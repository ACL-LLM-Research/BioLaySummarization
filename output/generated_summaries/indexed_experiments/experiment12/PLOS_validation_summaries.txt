Researchers conducted a study to investigate how genetic variations in the 3' end of genes, specifically polyadenylation, impact gene expression in human lymphoblast cells from distinct individuals. They found that transcript positions do not randomly fall in untranslated regions, but rather preferentially flank 3' regulatory elements, including microRNA sites. The usage of transcript forms and motifs varied across individuals, and polymorphisms in polyaden signals and 3 motifs were significant predictors of gene expression levels. Single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyaden variants on steady-state expression and validated regulatory function of 3 cis elements. The study focused on immune regulator IRF, establishing the effect of natural variation in RNA 3- processing on response to antigen stimulation. The results highlight the importance of mechanisms in genetics of 3- variation: usage of distinct 3- signals and effects of 3 elements determining transcript fate. The study suggests integrating 3 positions with 3 motifs will be a tool in interpreting human variation. The relationship between sequence and expression did not manifest for microRNA sites. The findings emphasize relevance of 3 motifs as predictors of variation when integrated with transcript forms.
Researchers studied the CD8 T cell response in animals vaccinated with the live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccine SIVne, which is highly effective against wild-type lentiviral challenge. They used deep sequencing and CD8 cell epitope mapping to identify regions of immune pressure and viral escape, and the effect of escape on the CD8 cell response. The initial CD8 response in the acute phase of SIVne infection targeted variable epitopes, followed by widespread viral escape and evolution. However, escape expanded the CD8 repertoire to target conserved epitopes, defined anropic specificity, and generated new responses to escaped variants during vaccination. These results correlated with SIVne-induced protection and increased anropic specificity and response depth. The study found rapid escape of variable epitopes and maintenance of CD8 responses to conserved epitopes in SIVne infection, as well as new CD8 responses to escaped variants during chronic infection. Escaped CD8 responses were maintained as central memory CD8 cells, contributing to increased breadth of the CD response at 20 weeks post-vaccination. Epitope escape and new CD responses to variants deepened the CD repertoire. High-throughput sequencing quantified SIVne variants and CD8 responses in vaccinated animals, including those with undetectable viral loads. Fine-mapped CD8 responses at the epitope level at 5 and 20 weeks postacc. Longitudinal study of vaccinated animals showed concurrent evolution of virus and CD8 specificity, resulting in increased anropic CD repertoire, breadth, rearranged immunodinance, and depth.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the immune response to Candida albicans infections in the oral mucosa. They used a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and found that IL-1 receptor (IL-R) signaling is critical for controlling the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils. IL-1 regulates the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow. IL-1 deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in circulation in response to C. albicans. Endothelial cells were identified as the primary source of G-CS during OPC, responding to IL-α released from keratinocytes in infected tissue. A link between IL-1 and granulopoies was established in vitro using a murine-derived kerocyte line and endothelial cell line. Two mechanisms coordinating neutil response in oral mucosa were identified, preventing fungal growth and dissemination, protecting the host from disease.
Between 2000 and 2007, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filari (GPE) delivered over 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 570 million individuals via mass administration of anti-filar drugs (albendazole, iverectin, diethylbamazine) in at-risk areas for 4-6 years. The economic benefits of this achievement were calculated by quantifying the number of clinical manifestations averted and associated with disease prevention in the context of direct costs, indirect labor, and healthcare for affected individuals. Reviewing multiple sources, including the World Health Organization, International Fund, and Labour, an estimated $21.8 billion in economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31.4 million treated during the first 8 years of GPE. This includes $2.3 billion from protection of nearly 3 million and individuals from acquiring lymphatic filari as a result of being born in areas of transmission. Additionally, 28 million infected benefit from GLF halting disease progression, resulting in $19.5 billion economic benefit. Health systems in endemic countries save $2.2 billion from reduced services associated with LF morbidity. The Programme offers significant economic benefits, with favorable implementation largely due to donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry, showing a high return on investment.
Researchers created a mouse model of Gaucher disease, a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene, to study how these mutations lead to Parkinson's disease (PD). The mice, called GBA-/-medaka, lacked the enzyme glucerebrosidase (GCase) activity, but surprisingly survived for months, allowing researchers to study the progression of the disease. The mice displayed symptoms similar to human Gaucher disease, including Gaucher cell infiltration in the brain, neuronal loss, and microgliosis. Detailed analysis revealed lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-s) in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes. Unexpectedly, disrupting α-syn did not improve lifespan, axonal swellings, neuronal loss, or neuroinflammation in G-aka. The study provides a new model for neuronopathic Gaucher disease and reveals mechanisms of α-s accumulation caused by G deficiency and minimal contribution of αyn to pathogenesis. Gaucher disease is the most common lysosomal disease, caused by homozygous mutations in GBA, leading to decreased enzymatic activity and accumulation of glucerebrosides and glucosylphosphingos. The disease is divided into three subtypes: non-neuronopathic, acute, and subacute. Long-term survival of the mice allowed observation of pathological progression, revealing G deficiency causes lysosomal dysfunction and α-s accumulation in axonal swellings. Axonal transport of αyn may play a role in G mutations leading to PD and be a therapeutic target. Patients with type 1 Gaucher have increased risk of PD, carrying G mutations show intraneural accumulation α-s, Lewy bodies and Lew neurites, hallmarks of sporadic PD. Studies indicate association between G mutations and α-s accumulation. The phenotypes in G-aka brains were caused by G mutation. α-s overexpression causes neurotoxicity, neuroflamm observed in PD brains, promoting progression.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Listeria monocytogen interacts with the immune system, specifically how it evades the phagosome and enters the cell cytos to induce a strong CD8 T cell-mediated immunity. They found that the immune response to phag-confined L monocogen is not due to inefficient antigen presentation, but direct suppression of the adaptive response. This suppression affects not only phag-confined but also cytosolic L monocogen, and co-infection with both strains prevents acquired immunity and T cell expansion. Bacteria confined in phag suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines and led to MyD-dependent IL-10 production. Blocking IL-10 or MyD restored immunity. The study shows microbes in phag can impact innate and adaptive response by antagonizing inflammation and CD8 cell generation. 

The bacterium alters the inflammatory landscape and T cell potency, with IL-10 acting as a negative regulator in CD8 cells and positive in other cells. The results are significant for microbial pathogenesis and vaccinology, understanding how microbes interact with innate and adaptive systems is key to controlling pathogenic effects. The presence of Lm in phag impacts CD4 and CD8 responses to cytos Act-L and immunity. The innate response shapes the adaptive response, and ph-confined Lm alters cytokine response to cytos Act-L. Mice were infected with two L monocogen strains, Act-L escapes cytos and elicits long-lived CD8 immunity. In the absence MyD, ph-confined Lm limits cytos response. Results show the immune discriminates pathogens in subcell locations via MyD and IL-10, impacting adaptive response potency.
Researchers have identified six genetic variants in the SIX gene associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), a leading cause of blindness worldwide. A previous genome-wide study found a significant link between POAG and the SIX locus (rs10427, odds ratio=1.32, p=3.87×10-11). The SIX gene plays a role in eye development and has been linked to optic nerve morphology. The researchers sequenced the SIX coding and regulatory regions in 262 PO cases and 256 controls, finding six nonsynonymous variants, five rare and one common, AsnHis (rs12345), associated with PO (OR=1.27, p=4.2×10-10) in the NEIGH/GLUG datasets. These variants were tested in an in vivo Danio rerio (zebrafish) complement assay to evaluate ocular metrics such as eye and optic structure. Five variants, primarily in PO cases, were hypomorphic or null, while the sixth, only in controls, was benign. One variant in the SIX enhancer increased SIX expression and disrupted its regulation. The study found a feature in PO patients dependent on SIX genotype: those homozygous for the SIX risk allele (His) have a thinner retinal nerve layer than homozygous for the non-risk (As) allele. The results, combined with previous SIX work, suggest SIX variants disrupt retina development, reducing retinal ganglion cells, increasing glcoma vision loss.
Researchers have identified a genetic switch that controls the production of flagella and toxins in the human pathogen Clostridium difficile. This switch, called the "flagellar switch", is a 154 base pair sequence that can be flipped between two orientations. When in one orientation, the bacteria produce flagella and secrete toxins, while in the other orientation they do not. The orientation of the switch is reversible and occurs during growth in vitro. The researchers found that the flag switch affects the production of glucyl toxins, which are essential for diarrheal disease, and flagellar motility. They also found that the switch occurs post-transcription and requires a C difficile-specific factor to degrade early flagellar mRNA when in the OFF orientation. The tyrosine recomase RecV, which catalyzes inversion at cV, is also responsible for inversion at the flagellar switch in both directions. Flagellar ON bacteria are motile and produce toxins, while OFF are aflagate and attenuated for toxin production. RecV mutants with the flag switch in ON are also motile and produce toxins, while those with the switch in OFF are aflag and attenuated. The flag switch affects transcription of toxin genes by σ, impacting glucyl toxins and cytotoxicity of C difficile. The researchers also found that RecV, which controls variation of cell wall protein cV, is responsible for inversion at flagellar in both directions.
Researchers studied the process of spore formation in the bacterium Clostridium difficile, an intestinal pathogen that forms spores as part of its life cycle. This process, called sporulation, involves the development of a highly resistant spore that allows the bacterium to survive harsh conditions. In the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis, two types of RNA polymerase sigma factors, σF and σE, control spore development in the forespore and mother cell, respectively. These factors are replaced by σ and σ at later stages. The researchers found that in Clostrid difficile, the main periods of activity of these factors are conserved, but activity of σ is independent of σ, σ is not dependent on σ, and σ does not require σ. They also found that σ is not necessary for spore formation. The results indicate reduced segregation between early and late sigma factors and reduced requirement for cell signaling pathways. The study supports the view that the spore network is conserved in evolution, with sigma factors regulating the pathway established 2.5 billion years ago in the Firmicutes phylum.
Researchers have developed a new framework to model the behavior of allosteric multisite proteins, which are proteins with multiple sites that can be phosphorylated or dephosphorylated, using a single variable. This simplification accurately replicates the steady-state behavior of more complex systems, such as the Monod-Wy-Change alloster model. The framework is useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems where multiple proteins interact simultaneously. It was applied to a newly discovered signaling pathway in yeast that monitors cell growth by measuring signals at the plasma membrane. The pathway's components form a hysteretic switch, with a signal proportional to growth size, a mechanism to read the signal, and an all-or-no response when the signal reaches a threshold indicating sufficient growth. 

The framework approximates the dynamics of multisite phosphorylation, which can be complex due to multiple sites' effects, using a single variable. It becomes more precise with more sites, with good estimates for four or more. The mechanism is a one-variable, quasi-stead state reduction of the Mon-WChange alloster system. Multisite phosphorylation is not fully understood, but can give ultrasensitive responses not possible in single-site systems. The framework can be extended to other types of multis modification, such as ligand binding, transcription regulation, methylation, acetylation, or ubiquination.
Researchers have used a "bottom-up" approach to study the quorum sensing (QS) system in E. coli, a mechanism that enables bacterial populations to communicate and gain a selective advantage. They focused on the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) QS system, examining the interplay between its components and regulation. By separating the network into sub-networks, they discovered a new negative feedback mechanism and revealed the importance of the Lsr regulator, previously masked by regulatory loops. A simple model was built to understand the interplay among substructures and their contributions to the overall network. This approach will help unravel complex QS architectures and direct emergent behaviors.

The AI-2 QS system consists of an auto-regulatory network with a double negative motif, providing a population response. The researchers studied network connectivity and signal propagation of AI-2, constructing mutant strains to represent the system as a complete network. Further analysis will shed light on regulatory pathways in bacterial metabolic networks and guide new phenotypes. A model was built incorporating the new element, capturing predictions and simulating the intact and sub-systems using the proposed architecture. The mechanistic basis for Lsr-mediated "switch" of E. coli QS was revealed, buried in the native system but effective.

The AI-2 mechanism was taken apart, analyzing sub-systems in isolation, leading to speculation of new interactions within the network. A "bottom-up" approach isolating regulatory elements is effective for analyzing biological networks with positive and negative regulations. Studying modules allows constructing a hypothetical system and predicting new mechanisms.
A study was conducted in rural Gabon to investigate the effect of schistosomiasis, a soil-transmitted helminth (STH), on Plasmod falciparum infection in school-age children. The study found that schosias increased the risk of Plmod infection, especially when combined with Trichuris trichi or hookworm infection. The incidence of malaria was higher in schos-infected children compared to non-infected, with a significant delay in time to first malaria event in children aged 6-10 years. The study suggests that STH enhances risk for P falcum in schos-positive children and increases susceptibility to malaria in young children, but not older children. This is consistent with previous findings that schos increases malaria prevalence in infected children. However, conflicting results exist in literature on schos-malaria co-infection due to potential confounding factors. In areas where schos is endemic, its effect on malaria outcome is a concern. The study area is endemic for both infections, with up to 30% of children co-infected with P falcum and S haob parasites. The results suggest that schos and STH co-infections cumulatively impact malaria outcome in school children, and should be considered in malaria control programs.
Researchers investigated the role of IRF-5-mediated inflammation in regulating CD8+ T cell responses during Leishmaniasis infection. IRF-5 is a transcription factor that induces pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF. The study found that IRF-5-mediated inflammation limits CD8 T cell expansion and induces HIF-1 in dendritic cells, impairing their function. HIF-1 induction in dendritic cells resulted in a higher frequency of short-lived effector CD8 T cells, reduced CD8 T expansion, and increased IL-12 expression by splenic dendritic cells. Mice with depleted of HIF-1 in dendritic cells had a lower parasite burden, suggesting H-1 induction is an immune evasive mechanism by Leish to establish infection. IR-5 is involved in transcription of Type I IF genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12, TN, IL-23, and IL-6. IR-/- mice showed IR5 is essential for protective Th1 responses. CD8 depletion caused mild increase in parasite burden in Cre mice, while CD8 cells controlled growth in H-1 knockout mice, indicating H-1 induction limits protective CD8 responses. H-1 induction in dendritic represents an immune mechanism by Leish to establish chronic infection.
Researchers conducted a systematic review to identify factors associated with poor outcomes in patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Latin America. They analyzed 14 studies and found that jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age under 5 and over 40 years, neutropenia, dyspnea, and bacterial infections, and edema, and low hemoglobin concentration were linked to unfavorable outcomes. The strongest predictors were jaundice, thromocytopenia, and HIV coinfection. The review highlights the need for externally validated prognostic models to identify patients at risk of poor outcomes. VL is a neglected disease with scarce effective treatments and high mortality rates. The Brazilian Ministry of Health recommends platelet transfusion for patients with low platelet counts. Leishmania-HIV coinfection increased risk of poor prognosis in all studies. Only 14 of 294 studies met inclusion criteria, all from Brazil, with 10 focusing on death and 3 on clinical evolution. Undernutrition is not a risk factor for severity, but rather a consequence of VL syndrome.
In Algeria, the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis (VL and CL) has been based on antimonial drugs for a long time. It is suspected that high selective pressure from these drugs may favor the emergence of resistant parasites. Although treatment failure is reported during antimonial therapy for both VL and CL, resistance has never been investigated in Algeria. To determine the level of antimonial susceptibility of Leishmania in Algeria is important for public health development. Within 30 years of epidemiology of VL and CL knowledge, Leish isolates were sampled to determine susceptibility to antimonial. A total of 106 isolates, including 88 from 1976-2013 in humans, dogs, rodents, and phleomines, and 18 from dogs in France, were analyzed. All Algerian isolates were from endemic areas. IC50 of antimonial tartrate (Sbivalent) and stibogluconate (pentavalent) were determined in promastigotes and amastigotes, respectively. Epidemiological cutoff allowed differentiation between Leish species causing VL or CL susceptible (S) or insusceptible (S) to trivalent antimony. IC50 values were 23.83μg/mL and 15.91μg for VL and CL, respectively. A trend of increasing susceptibility in VL isolates during 30 years was reported. In contrast, an increase in S-phenotypes in CL isolates was observed during same period. Emergence of S-phenotypes correlates with L.lick (L.tropica) isolates causing CL that emerged in Algeria last decade. Results provide insight into spatiotemporal Leish antimony in Algeria, highlighting need for effective methodology to detect emergence and prevent dissemination of resistant strains.
Researchers have investigated the link between acute gastroenteritis and the development of Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory condition of unknown etiology. They found that exposure to foodborne pathogens causing gastroenteritis increases the risk of CD in the post-infect period, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Two models were developed to study the comorbidity of acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhimium or Citrobacterium in mice colonized with adherent-invasive Escherichia (AIE), a pathion linked to CD. Results show that disease in the post-infect period after gastroenter is driven by the tissue expansion of the AIE pathion, with increased immunology defects, barrier, and delays in mucosal restitution following path clearance. These features require AIE resistance to host peptides and amin inflammatory response to enteric path. Individuals colonized by AIE at the time of infectious gastroenter may be at risk for CD onset. AIE is identified as a tractable disease modifier, a finding that could be exploited in the development of interventions following infectious gastroitis in at-risk individuals.
In flowering plants, the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis consists of two gametic cells, the egg and central cell, surrounded by five accessory cells, all of which are vital for fertilization. However, the mechanisms controlling the formation of accessory versus gametic cell fate are unknown. Researchers isolated the lach (lis) mutant, which forms supernumerary egg cells, indicating LIS is involved in a mechanism preventing accessory cells from adopting gametic fate. LIS is expressed in gametic cells and is homologous to yeast splicing factor PR4, suggesting components of the splice apparatus participate in cell decisions. The lis mutant reveals two levels of cell regulation: between gametic and accessory cells, and between egg and central cells. The initiation of cell-specific genes indicates Arabid distinct fates are manifested after cellularization. 

The female gamophyte of Arabidopsis originates from a haploid spore through three nuclear divisions, resulting in a syncytium of eight nuclei that cellularizes into four cell types. In lis-1 mutant synergids differentiate egg attributes at expense of syner cell, with syner marker ectopically expressed. This shows not all aspects of accessory and gametic fate are exclusive. In lis-1 mutant, accessory cells become gametic over time, with morphological features distinguishing lis-1 from wild-type becoming more pronounced. LIS is mapped to At2g00, a protein with WD repeats.
Researchers conducted a qualitative study in a rural Ethiopian highland community to understand the barriers to wearing shoes, which is crucial for preventing Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). They used the PRECE-PRO model to assess social, behavioral, environmental, and educational factors influencing shoe-wearing. The study gathered information from 242 respondents through focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and case studies. Results showed that shoe-wearing norms are changing, with going barefoot seen as shameful, and shoes confer dignity and protection against injury and cold. However, practical and social barriers prevented the desire to wear from being translated into practice. Limited resources meant people could not purchase more than one pair of shoes, ensuring longevity or afford quality shoes. As a result, shoes were preserved for special occasions and not provided for children until a certain age. Some barriers, such as fit and fear of labeling, may be specific to certain diseases, but underlying poverty-related barriers, like price, unsuitability, and low perception, are relevant to multiple NTDs. Established health behavior models identified barriers to shoe-wearing amenable to intervention, benefiting NTD prevention through shoe distribution.
Pseudorabies virus (PRV) Us protein plays a crucial role in targeting viral capsids and glycoproteins to axons of infected sympathetic neurons. Without Us, mutants are defective in anterograde transmission in vivo. Researchers investigated how Us promotes axonal sorting of many viral proteins. They found that glyroteins B, C, D, and E are associated with lipid microdomains on infected cells and directed into ax in Us-dependent manner. This study determined Us is associated with lipid rafts, critical for Us-mediated sorting viral proteins. Non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells were used, a rathepromocytoma line acquiring sympathetic characteristics in presence nerve growth factor (NG). Us is highly in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Reducing Us affinity for rafts inhibited antograde transmission from neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. Association Us with rafts is key for targeting proteins axons, consequence spread PR from pre-synaptic to postynaptic neurons mammalian nervous system.
Researchers studied the phenomenon of genetic heterogeneity in yeast cells, where genetically identical cells exhibit different growth rates and stress tolerance under constant conditions. They found that the cyclic AMP (cAMP) regulated transcription factors Msn and M4 are responsible for this heterogeneity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a type of yeast. Lower cAMP levels correspond to slower growth, and a reporter of the pathway's activity correlates with growth in individual cells. The paralogs M2 and M4 have different roles in heterogeneity, with M2 required for growth and M4 for expression of T1, a subunit of trehalose synth that contributes to stress tolerance. Perturbing the pathway or culturing cells with cAMP analog or PK inhibitor impacts survival under heat stress. Increasing cAMP reduces slower subpopulation and increases susceptibility, while PK inhibition slows growth and decreases susceptibility. Loss of M2 reduces but not eliminates correlation between growth and stress, suggesting M2's role in heterogeneity but residual benefit of slow growth. The study sheds light on genetic control of heterogeneity and suggests a means to defeat pathogens or tumor cells by making them susceptible to treatment.
Researchers studied the genetic diversity of the Chikungunya virus (CHV) during its rapid spread from Asia to the Americas in 2013. They analyzed viral samples from infected individuals in Guadeloupe and Martinique, two islands in the center of the outbreak, using deep-sequencing and bioinformatics. They found changes in the consensus sequence and minority variants at different levels in the population. The diversity was reduced after single passages in cell lines. An infectious clone was constructed from the outbreak and a novel 3' untranslated region (UTR) structure was identified, not found in nature, leading to increased replication in insect cells. An intrahostasis analysis was performed on the new CHV outbreak in the Caribbean, identifying variants in individuals and a new 3'UTR, suggesting CHV evolved quickly in the new population. The study highlights the need for continued viral surveillance as the epidemic evolves to understand CHV's potential.
Researchers have identified a previously unannotated gene called UOR that plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and tumor formation through the mTOR signaling pathway. They found that reducing UOR function in cultured neurons and cancer cells promotes neurite growth and cell growth, while overexpressing UOR suppresses colony formation in cancer cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that UOR stabilizes a component of the mTOR complex, DEOR, to inhibit m signaling. In zebraf models, disrupting UOR gene increased mTOR activity and worsened HRAS-induced tumor formation. UOR depletion also promoted tumor growth and m signaling in xenograft mice. The study shows UOR regulates cell growth and tumor via m signaling. UOR is a vertebrate-specific gene with no known function, despite extensive sequence searches. Reducing UOR levels in neurons and cancer cells promotes growth, while overexpressing U suppresses colony formation. UOR interacts with DEOR and m complexes to inhibit m signaling. Disrupting U gene in zraf increased m activity and worsened HRAS-induced tumor. U depletion promoted growth and m signaling in xenograft mice. These findings demonstrate UOR regulates growth and tumor via m signaling.
Researchers have created a comprehensive map of protein interactions in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African trypanosomiasis, a fatal disease in humans and nagana in cattle. The parasite's biology and pathogenesis are not well understood due to the unknown functions of most of its proteins. By analyzing protein interactions, they identified 128 high-confidence complexes involving 716 proteins, including 635 with no known functions. The map correlates with known pathways and proteins across the parasite's life cycle and provides potential functions for many uncharacterized proteins. They validated several novel proteins involved in RNA editing, including a candidate in post-transcriptional regulation. The study provides an unprecedented view of the parasite's protein complex and serves as a resource for further characterization of tryosid proteins. This is the largest proteomics interaction map of tryosid parasites to date, useful for formulating new hypotheses and experimental leads.
Researchers studied lymph nodes (LNs) in macaques infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to understand how the bacteria persist in these organs. LNs are common sites of extrapulmonary tb infection and thoracic LNs are frequently infected in humans, but the dynamics of tb infection in LNs and their function are not well understood. The study analyzed thoracic LNs from tb-infected cynolgus andhes macques using PET scans, bacterial burden, LN structure, and immune function. They found that LNs have different trajectories of increasing or decreasing activity over time, even in the same animal. Rhes macques are more susceptible to tb than cynolg macques due to extensive LN pathology. tb grows to same level in cynolg and rhes mac LNs, but cynolg macques control tb later post-infection while rhes do not. LNs are poor at killing tb, even with treatment, due to lack of cell-rich structures, disrupting LN structure, introducing macrophages that serve as niches for tb, and destroying vasculature. The study shows L are not only sites of antigen presentation and immune activation but also persistence of significant numbers of tbilli.
Researchers have identified 47 new species of microsporidia, a type of fungus that infects animals, and studied their interactions with the nematode Caenorhabdis elegans and other related nematodes. Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites, meaning they live inside their hosts, and are poorly understood. Caenorhabdis elegans has been used as a model to study microspor, with the identification of its natural pathogen Noc paris. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microspor infections are in Caenorhabdis and other nematodes in the wild. The study found Noc paris to be the most common microspor infecting Caenor in the wild, and described six new species in the Noc genus. Phylogenetic analysis identified two subclades distinct from Noc, named Entersect and Ptospora. Unlike Noc, these belong to the clade of microidia that includes human pathogens. All microidia are horizontally transmitted and infect intestinal cells, except Ptos that replicates in the epidermis of Caenorhost. At the cellular level, infected spores of Entersect show apical distribution and exit via budding, unlike Noc that exit via exocytosis. Host specificity is broad for some microidia, narrow for others, with some infecting Osche but not its sister Os, and vice versa. Nauseli fails to induce Caenor transcription of genes induced by Noc species, suggesting mechanisms to prevent host response.
Chemokine receptors, a subclass of protein-coupled receptors, play crucial roles in the human immune system and are involved in cancer and HIV infection. Studies have shown that homo and heterodimers of chemokine receptors CXCR, CCR, and C2 modulate receptor function, and cholesterol affects chemine activity. However, structural information on homo and heterodimers of chemine receptors and their interaction with cholesterol is limited. This study reports homo and heterod configurations of chemine receptors CXCR, C, and C at atomic detail from molecular simulations. Homodimer patterns were similar for closely related chemine receptors, but differed between CXCR. Cholesterol modulated homod interfaces in subtype-specific manner. Chemine heterod display distinct dimer patterns CX4/5 and CX/2. Associations between CX and C reveal increased cholesterol sensitivity compared CX/ heterodimer patterns. This work provides a comprehensive overview of interaction between chemine receptors and how heterodization and interaction with environment diversifies function of related GPC.
Systemic leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the Leishmania parasite, has been known to present with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and wasting. However, a subclinical form has been identified with one or two of these symptoms missing, replaced by lymphadenopathy and anemia. A new form, referred to as "atypical", has been discovered in patients with suspected immune deficiency. These patients were referred to a specialized laboratory for immune function tests, including microscopic examinations and biopsies. 19.4% of 160 patients had normal profiles but dysfunctional macrophages with Leish parasites. This revealed the presence of atypical systemic lemanias, presenting as a masquerading condition with non-functional immune system, predisposing to recurrent infections and various symptoms. This indicates systemic leishias has a wider spectrum of signs and symptoms than previously suspected and is more common than diagnosed. Among 31 patients, adults were found, showing systemic leishias is not limited to the pediatric group. The authors recommend considering atypical systemic leishias in patients with unexplained immunity and no obvious immunologic defect.
Researchers have analyzed millions of genetic mutations and variations in the human genome to identify potential causes of diseases, reactions to drugs, and predispositions to infections and age-related conditions such as brain and cardiovascular impairments. However, predicting the consequences of a genetic variant is a complex task. A study found that conserved amino acids are useful for identifying likely variants with consequences. This study explored the potential of variants at homologous positions in paralog proteins to identify polymorphisms with consequences. A dataset of disease-causing variants from OMIM and HGMD was used to identify and characterize pairs of variants at homolog positions. Results show locations of variants are correlated in paralog proteins. If one member of a variant pair is disease-causing, the other is likely to be disease-causing. This information can be used to identify disease variants, extend procedures, and provide candidates for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

A dataset identified pairs of variations at homolog positions in human genes. Variants co-occur at amino pairs more frequently than expected, suggesting similar constraints result in coordinated distributions of disease and non-disease variants. Data suggest paralog genes and variantairs for hypothesis and clinical research. Extending to paral genes not associated with disease can identify new candidates and uncharacterized variants. A collection of disease-causing from OMIM and HG was mapped to genes and sequences. This suggests algorithms miss instances based on sequence conservation. Paralog human might provide in silico characterization complementary to SIFT and PolyPhen.

Variants in paralog proteins tend to pair. Alignments provide a resource for genomics.
Researchers studied the genetic makeup of the malaria parasite Plasium falciparum in people with severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papua New Guinea. They found that parasites causing severe malaria had changes in their gene expression, including a decrease in the production of proteins on their surface that are targeted by the immune system. These proteins, called PfEMP, are important for the parasite's survival. The study used RNA sequencing to analyze 44 parasite samples and found that those causing severe malaria had reduced glycolysis, a process that provides energy, and altered gene regulation through histone methylation. They also had lower expression of PfEMP and multiple chaperone proteins. The study confirmed previous findings that certain PfEMP sequences are associated with severe disease and identified new associations between PfEMP domains and disease severity. These findings can help develop vaccines for severe malaria and understand how the parasite adapts to the host environment in severe malaria. 

The study differed from previous research that found increased expression of genes for PfEMP in severe malaria. Instead, 17 genes were downregulated, including skeleton protein 1, which is involved in PfEMP expression. Patients with severe malaria had lower levels of antibodies to PfEMP and recognized fewer Pf than those with uncomplicated malaria. Parasites causing severe malaria also downregulated genes involved in PfEMP expression. Antigens encountered early in life are recognized by immune children's sera more than those causing uncomplicated disease. Expression of conserved PfEMP by severe parasites explains why immunity to severe is acquired faster than uncomplicated. Some PfEMP domains bind host receptors and are expressed in severe have been identified.
Researchers used an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to deliver anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to rhesus monkeys to prevent HIV-1 infection. The goal was to achieve long-term delivery of potent-neutralizing antibodies. High levels of the delivered mAb were achieved, up to 270 micrograms per milliliter. However, host responses to the delivered antibody were observed in 9 of the 12 monkeys, limiting the concentration that could be achieved. This resulted in a wide range of delivered mAb concentrations, from 1-270 micrograms per millil. Despite the absence of detectable neutralizing activity against the virus, six monkeys in the AAV-delivered IgG1Ab group showed protective effects against SIV239 challenge. These effects included lowering viral load peak, lowering viral set point, and delay in time to peak load from exposure. All were statistically significant. The monkey with highest delivered m completely resisted six SIV239 challenges, including a final dose of 10 infectious units. The study demonstrates the potential of this approach for HIV-1 prevention. However, antibody responses need to be understood to realize the promise.
Researchers have challenged the long-held assumption that protein molecules respond linearly to thermal or structural perturbations, such as ligand binding or detachment. They studied two motor proteins, myosin and kinesin K1A, using a coarse-grained elastic network approximation, and found that linearity is deficient for lig-induced conformation motions and even thermal fluctuations. The nonlinearity is particularly pronounced in K1, where normal mode description fails to describe mechanochemical motions. This indicates that assumptions in protein dynamics theory may need reconsideration. Conformation relaxation processes associated with ligand binding and hydrolysis in myos and K1 were analyzed, revealing nonlinearity in both molecules. While myos conformation relaxation can be characterized by normal modes, K1 description breaks down. However, ordered and robust mechchemical motions are present in both proteins, but cannot be described by linear response. Large conformation changes due to lig binding are often considered in linear theory and normal approximation, despite magnitude. Strong overlaps between lig-induced conformation and atomic displacements in slow modes were found in myos, but absent in K1. Numerical investigations of elastic motions in my and K1 revealed nonlinearity in both. In K1, nonlinear effects dominate mechchemical motions, differing from normal predictions. Despite nonline, well-defined conformation paths against perturbations were found in both proteins.
Researchers have investigated the interaction between different endocytic pathways, specifically clathrin-independent endocytosis, and the role of caveolins and caveolins in regulating this process. They found that specific caveolar proteins, cavin-1 and cavin-3, but not cavin-2 or cavin-4, act as negative regulators of the clath-independent/GPIAP enriched endosomal (CL/GEE) endytic pathway, independent of cave formation. Caveolin-1 and cavin also inhibit the CL/GC pathway upon over-expression. Expression of caveolar leads to a reduction in formation of early CL/GEE carriers, detected by electron microscopy. The CL/GC pathway is upregulated in cells lacking cavin-1/cavin or reduced cavin-3. Inhibition by caveol can be mimicked by isolated caveolin scaffolding and associated with perturbed lipid diffusion, revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies. In absence of cavin and caveol, cavin is endocyted through the CLC pathway, but loses polarization and sorting with consequences for membrane dynamics and endytic in migrating cells and muscle tissue. Non-cave cavin-1 acts as modulator of key regulator CL/GC, C42. This study provides new insights into regulation of non-cave clath-independent endocyt by caveolar proteins, illustrating multiple levels of crosstalk between pathways.
Researchers have identified a subset of Receiver (REC) domains in bacteria and archaea that lack the conserved aspartate (Asp) residue, which is typically phosphorylated by a histidine kinase to propagate a signaling response. This subset, called Aspart-Less Receiver (AL) domains, is surprisingly common, making up about 4% of all REC domains, and is often associated with rare effector outputs. Analysis of AL structures and biochemical data suggests AL domains have reorganized their active sites to take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate signals other than phosphorylation, while retaining post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimer interface. This defines AL as an atypical REC subclass and provides insights into activation mechanisms between AL and REC domains. The most common AL substitutions at the conserved phospho-As site are Ser, Thr, and Tyr, which are known to be phosphorylated by bacterial kinases. Some AL domains have diversified to bind small molecules, such as antibiotics, and Ser phosphorylation through eukary-like kinases and PP phosphatases, regulating cell envelope functions and virulence in microbes. A dataset of 74,816 REC-containing proteins, 2,976 lacked or had substitutions at the conserved position, indicating up to 4% of domains do not have this residue. The AL sequences comprise about 4% of all domains in bacteria, making them the Aspart-L Receiver (AL) domain subclass of atypical RECs.
Researchers have developed a new type of oncolytic herpes virus (OV) that targets cancer cells with a specific receptor called HER2, which is overexpressed in many cancers. This virus, called R115, is fully virulent, meaning it can replicate in cancer cells but not in healthy cells, and is armed with IL-12, a protein that stimulates the immune system. The study tested R115 in immunocompet mice with HER2-expressing tumors and found it inhibited tumor growth, with some mice surviving long-term and protected from a second tumor. Analysis showed R115 unleashed an immunosuppressive tumor environment, inducing immunomodulatory cytokines and increasing certain immune cells. The response was durable, breaking tolerance to HER and tumor cells, indicating a systemic immunotherapeutic effect.
Researchers investigated the susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different HIV vaccine vectors to HIV infection. They found that CD4 cells induced by the Adenovirus 5 (Ad) vector were highly susceptible to HIV, while those induced by the ALVAC (canarypox) vector were less susceptible. This difference was associated with reduced expression of HIV entry receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on ALV-specific CD4 cells. Phenotypic analysis showed ALV-specific CD4 cells had a Th1 phenotype, producing high levels of IFN-γ and CCL4 (M-β) but little IL-17. In contrast, ALAC and Ad vectors induced distinct profiles of vector-specific CD8 and CD4 T-cell proliferative responses, with ALAC preferentially inducing CD8-cell proliferation. Depletion of ALAC CD8 cells led to increased HIV infection of AL-specific CD4 cells, suggesting a protective role of ALAC CD8 cells. The study highlights the importance of evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination.
Researchers studied the evolution of X chromosome inactivation, a process where one X chromosome is silenced in female somatic cells, in mammals. They found that the choice of which X to silence varies among species, ranging from paternal X-inherited inactivation (PX), where females are haploid for maternal alleles, to random X-inactivation (RX), where maternal and paternal alleles are equally expressed. The study analyzed how dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection influence X inactivation evolution. Results show that a single interaction between allelic dominance and sex-differential can select a broad range of inactivation strategies, including unequal rates between maternal and paternal X chromosomes. RX is favored over PX when alleles are recessive to female fitness, and criteria for RX evolution is restrictive when variation is sexually antagonistic. Evolution from PX to RX increases female fitness at the expense of male fitness. The study provides a framework for predicting chromosome expression of X-linked genes and leads to predictions for future studies of allele variation.

 Species properties and genetic variation predict patterns of selection for X inactivation. Sexual and sex-based mutation rates vary, influencing transmission of deleterious alleles between maternal and paternal X. Selection favors inactivation of the chromosome with more deleterious alleles. An analysis tested evolutionary stability of X strategies. Sex-differential selection, where fitness differs between males and females, influences large fractions of genomes, affecting X diversification. Stronger selection against males decreases paternal X deleterious alleles. Sex-differential might favor biased inactivation, predicting magnitude to evolve. Results suggest conditions for biased patterns are permissive.
Researchers investigated the antiviral potential of the host protein ZAP against three flaviviruses: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIK). They found that overexpression of ZAP blocked JEV infection, but not DENV or ZIK, and depletion of endogenous Z enhanced JEV replication. Z hampered JEV translation and targeted viral RNA for 3-5' exosome-mediated degradation. The zincinger motifs of Z were essential for RNA targeting and antiv activity against JEV. The 3'-UTR, especially the region with dumbbell structures and high content of dinucleotide, was mapped to bind Z and confer sensitivity to Z. The study identified JEV as the first Z-sensitive flavivirus, suggesting Z may act as an intrinsic antiv factor through RNA binding against J infection.
Rift Valley fever virus (RVV) is a significant pathogen that causes severe disease in humans and animals, particularly in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Researchers studied the immune response to wild-type and vaccine strains of RVV in mice to understand its pathogenesis. Mice infected with a live-attenuated vaccine strain survived with minimal disease and cytokine response, while wild-type infection was lethal, causing lymphocyte and platelet depletion and strong cytokine response. The virus was found to be hepatotropic, with liver damage and histological data supporting this. However, a pro-inflammatory response was not seen in the liver, but rather a chemokine response indicating neutrophil infiltration. In the brain, a chemok and cytokine response was evident with little pathology. The study suggests RVV pathogenesis in mice is liver failure due to necrosis and hepatitis, with long-term disease being neurologic, supported by human and BAL/c mouse observations.
Chemotherapy resistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a significant challenge for improving patient survival. Researchers investigated the mechanisms of taxane resistance in TNBC and found that C motif chemokine ligand 20 (C20) is elevated during tax-containing chemotherapy in patients with no pathological complete response. C20 promotes self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells (BCS) through protein kinase Cζ (PKζ) or 38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) mediated p65 nuclear factor B (NF-κ) pathway, increasing taxane resistance of SCS. C20 also promotes NFκ activation ATP-binding subfamily member 1 (ABCB1)/multidrug 1 (DR) expression, leading to extracellular efflux of taxane. Results suggest chemotherapy-induced C20 mediated resistance via upregulation of AB1. NF-κ activation C20, forming positive feedback loop between NFκ and C20, providing impetus for resistance in cancer cells. C20 can be a predictive marker for taxane response, and blocking C or its pathway may reverse tax resistance in breast cancer. Studies showed tax-induced C20 promoted self-renew of S through activation pNF, mediated by PKζ and MAP activity. A novel strategy to reverse tax resistance in breast cancer is combining tax treatment with adjuvant pharmacological inhibition AB1, improving chemotherapeutic efficacy. Results demonstrated C20 promoted resistance S through positive loop mediated PK/38NF. Tax-induced C20 activated NF through PKζ or38 and promoted expression of AB, leading to resistance breast cancer cells. Increased C20 by tax depended on NF activity, suggesting activated NF regulates C level in feedback to enhance effect on resistance.
Toxoplas gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite, infects virtually all nucleated cells in warm-blooded animals. Its ability to infect and manipulate host cells depends on transporting "GRA" proteins from secretory organelles called dense granules into host cells, where they reside. GRA proteins have diverse roles in Toxopla's lifecycle, including hijacking host cell functions like cell cycle and p38 MAP kinase. Some GRA, like GRA16 and GRA24, are secreted into parasitoph vacuole (PV) where Toop replicates and transported across PV membrane (PVM) into host, but translocation process and machinery are unclear. A previous study showed TMY1, cleaved by TASP into fragments, localizes PVM and is essential for GRA transport into host. To identify additional proteins for effector transport, Toopla mutants defective in cyc-regulation were screened for ability export GRA and GRA to host nucleus. A novel MY2 and MY3 play crucial role in translocation subset GRAs into host. MY2 and MY3 are secreted PV and co-localize with PVM and MY1. Consistent with transmembrane domains, all are membrane-associated, MY3 but MY stably with MY1, N-terminal and C-terminal disulf-linked. Further, intrinsically disordered effectors to structured DH domain blocks transport, consistent translo model effector.
Researchers studied how the papillomavirus (PV) replicates its DNA in host cells. PV has a mini-chromosome-like genome and initiates replication by binding the E2 protein to the origin recognition complex (ORC) and recruiting the E1 helicase. The study found that PV and bovine PV-1 E proteins bind to OR2, but OR2 is not present at the viral origin. Depleting OR2 increased PV replication in a transient model and maintained viral episomes, but not in cells with integrated genomes. E and E increased at the origin after OR2 silencing. This suggests OR2 suppresses E2 function, not activates it. Over-expressing E2 decreased OR2 at mammalian origins, implying E restricts pre-OR assembly that competes with host replication complexes for viral amplification. OR2 with E restricts replication in the maintenance phase and elevated E levels subvert OR loading and synthesis at cellular origins.
A study was conducted in the urban and peri-urban area of Dush, Tajikistan to investigate the presence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk. Bruc DNA was detected in 10.3% of 564 milk samples by IS-based real-time PCR, which is concerning due to common consumption of unpasteurified dairy products in the region. Bruc DNA was found in all seropositive cows, but 8.3% of seronegative cows also showed presence of Bruc DNA. Sequence analysis of the rB gene suggests one cow was infected with B. abortus and another was likely infected with B. melensis. Discrepancies between serology and real PCR results highlight the need for complementary diagnostic strategies to detect seroneg individuals in Bruc surveillance and eradication programs. Vaccination of cattle with S19 and small ruminants Rev1 may be needed to control Bruc infections, but further research on Brella isolation is required to understand Brella spp in the region.
Researchers studied the role of histone H3 lysine methylation in maintaining chromosome stability in the fungus Zoseptoria trici, which has eight accessory chromosomes that are highly unstable during meiosis and mitosis. They deleted genes responsible for methylation of H3 lysine 9 and 27, Kmt1 and K6, respectively, and analyzed the impact on chromosome and genome stability in vitro and in planta. Whole genome sequencing, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq showed changes in genome and chromatin structure and gene expression between mutant and wild-type strains. H3me3-deficient strains had dramatic chromatin reorganization, with H3me mostly localized in regions with H9 in wild-type. Many rearrangements and new chromosomes formed without H9, accompanied by transposable element activation. Loss of Hme increased stability of accessory chromosomes under normal conditions, without large gene changes. H9 is crucial for maintaining stability by preventing Hme in constitutive heterochromatin. Hme reduces overall stability, creating an unstable state for quasi-essential genome regions.
Researchers evaluated the cost-effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for rabies vaccination in low-income countries, where life-saving vaccines are often inaccessible and unaffordable to those most at risk. They found PEP to be an extremely cost-effective intervention, with a cost of less than $60 per death averted. Switching from intramuscular (IM) to intradermal (ID) administration resulted in significant savings, mitigating vaccine shortages and reducing costs. To make P more accessible, financing mechanisms were proposed to subsidize costs for those in need and support existing rabies prevention programs. A universal switch to ID delivery would improve affordability and accessibility, leading to reduced rabies deaths and cost-effectiveness for healthcare providers.

The study examined costs of IM versus ID administration in different settings, demonstrating ID to be more cost-effective in averting rab cases and lives. Clinic capacity affects vial sharing and cost-effectiveness relative to IM. Rabies post-exposure vaccination is essential but out of reach for many, with shortages in developing countries and victims incurring costs and delays, leading to avoidable deaths. Changes in P costs could improve affordability, providing incentives without compromising budgets. Issues should be considered in P policy design to reduce rabies burden by increasing availability for the poor who bear the brunt in developing countries.

Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated in terms of dollars per death averted: PEP/EffectivenessPE-EffectNoPEP, from the health provider's perspective, including direct costs.
Toxoplas, an obligate intracellular parasite, replicates within mammalian cells in a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that does not fuse with host organelles. One mechanism for nutrient acquisition is attracting host organelles to the PV. This study examines the exploitation of lipid droplets (LD), fat storage organelles, by Toxoplas. Toxoplas replication is reduced in cells depleted of LD or impaired lipolysis or fatty acidolysis. In infected cells, host LD number and expression of LD-associated genes (ADRP, DG2) increase until parasite replication onset. PV are surrounded by host LD. Toxoplas accesses lipids in LD and incorporates them into its membranes and LD. Exogenous oleic acid stimulates LDogenesis in the cell, resulting in accumulation of neutral lipids in large LD inside parasite. Tooplas intercepts and internalizes LD within PV, some associated with Rab7, wrapped by intravacolar network (IV) membranes. Mutant parasites impaired IV display diminished lipid uptake from LD. Parasites lacking IV-localized phospholipase2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from LD in PV, suggesting IV's major contribution to LD processing and lipid release.
Researchers have identified a new compounds called chalcones that can inhibit the growth of Fasciola hepatica, a liver fluke parasite that causes disease in cattle and sheep. This parasite is considered an emerging zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. Current treatment is chemotherapy with the drug tricendazole, but resistance has been reported in several countries, making it urgent to find new treatments. The study searched a library of 40 flavonoids and found chalcones with phenyl and napht groups to be good inhibitors of Fasciola cystine proteases. One compound, C34, was found to bind to the enzyme FCL with an IC50 of 5.6 μM and is a slow-reversible inhibitor that interacts with key residues in the enzyme. In vitro, C34 reduced the parasite's ability to migrate through the gut and caused death within a week, but was not toxic to bovine cells. This is the first report of non-peptide inhibitors of Fasciola catheps and opens avenues for developing new treatments for fluke infections and other helminthic diseases.
Researchers investigated how the visual system transmits information about fast and slow changes in light intensity through separate neural pathways. They used in vivo imaging to study how bipolar cells transmit signals to the retina and found that the volume of the synaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to different temporal filtering. Individual cells transmit through terminals of varying size, but smaller terminals generate faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher gain, followed by more adaptation. Smaller terminals transmit higher frequencies more effectively. Modeling calcium dynamics of ves release indicated that variations in presynaptic compartments contribute directly to these differences in response.

Measurements showed that presynaptic calcium is a strongly rectifying function of light intensity, increasing with graded contrast. Voltage-dependent calcium channels in terminals are responsible for non-linear transformation of the signal. Variations in presaptic signal impact output, with smaller terminals responding to step light with higher release rates, but resolution too low to detect modulations at frequencies >1 Hz. The next compartment in the pathway, synaptic terminals of bipolar cells, showed rectification in output due to increase in stimulus variance.

To quantify changes in synaptic gain, an "Adaptation Index" was used, calculated as ratio of initial to steady-state response. Assuming constant vesicles in terminals of different volume, the model predicted rate of release would depress more in smaller terminals. Whole-cell recordings from goldfish retina showed presaptic signals in large and small compartments while controlling the terminal.
Researchers have developed a new method to detect and analyze individual synapses in the brain using fluorescence microscopy images. Synapses are the tiny connections between brain cells that allow them to communicate with each other. Current methods to study synapses have limitations: fluorescence microscopy is fast and cheap but hard to distinguish between synapses and non-synaptic signals, while electron microscopy is accurate but slow and expensive. The new method uses a combination of fluorescence and electron microscopy to create detailed images of individual synapses. It uses a probabilistic algorithm to identify synapses in fluorescence images and was tested against electron microscopy images as a reference. The algorithm was successful in detecting synapses and reproducing known features of syn distributions in the brain. This method can help discover new types of synapses and their density. It can also be applied to other types of microscopy images where electron validation is not possible.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of action of ZnT, a protein responsible for zinc accumulation and secretion into breast milk during lactation. They found that Zn2 is a proton-coupled zinc antiporter, meaning it uses a proton gradient to transport zinc into vesicles. This was demonstrated through experiments using Bafilomycin A, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar protonase, which alkalizes vesicles, and abolished Zn2-dependent zinc transport. Additionally, using Lyso Red and Ly-pfluorin, they showed that upon Zn2 overexpression in intracellular vesicles and addition of exogenous zinc, vesicles underwent alkalization due to proton-zinc antiport, which was reversed in the presence of TP, a zinc chelator. Computational calculations suggest Zn2 functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2+/Zn+ ion. This means Zn2 is a motive-driven, electrutral ves zinc exchanger, concentrating zinc in vesicles at the expense of proton extrusion to cytoplasm.
Researchers have discovered that 14-3 proteins play a crucial role in maintaining genome stability by regulating the processing of stalled replication forks, which is essential for accurate DNA replication. They found that 14-3 proteins interact with Exonuclease 1 (Exo), an enzyme responsible for processing stalled forks, in yeast and mammalian cells. Without 14-3 proteins, cells accumulate gaps in DNA at stalled forks, leading to persistent checkpoint activation and recovery defects. Using DNA electrophoresis, they showed that 14-3 proteins promote fork progression under limiting nucleotide conditions. The study proposes that 14-3 assist in controlling Exo phosphorylation and other targets, promoting fork stability and restart in response to DNA stress. 

In yeast, 14-3 deficient cells fail to induce Exo hyperphosphorylation and accumulate Ex1-dependent ssDNA gaps at forks, as revealed by electron microscopy. This leads to persistent checkpoint activation and recovery defects. The researchers also found that 14-3 proteins control fork progression and stability under nucleotide limiting conditions. Phosphorylation restrains Ex1 activity, suggesting 14-3 regulate Exo activity upon DNA stress. The study sheds light on processes at stalled forks, proposing 14-3 as central regulators of fork stability and processing.
Researchers studied the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection and pathogenesis using a humanized mouse model. They found that HIV-1 infection leads to persistent infection and immunopathogenesis, including type I interferon (IFN) induction, immune activation, and depletion of human leukocytes, including CD4 T cells. A monoclonal antibody was developed to deplete human DC in lymphoid organs in humanized mice. When DC were depleted prior to HIV infection, induction of IF and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were abolished during acute HIV infection with a highly pathogenic CCR/CX4-tropic HIV or standard C5ropic HIV isolate. Consistent with antiviral role of IF, HIV replication was upregulated in DC-depleted mice. Interestingly, cell death by highly pathogenic HIV isolate was reduced in DC-depleted mice. During chronic HIV infection, depletion DC also reduced induction of IF and IS, associated with elevated HIV replication. Surprisingly, HIV induced human cell death in lymphoid organs, not blood, was reduced despite increased replication. Increased cell in lymphoid was associated with reduced HIV-induced death human leukocytes CD T cells. DC play opposing roles in suppressing HIV replication and promoting HIV-induced immunogenesis. Findings suggest DCpletion and IF blockade provide novel strategies for treating HIV non-responsive patients with immune activation despite antiretrov treatment.
Researchers investigated the effect of sulforaphane (SF), a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, on HIV infection in macrophages. They found that SF blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages, but not in primary T cells. SF also blocks infection in differentiated monocytic cell lines, but not in other cell types. The study suggests that SF's anti-viral activity is mediated through nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which is mobilized by SF. Depletion of Nrf with siRNA increased HIV infectivity in macrophages and reduced the anti-v effects of SF treatment. SF treatment blocks infection after reverse transcription, but before 2-L circle formation, similar to type I interferon-induced proteins SAM1 and MX. However, SAM and MX were not upregulated. The study shows that Nrf can block HIV infection and highlights a new way to trigger inhibition.
A cross-sectional study in rural Kenya found that 76.2% of pregnant women were infected with at least one geohelth, with 52.3% with Ascaris lumicoid, 39.5 with hookworm, and 29.0 with Trichuris trichi. Infection with at least geelth was associated with use of unprotected water source (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3) and lack of water treatment (OR 1.8, 95 CI 1.1-3). Geelth infections were not associated with clinical symptoms or body mass index. Hookworm infection was associated with lower upper arm circumference (mean -0.7 cm, 95 CI 0.3-1). Hookworm with egg count ≥100/gram was associated lower hemoglobin (mean -1.5 g/dl, 95 0.3-2.7). Among gravid 2 and 3 women, Ascaris lumicoid was less likely to have malaria (OR 0.4, 95 0.2-0.8) compared to without Ascaris lumic. Geelth infections are common in this population, but few detrimental effects were observed. Routine antelmin treatment during antenatal visit is recommended, but evaluation of impact on pregnancy, malaria, and outcome is useful.
Researchers investigated the effects of mycolone, a compound produced by the pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, on the nervous system's inflammatory responses. They found that mycolone suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by immune cells, including sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia, without affecting their viability. This suggests that mycol's analgesic properties may be partially due to its anti-inflammatory effects. In vitro, mycolone induced cell death in these cells at concentrations above 10ng/ml after 48 hours, but suppressed pro-inflammatory mediator production at nanomolar concentrations within 24 hours. It also prevented microglia polarization, which contributes to neuroinflammation. In a rat model of neuropathic pain, mycolone injected in the spinal canal decreased inflammatory cytokine production without cytotoxicity. This study provides evidence that mycol suppresses inflammatory responses in sensory neurons, Schw cells, and microia, supporting previous findings in peripheral leukocytes.
Researchers investigated the relationship between genetic variations in human genes and the outcome of African trypanosomiasis, a disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambense, in West Africa. They collected blood samples from 425 individuals in Guinea, including 232 with the disease, 79 with a history of exposure but no symptoms, and 114 without the disease. The team analyzed 28 genetic variations in 8 genes and found that some were associated with the disease outcome. The IL6 rs1819 allele was linked to a lower risk of progressing from latent to active disease, while MIF36071 was associated with increased risk but not significant after correction. MIF12459 was linked to latent infection. The AP1G2 allele was associated with higher risk and AP1 with lower risk of developing the disease. No associations were found with other genes. The study shows that genes influence Tryosoma bruce gambense infection in individuals from Guinea and may lead to new control tools.
Researchers conducted a study on the genetic diversity of South Asians by whole-genome sequencing 38 individuals from Singapore, descendants of immigrants from Dravid-language-speaking states in south India, as part of the Singapore Sequencing Indian Project (SSIP). The genetic diversity of these samples was compared to those from the Sequencing Malay Project and Phase 1 of the 1,000 Genomes Project. Results showed that SSIP samples had greater intra-population genetic diversity and higher heterozygous-homozygous ratio than other Asian populations. When compared to a panel of well-defined Indians, the genetic makeup of SSIP was closely related to South Indians but distinct from Europeans in autosomal SNPs. However, samples were assigned to mitochondrial haplogroups predominantly present in Europeans and had higher European admixture than others. Analysis of relatedness to archaic humans (Denisovan, Neanderthal) showed higher ancient admixture in East populations than SSIP. The study provides a valuable resource for South Asian samples in Phase 3 of 1,000 Genomes.
Researchers investigated the molecular basis of aminoglycoside susceptibility in Burkholderia pseudalle isolates from Thailand. They found that most isolates are intrinsically resistant to aminlycosides and macrolides due to the AmABpr efflux pump. However, three isolates 708, 218, and 9 showed aoglycos susceptibility. RT-PCR revealed the absence of amr transcripts in 708 and reduced levels in 218 and 9. Serial passage on gentamicin concentrations yielded 218 and 9 mutants that became resistant to other aminlycos and macides, but not 708. Transcript analysis showed resistance in 218 and 9 was due to upregulation of ampr expression by unknown mechanisms. PCR revealed the ampr operon was missing in 708, associated with a 70kb deletion. Rescue of the ampr region from a fosmid and sequencing showed a 131 and 141 kb deletions compared to K43 and 10. This deletion removed the operon and genes for malleactin and cobal synthesis, anaerobic arginine deiminase, type 1 fimbria, and secreted chitin. Whole genome and PCR confirmed absence from 708. Despite missing virulence genes, 708 was virulent in a murine model.
Researchers studied how CD4 T helper cells differentiate into Th1 or Th2 cells, a process mediated by cytokines and transcription factors. Contrary to expectations, they found co-expression of antagonistic transcription factors Tbet and Gata in individual cells at high levels, distinct from basal levels during priming. Cytokines were expressed in a small subpopulation, independent of transcription factors in single cells. Cell-to-cell variation in cytokine expression during early differentiation was larger than in the fully differentiated state. Inhibiting cytok signaling led to mutual exclusion of antagonistic factors, revealing an intracellular network overruled by extracellular signals. Results suggest CD4 cells acquire a mixed Th1/2 state early, instructed by extracellular cytokines. The interplay between extracellular and intracellular components in Th2 differentiation may be a strategy to buffer noisy cytokine expression.
In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the protein PAQR-2 plays a crucial role in adapting to low temperatures by regulating fatty acid desaturation. PA-2 is similar to insulin-sensitizing adiponectin receptors in mammals and is essential for growth at 15°C, a temperature that is usually not suitable for the organism. Researchers screened for PA-2 suppressors and found mutations in genes involved in phosphatidcholine synthesis and fatty acid metabolism. They found that PA-2, phosphidcholines, and Δ-9 desaturases form a pathway that increases unsaturated fatty acids to maintain membrane fluidity at low temperatures. This is supported by observations that PA-2 suppressors normalize saturated fatty acid levels and low detergent concentrations that increase fluidity can rescue PA-2 mutants. The study establishes a regulatory pathway connecting PA-2, phosphcholine, and Δ-9 desatases to increase unsaturated fatty acids during cold adaptation. PA-2 increases unsaturation is essential for adaptation to 15°C in C. elegans.
Researchers have used electron microscopy to study the structure of the Herpes Simplex Type-1 (HSV-1) virus, a common human pathogen that causes diseases such as cold sores and blindness. They found a previously unknown feature at the virus's vertex, a connection between the capsid and the membrane, which may play a role in releasing the virus's genetic material into the host cell's nucleus and maintaining the virus's structure. This feature is similar to a structure found in bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, suggesting a shared evolutionary link between the two. 

HSV-1 has a complex structure consisting of a DNA, a protein layer called the tegument, and a lipid envelope. The lack of a tail-like structure in HSV-1 was thought to be due to the virus's ability to infect eukaryotic cells. However, the process of delivering DNA into host cells is similar to that of bacterophages, which have a tail. The HSV-1 capsid has a constant diameter of 125 Å and varies in size from 155 to 240 Å. The structure consists of pentons, hexons, and triplexes.
Researchers studied how the Schistosoma mansoni parasite's soluble egg antigen (SEA) affects HIV-1 infection in the body. They found that SEA can bind to a protein on dendritic cells (DCs) called DC-SIGN, blocking HIV-1 from entering these cells. When DCs exposed to SEA matured under Th2 conditions, they induced T-cells that were less susceptible to HIV-1 R5 infection, but not X4 infection. This was not seen when DCs matured under Th1 or Th1/2 conditions. T-cells induced by SEA-exposed DCs produced less IFN-γ and MIP-1. The study also showed that recombinant omega-1 (r-1) protein, similar to SEA, induced T-cells that were less susceptible to HIV-1 R5 infection, but not X. This was associated with reduced IF-γ and M-1 expression and CCR5 surface expression. The study suggests that SEA and r-1 can modulate HIV-1 infection, potentially influencing disease course in co-infected individuals.
Researchers investigated the phenomenon of neural activity-induced shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and astrocytes in grey and white matter. They found that neuronal stimulation causes a 30% shrinkage of the ECS, which has implications for understanding potassium clearance and astrocyte function. A model was developed to account for experimental data in wild-type and gene knockout individuals. The model suggests that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride, and passive channels of the Na/K pump, and osmotically transport of water through the astrocyte membrane are sufficient for ECS shrinkage. However, considering ECS and astrote ion concentrations with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na+/Cl (NK1) and NaHCO (NBC) cotransporters are critical for achieving observed levels of shrink. The model is detailed and constrained to guide future experiments and pave the way for comprehensive astroglia-neuron models in normal and pathophys situations.
In Arabidopsis thalian, transposons and repetitive DNA elements can be detrimental to the organism if expressed. These elements are suppressed by the establishment of repressive chromatin modifications through the siRNA-mediated transcription silencing pathway, where non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) produced by RNA Polymerase V (Pol) guide ARGONA4 (AGO) to chromatin and enzymes that establish repressive chrom modifications. However, it is unknown how chrom modifying enzymes are recruited to chromatin. This study shows that SPTLTF1, a silencing factor and homolog of SPT elongation factors, binds chromatin at loci subject to transcription silencing. SPTLTF binding occurs downstream of Polymer V but independently of the presence of 24-nt siRNA. Additionally, SPTLTF and AGO are recruited to chrom in parallel and independently of each other. Using methylation restriction enzymes, binding of AGO and SPTLTF is required for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications at several loci. The study proposes that coordinate binding of S and AGO creates a platform for direct or indirect recruitment of chrom modifying enzymes.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Rpo regulon in the tick phase of the Borrelia burgdorferi life cycle, a bacterium that causes Lyme disease. They found that Rpo-dependent gene expression is necessary for the transmission of spirochetes by feeding nymphs. Without Rpo, the spchet are confined to the midgut and transform into unusual round bodies during the later stages of the blood meal. This transformation is reversible and appears to be caused by reduced levels of Coenzyme disulf reductase, which provides NAD for glycolysis. The study shows that spiroes default to an Rpo-independent program for round formation when energy for transmission is unfavorable. The results highlight the importance of the R regul during the tick phase of the cycle and suggest a new role for RSB in physiological adaptations for tick-to-mamm transmission.
Researchers investigated the relationship between gibberin (GA) and jasmonate (JA) hormones in controlling stamen development in Arabidopsis. They found that GA promotes the expression of MYB21, MY24, and MY57 genes, which are involved in stamen elongation. Loss-of-function of DELLA proteins, which are inhibited by GA, restored the expression of these MY genes and restored stamen growth in GA-deficient plants. A triple mutant of MY21, MY24, and MY57 resulted in a short stamen and male sterility. Genetic and molecular studies showed that GA suppresses DELs to mobilize the JA biosynthesis gene DAD, leading to lower JA content in GA-deficient flowers. The study established a hierarchical relationship between GA and JA, where GA promotes JA biosynthesis to control the expression of MY21, MY24, and MY57, a prerequisite for normal st development in Arabidopsis.
Researchers investigated the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in lifespan extension caused by dietary restriction (DR) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Previous studies have shown that the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is essential for longevity resulting from DR in flies and yeast. TOR is a conserved kinase that regulates growth and metabolism in response to nutrients and growth. H-1 is a transcription factor that plays key roles in oxygen homeostasis, tumor formation, glucose metabolism, cell survival, and inflammatory response. The study found that H-1 deficiency results in extended lifespan, which overlaps with inhibition of the RSK-1/S6 kinase, a component of the TOR pathway. Using a modified DR method based on variation of bacterial concentrations on agar, they found H- modulates longevity in a nutrient-dependent manner. H- loss-of-function extends lifespan under rich conditions but fails to show extension under DR. Conversely, mutation egl-9, which increases H- activity, diminishes lifespan under DR. This is rescued by tissue-specific expressionegl- in neurons and muscles. Increased lifespan by H- is dependent on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulator inos-requiring-1 (IRE-1) and associated with lower ER stress. The results demonstrate a tissue-specific role for H- in lifespan by the IRE-ER pathway.
Researchers have discovered that human skin cells called keratinocytes can change their function and behavior in response to different situations, such as when they differentiate into mature skin cells or migrate to a new location. They found that the cells have unique "enhancers" - specific to each state, which control the expression of genes associated with that state. The enhancers are also linked to genetic variations that cause skin diseases. A protein called GR3, which promotes differentiation and migration, binds to enhancers in differentiating cells, but to promoters in migrating cells, repressing migration inhibitors. GR3 is located in enhancers and binds to regulate them, also repressing formation of non-kerocyte enhancers in differentiating cells. This study shows how a single protein can control different gene programs in the same cell type by changing where it binds on chromatin. Previous studies linked enhancers to cell fate and differentiation, but not reversible states like migration. GR3 regulates gene programs in differentiating and migrating keratin by switching chromatin binding in distinct enhancer landscapes. It also suppresses nonkerocyte enhancers in differentiating keratin. The study highlights the relationship between GR3 and chromatin, including enhancers, which applies to cell specification and reversible state. A single factor like GR3 can regulate transitions through distinct mechanisms. GR3 is essential for normal keratin migration in eyelid closure and wound healing, modulating programs that promote movement and suppress progenitor states.
Researchers studied the relationship between endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and exogenous retroviruses in sheep. ERVs are remnants of ancient retroviral infections passed down from generation to generation. Some ERVs may help the host fight off pathogenic retroviruses by interfering with their replication. However, evidence of this mechanism's influence on coevolution of ERVs and exogenousviruses has been hard to find. Sheep are a good model to study retroirus coevolution due to coexistence of exogenous oncogenic retroviruses and biologically active ERVs. The study isolated and characterized 27 ERVs in sheep, which have been in the host genome for 5-7 million years. Two ERVs, JS56 and JS-20, entered the genome 3 million years ago and acquired a defective gag protein, making them dominant and able to block exogenous retrovir replication. These dominant ERVs became fixed in the genome before sheep domestication 9,000 years ago. A new ER emerged recently, likely in the last 200 years, escaping dominant ERs. The study shows sequential events indicating evolutionary antagonism between ER and exogenousviruses. This suggests ERs are used by the host to fight retroiral infections.
Researchers evaluated the effectiveness of real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for diagnosing schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma mansoni and Schistoma haematobium. Current diagnosis relies on microscopic detection of eggs in stool or urine and serological assays, but these methods have low sensitivity. The study aimed to assess two in-house real-time Schos PCRs targeting S. mansoni and S. haematobium in stool, urine, biopsy, and serum samples for diagnosing active infections and monitoring treatment efficacy. 412 samples (124 urine, 86 stools, 8 biopsies, 194) from suspected schistosiasis patients were tested before antiparasitic treatment. Results were compared to microscopic examination and serological assays (ELISA, HA, and WB). Compared to microscopy, PCRs increased sensitivity from 4% to 10.5 and 33.7 to 48.8 for S. in urine and S. in stools, respectively. Serum PCR sensitivity was 72.7 and 94.1 in patients with positive microscopy. Specificity was 98.9. After treatment, PCR positivity declined from 93.8 at 30 to 8.3 at 360, while antibody detection remained positive 1 year. Schos PC outperformed microscopy on stools and urine and could be part of methods with WB-based serology, the gold standard for diagnosis. When serology is positive and microscopy negative, PC provides information for further exploration.
Researchers used machine learning to estimate the energy of different shapes (conformations) of a complex molecule called Archaz A, which is a potent inhibitor of a type of enzyme found in a certain bacteria. They used a method called Gaussian process regression, a type of non-parametric machine learning, to model the relationship between the shape of the molecule and its energy. This allowed them to predict the energy of new shapes of the molecule with high accuracy and speed. They compared their predictions to calculations at a high level of theory and found an average error of less than 1 kcal/mol. This study shows that machine learning can be used for complex, pharmaceutical relevant molecules, potentially speeding up simulations of larger structures.

The researchers used a simple representation of the molecule based on charges and distances between atoms, which was sensitive to changes in shape. This allowed them to find correlations between shapes and energies at a high level of theory. Machine learning has been used in other areas of chemistry, such as predicting properties and transition states. They integrated machine learning with molecular dynamics to simulate long-term chemical and biological systems, using Archaz A as an example. They trained models to capture the relationship between shapes of Archaz and its energy, using a simple representation based on charges and distances. Semi-empirical simulations were carried out using the AM1 Hamilton, starting with a structure from NMR, and refined to match the NMR structure.
Researchers have developed a new method to detect Ebola virus antibodies in wild great apes, specifically gorillas, using non-invasive fecal samples. This breakthrough allows for a better understanding of Ebola virus infections in wild apes and informs strategies to protect them from future infections. The study found that 10% of gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo had antibodies to Ebola virus, indicating exposure or infection is not always lethal in this species. Additionally, evidence of antibodies was found in gorillas previously thought to be unexposed to Ebola, suggesting they may be protected by geographical barriers to transmission. This new approach will aid in early detection of exposure, identifying at-risk populations for vaccination, and tracking vaccine efficacy. Since human Ebola is linked to contact with infected carcasses, identifying ape outbreaks can impact public health in local communities where case-fatality rates are up to 88%. The study is the first to detect Ebola antibodies in wild ape fecal samples and has implications for ape management and survival. Strategies to protect apes from Ebola infections are being explored, including vaccination, as vaccines have shown to protect monkeys from disease.
Researchers have identified a novel type III effector protein, Xop, from the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicator, which exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and in planta. This activity is associated with its C-terminal region, specifically interacting with E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes to form K-linked polyubitin chains. The crystal structure of the Xop C-terminal domain revealed a novel fold, termed XL-box, not present in any characterized E3 ligases. Mutation of amino acids in the XL-box disrupts E ligase activity and prevents Xop-induced plant death. The XL-box lacks cysteine residues, suggesting a non-catalytic ubiquitination mechanism. The N-terminal region of Xop contains a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, potentially a protein-protein interaction module for target recognition. E ligase activity is required for plant death, while suppression of PAMP responses depends on the N-terminal RR domain. The unique fold of the E ubiquitin ligase domain in Xanthas Xop is unprecedented, highlighting variation in bacterial effectors mimicking eukary-specific activity.
Researchers studied the role of T follicular helper cells (Tfh) in the early stages of HIV infection and the impact of antiretroviral treatment (ART) on T and B cell function in a cohort of HIV-infected individuals. They found that Tfh function was impaired in stage 3 compared to stages 1 and 2, with lower B cell survival and IgG secretion in cocultures. This coincided with increased inflammation and higher viral load. Elevated viral load in stage 3 was associated with decreased Tfh-mediated B cell Ig production, indicating a role for viremia in T impairment and humoral response. Phenotypic perturbations were also observed in the B compartment, with a decrease in resting cells in stage 3 compared to 1, coinciding higher vire. The coculture suggested intrinsic B defects contributed to impaired response at lower level. Overall, Tfh B responses were altered in stage 3 compared 1, with increased inflammation and reduced B cells. Data suggest early ART for HIV-infected individuals could prevent dysregulation while preserving T function and B memory.
Researchers have developed a miniaturized screen for a Schistosoma mansoni serergic protein-coupled receptor (Sm5-HT) to identify novel parasite-selective inhibitors for the treatment of schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease affecting 200 million people worldwide. Current therapy relies on a single drug, praziquantel, with suboptimal features. The team pharmacologically profiled Sm-HT as a downstream modulator of praziquel efficacy in a miniaturized assay with high content, employing a luciferase biosensor sensitive to cellular AMP levels. Data showed divergent pharmacological signature between paras serergic receptor and closest human homolog H-HT, supporting parasitic pharmacores optimization. New ligands and series with potency and selectivity for Sm-HT over H-HT were identified in vitro and validated in vivo against schosomules and adult worms. Sm-HT displayed irreversible inactivation, a phenomenon also seen in-HT, enhancing its appeal as a target for anthelmint ligand design. The study underscores feasibility of flatworm GPCRs in high throughput format resolving classes of G modulators and Sm-HT as chemotherapeutic node for next generation anthelmics.
During embryonic development, the formation of the three primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) is crucial for the organization of the metazoan body. In some organisms, such as flies, fish, and amphibians, the ectoderm layer not only separates the germ layers but also serves as a substrate for mesoderm migration. Researchers have found that the separation of these layers is not solely due to differences in adhesion between cells, but rather to localized signals at the boundary between the layers. Ephrin/Eph signaling plays a key role in this process, with multiple ephrin ligands and Eph receptors expressed on each side of the boundary and tissue separation dependent on forward signaling in both directions. This involves redundant ligands and receptors and activation of Rac and Rho. This mechanism differs from simple adhesion-based layer formation and involves localized responses to signals at the boundary and an attachment/detachment cycle allowing cell migration across a substrate.
Researchers analyzed blood samples from 83 children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 76 age-matched neurotypical peers to identify biochemical markers of the disorder. They used multivariate analysis to classify participants as ASD or neurotypical, achieving 96.1% accuracy for neurotyp and 97.6% for ASD. Additionally, they used partial least squares to predict adaptive behavior, measured by Vineland Adaptive Composite score, with 5 metabolites from folate one-carbon and transulf pathways, achieving R2 of 0.45 after cross-validation. This level of accuracy exceeds previous approaches in the field, indicating strong correlation between metabolites and ASD diagnosis, and potential for extracting information from complex biochemical data.

The study used advanced statistical tools to examine metabolites of folate one-carbon and transulf pathways in neurotyp and ASD children, as well as their siblings. Children aged 3-10 were assessed for oxidative stress, with ASD defined by DSM-IV, ADOS, and CARS score >30. FMTS metabolites from 83 ASD, 47, and 76 neurotyp children were used for classification. Metabolites investigated are listed in Table 1, with details in [38]. Of 83 ASD, 55 had Vineland scores for regression (46-106). Vin Adaptive Composite evaluates adaptive skills through semi-structured caregiver interview.

The multivariate analysis provided unprecedented classification separating ASD and neurotyp based solely on biochemical data. Existing analyses showed differences in mean metabol levels, but not designed for classification, failing to separate participants. Incorporating multiple measurements increased separability and predicted severity.
Researchers used Bayesian statistical models to analyze leishmanias incidence in Brazil over a 10-year period (2001-2010). Leishias is a disease found in 98 countries, affecting approximately 350 million people, with 2 million cases annually. Brazil is one of the most affected countries. The study focused on spatial and temporal patterns of cutaneous and visceral leishias. Bayesian negative binomial models were fitted using integrated Laplace approximations for fast inference. Variable selection identified important climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic predictors. Precipitation and socioeconomic factors were significant for both types of leias. Predicted cases in 2010 were 30,189 (SD:7,676) for cutaneous leias and 4,889 (SD:288) for visceral leias. Maps showed highest infected areas in Minas Gerais and Para for visceral and cutaneous leias respectively. High-resolution maps identified priority areas for control efforts to reduce incidence. 

The study used available data from Brazil's Ministry of Health and variable selection to identify environmental and socioeconomic predictors. Previous analyses mapped leias incidence at state level, but rarely used statistical models accounting for spatial-temporal correlations. This study analyzed CL and VL data from 2001-201, employing Bayesian negative binomial models via INLA, using climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic covariates. High-resolution maps for leias and estimated infected people at state level. Brazil's Ministry reported maps without predictors and Bayesian approaches. Recent study provided worldwide leias estimates and Brazil maps aggregated by state. This study provided country-based maps for cutaneous and visceral leias at 88km resolution, exploring spatial processes, risk, and high areas.
A study of 647 adults and 881 children with deng in Vietnam found significant differences in clinical features and complications between the two age groups. Adults experienced more severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and organ involvement, while children had more frequent and severe vascular leakage and shock. Thrombocytopenia was more common in adults, especially in those with secondary infection and certain serotypes. Platelet counts remained lower in adults even after recovery, indicating an intrinsic difference in platelet count between age groups. The study highlights the importance of understanding age-related differences in deng disease to inform research and management guidelines.
Researchers studied the infection of sooty mangabeys (SM) with Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIVm) and found that despite robust virus replication, the infection is non-pathogenic. They identified a novel CCR5 mutation, CCRΔ2, which encodes a truncated protein not expressed on the cell surface and does not support SIV entry in vitro. This allele was present in 26% of a large SM colony, along with 3% for CCR5Δ24, which also abrogates surface expression. 8% of animals were homozygous for defective C5 and 41% heterozygous. The mutant was also found in wild SM in West Africa. CD8 and CD4 T cells showed a gradient of C5 expression across groups, significant for CD8 cells. SIVm infection prevalence was not different in animals lacking C5 compared to heterozygous and homozygous wild-type. Animals lacking C5 had robust viral loads, modestly lower than wild-type. SIV isolates infected homozyg mutant and wild PBMC in C5-independent manner in vitro and Envs from C-null and wild used CX6, G15 and G1 in addition to C5 transfected cells. This indicates SIV relies on C-independent pathways in SM homozy for C5 and alternative use in SM with C5 wild is uncertain, suggesting SIVm tropism and host in vivo defined by distribution and use of entry in addition to C5.
Researchers have investigated the role of the transcription factor MEF in the development of tumors, specifically in a type of cancer called leiomyosarcoma (LMS). They found that MEF can have both positive and negative effects on tumor growth, depending on its interaction with other proteins. MEF can activate or repress gene expression by modifying histone marks, such as H3 methylation and acetylation. Class II HDs, a type of enzyme, are involved in creating a repressive environment for MEF. In 22% of LMS, class II HDs are overexpressed, and high levels of MEF, HD4, and HD9 correlate with poor survival. Knocking out HD9 in LMS cells restored transcription of MEF-target genes and reduced transformed phenotype. HD9 also demethylated H3me3 at M2 promoters. Class II HDs do not bind M regulatory elements of M2. M2 genes can be both transcribed and repressed, but are poised in chromatin signature. Class II HD and HD9 are potential targets for therapy in LMS.
Researchers used a combination of protein docking, molecular simulation, and cryo-electron microscopy to study the structure of two types of hydrophobin proteins, HFBI and HFB, produced by the fungus Trichoderma rei. The study aimed to understand how these proteins form a film at the air-water interface, which is crucial for the fungus's growth and has applications in biotechnology. The results showed a unit cell composed of six proteins with P6 symmetry, but cryo-electron microscopy revealed P3 symmetry with a unit size of 56 Å. Computational simulations suggested an alternate structure with P3 symmetry and a smaller unit size. A Monte Carlo simulation of a spin model representing the hydroobin film showed this alternate structure may increase the rate of film formation, indicating a possible mechanism for both biology and nanotechnology. 

The researchers used cryo-electron microscopy, protein docking, and molecular dynamics to study the structure of HF and HFB of Trichoderma rei, which have high resolution structures available. The experimentally observed unit size matches a close-packed hexagonal arrangement of proteins, hosting seven molecules, but AFM shows a uniform sheet. Macroscopic properties arise from cooperative effects between interlocking proteins in the surface network. Hydrophins have industrial applications and biological roles, and similar models have been used in self-assembly. The study aimed to understand the role of P3 symmetry in film formation, designing a Monte Carlo algorithm mimicking protein motions. The first high-resolution structure of hydroob was HFB of Trichma, crosslinked by disulfide, 2nm diameter, and amphipathic with hydrophobic face.
Researchers have identified a potential new target for treating Leishmanias, a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donani. They studied the enzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, specifically threyl-tRNA synthase (LThr), which is essential for protein synthesis. Recombinant LThr was expressed and purified, and its kinetic parameters were determined. Immunofluorescence analysis showed LThr is localized in the cytosol and mitochondria. Heterozygous mutants of LThr in Leish promastigotes showed restrictive growth and attenuated infectivity, and were more susceptible to the inhibitor borid. Several attempts to create Thr homozyg null mutants failed, indicating LThr is essential for Leish survival. Borid showed strong affinity for LThr and inhibited aminoacylation activity with an IC50 of 0.06 μM. Borid also inhibited promastig stage parasites with an IC50 of 21 μM. The study suggests LThr is a potential target for drug discovery, as it is essential for Leish survival and can bind small molecules with strong affinity.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is recognized as non-self by the protein RIG-I through the presence of a 5'-phosphate (5-pp) on viral RNA associated with a 3' poly-UUC tract. Researchers have defined the HCV pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and criteria for R-I non-discrimination of HCV by examining RNA-function attributes that impart AMP to the poly-UUC tract. They found that the 34 nucleotide polyuridine core of the sequence was essential for R-I activation and interspersed ribosine nucleotides between poly sequences in RNA were required for optimal R-I induction. 5-pp poly-U RNA variants stimulated R-I efficiently and interaction with the repressor and helicase domains of R-I was required for signaling. When appended to 5-pp RNA lacking AMP activity, the-U core sequence conferred non-recognition of RNA and innate signaling by-I. Importantly, HCV-U variants strongly activated-I triggered anti-H responses in vitro and hepatic immune responses in vivo using a mouse model. These studies define a multi-mot P signature of non-recognition by-I that incorporates 5-pp with polyuridine composition and length. This HAMP drives-I signaling to induce the immune response to infection. The study defines basis of non-discrimination by-I and offers insights into antiviral potential of targeted-I activation.
Researchers investigated the role of eosinophils in promoting the growth of Trichella spiralis larvae in skeletal muscle. They found that IL-4 and eosophils are necessary for normal larval growth and that eosophils from IL-4 competent mice are sufficient to support growth. The eosophil effect operates in the absence of adaptive immunity. Following invasion by larvae, host gene expression in muscle was compatible with a regenerative response and shift in source of energy in infected tissue. The presence of eosoph suppressed local inflammation and influenced nutrient homeostasis in muscle. Redistribution of glucose 4 (GLUT4) and phosphorylation of Akt were observed in cells, consistent with enhancement of glucose and glycogen storage by larvae. The data suggest a mechanism in which eosoph promote larval growth by IL-4 dependent that limits interferon-driven responses that alter nutrient in muscle. 

Eosin-derived IL-4 promotes larval growth by enhancing glucose uptake in host cells through GLUT4 pathway. Alternatively, glucose can be regulated by IL-4 indirectly. Results support a mechanism in which larval growth is supported when eosoph or eosoph-derived IL limits STAT signaling that inhibits glucose and lipid in muscle. Further experimentation is needed to clarify the mechanism. Eos derived from IL-4 mice were necessary for lar growth. Whole transcription profiling identified genes altered in muscle during infection coinciding with eosoph requirement. To limit infiltrating cells in muscle, experiments were performed with Rag- mice. Observations support a model in which eosoph contribute IL- dependent regeneration in response to injury caused by NBL. Lar growth was supported when eosoph restored by transfer from IL or STAT- mice. Eos express IL receptor and may develop in presence of IL to produce mediators or functions that support growth. Lar growth not affected by absence I2. Transfer IL- eos failed to improve growth in mice.
A recent genome-wide study of DNA replication in human cells contradicts the idea that mammalian chromosomes consist of large regions with no replication origins. The study found that in HeLa cells, a type of human cell line, replication origins are spaced about 40,000 base pairs apart and fire in clusters, with increasing synchrony during the S phase of the cell cycle. The speed of replication remains constant, around 0.7-2 kilobases per minute, and is narrowly distributed throughout the phase. Analysis of the genome-wide replication timing shows a broad distribution of speeds, with some regions replicating less than 2 kilobases per minute. This suggests that He cells do not have large regions of unidirectional fork progression. Instead, temporal regions are replicated by sequential activation of origins at an increasing rate during the phase, and timing is set by the delay and spacing between origin firings, not the velocity of single forks. The study also found that internal origins in a temporal region are activated, demonstrated by DNA combing of the IGH locus in He cells. Analysis of published origin maps in He cells and replication and DNA comb data in other cell types confirm these findings, except for embryonic cells where regions of unid fork are more abundant.
Researchers investigated how the "temporal stability" or "slown" approach can be implemented in biologically realistic learning rules. They found that slow feature analysis, an algorithm based on slown, can be implemented in continuous neurons using a modified Hebbian rule, linking it to the trace rule, another implementation of slown learning. Analytically, they showed that for Poisson neurons, slown learning can be implemented by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a specific window. Studying the dynamics of STDP, they found that the learning outcome is governed by the convolution of the window with the postsynaptic potential, not the window alone. They derived ST windows that implement feature analysis and the trace rule, compatible with physiological data in shape and timescale. The analysis also showed the window can be split into reversible and irreversible components sensitive to input statistics, with irreversible generating oscillatory weight dynamics. This offers a novel interpretation for the role of ST in physiological neurons. 

In a continuous model, modified Hebb learning enables neurons to learn the slown combination of inputs. This links SFA to the trace rule, another slown implementation. In a spiking model, linear Poisson neurons, STDP is an implementation of slown. The study suggests the outcome of ST learning is the convolution of the window with EP, not the window alone. The window for SFA can be calculated analytically. Physiologically plausible parameters lead to a window shape and width in agreement with findings, proposing a new interpretation of ST as slown compensating for neuronal filters like EP.
Researchers have discovered a new phenomenon called "cooperative adaptation to therapy" (CAT) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCL) where cancer cells induce resistant phenotypes in neighboring cells when exposed to therapy. Using a CRISPR/Cas toolkit, they engineered diverse NSCL cells with mutations in Dicer, a type III cytoplasmic endonuclease involved in non-coding RNA genesis. In a three-dimensional growth dynamics, fluorescently-labeled mutant and wild-type cells were cultured individually or co-cultured in a substrate-free system under stimulated or drug conditions. Mathematical modeling and flow cytometry characterized growth patterns of mono and co-cultures, revealing that combination of wild-type and mutants allowed growth in previously sensitive cells despite drug pressure via cooperative game-theoretic change in fitness. An ex vivo human tumor model predicted clinical response to drug sensitivity and morphological heterogeneity correlated with prognostic failure of multiple-approved and off-label drugs in NSCL patient samples. This study presents a paradox in resistance implicating non-genetic cooperation among cells to thwart pressure, suggesting profiling druggable targets alone may be insufficient for effective therapy.
A study conducted in the Mbeya region of southwestern Tanzania found that 67.9% of the population above the age of 5 had IgG antibodies against Spotted Group (SFG) rickettsiae, a type of bacteria that causes spotted fever. The study involved 1,228 participants from nine communities, stratified by age, altitude, and ownership of domestic mammals. Higher temperatures and lower elevations were associated with lower seroprevalence, while warmer temperatures and male gender were associated with higher seropval. Higher cattle density at higher elevations was also associated with higher seropval. The study suggests that SFG ricketial infection is common in the rural population of Mb Region and spread is limited by temperature and elevation. Further research is needed to determine the contribution of SFG to febrile illnesses and estimate the disease burden in the population. 

The study used random sampling to select participants and tested for IgG against SFG ricketiae using indirect immunofluorescence at a dilution 1:64. Interviews were conducted with household heads regarding socioeconomic and infrastructural settings. SFG might contribute to disease burden, as S ricketios are frequent in travelers and endemic in African countries. Future studies should detect the pathogen in infection and describe transmission to validate risk factors. Comparing to typhus group ricketial antibodies, S and TGR serositivity occur in different patterns, with higher in areas with sparse or dense population.
Researchers have discovered that a specific type of fatty acid called oleate plays a crucial role in the immune response of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to pathogens. Oleate is a type of monounsaturated fatty acid that is involved in various physiological processes, including membrane formation and fat storage. The study identified two enzymes that synthesize oleate in C elegans and found that its production is necessary for the activation of immune genes in response to pathogens. C elegans deficient in oleate production are more susceptible to infection from various human pathogens, which can be rescued by adding exogenous oleate. However, oleate alone is not enough to activate the immune response. This research adds to the known benefits of monounsaturated fatty acids and suggests a link between nutrient metabolism and susceptibility to bacterial infection. 

The study found that oleate is necessary for immune activation and resistance to bacterial infection in a different way from other fatty acids. C elegans deficient in ole production are more easily killed by bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia faalis, and Staphylococcus marces. Oleate is the most abundant fatty acid in C elegans. The researchers tested if ole's effect on immune response is through its conversion to other fatty acids, but evidence shows this is not the case. The pathogen and immune profile of fat-2 mutants show ole's effect on immune is not dependent on other fatty acids. Supplementation of ole rescued the immune defect in fat-6 mutants in a dose-dependent manner. The study indicates ole and other fatty acids affect immune expression and resistance by different mechanisms.
Researchers have discovered a new class of compounds, called pyrimidines, that target guanine riboswitches, which regulate gene expression in response to specific metabolite binding. Guanine ribwitches are involved in purine metabolism, crucial for nucleotide pool in cells. Binding to guanine, these ribwitches stabilize 5'-untranslated mRNA, causing transcription attenuation of downstream reading frame. A compound, PC, a pyrimidine, shows bactericidal activity against a subgroup of bacterial species, including nosocomial pathogens, by targeting guA, a gene for G synthase, under control of ribwitch. Bacteria with multiple drug resistance were inhibited, suggesting PC targets different pathway. A mouse model showed direct correlation between PC administration and reduction of Staphylococcus aureus infection in mammary glands. This establishes possibility of using existing knowledge to design guanine ribwitch-targeting antibiotics as antimicrobial compounds. The finding of new guanine ribwitch target is crucial as community-acquired bacterial infections have emerged.
Researchers investigated how gaze influences the construction of mental space during navigation in primates, specifically macaque monkeys, as they searched a virtual reality maze for a reward. They found that hippocampal cells responded to one or more variables like direction, point of gaze, or context, and fired at the sight and in anticipation of a landmark in a viewpoint-dependent manner, encoding the animal's situation within a set of actions leading to the goal. Overall, hippocal activity was best fit by a fine-grained space comprising current position, view, and context. The findings indicate that place cells in primates embody multidimensional, task-situated knowledge to the target of gaze, supporting self-awareness in space construction.

The study examined the nature of hippocal coding in a goal-oriented task, separating goal and landmarks, and how cells code position, direction, and target gaze. The goal setting enabled to examine whether task context modulated the activity of cells. Previous results showed hippocal encoded spatial views, place, or a mixture of place and view. In a VR setting, the findings show hippocal display fine tuning that preferentially codes one landmark viewed by the animal and its position relative to landmark.

The results give a comprehensive analysis of variables controlling hippocal cells, bridging the gap between studies in rodents and primates, including humans, in real and virtual environments. Hippocamp cells code the target in an informed manner, embedding position with elements in environment and context. The data suggest counterpart place in prim, compared to rodents, is expressed related to gaze with other navigation variables, such as position and identity at instants of planning.
Researchers have studied the development of the midbrain and hindbrain in vertebrates, focusing on the midbrain boundary (MHB), where a specific pattern of gene expression is established and maintained by a network of regulatory interactions between transcription and secreted factors. They used a Boolean analysis of spatial gene expression patterns at the murine MHB to identify key interactions in this network, employing computational techniques for minimization of Boolean functions. This allowed them to predict the interplay of various regulatory interactions, including a maintaining rather than inducing effect of Fgf on Wnt expression, which was unclear from previous data. Using mouse neural plate explant cultures, they found that Fgf maintains but does not induce ectopic Wnt expression in these explants. Combining this with validated interactions, they constructed a regulatory network of transcription and secret factors at the M. Analyzing Boolean differential and reaction-diffusion models of this network confirmed it explains the maintenance of M and expression patterns under wild-type and knock-out conditions. They demonstrated that spatial expression patterns can provide information about regulatory networks, showing that patterns around the M help understand the maintenance of this boundary on a systems level.
A parasite called Theileria annulata infects host cells, causing uncontrolled growth and division of the infected cells. After the parasite enters the cell, the host cell membrane dissolves and microtubules (MTs) surround the parasite, forming a structure called a schizont. Instead of invading other cells, the schizont remains attached to the host MTs and during cell division, using the host's astral and central MTs to divide between the two daughter cells. The mechanism of how the schizont recruits and stabilizes host MTs is unknown. Researchers focused on the protein EB1, a key regulator of host MT dynamics, and found that Theia annata's p104, a protein on the schizont's surface, binds to EB1. This binding depends on a specific motif in p104's C-terminal region. The interaction with host EB1 is cell cycle-regulated, making it the first pathogen protein to interact with EB via a SIP motif. This study reveals how Theia interacts with the host cytoskeleton, a crucial for its persistence in the host.
In a study on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, researchers found that cells with a deficiency in the replicative ligase Cdc9 had persistent DNA damage, likely due to broken replication forks, leading to constitutive activation of the DNA damage checkpoint and longer telomeres. Telom length required functional telerase, the DNA signaling cascade Mec-Rad-Rad53, and components of the repair pathway Rad51, Rad52, Pol, and P1. The phosphorylation of P1 by Mec-Rad53, necessary for inhibition of telomerase at double strand breaks, was also important for P1's role in repair and telom elongation in c9 cells. Two other mutants with impaired replication, c44 and r3, showed similar telom length dependent on P1 phosphorylation. The study proposes that passage of repair forks through telomeres promotes telerase activity, leading to telom lengthening. A genome-wide screens for S cerevisiae mutants causing telom length or shortening found genes relevant to replication, repair, and chromatin structure. The damage-induced phosphorylation of P1 promotes telom-stabilizing tel extension while repressing de novo telom events at breaks, funneling DNA into preserving pathways. The DDR in c9 cells is required for repair via BIR, causing additional telom length. The mechanism may explain r3 mutants with replication pausing and break constitutive activation Rad and teleres. Combination damage and length is seen in c44 cells. DNA-induced phosphorylation of P1 is required for inhibition telom at DSBs and P1's function in BIR. Activation B in damage leads to telom length, providing protection against repair machinery. Cells lacking P1 have longer teleres and de novo tel addition Ds.
Researchers investigated the use of luciferase immunoprecitation systems (LIPS) as a rapid and specific diagnostic tool for Onchocerca volulus infection. Four recombinantly produced Onocerca volulus antigens (OvAR-1, API-1, A-MS-1, and CPI-1) were tested on a large cohort of sera from uninfected controls and patients with proven Onoc volulus, Wucher bancfti, Loa loa, Strongloides stercis, and other cross-reactive infections. Antibody responses to the four antigens allowed unequivocal differentiation between infected and uninfected sera with 100% sensitivity and 100 specificity. Analysis of antibody titers to each antigen in infected sera revealed they were markedly different and did not correlate with each other. Compared to infected, patients with W, L, S, and other conditions had lower geometric antibody titers to each antigen. A mixture of the four antigens in standard or 15-minute IPS showed 100% sensitivity and specificity distinguishing infected from unected sera. IPS had best performance with 76, 84, and 93 for distinguishing from W, L, and S-infected sera. The multi-antigen IPS can be a rapid, high-throughput, specific tool to diagnose individual infections and potentially sensitive point-of-care for early detection recrudescence in control and mapping areas.
A 54-month iron-folic acid supplementation and deworming program was implemented in a rural area of northern Vietnam to reduce anemia, iron deficiency anemia, and soil-transmitted infections in women of reproductive age. The study aimed to evaluate the program's effectiveness and identify predictive factors for hematological outcomes. A prospective design was used to assess a population-based supplementation and dewing over 54 months, with 389 participants enrolled prior to commencement. After 54 months, 76% of participants were taking iron-folic acid and 95% had taken dewing. Hemoglobin rose from 122g/L to 131/L, anemia fell from 38% to 18, iron deficiency from 23 to 8, and iron anemia from 18 to 4. Hookworm infection reduced from 76 to 11 and moderate or heavy infestation to less than 1. The program efficiently reduced anemia and eliminated iron anemia and moderate to heavy soil-transmitted infections below public health concern levels.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) evades the immune system. EBV is a common virus that can cause life-threatening reactivations in people with weakened immune systems. To avoid being eliminated by the immune system, viruses like EBV use various strategies to hide from T cells and other immune cells. The study found a protein called gp150 on the surface of EBV-infected cells that prevents the immune system from recognizing the virus. This protein is a shield made of sugar molecules that covers the surface of the cell, making it hard for the immune system to detect the virus. This is a new way for viruses to evade the immune system. The researchers also found that this protein is not needed for the virus to enter or leave the cell, but is important for the virus to hide from the immune. The study suggests that immune cells called B cells are also important in fighting EBV infection, not just T cells. The results show that the virus can live longer in the body when it has this protein, making it harder for the immune to get rid of it.
Researchers have found that a protein called Tarp, which is present in all pathogenic Chlamydia species, plays a crucial role in the bacteria's ability to invade host cells. Tarp is a protein that binds to actin, a component of the host cell's cytoskeleton, and helps the bacteria to enter the cell. A specific antibody against the actin-binding part of Tarp was created and tested, and it blocked actin polymerization in the lab and prevented Chlamydia from entering host cells, indicating T's importance in the bacteria's pathogenesis. Analysis of T orthologs from other Chydia species showed multiple actin-binding sites. To determine if the actin-binding domains are functional, Tarp fusions from different Chy species were tested for their ability to bind and nucleate actin. The results showed that Chy Tarp has variable numbers of actin sites and promotes actin formation. The study suggests that T-mediated actin binding and nucleation is a conserved among Chy species and plays a role in bacterial invasion of host cells.
Researchers have developed a new method called formalin-acetate sedimentation digestion (FASD) to precisely quantify Schistosoma japonicum eggs in bovine feces. Schistosoma japon is a zoonosis that affects mammals, including water buffaloes, which account for 75% of human transmission in the People's Republic of China. Accurately determining the prevalence and intensity of Schosoma in mammalian hosts is crucial for calculating transmission rates and environmental contamination. The FAS technique involves filtration, sedimentation, potassium hydroxide digestion, and centrifugation steps prior to microscopy. It removes 70% of debris from fecal samples, making it easier to visualize Schosoma eggs. This method is useful for estimating infection in boines and other ruminant hosts. The FAS technique is as effective as real-time PCR for determining Schos prevalence in boines but less costly. It can be a valuable tool for surveillance in areas with low to high infection or suspected schos elimination.
Mutations in the genes encoding cartilage protein (CRTAP) and proly 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H) encoded by LEP1 were first identified as causes of recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). These proteins, together with cyclophilin (encoded PPI), form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a proline on the α1(I) chain (Pro986) and has cis-trans isomerase Pase activity for proper collagen folding. Recent data suggest proly 3-hydrolation of Pro is not required for collagen stability, but absence of this post-transl modification disrupts protein interactions for proper folding and leads to collagen overmodification. PH and CRTAP stabilize each other, and absence of one results in degradation of the other. Hypomorphic or loss of function of either gene causes loss of the complex and its functions. The contribution of this complex's 3-hydrolysis versus Pase and chaperone activities to OI phenotype is unknown. To distinguish these functions, knock-in mice were generated carrying a single amino substitution in the catalytic site of PH (Lep1H662). This abolished PH activity but retained ability to form complex with CRT and chaper function. Knock mice showed absence proly 3-hydrolation at Pro of α(I) and α(II) collagen but no overmodification at other residues. They were normal in appearance, no growth defects and cartilage plate histology but decreased trabecular bone mass. This model recapitulates elements of bone OI but not cartilage phenotypes caused loss proly 3-hydrolation complex. Observations suggest differential consequences due selective inactivation PH hydroxylase versus ablation proly 3ydro complex.
Researchers have discovered that the P-element, a selfish genetic element, has invaded the Drosophila simul species, causing hybrid dysgenesis, a syndrome of abnormal phenotypes including sterility, similar to its invasion of Drosila melanogaster. A survey of 181 D simul strains found 20% induce dysgenesis. Genomic and transcript data show the dys-inducing phenotype is associated with the P-element invasion. The invasion occurred rapidly and simultaneously on three continents, with strains containing P-elements rare in 2006 and common by 201. Strains from the latter phase of invasion have adapted to suppress the P-element's effects, evidenced by resistance to dysgenesis. A hybridgenesis was found in crosses between simul strains collected before and after the invasion. Next generation sequencing and PCR identified the P-element associated with dysgenesis in simul, which spread across Europe, Africa, and North America, faster than in D melanaster. Both simul and melanaster evolved to suppress dysgenesis by the end of the study, suggesting strong selection to ameliorate the P's effects, underscoring the challenge posed by selfish elements. simul has lower rates of P-induced gonadal dys than melanaster, expected to hamper the P's spread by reducing its carriers' fitness.
Researchers have developed a method to use rhodamine B, a fluorescent dye, to mark the body and seminal fluid of male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes for mark-release experiments and estimate the efficacy of sterile male releases. The technique involves feeding males 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8% rhod B in 50% honey solutions during flight, resulting in >95% transfer to females and successful marking after 4 days, with 0.4 and 0.8 solutions producing the longest body marking. Rhod B had no effect on male competitiveness and field releases demonstrated transfer of marked fluid to females and recapture of marked males. This method is useful for evaluating male-based control strategies and a viable marking technique without negative effects of traditional methods. Rhamine marking is less expensive and time-consuming than other methods such as PCR and isotope labelling and fertility assays to assess competitiveness of sterilized males. 

Aedes aegypt males were fed 0.4% rhamine and 50 honey for 96 hours, then knocked down and inspected for rhamine in body and seminal fluid. Females were inspected for rhamine in burs and spermathec and presence of sperm. Competitiveness assays in semi-field cages showed rhamine labelling may be advantageous over powders and useful to assess mating success. The study aimed to assess rhamine as a dual technique for Ae aegypt, including Wolbachia-infected w strain. Males exposed to 0.4 rhamine and 50 honey marked 96 hours later were engorged when knocked down. Females mated with stained males had 83% seminal marking, while 90 mated with stained males had fluid under fluorescence. Rhamine sugar-feeding marked body and fluid of wild and Wolia-infected aegy, lasting life expectancy post-feeding without impacting survival. Transfer of marked fluid occurred >95 post-feeding with no impact on competitiveness or survivorship.
Bacterial superantigens, a family of toxins, induce an inflammatory cytokine storm that can lead to lethal shock. CD28, a homodimer on T cells, functions as a costimulatory ligand in the immune response through interaction with Bcoligands. However, to elicit inflammatory cytokine expression and toxicity, superigens must bind directly to the dimer interface of CD28. Preventing access of superigen to CD suffices to block lethality. Mice were protected from lethal superigen challenge by peptide mimetics of the CD dimer interface and peptides to compete with superigen for binding in CD. Superigens use a conserved strand/helix domain of unknown function to engage CD28. Mutation of superigen domain abolished inflammatory gene induction and lethality. Structural analysis showed when superigen binds to T receptor on cell and major histocompatibility class molecule on antigen-presenting cell, CD can be accommodated as superigen receptor in ternary complex, with CD dimer oriented towards strand/helix domain superigen. Our findings identify CD homimer as critical receptor for superigens. The role of CD as receptor for class microbial pathogens, superigens, broadens pathogen recognition mechanisms.
Researchers have discovered that the Wnt/β-caten pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle and proliferation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Unlike somatic cells, ESs have a fast cell cycle with a short G1 phase due to the lack of cell cycle inhibitors, which maintains their pluripotency and prevents differentiation. The Wnt/β-caten pathway controls pluripotency through the W-effector T3, but its effect on the cell cycle of ES was unknown. The study found that W-eff T1 is recruited and activates the Ink/Ar tumor suppressor locus, restoring G1 phase and reducing proliferation of ES without affecting pluripotency. T1, but not T3, is recruited to palindromic motifs in promoters of cycle repressors, such as p15k4, p16k4 and p19, mediating W-dependent anti-proliferation in ES. Disruption of β-caten or T1 impairs W-dependent cell regulation. Activation of W results in downregulation of differentiation genes while plurotency remains unpert. Cell effects depend on βaten and T1, but not T3, indicating non-overlapping functions of T/L factors in ES. T1 is enriched at promoters of cycle genes like Ink/Ar locus. Data show GSK inhibition βaten transcriptionally regulates Ink and Arf members in T3-independent manner. T1 KD in ES did not impair plurotent markers. W/βaten triggers anti-proliferation in ES via T1 activity, contrasting its mitogenic effect in somatic cells.
Researchers investigated the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in dengue virus (DENV) infection. They found that pDCs from mildeng patients had higher frequencies of membrane-bound TRAIL (mTR) compared to severe cases or healthy controls. Plasma levels of IF-α and soluble TR were increased in mild compared to severe deng patients, correlating with p activation. In vitro, exposure to DENV-2 induced mTR expression on p and relocalized it from the intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane. Chloroquine treatment inhibited DENV-induced mTR relocalization and IF-α production by p. Endosomal degradation by chloro allowed viral antigens detection inside p. Coculture of p/DENV-infected monocytes showed reduced antigen detection, which was also observed after exogenous IFα treatment, indicating p effect on viral load was mainly due to IFα production. The study characterized p activation during DENV infection and antiv role in vitro. TR-expressing p may play a role in disease outcome.
Researchers have investigated the role of tumor necrosis factor (TN) in the body's defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. TN plays a crucial role in both active and latent phases of infection. Studies have shown that TN-neutralizing drugs, used to treat inflammatory disorders, increase the risk of tuberculosis (TB). This study used a computational approach to characterize TN's role in protecting against the tubercle bacillus in both active and latent infection. The researchers extended previous models to investigate the production of soluble (sTN) and transmembrane TN (tmTN). They analyzed the effects of anti-TNF therapy in clinical trials by simulating two commonly used therapies, anti-T antibody and TN receptor fusion, to predict differences in TB reactivation rates. The study found that bioavailability of TN following anti-T therapy is the primary cause of reactivation of latent infection and that even low levels of TN are essential for infection control. A mathematical model was used to distinguish the mechanisms of action of anti-T treatments and gain insights into TN's role in TB control and pathology. The study suggests a TN-modulating agent could be developed to balance reduction of inflammation with maintenance of resistance to infection. Alternatively, the dose and timing of anti-T therapy could be modified.
Researchers analyzed data from the 1000 Genomes Project to investigate differences in the loss of ancestral retrocopies among human populations. They also examined retrocopy expression levels using RNA-Seq data from the Geuvad Consortium and lymphoblast cell lines. A new approach was developed to detect novel retrocopies absent from the human genome, confirming their existence and presence in 17 populations. 193 retroduplication variations (RDVs) were detected, mostly resulting from retro deletion. Most were not previously reported. Expression of 11 ancestral genes deleted in individuals was confirmed, with low frequency, except for one. Conservation and low deletion rate suggest functionality. Differences in retrocopy expression between populations were also found, with 9 genes undergoing significant expression.

A new approach was developed to detect undiscovered retroduplication in the human genome. Previous studies on retro repertoire in populations revealed 208 polymorphic retrocopies, called retrodup variations (RD). Two studies reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of populations, proving RD value as genomic markers for history. However, many questions remained unanswered. Current methods for discovering retroposition were limited. This study used 4,927 retro from RetroDB and genomic data from 1,092 individuals from 14 populations. 214 indels affecting 190 retrocopies were identified. Retro polymorphisms as markers for population history are established, but findings suggest insight into ongoing evolutionary processes.
Researchers studied how the location of Taenia solium cysticerci in the brain affects inflammation in pigs with neurocysticercosis, a disease caused by the parasite. They compared inflammation around cysterci in the brain tissue (parenchyma) to those in the meninges (membranes surrounding the brain) and in pigs treated with prazantel, an anti-parasitic drug. Histological analysis of 196 brain samples from 11 infected pigs showed that cysti in the parenym caused more inflammation after treatment than those in the meninges. Inflammation in the meninges was not affected by treatment. Cysti partially in contact with both parenym and meninges showed increased inflammation correlated with the extent of contact with parenym. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier was only seen in parenym tissue after treatment. Inflammation in meninges was less than in parenym. This may explain why subarachn neurocystercosis is harder to treat than parenymal.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 30 communities in two districts of Ghana where azithrom mass administration for trach control had previously taken place. Children aged 5-17 with ulcerative lesions compatible with yaws were enrolled. Samples for treponemal serology and PCR were collected from all children. 90 with 98 lesions were enrolled. Syphilis serology was negative in all of them. PCR for T. pallum sp pertue was negative in children but Haemophil duyi DNA was detected in 9 lesions. In communities previously treated for trach, no evidence of ongoing y transmission was found. H. duyi was associated with a proportion of lesions but majority remain unexplained. Integration of diagnostic testing into pre and post-M surveillance is required for better y control.
Researchers have been working to find new ways to stop HIV from hiding in the body after treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART). One way to do this is to block the formation and growth of the HIV reservoir, a group of cells that keep the virus alive. The reservoir is mainly made up of memory T cells, a type of immune cell that helps fight infection. A pathway called Jak-STAT is involved in the homeostasis, or balance, of these cells, and is thought to play a role in HIV persistence. Two FDA-approved drugs, tofacitinib and ruxitin, were tested to see if they could stop the reservoir from forming and growing in the lab. The study found that these drugs blocked the Jak-STAT pathway in memory cells that harbor HIV, and reduced the number of cells with integrated virus. The drugs also blocked production of virus from infected cells and prevented transmission to other cells. This suggests that dysregulation of the Jak-STAT pathway is linked to HIV persistence and that targeting it could be a new way to prevent reservoir growth. The study also showed that the drugs did not harm the immune response to HIV, which is important for fighting the virus. Overall, the results suggest that Jak inhibitors could be a new way to prevent HIV persistence and may be used in future curative strategies.
Researchers studied the immune response of Spodoptera exigua larvae to two different types of baculoviruses, SeNP and AcNP. Contrary to the expected shutdown of host gene expression, the larvae showed a balance of up and down-regulated genes in the first 36 hours after infection. Immune-related genes, including pattern recognition proteins and signaling pathways, as well as effectors involved in melanization were downregulated. The downregulation of immune genes was also observed in the larval gut, which affects the status of gut microorganisms responsible for growth and development. The researchers investigated if this downregulation affects the amount of gut microbiota and found an increase in bacterial load, hypothesizing it as a consequence of viral infection. Experiments showed that gut bacteria enhanced baculirus virulence and pathogenicity. The study discusses host response pathways affected by baculiruses and the role of microbiota in viral infection.
Researchers have identified a novel gene that controls the transition from meiosis to mitosis in plants, a key component of apomix, a type of asexual reproduction. By combining this gene with two others that affect meiotic processes, they created a genotype called Mi, where meiosis is replaced by mitosis. Plants with this genotype produce functional diploid gametes identical to their mother. This is a step towards understanding and engineering apomix. Apom can be separated into three components: absence or alteration of meiosis, fertilization-independent embryo development, and endosperm initiation without fertilization. In the Mi genotype, meiosis is completely replaced by mit-like division, resulting in fully penetrant apomesis. The Atspo-1 and At8 mutations lead to mit-like first meiotic division, while os1 prevents second meiotic division. Mi plants produce diploid dyads and fertile seeds. A previous apomesis case was reported in Arabidopsis, but only 0.2% of dyadules generated viable gametes. In contrast, Mi plants produce wild-type levels of viable ovules and pollen. Meiosis skipping results in mit-like division, retaining parent genetic information in gametes. All gametes tested retained mother heterozygosity for genetic markers and were genetically identical to the mother. This confirms Mi undergoes mitosis instead of meiosis without affecting subsequent processes. Meiosis replaced by mitosis doubles ploidy with each generation.
Researchers have developed a new approach to prioritize disease-causing genes by incorporating tissue-specific information into protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Current methods rely on a static picture of human PIs, which may not accurately reflect tissue-specific interactions. The study constructed tissue-specific PIs for 60 human tissues using gene expression data and found that they improve prioritization results compared to generic PIs. Integrating tissue expression data into prioritization improved accuracy, especially when the disease gene is expressed in the associated tissue. Tissue-specific PIs were constructed using gene expression data from healthy tissues and applied to prioritize genes for diseases, such as liver and brain diseases, which have different molecular landscapes. The study found that tissue-specific PIs yielded higher area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and correct gene ranking than generic PIs. The method was extended to infer disease-tissue associations by constructing tissue PIs and using them for prioritization instead of generic P. A majority (71-83%) of known disease-causing genes are expressed in the disease-associated tissue, supporting the hypothesis that a gene is likely to be expressed in a tissue for its mutation to manifest clinically. The study used PRCE algorithm for prioritization and contrasted generic and tissue PIs, finding the specific approach enhanced performance. Two methods for tissue P construction yielded different prioritization performance.
Researchers have developed a two-locus model to study the spread of insecticide resistance in mosquito species that transmit diseases such as malaria. The model allows for differential exposure of males and females to high or low concentrations of insecticide and varying selection pressures and dominance based on concentration. They applied the model to investigate sequential versus mixture use of insecticides to minimize resistance spread. Results showed mixtures were favored in 24% of runs, while 56% favored sequential use and 44 favored mixtures. Mixtures are preferred when insect effectiveness is high and exposure is low. If insect does not kill homozygous genotypes, sequential is more robust. Resistance spreads slower with mixture, but may not outperform sequential. For example, mixture lasts 5 years while individual insecticides last 3-4 years, giving 7 years lifespan for sequential. The model can identify control strategies to minimize resistance spread.

The researchers also explored delaying new insecticide deployment until another is available for a mixture with low resistance. They investigated a wider parameter space and found performance depends on insect, application, behavior, and genetics. Mixtures are favored with high effectiveness and low exposure. A metric was used to plot variables affecting time to resistance, showing separation between runs. The strategy is favored by lower exposure and higher effectiveness.

The study focused on minimizing resistance spread, not operational implications such as cost, non-vector impacts, and commercial considerations. With two or three insecticides, mixing risks everything if mixture fails.
Researchers have studied the saliva of Rhodnius neglectus, a type of kissing bug that transmits Chagas disease, to understand how it interacts with its host. They used next generation sequencing and mass spectrometry to identify proteins in the saliva. The study found 636 proteins, 73 of which were confirmed by proteomic analysis. The saliva contains serine proteases, lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors, antigen-5 metalloproteases, disins, and odorant binding proteins. These proteins are similar to those found in other triine bugs that transmit the same disease. The study improves understanding of how these bugs interact with their hosts and how they transmit disease.
Researchers used the nematode Caenorhabdis elegans as a model to study the interaction between nematodes and bacteria in soil. They exposed C. elegans to different bacteria from grassland soils and used transcription profiling to identify genes that were turned on or off in response to the bacteria. Many of these genes were involved in metabolism and immunity, suggesting they could affect nemode community dynamics in natural systems. Mutations in 21 of these genes showed they contributed to lifespan and fitness in a given bacterial environment, even though the bacteria were not a natural food source for C. elegans. The researchers also found that changes in food source, as can occur in environmental disturbance, had a large effect on gene expression with consequences for fitness. They used regression analysis to show that the degree of gene expression between bacterial environments predicted the effect of gene loss on life traits in those environments. C. elegans is not found in abundance in grass soils studied but is related to relevant nemat taxa, making it a good model for understanding nemode responses to bacteria. The study aimed to discover conserved genes in nemode-bacterial interactions, using C. elegans as a model since nemodes do not have well characterized genomes or tools. Bacteria were isolated from grass prairie soils and C. elegans exposed to different bacterial sources to model naturally occurring interactions driving changes in nemode community response to land use.
Researchers have investigated the role of gene expression noise in the development of the mammalian embryo, specifically the formation of the inner cell mass (ICM) surrounded by the trophoblast, which forms extra-embryonic structures. Using multi-scale modeling, they found that stochastic gene expression promotes cell plasticity and plays a crucial role in accurately organizing the mouse blastocyst. They discovered that asymmetry in noise levels of Cdx2 and Oct4 expression provides a means to benefit from noise-mediated plasticity while reducing detrimental effects of stochasticity. By controlling the timing and pace of cell specification, the embryo modulates plasticity, creating a window for cells to read their environment and adjust fate. These results suggest noise has a crucial role in maintaining plasticity and organizing the blastocyst.

The study supports the hypothesis that gene noise has a positive influence on TE/ICM organization and adds robustness to correct blastocyst arrangement. They found that noise in C2, Oct, or both drive cell transitions to correct expressions and organization. 2D and 3D simulations showed inherent asymmetry in the system, introducing perturbations leading to switch from less stable to more stable states. The regulatory model is plausible, but results indicate noise helps deal with positional information ambiguities. Asymmetries in noise sources, predicted and confirmed by gene quantification, promote noise plasticity without overwhelming dynamics. Mammalian fate is a gradual process, providing a window for noise to fix errors. This suggests noise improves organization.

Results are consistent with modeling that C2 noise improves organization, while Oct noise does not. With modeling predictions, they conclude that noise has the appropriate structure to promote proper organization.
Researchers have discovered that germline-encoded antibodies, which are antibodies encoded in the human genome before exposure to antigens, can bind to multiple antigens with high specificity. This is in contrast to somatically encoded antibodies, which acquire mutations after exposure to antigens and bind to a specific epitope. To investigate this, researchers computationally redesigned antibodies encoded by a common germl gene to bind multiple antigens. Using the Rosetta algorithm, they predicted sequences for the entire heavy chain region, including framework and complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). The predicted sequences matched germl-encoded sequences closely, revealing residues enabling polyspecific binding. In contrast, designing antibodies to bind a single antigen returned a sequence similar to mature sequence, mimicking natural maturation. The study demonstrates Rosetta captures aspects of antibody-antigen recognition. The variable region CDR3 often mediates specificity, but key positions in germl-encoded CDR, CDR, and immunoglobulin framework contribute to polyspecificity. Designing antibodies to bind multiple antigens may allow rational design of polyspecific antibodies for diverse epitope binding. Researchers used Rosetta to design sequences optimal for interactions with 1) multiple antigens and 2) a single antigen. Without prior knowledge of germl or mature sequences, multi-state design recovered sequences similar to those encoded by inferred germl. Sets of mature-antigen complexes from common germl VH were input into Rosetta, recovering optimal sequence to bind all antigens simultaneously. Sequences were flexible, accommodating diverse conformation states. This approach considers multiple conformations, predicting flexible sequences binding multiple antigens. Harlan and colleagues found polyspecific encoded by germl sequences. The study compares germl and mature sequences optimized through evolution and maturation with predicted by Rosetta function on co-crystallized complexes. The approach predicts germl and mature in silico without prior knowledge, a step towards rational design.
Locusts exhibit two distinct behavioral phases: solitar and gregar. Solitar individuals are repelled by other locusts, while gregar insects are attracted to conspecifics and form large aggregations such as hopper bands. Experiments at the individual level have shown how crowding biases towards the gregar form. To understand hopper band formation, we study phase change at the collective level. A partial integrodifferential model is constructed to incorporate interplay between phase and movement at individual level to predict hopper dynamics at population. Stability analysis reveals conditions for an outbreak, characterized by large transition to gregar phase. The model enables quantification of temporal dynamics of each phase, proportion of population that will gregarize and time for this to occur. Numerical simulations describe aggregation structure and reveal transient clumps of gregar insects. Predictions suggest possible biological experiments.

The problem is addressed via mathematical modeling to quantify collective gregar, a key process before destructive locust outbreak. A continuum model is constructed for phase interacting gregar and solitar locs. Dynamics are classified in wide parameter space, challenging by numerical alone. In low densities, phases are uniformly spread and solitar dominates. For large populations, a dense gregar patch emerges, solitar becomes scarce. Clustering at high densities is hop band onset. Analysis calculates critical density for gregar forms and ratio gregar to solitar. Behavioral is plastic and dependent on density: sparse, gregar to solitar and vice versa. Gregar dominates large numbers gather, potentially outbreak. This dependence is summarized. Analysis yields unstable spacing from number of modes. Simulations illustrate rapid transitions once gregar initiated. Dense gregar packs form, sweep sol in vicinity.
Researchers have studied the process of membrane fusion in flaviviruses, a type of virus that causes diseases such as tick-borne encephalitis. They focused on the protein E, which mediates fusion at acidic pH, changing from a dimer to trimer with a hair-like structure. By exposing virions to alkaline instead of acidic pH, they trapped the virus in an intermediate state where dimers dissociate and interact with membranes without merging. Further treatment to low pH led to fusion, suggesting these monomers are an elusive intermediate to convert prefusion dimer to postfusion trimer. Using non-physiological conditions, they dissected the flavivirus process and identified two steps: insertion of multiple E monomers precedes formation of hair-like trimers. This sequence provides new insights into viral membrane fusion process.
Researchers have found that the rate of plant extinctions in the Cape of South Africa, a global biodiversity hotspot, is higher than expected and cannot be explained by simple traits such as body size, fecundity, and geographic range. By comparing the Red List data for the British and South African floras, they discovered that the taxonomic distribution of extinction risk differs between regions. Using a comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the Cape, they revealed a phylogenetic signal in the distribution of plant extinctions, but most threatened species cluster at the tips of the phylogeny, opposite to trends in mammals. Analyzing the distribution of threatened species across 11 exemplar clades, they suggest speciation best explains the phylogenetic structure of extinctions in plants of the Cape. The results show that extinction risk is higher for young and fast-evolving plant lineages and cannot be explained by correlations with simple biological traits. Critically, the most vulnerable species are marching towards extinction at a rapid pace, independently from anthropogenic effects. The findings have implications for conservation and cast doubt on the utility of Red List criteria for regions with rapid speciation, aiming to preserve the tree-of-life.
Researchers have identified two new proteins, Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (TK) and Vav, that interact with the immune receptor Dectin-1 to help phagocytose the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Dect-1 is a key receptor in the innate immune system that helps fight fungal infections. TK and Vav are recruited to phagocytic cups containing C. albicans yeast or hyphae, but not to mature phagosomes. They localize to the cuff surrounding hypha, while Dect-1 lines the phagosome. TK and V colocalize with lipid (3,4,5)P3 and F-act at the phocytic cup, but not diacylglycerol (DAG) which marks mature phagomal membranes. Using a TK inhibitor, researchers found that TK contributes to DAG synthesis at the phocytic cup and recruitment of PK. TK or V-deficient macrophages have a defect in C. alb phocytosis. Bone marrow macrophages lacking TK or V1 show reduced C. alb uptake, similar to Dect-1 deficient cells. TK or V-deficient mice are more susceptible to systemic C infection than wild-type mice.
Rift Valley fever (RV) is a vector-borne disease affecting ruminants and humans. Madagascar was heavily affected by RV in 2008-2009, with a large and heterogeneous spread of the disease. To optimize available resources for RV surveillance in Madagascar, identifying at-risk environments is essential. This study aimed to identify environmental factors favorable to RV transmission in cattle and humans, and human behaviors favoring human infections in Malag contexts. Environmental factors were characterized using Multiple Factor Analysis (FA), and cattle and human serological data analyzed using Generalized Mixed Models. Cattle and human seroprevalence were associated with humid environments (p<0.001) and high cattle density (p<0.01, OR=2.6). Frequent contact with raw milk contributed to human infection (OR=1.6). The study highlighted eastern, western, and northwestern parts as high-risk for RV transmission in cattle. An integrated analysis of environmental and human datasets provided new insights on RV transmission patterns in Madagascar. The association between serrevalence, humid, and cattle density suggests conitant vector and direct transmissions are critical for RV enzotic transmission. In at-risk environments, western, northwestern, and eastern areas, suitable Cx Anopheles mosquitoes vector transmission occurs in cattle and humans.
Researchers studied how a type of protein called a prion, which is a self-propagating protein conformation, is transmitted between identical and non-identical proteins, such as between homologous proteins from different species. They used a yeast Rq1/PIN-based system to explore the nature of transmission barriers. The R1 prion, a common in wild and laboratory yeast strains, facilitates the appearance of other prions. R1's pr domain has four Q-rich regions. The study found that R1 has multiple prion determinants that can independently drive amyloid formation in vitro and transmit the PIN prion state in vivo. Analysis of PIN transmission between R1 fragments with different pr determinants showed that one Q-rich region is required and sufficient for transmission, but transmissions are impeded by barriers of different strength. The existence of barriers in the absence of amino mismatches in regions indicates that multiple pr domains determinants act cooperatively to attain the pr conformation, and transmission is determined by this fold.

The PIN pr domain is located in the Q-rich C-terminus, but one Q region in R1 is not essential for maintenance of the pr state, suggesting R1 pr carries multiple determinants capable of supporting the pr state. Bacterially expressed R1 fragments lacking three of four Q regions were tested for propensity to form amyloid in vitro. Q1's inability to maintain pr state is not unexpected, as Q1 region lacks oligopeptide repeats and residues hypothesized to facilitate fragmentation of amy aggregates. Pr strains have distinct pr conformations of same protein, despite amino sequence, have transmission barriers. In vitro and genetic data indicate large pr domains define differences. PIN stands out as found in industrial and pathogenic isolates, while PSI and URE are common in laboratory.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze genetic data from multiple individuals using a technique called deep learning, a type of machine learning. This method uses multiple layers of neural networks to learn from input data, such as summary statistics, to output genetic parameters of interest. They applied this approach to infer natural selection and population history in Drosila melanogaster, a fruit fly species. The method can separate demographic and selection factors without sequential steps, which is important as selection can confound demographic analysis. Analysis of 197 Drosilaogaster genomes from Zambia found regions of the genome with hard sweeps, soft, and balancing selection. Sweeps and balancing occur more frequently closer to the center of chromosomes. Demographic inference suggests previously estimated bottlenecks for Dilaogaster are too extreme. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning for population analysis, which is still in its infancy. Deep learning can distinguish informative from uninformative statistics and accommodate complex models. It provides a complimentary approach to existing likelihood-free inference in genetics. Other methods, such as ABC and SVM, can also be used. It is unclear which would produce most accurate results. Deep can be used to classify regions as neutral or selected for demographic inference.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes disrupt the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway by impairing localization and deubiquination of FANCD2. Persistent expression of high-risk HPV oncogenes is necessary for the development of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. Research shows that E6/E7-expressing cells are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agent cisplatin and have defects in repairing interstrand crosslinks (ICL). The study elucidates how E/E7 attenuates the FA DNA repair pathway. E7 activates the pathway by increasing FAN2 monoubiquination and foci formation, but inhibits completion of repair by multiple mechanisms. E7 impairs FAN localization with double-strand breaks (DSB), hindering downstream protein Rad51 recruitment to DS in E cells. Further, E expression delays FAN deubiquination, a process for effective ICL repair. Delayed FAN deubination is associated with chromatin retention ofAN, hindering US1 deubiquinating activity and persistently activated ATR/CHK-1/p565AN signaling. E-mediated p53 degradation does not hamper cell cycle processAN modifications but abrogates repair by disruptingAN deubination. E reduces and foci formation of Pal2, a repair protein downstreamAN.
In the Southern Chiapas region of Mexico, a major onchocerciasis focus in Latin America, 559 communities have undergone semi-annual ivermect treatment since 1998. In 50 communities, iverectin frequency shifted to twice a year in 2003, and an additional 113 communities were added to the quarterly regimen in 2009 to achieve rapid suppression. Epidemiological and entomological assessments were conducted in 6 sentinel communities with 2 rounds of iverectin per year and 3 extra-sent with 4 rounds per year. No Simulium ochum l collected in 201 were found to contain parasite DNA by PCR-ELISA, with an upper 95% confidence interval of 0.06/2,000 examined. Serological testing on 4,230 children under 5 revealed 2/4,230 exposed (0.05%). These findings meet the criteria for transmission interruption developed by the international community. The Onchercias Elimination Program aims to eliminate ocular morbidity and transmission in 13 foci in Latin America. The Southern Chiapas population (114,024) is 21% of the Americas at-risk population. Since 1990, onchercias control relied on iverect distribution to at-risk communities. Annual mass iverect began 1994, modified to 6 months in 1998. In Chiapas, iverect started 199, initially for cases, then all eligible in hyperemic and hypoemic 1994, 25% hypoemic 1995-7. 22 rounds >85% eligible have been provided over 11 years, coverage >85 every year 199-201.
Listeria monocytogen is a Gram-positive facultative intracellular pathogen that invades mammalian cells and escapes from membrane-bound vacuoles to replicate within the host cytos. A transcription activator PrA regulates gene products for intracellular growth and bacterial spread. However, the signal that activates PrA has not been defined. Researchers found that L monocytogen secretes a small peptide pherone, pA, which enhances escape from host vacoles and may facilitate PrA activation. pA is generated via proteolytic processing of P lipoprotein signal. P lipop is dispensable for pathogenesis, but bacteria lacking pA are attenuated for virulence in mice and have reduced escape efficiency from vacoles of nonphagocytic cells. Mutating PrA restores virulence and eliminates need for pA signaling. Experimental evidence suggests pA may signal monocogen presence within vacole, stimulating expression of products contributing to escape and PrA activation for growth.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Vibrio cholera, which causes cholera, adapts to the hostile environment of the human intestines during infection. They used a technique called whole-genome transposon sequencing (T-seq) to compare the genes required for colonization in mice with and without antioxidant treatment, N-acetyl cystine. The results showed that mutants of the methyl-directed repair system, such as MutS, had a significant advantage in untreated, ROS-rich mice but not in N-treated mice. Further analysis suggested that accumulation of catalase-producing and rugose variants in N- mice was the cause of Mut mutant enrichment by oxidative stress during infection. Rugose variants could revert to smooth colonies in aerobic in vitro. The mutation rate of wildtype colonized in N- mice was higher than in N+ mice. These findings support a paradigm that Vibrio employs a temporal strategy to battle ROS during infection, resulting in enriched phenotypes.
Researchers studied the role of the Mlh3 protein in baker's yeast in meiotic recombination and mismatch repair (MMR). They analyzed 60 new Mlh alleles, five of which disrupted MMR and one that specifically disrupted meiotic crossing over. The researchers purified and characterized two representatives of each class, Mlh-32 (MR+, crossover-) and Mlh-45 (MR-, crossover+). Both displayed wild-type endonuc activities in vitro. The M2sh complex, which acts with Mlh in MMR, stimulated the endon activity of Mlh-32 but not Mlh-45, suggesting M-45 is defective in M interactions. Whole-genome recombination maps were constructed for wild-type, M+ crossover, M- crossover, endonuc defective and Mlh mutants in S288/Y789 background. Compared to wild-type, all Mlh mutants showed increases in non-crossover events, consistent with recombination intermediates being resolved through alternative pathways. This study provides a structure-function map for Mlh and highlights the importance of protein-protein interactions regulating Mlh's enzymatic activity. It also shows how meiotic components can alter the fate of meiotic recombination intermediates, providing insights into how meiotic pathways are regulated.
Researchers have found that the structure of a host population plays a significant role in the reversal of resistance to antibiotics after treatment is stopped. When antibiotics are used to treat diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, Staphylococcus aureus, or gonorrhea, resistance levels increase, leading to a switch to new drugs and discontinuation of older ones. However, resistance often persists or declines slowly. This is often attributed to the low fitness cost of resistance in the absence of the drug. The study shows that host heterogeneity in the number of contacts also affects reversion dynamics. During treatment, host structure leads to non-random distribution of resistant strains among the population, and after drug discontinuation, it affects competition, resulting in mitigation of fitness advantages. As a result, reversion rate and probability are lower on the population level after treatment is stopped. Simulations show the impact of heterogeneity is largest in biologically plausible range when fitness costs are small. 

The study confirms contact heterogeneity lowers reversion probability even when a substantial pathogen population is sensitive when treatment is stopped. Large differences between sensitive and resistant strains result in non-trivial distribution of infections over the network, influencing reversion once treatment is stopped. Costs of resistance are generally small for many path-drug combinations, making the biologically relevant range where effects of heterogeneity are largest. The range of fitness values affecting reversion probability shifts closer to 1 with system size. During treatment, resistant infections increase while sensitive decline. Once resistant has risen to a level, treatment is stopped, and dynamics are governed by wild-type and resistant competition in absence. Modulating host structure on reversion is strongest in biologically when differences are small. This framework allows studying disease emergence during treatment and competition between strains after is discontinued.
Researchers studied how genetic variations in the human genome, known as copy number variants (CNVs), contribute to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). They used fruit flies (Drosophila) as a model to examine interactions between genes affected by CNVs in individuals with autism. The study found that pairs of genes affected by the same CNV showed synergistic effects, meaning their combined effect was greater than the sum of individual effects. This was observed in three out of four CNVs with complete ortholog relationships. Changes in Doph genes resulted in similar neurological defects to those previously reported in Doph models of ASD variants. The study suggests that combined effects of multiple genes contribute to autism, rather than a single gene. This is supported by the fact that individuals with autism often have multiple CNVs affecting different genes. The researchers used Doph as an in vivo system to examine interactions between genes implicated in autism, as it is a tractable and high-throughput model. They modeled effects of gene changes on Doph neurological readouts using sets of genes from multigen de CNVs identified in patients with autism. The study focused on Doph orthologs of genes affected by CN whose products participate in ASD networks and neural functioning. Many CNs affect genes in the same pathway, and 33% affect multiple genes interacting within that pathway, suggesting combined copy change contributes to autistic phenotypes. The study illustrates how synergistic effects from structural variation contribute to disease.
Research has shown that CD8 T cells play a key role in the development of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) during Plasmodium berghei AN infection in C57/6 mice. However, the mechanisms through which they mediate their pathogenic activity during infection are not well understood. This study used intravital two-photon microscopy and flow cytometry to examine brain-infiltrating T cells in mice infected with ECM-inducing (P berg AN) and non-inducing ( berg NK) infections. Results showed that T cells accumulated in the perascular spaces of the brain during both infections, but displayed arrested behavior specifically during berg AN infection. T cells formed long-term interactions with CXCR-bearing antigen-presenting cells in the brain during AN infection, but depletion of these cells did not prevent ECM development. Pathogenic T cells localized with apoptotic cells expressing CD31, a marker of endothelial cells, but apoptosis was rare and did not result in loss of vasculature or disruption. The study found that arrest of T in perascular compartments is a signature of ECM-inducing infection and suggests an important role in ECM development.
A study was conducted in Vih County, Kenya to determine the burden of Tungis, a parasitic disease caused by the sand flea Tungaans, also known as jigger. The study was a cross-sectional and involved 437 participants aged 5 and above from 21 villages in 3 sublocations. The overall prevalence of Tungis was 21.5% (95% CI 17.7-25.3%). The disease was more common in areas with low economic status, indicated by a monthly income of Ksh 100 or less, earthen floor, lack of toilet facilities, age 14 or less, no use of closed footwear, and resting inside the house. Tungis is a significant problem in V County due to the economic status of the affected. Factors contributing to the disease include poverty. The study suggests the need for cost-effective and accessible strategies to control Tungis. Tung is endemic in tropical and subtropical countries, with unknown global burden. In Kenya, studies have reported prevalence between 19-40%. Children and the elderly bear the brunt of infection. Tung is a neglected disease, not recognized by WHO, affecting communities in poverty, poor housing, sanitation, and contact with domestic animals. Mapping of neglected diseases has improved, but more is needed for Tungis to understand affected communities and magnitude. The study found no spatial autocorrelation, indicating Tis prevalence may be random.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the interaction between auxin and cytokinin hormones in Arabidopsis root patterning. The model considers the regulation of auxin transporters by aux and cytokinin in a spatial context, taking into account cell shape and polarity and cell walls. Analysis shows that a cytokinin pattern generated by diffusion is unlikely and not required for auxin patterning. Instead, aux-dependent modifications of cytokinin response allow necessary feedback, amplifying and stabilizing aux maximum. The model highlights the importance of auxin efflux regulation for robustness and predicts a role of AUX and LAX2 aux influx transporters in vascular patterning. Local PIN polarisation generates an aux flux stabilizing accumulation in the xylem axis and provides a mechanism for aux to accumulate in xylem-pericycle cells, an early step in lateral root initiation. Pericycle cells opposite xyle poles compete for aux accumulation, consistent with lateral roots not initiated opposite each other.

The model extends a previous longitudinal aux transport model, considering regulation of transport under aux and cytokinin control. It identifies a novel role for aux influx and a connection between subcell polarity and tissue robustness. Insights into transverse aux transport will aid three-dimensional models of root growth in Arabidopsis. Cytokinin distribution is sufficient to activate PIN, resulting in aux transport to the xyle axis and patterning; a gradient around cytok biosynthesis sites is not required and unlikely. Simulations show the mutually inhibitory aux-cytokin loop maintains aux in the xyle axis. However, aux becomes confined to protoxyle, while simulations show sustained aux throughout the xyle axis. PIN localisation is a factor in aux distribution and flux.
Researchers have identified a key player in the process by which migratory locusts change their behavior in response to their environment. A protein called CRE-B acts as a mediator in a signaling pathway involving a neuropeptide (NPF) and nitric oxide (NO) that regulates locomotor activity between solitary and gregarious phases. CRE-B directly activates the expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by interacting with its promoter region. Phosphorylation of serine 110 on CRE-B changes in response to population density and is controlled by N2. The involvement of CRE-B in N2-regulated locomotor plasticity is confirmed by RNA interference and behavioral assay. Protein kinase A transmits the effects of N2 on CRE-B phosphorylation and OS transcription. The study reveals a precise cascade underlying environment-induced behavioral plasticity.
Researchers studied the role of the zinc-finger protein Zelda (Z) in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Zelda plays a key role in the transcriptional activation of genes involved in sex determination, patterning, and other early developmental processes. To understand its mechanisms and targets, the researchers used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (IP-Seq) to map regions bound by Zelda before, during, and after the maternal-to-zyotic transition (MT). They found thousands of regions bound by Zelda in cycle 8 embryos, most of which remain through cycle 14. Expectedly, early Zelda-bound regions include promoters and enhancers of genes transcribed at this stage. However, they also observed Zelda bound to promoters of genes whose transcription does not occur until MT, and thousands of enhancers bound by transcription factors that regulate gene activation during MT. The association between Zelda binding and MT is strong that Zelda can identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with specificity. This suggests Zelda not only regulates earliest transcription but also plays a role in activating genome at MT.
Researchers have investigated the timing of protein-protein interactions (PPI) in the context of the circadian clock, a fundamental cellular mechanism regulating physiological processes with a 24-hour cycle. They identified 109 novel PIs among circadian proteins using a yeast-two-hybrid approach, including the interaction of phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL, which resulted in BM1 destabilization. A dynamic circadian P network was constructed predicting P timing using circadian data, and systematic circadian phenotyping (RNAi and overexpression) suggested crucial roles for involved components in interactions. Analysis of a global network in liver revealed interacting proteins expressed at similar times, likely restricting interactions to specific phases. Circadian PIs were found to connect many cellular processes, such as signal transduction and cell cycle, contributing to temporal organization in an unprecedented manner.

A comprehensive view of circadian P dynamics was provided, distinct from previous studies focusing on specific processes or phases. Novel PIs included modulators of CLOCK/BMAL function, indicating phosphatase 1's role in regulating BM1 abundance. The network was extended with validated interactions from literature, some essential for normal circadian dynamics. Timing of gene expression, protein interactions, and post-translational modifications are essential for sustaining circadian rhythms. The study highlights the importance of precisely timed PIs for the circadian clock, but emphasizes the need for a comprehensive view of PIs among circadian proteins and their dynamics. The extent of regulation of circadian processes via time-dependent PIs is largely unknown.
Researchers have solved the three-dimensional structure of ABA-1, a repeating unit of the nematode protein allergen (NPA) from Ascaris su, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The protein has a novel seven-helical fold with a central helix and two four-hel bundles on either side. Two discrete hydrophobic ligand-binding pockets are found in the N-terminal and C-terminal bundles, and amino acid chains affected by ligand (fatty acid) binding were identified. Recombinant A-1 contains tightly-bound ligand of bacterial origin in one of its binding sites. This is the first post-translationally processed unit of a tandemly repetitive polyprotein to be structurally characterized from any source and belongs to a new class. Nematodes have no counterparts in vertebrates, making them potential targets for drug or immunological intervention. Ascar and filarial nemat parasites have a simplified array of N units with predominantly identical or similar amino sequences, unlike other nematodes and free-living species. NAs are immunodominant and allergenic in nemode infections, with no consensus features making a protein more or less likely to be allergenic. Several disease-causing nemodes express NAs associated with strong immune responses and hypersensitivities. The structure of ABA-1 may contribute to elucidation of a consensus for infection-associated allergens. NAs have affinity for pharmacologically lipids or precursors, suggesting sequestration or delivery may be a mechanism to subvert host response, making them relevant to parasitology and protein science.
Between 1998 and 2008, there were 39,677 reported cases of ciguatera poisoning in 17 Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PITCs), with a mean annual incidence of 194 cases per 100,000 people. This is a 60% increase from the 104 cases per 100,000 reported between 1973 and 1983. Accounting for underreporting, an estimated 500,000 Pacific islanders may have suffered from cigater in the last 35 years. Ciguater is a tropical disease caused by consuming coral fish contaminated with cigatoxin, a toxin produced by dinoflagates and cyanobacteria. Symptoms include acute neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac issues, and in some cases, chronic neuro symptoms lasting weeks to months. The disease is often underdiagnosed and underreported, with only 2-10% of cases reported to health authorities. Cigu is a major public health concern, expected to increase with environmental changes.
Researchers studied the impact of benznazole treatment on CD4CD+8 T cells in chronic Chagas disease patients. Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that persists in the body and impairs the immune system. CD4CD8 T cells are a type of immune cell that expands in chronic Chagas patients, but their role is not well understood. The study included 38 patients with chronic Chagas, 20 asymptomatic and 18 symptomatic, and 12 healthy donors. Blood cells were stimulated with T cruzi antigens to analyze cytokine and cytotoxic molecule production by CD4CD T before and after benidazole treatment. Expression and co-expression of inhibitory receptors in patients after treatment were studied using flow cytometry. CD4CD T frequency was higher in Chagas patients than healthy donors, with higher CD4CDlowCDhigh ratio. CD T from patients expressed co-expressed inhibitory receptors in proportion to disease severity. Benidazole reduced CD frequency and CD ratio, decreased inhibitory co-expression, and enhanced multifunctional capacity of CD T. After treatment, T antigen-specific CD T expressing IL-2 and TN-α increased. CD T could control T infection, producing effector molecules. Benidazole partially reversed exhaustion caused by T in these cells, improving T antigen CD T response.
Researchers have identified Arabidopsis thaliana phosphoinide-specific phospholipase 2 (AtPLC2) as the primary enzyme responsible for phosphoinide metabolism and its role in seedling growth and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. Lipid profiling of multiple PLC mutants showed increased levels of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, indicating impaired phosphide metabolic pathway. PLC2 displayed distinct tissue expression and localization at the plasma membrane in different cell types where phosphide signaling occurs. Seedlings of PLC-1 mutant showed growth defects complemented by heterologous expression of PLC, suggesting phosphide-specific phospholase activity by PLC is required for seed growth. The PLC-1 mutant also showed hypersensitive response to ER stress with changes in phenotypes and gene profiles. The study revealed primary enzyme in phosphide metabolism, its involvement in seedling and emerging link between phosphide and ER response. 

The endoplasmic reticulum is a major site of phosphid biosynthesis, and phosphid signaling may be associated with ER function. Involvement of lipid in stress response is emerging in plants. The study isolated and analyzed mutants of multiple PLC forms in Arabid. Lipid profiling phosphides in mutants showed PLC is primary PI-PL in phosphide metabolism. Plants may have unique mechanism cross-talk between ER and plasma to cope with stress. Conclusion, PLC is major PIPL in phosphide and seedling in Arab, important for ER tolerance, suggesting link phosphide signaling and ER response.
Researchers challenge the assumption that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level, excluding emergence at the macro level. They use a measure called intrinsic-effect power-integrated (Φ) to show that a macro level can "beat" the micro. Systems were evaluated across different spatial and temporal scales by considering all possible black boxes, which are elements of one or more micro elements over one or more updates. Cause power was based on inputs and outputs of the boxes, ignoring internal elements that support their input-output function. Results show black elements can have more inputs and outputs than micro elements, revealing emergence of high-order mechanisms and constraints not apparent at micro. A macro system can have higher Φ than its constituents with more mechanisms that are interconnected. For a system, local maxima of Φ can be identified across spatiotemporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a biological system, the Boolean model of fission-yeast cell, which identifies local max during its biological function. These max correspond to levels of organization where emergent cause properties come into focus, providing a point for scientific inquiries.

Intrinsic power is used to quantify causal power and examples of black macro systems with higher power than micro are shown. This refutes the assumption that power resides exclusively at micro. Evaluating power across spatiemp scales shows local max of power, which integrated decreases to zero. Max capture emergent roles of macro elements, corresponding to system descriptions as NOR, OR, AND, or MAJ elements. Reduction assumes power resides with micro, but power is evaluated explicitly as intrinsic and spatiemp levels where properties emerge. A framework to evaluate power and properties of a black system is proposed. Emergent properties include increase power and relationships between elements that become apparent at macro. Intrinsic and counterfactual framework is used to quantify power and mechanisms at micro and black levels.
Researchers have investigated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which play a crucial role in cell adaptation to the environment but can also cause damage under conditions of hypoxia/reoxygenation leading to various diseases. To understand this, they extended a model of complex III to account for electron transport, proton translocation, transmembrane electrochemical potential, TCA reactions, and substrate transport. Measurements of electron flux in rat mitochondria fueled by succinate, pyruvate, and malate, and dynamics of NAD reduction by reverse transport from succinate through complex I were analyzed. The model fitting provided insight into the formation of free radicals that transfer unpaired electrons to oxygen, producing superoxide and initiating ROS. Analysis revealed association of ROS with specific electron transporters and their combinations in complexes I and III. The phenomenon of bistability in complex III was found to be valid for the whole chain. Conditions for switching to a state with high free radicals in III were predicted and confirmed. These findings provide new insight into ROS production mechanisms in the chain.
Researchers have studied how motor proteins transport cargo within cells, which is essential for various cellular functions. Motor proteins convert chemical energy into kinetic energy, enabling unidirectional and bidirectional transport of cargo over long distances. Disruptions in this process, caused by mutations altering motor characteristics, lead to neurodegenerative diseases. For example, phosphorylation of the kines motor domain at serine residue is linked to Huntington's disease. A study on phosphorylated phosphim ser residues showed lowered motor stalling forces. This article investigates the effects of similar mutations on transport properties of cargo carried by wild-type and mutant motors. Results show mutants with altered stalling forces determine average velocity and run-length, even outnumbered by wild-type motors. Mutants gain advantage and increase run-length when load is near mutant stalling or multiple of stalling force. A semi-analytical method was developed to analyze transport by multiple motors of types, determining transition rates between configurations and computing biologically relevant quantities like velocity and run-length without Monte Carlo simulations. This method can model single parameter alterations and deduce effects on transport by multiple motors.
Researchers investigated the role of the CAC1 gene in operant learning, a type of learning that involves selecting and adapting behavioral strategies to achieve a goal. They studied mice with a genetic modification that impairs learning, a knockout of the CnaC1 gene, which codes for a subunit of high-voltage calcium channels. These channels are crucial for synaptic plasticity and have been linked to learning and psychiatric disorders. The study used a detailed analysis of individual learning strategies and computational models to show that Cna1 knockout does not impair learning in general, but affects how mice adapt to reward. Most knockout mice increased reward by adapting to outcome, while controls followed the intended cue-association rule. This suggests a specific role of the gene in learning and highlights the importance of examining behavioral strategies. The results may have implications for treating psychiatric disorders.
Researchers studied how Wolbachia infections in Aedes aegypt mosquitoes respond to cyclical heat stress. Aedes aegpt mosquitoes infected with Wolbach are being released to suppress arboviruses worldwide, but their ability to invade and persist depends on environmental conditions. The study reared Ae aegypt larvae with different types of Wolbach (Mel, wMelB, and wMel-CLA) under diurnal temperatures. Results showed that rearing Mel and Mel-CLA-infected larvae at 26-37°C reduced cytoplasmic incompatibility, a reproductive manipulation by Wolbach, and decreased Wolbach density in adults. Mel and Mel-CLA infections were not transmitted to the next generation when exposed to 26-37°C across life stages. In contrast, wB infection maintained high density, exhibited cytoplasm incompat, and transmitted to offspring with high fidelity under this temperature. These findings have implications for Wolbach interventions across environments and highlight temperature control in rearing.
Researchers studied the presence of adenoviruses in the gastrointestinal tracts of non-human primates, including great apes and macaques. They found that these animals shed substantial quantities of infectious adeniruses in their stools, with frequencies comparable to those reported in humans. The team purified and sequenced 30 adeniruses from apes and 3 adenir from macques, and analyzed them with 22 adenirus genomes from GenBank. The results showed that ape adeniruses belonged to human adenirus species B, C, and E, with evidence of intraspecies recombination and high phylogenetic relatedness across primate hosts. This suggests cross-species transmission has occurred in the history of B and E viruses. The high asymptomatic shedding of adenirus in non-human primates and zoonotic transmissions warrant caution for primate handling and housing. The presence of persistent latent adenirus in the gut should be considered in human and non-primate studies with adenirus vectors.
Researchers have investigated the process of unwrapping the outer helical turn of nucleosomal DNA, a fundamental to various cellular processes. Nucleosomes are protein-DNA complexes where 146-147 base pairs of DNA wrap 1.75 times around a histone core. To function, nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped, but the details of this process at an atomic level were not well understood. Using molecular simulation with enhanced sampling, the researchers calculated the free profiles for unwrapping the outerhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA, finding a free energy change of 11.5 kcal/mol, consistent with single molecule experiments. The simulation revealed various conformation states, indicating multiple paths to unwrapping but a dominant asymmetric one. Unwrapping started at one end with 5 base pairs, then 5 at the same end with increased energy, then at the other end with 10 pairs unwrapped. Further unwrapping 15 pairs, unwrapped at one end then the other to complete unwr the turn. This provides insight into nucleosome construction, disruption, and repositioning, ongoing cellular processes.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which the protein Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) protects cells from damage caused by oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can damage cell membranes, and lysosomes are particularly vulnerable because they require a stable acidic environment to function. Apo, an extracellular protein with antioxidant properties, is secreted by cells in the nervous system, such as astrocytes, to help neurons cope with stress. The role of Apo is known at the cellular and organism level, but its mechanism was unknown. The study analyzed Apo's intracellular traffic and role in lysosomal homeostasis under oxidative stress. Apo is endocytosed and targeted to vulnerable lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner, and is functionally stable in acidic environment. Its presence is necessary and sufficient for lysosomes to recover from oxidation-induced alkalinization in astrocytes and neurons, by preventing membrane permeabilization. Two lysosomal processes, myelin phagocytosis by astrocytes and neurodegeneration-triggered autagy in Drosila model, require Apo-related lipocalins. Results uncover a new function of Apo, a member of conserved gene family, and set lipoprotein regulation of lysosomal integrity as a mechanism critical for neurodegenerative diseases.
Researchers studied the biology and susceptibility of Phlebotus orientalis sandflies to Leishmania donovani, the parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis in East Africa. Two colonies of P. orientalis from different locations in Ethiopia were examined: a non-endemic site in the lowlands of Melka Wer and an endemic area in the highlands of Addis Zemen. Significant differences in life cycle parameters were found between the two colonies, including requirements for larval food and humidity during pupation. However, genetic analysis using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAP) and DNA sequencing of cytB and COI genes showed no genetic differences between the two colonies. Hybrid offspring had higher fecundity than the parental colonies. Susceptibility of P. orient to L. donani was studied through experimental infections. Even the lowest infective dose (2,103 per ml) was sufficient for successful establishment of L. donani infections in 50% of P. orient females. Using higher infective doses, infection rates were 90% for both colonies. Leish development in P. orient was fast, with metacyclic promastigotes in the thoracic midgut and colonization of the stomal valve by haptads recorded in P. orient females by five days post-feeding. Both MW and AZ colonies of P. orient were highly susceptible to Ethiopian L. donani strains. The average blood-meals taken by P orient females were about 0.7 µl, the infective at lowest dose was one or two L. donastigotes per sand-meal. Development of L donani was similar in P orient colonies, hence the absence of visceral leishiasis in non-endemic Mel Wer cannot be attributed to susceptibility local P orient populations to donani.
A study was conducted to quantify the quality of life and disability of patients with advanced schistosomiasis japonica in a schistosoma japon-haemic county in the People's Republic of China. A total of 506 candidates were screened, and 215 cases were confirmed with advanced schosmias japonica. Most patients reported impairments in at least one health dimension, such as pain or discomfort (90.7%), usual activities (87.9%), and anxiety or depression (80.9%). The disability weight (DW) was 0.447, and age-specific DW ranged from 0.378 among individuals aged 30-44 to 0.510 among the elderly ≥60. DW was associated with loss of work capacity, psychological abnormality, ascites, and hepatitis B virus, while splenectomy and albumin were protective for quality of life. These patient-preference estimates provide data for revision of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study and evidence-based decision-making in China's schosmiasis control program.
African Trypanosomias, also known as sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in animals, are prevalent parasitic diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. They are caused by the bite of tset flies infected with Trypanosoma brucei protozoa, specifically T. b. gambense in West and Central Africa and T. rhodesense in East and Southern Africa. A retrospective study used national census data from 1999 to estimate population vulnerability and disability in Kenya's tse belts, where tse flies are vectors for T. rhense and other trypan agents. The study found that tse belts were associated with increased disability, both directly through bites causing human infection and indirectly by reducing agricultural production due to diseased livestock, leading to nutritional deficiencies and poverty. Incorporating census data is a promising tool for future surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa. The combined burdens of human and animal trypanosomias and agricultural losses contribute to disability in tse-infested areas.
Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) is a compound that induces cell differentiation and HIV production in chronically infected cells, but its mechanism of action was not well understood. Researchers found that HM activates the PI3/Akt pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of HEXIM protein, which releases active transcription elongation factor (PTEF) from its inactive complex with 7 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). As a result, PF is recruited to the HIV promoter to stimulate transcription and production. Despite HM presence, released PF rapidly reassembles with 7snRNA and HEXIM. A mutant HEX protein that cannot be phosphorylated and released via PI/Akt pathway antagonizes HM-induced viral production. Studies reveal how HM targets cellular factor PF for HIV reactivation and suggest modifications in equilibrium between active and inactive PF contribute to cell differentiation.
Researchers have identified a link between the Leishmania virus (LRV) and aggressive forms of cutaneous leishiasis (CL), which can lead to mucosal (ML) or disseminated cutaneous leishias (DCL). These complications occur when the infection spreads from a primary skin lesion caused by a Leish-infected sand fly to secondary sites, causing significant morbidity and inflammation. LRV is found in Leish strains L. guyensis, causing elevated parasitemia, hyperinflammation, and disease exacerbation. To study this relationship and LRV distribution in other Leish strains, improved detection and quantitation methods are needed, independent of viral sequence knowledge. This study presents techniques, including an anti-dRNA monoclonal antibody J, for specific and quantitative recognition of dsRNA in sequence-independent fashion. Applications include immunofluorescence, ELISA, and dot blot, complementing nucleic acid purification and real-time PCR. Methods were evaluated and demonstrated LRV detection by J in several strains, patient sample, and infected mice biopsies. LRV is recognized by host Toll-like receptor TLR, exacerbating disease in murine models. Leish has a life cycle, promastigote in sand fly midgut, amastote in mammalian macrophage. LRV was tested on isolated Leish from L brazensis patient, later typed as L. brazensis. The approach was applied on catalogued isolates, fresh L braz sample, and murine biops, showing ease of use for field application. The technique has potential for predicting LRV-related leish dissemination risk.
Enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escheria coli (EPEC and EHE) are closely related pathogens that attach to intestinal epithelial cells, efface microvilli, and promote cytoskeletal rearrangements into protrusions called actin pedestals. PEC employs the tyrosine phosphorylated transmembrane receptor Tir, while EHE relies on the multivalent scaffolding protein EspF. The ability to generate these structures correlates with colonization in animal models, but the function of pedest in infection is unclear. Researchers characterized colonization of PEC and ECE during polarized epithelial cells, finding both formed bacterial communities or "macroies" that encompassed multiple cells. Tir and Esp, as well as the Arp2/3 complex, were critical for expansion of macroies over time. Unexpectedly, EspF accelerated formation of larger macroies compared to PEC, as Esp-mediated actin assembly drove bacterial motility to junctions, where bacteria formed a pedestal on a neighboring cell and divided, allowing one daughter to disengage and infect the second. These data reveal Esp enhances epithelial colonization by actin-based motility and efficient cell-to-cell transmission.
Researchers compared two methods for isolating extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the excretory-secretory products of the parasitic worm Fasciola hepatica: differential centrifugation (DC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). DC is the most commonly used method for isolating EVs from pathogens, but SEC has been used for isolating EV from other pathogens. The study found that EVs isolated by SEC were smaller and less diverse than those isolated by DC. SEC also resulted in a higher purity of EV to excretory-secretory protein (ESP) ratio, with reduced contamination from soluble cathepsin proteases. Proteomic analysis showed DC EVs contained more ESP and tegument proteins than SEC EVs. This suggests DC and SEC do not isolate equivalent EV populations, and caution should be taken when choosing purification methods. The study proposes using SEC for isolating EV before downstream studies.
Researchers used a reverse-engineering approach to study post-transcriptional regulation in the fruit fly Drosila melanogaster, focusing on the gap genes Krpp, kni, and gt. They analyzed detailed, quantitative datasets of mRNA and protein expression to fit a model of post-transcription regulation and determine its structural and practical identifiability. The results showed that post-transcription regulation is not required for patterning in this system but is necessary for proper control of protein levels. The study demonstrates the uniqueness and specificity of a fitted model can be rigorously determined in the context of spatio-temporal formation, increasing the potential of reverse engineering for study of development and other complex biological processes.

The researchers used a reverse-engineering approach to gain quantitative insights into postcription regulation by fitting the model to data in a rigorous and reproducible manner. They first determined if the model was formulated to have a unique solution, then fitted it to protein data using mRNA as inputs or boundary conditions. If the models reproduced protein patterns, they concluded postcription was not required for expression. If they failed, they identified features relying on postcription processes.

The approach was applied to the complex problem of spatio-temporal formation in the fly embryo, testing the importance of postcription in development. A high-resolution dataset of mRNA expression for Kr, kn, and gt was created covering the blastoderm stage.
Researchers investigated how age affects susceptibility to rotavirus infection, a major cause of diarrhea worldwide, in a mouse model. They found that infants and newborn mice are highly susceptible, while adults remain asymptomatic and shed low viral particles. The team discovered that Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) expression in the intestinal epithelial cells is low in newborns but increases during the postnatal period, inversely correlating with rotavirus susceptibility, shedding, and histological damage. Adult mice lacking TLR3 or its adaptor molecule Trif showed higher viral shedding and decreased epithelial pro-inflammatory and antiviral gene expression compared to wild-type animals. In contrast, neonatal mice lacking TLR or Trif did not display impaired stimulation or enhanced rotavirus susceptibility. Using chimeric mice, a significant contribution of non-hematopoietic cells in Tr-mediated antiral response was detected in adults. A significant age-dependent increase in TLR expression was also found in human intestinal biops. Upregulation of epithelial TLR during infancy might contribute to age-dependent rotavirus susceptibility.
Researchers analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from 1,039 individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 870 controls from the National Human Genome Repository to determine the distribution of rare genetic variations. Two sequencing centers used different methods to produce and identify variants, and the goal was to ensure the distribution was similar. Variants were filtered based on missing data, read depth, and balance of alternative reads. Seven samples were sequenced at both centers, and results were evaluated. The study addressed how to combine data and results from centers. Gene-based analysis was a choice, but should statistics be combined across centers (meta-analysis) or data combined and analyzed (mega). Due to the nature of gene-based tests, mega-analysis had better power than meta-analysis. Before analysis, the impact of population structure on rare variants was explored. Like other studies, population structure confounded case-control studies by clustering variants in ancestry, but principal-based analyses controlled for ancestry and produced appropriate distributions. Using gene tests and mega-analysis, no new genes were found for ASD. Results suggest gene-based tests require larger samples for discovery, even for a disorder like ASD.
A study investigated the association between genetic polymorphisms in the chitin-degrading enzymes chitriosase and AMCase and the incidence of mycetoma caused by Madlla myetatis in a Sudanese population. Chitin is a component of the fungal cell wall of M. myetatis, which can trigger the human immune system. Polymorphisms in the genes for chitrios and AM were studied in 112 myetoma patients and 103 controls. A 24-b insertion in the chitrios gene (rs1317) resulted in impaired chitin activity, while a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the AM gene (617) resulted in decreased AM activity. Additionally, a SNP (41292) and 10-b insertion in the 5'UTR of the AM gene (143) were studied, resulting in increased AM activity. DNA was isolated from blood and genotypes were determined using PCR-RP. Histological staining confirmed the presence of chitin in the fungal grain. The polymorphism resulting in decreased chitrios activity was associated with increased odds of myoma (OR 2.9, p=0.004). No association was found for polymorphisms in the genes for AM (p>0.05). Decreased chrios activity was associated with increased risk of M myet myoma.
Researchers have re-examined the concept of herpes simplex virus (HSV) latency, a state where the virus remains dormant in the body without causing symptoms. Traditionally, HSV was thought to have two phases: an acute phase where the virus replicates and a latent phase where it remains dormant. However, new evidence suggests that the latent phase is not as clear-cut as previously thought. Studies have shown that lytic genes, responsible for viral replication, can be transcribed during latency, but it was unclear if they were translated into proteins. This study used a sensitive model to show that lytic and latent phases are not as distinct as previously thought. Half of the virus spread to latent sites occurred after the initial infection, and lytic promoters drove protein expression during latency. This is the most direct evidence to date that lytic promoters can generate proteins during latency. The study also linked this to CD8 T cell activation in latently infected nerve cells with viral gene expression during latency. This is consistent with either limited lytic gene expression being part of latency or early presentation of proteins to CD8 cells halting reactivation by immune mechanism.
Researchers studied the accumulation of a misfolded protein called PrP in the brains of mice infected with three different strains of scrapie, a type of prion disease. They used a technique called dual-staining immunohistochemistry to see where PrP was accumulating in the brain cells. The results showed that each strain had a different pattern of PrP accumulation, with strain 22 mainly in astroglia, strain 7 in neurons, and strain ML in both astroia in thalamus and cortex but in substantia nigra. The researchers also looked at the expression of genes involved in neuroinflammation in the thalamus and found that despite the differences in Pr accumulation, the pattern of upregulated genes was similar for all three strains. The upregulated genes correlated with activation of astroia and microglia early in the disease before vacu pathology or clinical signs. The profile of upregulated genes in scrapie differed from two viral diseases with similar gliosis levels.
Researchers have developed a new approach to study the 3D organization of chromosomes, which is crucial for gene expression and cell function. Chromosomes are long, densely packed, and topologically constrained polymers, making it challenging to model and simulate their behavior. The team created a generic coarse-grained model for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice, accounting for entanglement and volumetric density. This model captures steady-state and dynamic properties and tracks dynamics at different scales, offering a significant numerical efficiency gain and a systematic way to define coarse-grained models for chromosomes. They used this approach to study the evolution of chromosome 3R (20Mbp) in Drosophila during a cell cycle (20h), combining it with a block copolymer model integrating epigen-driven interactions to reproduce experimental data and predict chromatin dynamics is dynamic during the cycle. 

The model achieved high efficiency by introducing rigidity and controlling volume fraction, allowing simulation of chromosome dynamics during a cycle on a desktop within a day. A coarse-grained model for chromatin was built with a copoly framework based on epigen data to investigate folding and dynamics of a large chromosomeR of Doph. This is the first study to describe behavior and evolution of large regions (20M) during a cycle (h) with high precision (10bp). The approach is generic and can be applied to self-avoiding polymers and off-lattice systems, emphasizing neglecting topological constraints leads to erroneous fine-scale description and supplementary interactions may lead to misinterpretation.
Researchers analyzed genetic data from 11 studies on 7 cell types to identify quantitative trait loci (eQTL) associated with gene expression. They integrated QTL data with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data from the ENCODE project to understand the mechanisms underlying cell specificity of QTL. The study found that QTL associated with hundreds of cell-specific CRE, including enhancers, promoters, repressive chromatin regions, open chromatin, and DNA binding proteins. This provides insight into the molecular mechanisms generating cell specificity of QTL and regulation. A classifier was built to predict cell specificity of QTL using CRE-SNP overlap features, demonstrating its feasibility. The study also showed that CRE from a trait-associated cell can annotate GW associations in the absence of QTL data for that cell. This integrative modeling will improve understanding of complex phenotypic variation in humans.
Researchers have developed a new cell line of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that limits glycosylation to early intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. This was achieved by using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to inactivate the gene encoding Mannosyl Alpha-1,3-Glycoprotein Beta-2-N-Acetylglucosyltransferase (MG1), an enzyme involved in glycosylation. The new cell line, called MG1-CHO, produces gp120 proteins with improved binding to glycan-dependent monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed to the V2 and V3 domains, while preserving glycan-independent epitopes. The MG-CHO cell line can grow at high densities and does not impair doubling time, making it suitable for biopharm production of HIV-1 immunogens. This is a step towards developing a vaccine that elicits broadly neutralizing Abs (NAbs) that recognize glycan epitopes on the HIV envelope protein gp120. Previous vaccines have failed to elicit NAbs to glycan epitopes due to differences in glycosylation. The new cell line may be used to produce glycan-optimized gp120 vaccine.
Researchers have identified trehalose-6-phosphatase (T6) from the parasitic nematode Brugia malayi as a potential target for anthelmint drugs. T6 is essential for the survival of the nematode Caenorhabdis elegans due to the toxic effects of trehal 6-phosphate accumulation, and is also present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The X-ray crystal structure of T from B. malayi revealed a stabilizing N-terminal domain and catalytic C-terminal C2-type H phosphat fold. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analyses with competitive inhibitor trehal 6-sulf identified five residues important for binding and catalysis. A model of the T6-trehal 6-phosphate complex indicates substrate binding driven by shape complementarity and van der Waals interactions, contrasting with sucrose-6-phosphatase which relies on hydrogen bonds. This suggests high-affinity inhibitors will bind to the phosphoryl pocket and non-native to the trehal pocket. Conservation of key residues in TPP enzymes from parasitic nematodes and pathogenic bacteria indicates a common strategy for TPP design, potentially applicable to antibiotics and anthelmics. The trehal site is dominated by hydrophobic residues, unlike other carbohydrate binding proteins. A model of TPP with trehal 6-phosphate was constructed for inhibitor design. T is present in bacteria, fungi, plants, and invertebrates, but not mammals, and RNAi knockdown of the tps-1 gene causes lethality due to trehal 6-phosphate accumulation. A T inhibitor could bring the same result, making T a target for small molecule anthelmics.
Researchers have developed a new computer model to simulate how fluids move through tumors, taking into account the unique and varied blood vessel structures found in different tumors. This is important because tumors have leaky and disorganized blood vessels, which makes it hard for treatments to be effective. The model uses real data from actual tumors and simulates blood and fluid flow in the tumor in a way that is computationally efficient. It combines two descriptions of blood and fluid flow in the vessels and the space between cells to make accurate predictions of tumor dynamics. The model allows for controlled experiments to be performed to understand how tumor heterogeneity affects fluid transport. The researchers applied the model to two types of tumors, a brain and colon cancer, and found that incorporating realistic blood vessels is key to modeling fluid response. They also found that reducing pressure in the tumor is not necessary to increase fluid flow and that treatments should aim to create a pressure gradient. Additionally, they suggest that stabilizing vessel sizes and permeability is key after treatment and normalizing the environment may increase fluid flow.
Researchers have investigated how the role of cell-to-cell transmission in HIV infection and how it is affected by neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors. They found that neutralizing antibodies that target the CD4 binding site (CDbs) of the virus, such as the potent antibody VRC01, lose potency during cell-to-cell transmission, while those that target the gp41 region remain active. This suggests that CDbs antibodies primarily block free virus transmission, allowing HIV to spread through cell-to-cell contacts. This could explain why HIV maintains infectivity and evades potent CDbs antibody responses in the body. The study shows that neutralizing antibodies, depending on their mode of action, differ in blocking free and cell-to-cell transmission. HIV uses both modes to infect in the body, so the effectiveness of entry inhibitors and antibodies in blocking cell-to-cell transmission needs to be considered. A panel of neutralizing antibodies and inhibitors were tested for potency against free and cell-associated virus. The study aimed to dissect the efficacy of neutral antibodies and inhibitors in cell-to-cell HIV transmission. Neutral antibodies recognize epitopes on the HIV envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, accessible in the oligomeric form. HIV spreads efficiently through various cell contacts, but the action of antibodies during this process is unclear.
Researchers have proposed a new model to explain how attention affects neural responses in the brain, particularly in the visual system. The model suggests that attention's effects on neural firing rates and receptive fields come from top-down modulation of higher visual areas, such as V4 and MT, rather than input areas like V1. The model requires feedback connections between areas and short-range inhibition within each area, redistributing top-down modulation to lower areas, altering inputs of higher cells, including those not initially modulated. This produces rate modulations and receptive field shifts. Simultaneously, short-range inhibition between cells produce competitive effects scaling receptive field size. The model reproduces observed effects on rates (response gain, input, gain, competition scaled field) and receptive structure (shifts, resizing spatial and feature space) without modifying parameters. It also predicts attention effects shift from gain to contrast as focus drifts away from cell.
In Drosophila larvae, a group of specialized cells called the posterior signalling centre (P) controls blood cell homeostasis in the hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. This role is similar to the microenvironment of hematopoietic stem cells in vertebrates. The P acts non-autonomously to maintain janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators (J/STAT) signalling in hematietic progenitors, preserving their multipotent character for differentiation into lamlocytes, a cell type required to fight specific threats such as wasp parasit. A study found that a type I cytokine receptor, CG142/Lat, is required to switch off J/STAT signalling in hematiet progen. This is necessary for differentiation of lamytes upon wasp parasitisation. Lat forms heteromers with Dome, a Drosila type cytokine receptor related to mammalian GP130, and antagonizes Dome activity in a dose-dependent manner. An immune response to wasp parasit is a decrease in cytokine mRNA in lymph, followed by increase in Lat/Dome ratio. This sequence leads to inhibition of J/STAT signalling by Lat. J/STAT is associated with human diseases like leukaemia and mouse studies point to its role in hematopoies and immune regulation.
Researchers studied the process of genetic recombination in geminiviruses, a family of single-stranded DNA viruses, during co-infections in tomato plants. They found that recombination patterns between two viruses, Tomato yellow curl virus and Tomato leaf curl virus, were complex and influenced by factors such as local sequence similarity, not secondary structure, and selection against recombinants with disrupted protein and nucleic acid interactions. The study showed that selection favored preservation of co-evolved protein-protein and DNA interactions was strong enough to identify exact sequence tracts involved in these interactions. In contrast to previous experiments, this study found varying outcomes due to the complexity of fitness landscape in tomato and recombinant progeny. Geminiviruses are ideal subjects due to emergence of numerous crop pathogens attributed to inter-species recombination and well-characterized intra-protein, interprotein, and protein-DNA interactions. Local sequence similarity, not secondary structure, influenced recombin sequences. Selection influenced overall patterns of recombination, favoring survival of recombinants with intact protein and nucleic interactions. Recombinants with up to 58 breakpoints were observed, more complex than previously reported in maize virus experiments.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between nucleosomes, the basic units of eukotic chromatin, and evolution. Contrary to the idea that nucleosomes are unique to eukotes, histone proteins have been found in archaea. However, archae nucleosomes differ from eukotic counterparts in many ways, including assembly into tetramers rather than octamers and lack of N and C-terminal tails. Despite these differences, the association between nucleosome footprints and evolution is conserved between humans and the archaeon Halofer volcanii. The study examined whether mutation or selection could explain concord substitution patterns in the two kingdoms, but found neither model sufficient to explain the association. Instead, nucleosome substitution patterns are consistent with a model where sequence results in frequent reposition of nucleosomes during evolution. The study shows that nucleosome reposition is necessary and sufficient to explain the association between current nucleosome positions and biased patterns. This highlights the importance of considering causality between genetic and epigenetic change. 

The study compared substitution patterns around nucleosomes in humans to dynamics in Halofera, a group of halophilic archaea, including the model Halofer volcan, which nucleosome organization was determined at high resolution. Nucleosomes may reflect reposition in response to sequence changes, as both archae and eukotic histones share preference for GC sequence and show similar reposition behavior when sequence changes. Archae nucleosomes differ from euk counterparts, assembling into tetramers, not octers, and wrapping less DNA, with shorter linkers between nucleosomes. Like euk, archae histones form multimer complexes onto bend DNA, sequences with higher GC content in both e and archae. Nucle organization shows dy-oriented trends break in lineages, not consistent with mutation or purifying selection on static nucleosomes. Instead, patterns consistent with local reposition of nucle in response substitutions.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify key positions on a protein that are crucial for its ability to change shape when binding to a ligand. This shape change is important for the protein's function. The method looks at normal modes, or vibrations, of the protein that are involved in this change and how they are affected by mutations. A dataset of 188 protein structures in both with and without ligand was used to test the method. Results show a correlation between mutations that alter these modes and evolutionary conserved positions. These positions are mostly buried, non-polar residues in regular protein regions like beta-sheets and alpha-helixes. They are important for mediating ligand conformation change. The study suggests these positions are conserved due to their role in protein function. Conformation diversity of the native state is central to protein function, with different conformers in equilibrium for ligand binding. Intramolecular motions allow transitions between them. This diversity should be conserved due to its importance. A database of conformation diversity in native proteins has been developed, with collections of structures for same proteins. Lig-free and lig-bound conformations coexist as minima in protein energy landscape. Conformation change between them by intramolecular vibrations.
Researchers studied the role of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldase (FBA) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M), a bacterium responsible for tuberculosis, to understand its pathogenesis and develop new treatments. They engineered an M strain with reduced FBA levels and found that it was cleared in both acute and chronic infections in vivo and lost viability when cultured on single carbon sources. However, M can co-catabolize multiple sources, so FBA was not essential when cultured on mixtures of glycolytic and gluogenic sources, generating a knockout (Δfba) strain. In vitro studies of Δba showed lack of F could be compensated by balance of glucose and butyrate, with growth and butrate determined by M's ability to coatabol glucose. These results evaluate F as a drug target for both replicating and persistent M, and expand understanding conditions defining M's FBA essentiality in vivo.
Researchers have investigated the role of a specific enzyme called mitochondrial 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin (mTXx) in the parasite Leishmania, which causes leishmaniasis, a disease. They created a mutant version of the parasite that lacked this enzyme and found that it was unable to infect mice. However, this was not due to the enzyme's ability to remove peroxides, as the mutant behaved normally when exposed to peroxides. The mutant was also unable to infect mice that could not produce perox, suggesting that the enzyme's role is not related to peroxide removal. Further, a version of the enzyme that could not remove perox was able to rescue the mutant's inability to infect, indicating a new function for TXx. The researchers propose that TXx acts as a molecular chaper, helping to prevent protein misfolding. This is supported by the enzyme's ability to prevent aggregation of citrate synthase in vitro and the mutant's increased sensitivity to temperature change. These findings change the understanding of 2-cystine periredoxins in trypanosids and show that they can be important for pathogenicity independently of their peroxide activity.
Researchers conducted a multicenter study to evaluate the accuracy of the Histoplas urine antigen (HAg) test for diagnosing disseminated histoplasis (PD) in HIV patients. The study included 288 patients with suspected PD and used the HAg test as a reference standard against Histlas capsulatum growth, blood, bone, and tissue cultures, or histopath exam results. The test showed a sensitivity of 67.1% and specificity of 97.5.5. The positive likelihood ratio was 27.2. In 10.5% of patients with proven PD, a co-infection was diagnosed, mostly Mycobacterium avium complex. The study found a high specificity but low sensitivity of the HAg test, suggesting it may be useful for starting antifungal treatment, but a culture-based approach is necessary due to frequent co-infections and a negative result does not rule out PD. 

A previous study in Brazil reported 100 sensitivity and 92.9 specificity for HAg in 78 proven PD cases among AIDS patients. The current study's sensitivity and specificity are higher than a previous report of 22.7 and 30 from a subset with culture-proven or histopath cases and healthy controls. The US Centers for Disease Control developed a urinary assay validated in 106 patients with culture-proven histlasis, showing 84 sensitivity and 94 specificity. However, results are difficult to compare due to study design.
Researchers conducted a metagenomic analysis of viral communities in stool samples from 12 children with diarrhea to identify the spectrum of viruses, including novel ones, present during acute episodes. They employed a "microassay" sequencing method requiring minimal sample quantity (<100mg), purification, and sequencing (384 reads per sample). This approach allowed detection of known enteric viruses and multiple putative novel viruses with limited similarity to GenBank sequences. The study aimed to assess whether novel or unexpected viruses play a causal role in diarrhea, as up to 40% of cases have no identified etiologic agent. Metagen sequencing enabled systematic and unbiased characterization of microbial populations, providing a foundation for future studies on novel viruses' roles in human diarrhea. 

The study explored viral diversity in pediatric patients with diarrhea, anticipating variation between specimens and desirability to sample multiple patients for overall perspective on diversity. Sequencing afforded systematic exploration of known and novel viruses in stool, laying groundwork for assessing novel viruses' causal role. Microay sequencing defined viral communities in fecal samples from patients, detecting known and novel viruses from few colonies per library. This serves as a springboard for interrogating diverse viruses' roles in the gastrointestinal tract.
A study was conducted in the Dominican Republic to compare the Zika and deng outbreaks using national surveillance data. The study found that 75% of deng cases were reported in individuals under 20 years old, while Zika infections were more dispersed among the population. Dengue rates were higher among males (25.9 per 10,000 population) compared to females (21.5 per 10,000). In contrast, Zika infections were highly clustered among females (73.8%) with age-adjusted attack rates of 7.64 per 10,000 in females compared to 2.72 per 10,000 in males. Stratification by sex showed higher rates among females (1.84) compared to males (1.72). However, GBS rates stratified by sex revealed higher risk in males (0.62) compared to females (0.57). The study suggests little impact of existing deng immunity on Zika attack rates at the population level. Confounding R and incident calculations by sex-specific reporting can alter reliability of epidemiological metrics, which can be addressed using proxy syndromes or conditions to explore sex-skewed incidence. The findings indicate community campaigns influencing short-term health behavior remain plausible behind increased reporting among women of reproductive age, although biological susceptibility cannot be ruled out. Media and screening are recommended for women of reproductive age during Zika outbreaks. Future research should focus on Zika outcomes among deng seropositive individuals.
Researchers have investigated the role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) in Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant species, in response to DNA damage and immune responses. Unlike in animals, where PAR1 is the primary PAR enzyme responsible for poly(ADP-ri)ation, PAR2 is the main contributor in Arabidopsis. PAR2 carries a SAP binding motif, not a zinc finger domain found in animal PAR1. PAR2 also plays a significant role in plant immune responses, such as restricting Pseudomonas syringae growth and reducing DNA double-strand breaks. Poly(AD-ri)glycohydrolase (PARG) enzymes were also studied, with Arabidopsis P1 being the primary remover of poly(AD-ri) from proteins. PAR2 activity is influenced by PAR1 and P1, and they physically interact with each other and P1 and2. PAR and P2 are structurally distinct from their animal counterparts, suggesting differences in regulation. In Arabidopsis PAR1 and PAR2 mutants were tested for sensitivity to genotoxic agents, with PAR2 mutants showing reduced poly(AD-ri)ation. PAR1 and PAR2 interact with P1 and2, suggesting regulation through physical interactions. Overall, PAR2 is the primary Arabid enzyme for poly(AD-riation in response to DNA damage.
Researchers have identified a new signaling pathway in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that regulates the formation of synapses, the connections between neurons. This pathway, called the M-15/JNK-1, opposes the action of the RPM-1 protein, which is involved in synapse formation and axon termination. The M-15/J-1 pathway includes four kinases: M-15, NS-1, JKK-1, and JNK-1, which work together to suppress synapse defects in the mechanosensory neurons of RPM-1 mutants. Overexpression of these kinases in the M-15/J-1 pathway in wild-type animals impairs synapse formation. The M-15/J-1 pathway functions autonomously in the mechanensory neurons and localizes to presynaptic terminals, indicating its role in synapse development. Loss of M-15/J-1 signaling also suppresses habituation to repeated stimuli in RPM-1 mutants, a behavioral deficit likely due to impaired glutamatergic synapse formation. Habituation is consistent with M-15/J-1 functioning as a parallel pathway to RPM-1, indicating it can restrict glutamateric synapse and short-term learning.
Researchers have investigated the role of the TR-1 protein in sex determination in Caenorhabditis brigae and Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that TR-1 is a bipotential protein, meaning it can both activate and repress the same target genes in response to different signals. In C brigae, TR-1 is required for spermatogenesis and works with the Tip60 Histone Acetylase complex to promote the expression of fog-3, a gene needed for spermatogenesis. Epistasis tests showed that TR-1 works with TR-1 to activate fog-3 and control the sperm/oocyte decision. Since TR-1 can also repress fog-3, these observations demonstrate it is bipot. TR- regulates the development of the male tail and two branches of the switch control TR-1 activity. However, the relationship between the two halves of the bipot switch has changed during evolution. C. brigae TR-1 mutants prevent hermaphrodite spermatogenesis, but C-f mutants do not, while C eleg TR- mutants prevent spermatogenesis but C-tr-1 mutants do not. Synthetic interactions confirm both halves of the switch exist in each species. The relationship between the two halves of the bipot switch can shift rapidly during evolution, producing the same phenotype by alternative mechanisms.
Researchers have developed two new measures, ΦE and ΦAR, to quantify the extent to which a system generates more information than the sum of its parts as it transitions between states, reflecting levels of consciousness generated by neural systems. These measures can be applied to time-series data, overcoming the limitations of previous measure ΦDM, which is only defined for discrete Markov systems and rare in biology. Simulations demonstrate the practical applicability of the new measures and explore their properties. The results provide opportunities for examining integration in real and model systems and carry implications for relations between integrated information, consciousness, and neurocognitive processes. However, findings pose challenges for theories ascribing physical meaning to measured quantities.

Previous measures of integrated information were formulated in the context of the Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness (IT), which considers consciousness as a fundamental property of the universe. The new measures, Φ and Φ, are framed in terms of process, easy to apply in practice, permitting testable hypotheses and synthetic models examining the role of information in neurocognitive processes. The ITC ascribes physical meaning to integrated information, considering low value as low conscious level. The distinction carries implications for theories like ITC, which characterize consciousness in capacity, not process.

The new measures, Φ and Φ, can be applied to time-series data from neuroimaging and biological datasets to test intuitions regarding consciousness and neuroognitive processes. They will investigate how integrated is modulated by input and output of a system in and surrounding environment, and theoretically determine the measures under different assumptions and practicality.
Researchers studied the spread of Rhodesian African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Uganda, which has increased in recent years, potentially overlapping with the Gambian form of the disease. They aimed to identify environmental and climatic factors controlling the disease distribution. A previous study used logistic regression to explore the relationship between H prevalence and social, environmental, and climatic variables in two affected districts, suggesting disease spread due to infected, untreated livestock movement. This study extends to account for spatial autocorrelation, uncertainty in data and model parameters, and predictive mapping of future H prevalence. A Bayesian geostatistical model was used, accounting for spatial autocorrelation and uncertainty, resulting in more accurate estimates and increased predictive accuracy. Analysis supports livestock movement of infected animals from endemic areas introduced H to the area. Health care accessibility and land temperature effects on H distribution were also confirmed. Predictive mapping shows increased risk in areas surrounding livestock markets, highlighting trading's role in spread. Treating livestock at sale is essential to prevent spread.
Researchers have challenged the long-held assumption that complexity leads to stability in ecosystems, particularly in the 1970s, and more recently in ecologically-inspired networks. They assumed the existence of a feasible equilibrium with positive abundances, but this assumption has not been tested. Analytical results and simulations show that equilibrium vanishes in species-rich systems, leaving the existence of a feasible equilibrium in stability criteria far from granted. Changing interaction structure and intensity, feasibility and stability are warranted regardless of species richness with weak interactions. Dynamical behavior of ecologically-inspired architectures is different and richer than unstructured systems. Results suggest understanding ecosystem dynamics requires interplay between interaction strength, network structure, and architecture. 

The feasibility of systems is critical to study. May's paradox that complexity decreases stability in models led to exploration of topological structure effects on dynamics. Several works show particular architectures stabilize ecological networks. However, feasibility of different architectures for interaction regimes has not been explored. Feasibility can be easily evaluated. Results indicate information on dynamics will be obtained by concentrating on interplay between structure, strengths, and how strengths are distributed. Many aspects should be taken to reach conclusions about feasibility and stability that fit natural systems. A refinement of May's approach mixing interaction types is considered. In species-rich communities, interactions should moderate equilibrium stability. Simulations study stability in randomly generated architecture mimics empirically observed food webs. Species richness and connectance are treated as independent, but decreases in different systems, restricting parameter space. Topology has been suggested minor role in stability, but architecture plays non-trivial on abundances. Equilibrium is not guaranteed, probability decreases exponentially as network size grows. Weak interactions, non-trivial equilibria found ecologically, ecologically sensible.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Western Kenya to assess the epidemiology of Coxiella burnii, a bacterial pathogen causing Q fever, in humans and cattle. Serum samples from 204 humans and 955 cattle in 416 households were analyzed for C. burnii antibodies, and questionnaires on demographic, socio-economic, and husbandry information were administered. Data were linked to environmental datasets on geographical locations. The overall seroprevalence of C. burnii was 2.5% in humans and 10.5% in cattle, but no correlation was found between cattle and human serreval within households or spatial proximity. Multilevel analysis indicated factors for exposure included cattle from markets and lower precipitation areas. For humans, the youngest group had highest odds of serositivity, variations observed between ethnic groups and frequent contact with livestock was a risk. Results show endemicity of C burnii in Kenya, with low prevalence. Analysis suggests environmental factors play role in cattle exposure, human patterns likely driven by livestock contact. Implication of markets in cattle exposure suggests a target for interventions.
Researchers have analyzed the genome of the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, a blood fluke that causes schistosomiasis, a major neglected tropical disease. They identified 33 DEAD-box RNA helicases, a family of enzymes involved in RNA processing, and found three vasa-like genes, Smv1, Sm2, and Sm3, which are specific to germ cells. These genes are essential for the development and survival of the parasite. Vasa, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, is a marker of primordial germ cells in metazoa and was used as a reference to identify the vasa-like genes in S. mansoni. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that Smv1, Sm2, and Sm3 are members of the Vasa/10 DEAD-box family. The genes were expressed in adult worms, eggs, and miracidia, with high expression in undeveloped eggs. Whole mount in situ hybridization showed that Sm1, Sm2, and Sm3 were transcribed in the ovary, where oocytes mature. Germ specific expression of schosome vasa genes provide a landmark for germ transgenesis of schosomes, etiologic agents of major tropical diseases. The study suggests that vasa-like genes can be used as markers for germ cell identification and transformation in schistosomes.
Researchers have found that a protein called VGL4 plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of heart valves in the body. Heart valve disease is a major health problem worldwide, and understanding how valves form and function is essential. The Hippo signaling pathway is important for organ and tissue development, but its role in valve formation and maintenance was unknown. V4 is a transcription factor in vertebrates and was mainly found in valve cells at a certain stage and remained until adulthood. Knocking out V4 in specific cell types showed that losing it in endothelial cells led to abnormal valve formation with increased expression of a target. Further knocking out this target in V4-deleted hearts reduced valve cell growth. This suggests V4 is important for valve development and manipulating the Hipp pathway could prevent congenital valve disease.

 Studies showed losing V4 in endothelial resulted in abnormal valves and severe heart growth in mice, while knocking out this rescued malformation. The study shows V4 and Hipp signaling are required for proper valve remodeling and maturation. The Hipp pathway in endothelial cells is necessary for post-stage valve formation and maintenance. Precise regulation is needed for cell proliferation and valve elongation. This study identifies a new function of V4 in remodeling and maintenance. Findings suggest mutations may underlie human heart valve disease. This is the first study showing the role of Hipp in valve remodeling and maturation. Tracing data shows endothelial but not crest V4 regulates cell proliferation. This is because V4 is mainly in endothelial and derived cells. Only losing V4 led to malformation Mechanistically, knocking out the phenotype in V4 heart was rescued, indicating V4 for normal development by antagonizing activity. Together, a key role of V4 in development and maintenance was identified.
Recent studies have suggested that soft sweeps, a type of positive selection where beneficial mutations become fixed in a population, are common across different species, including humans, fruit flies, and viruses. However, other research has questioned the validity of these findings, arguing that sweeps are likely rare. This study re-examines three recent studies and their methods, using population theory and simulations. It finds that all three are prone to high false positives, incorrectly identifying sweeps under both hard and neutral models, and that demographic histories combined with hard sweeps provide a more parsimonious explanation. This challenges the tendency to use complex models of positive selection, neglecting proper demographic models. The lack of testing and analysis led to inaccurate views of evolutionary processes and misleading answers to population genetics questions, suggesting a dominant role for selection in shaping variation. The claim of soft sweeps in humans is based on excess intermediate haplotype frequencies, relying on prior knowledge of fitness and demographic history. However, hard sweeps of weak mutations are classified as soft, and demographic models result in similar haplotype structures as soft. Given non-equilibrium histories and rare beneficial mutations, sweeps are unlikely explanations. The examples span different population parameters, including humans, flies, and viruses.
Researchers studied the behavior of female Aedes aegypt mosquitoes, which transmit dengue fever to humans, and found that their host-seeking behavior is suppressed for three days after a blood meal due to a hormone-like peptide called Headptide. They identified eight Neurope Y-like receptors (NLR) in the mosquito genome and tested them for sensitivity to a panel of peptides. Four LR responded to one or more ligands, but only NLR1 responded to Headptide and shorturope-F peptides (sPF). Two NLR homologs in the Lyme disease vector Ixodes scularis were also sensitive to Headptide. Injecting synthetic Headptide and sPF inhibited host-seeking behavior in non-fed mosquitoes, while control injections had no effect. To test if NLR1 is necessary for host-seeking inhibition, researchers generated mutant strains and tested for behavioral abnormalities. Mutants displayed normal behavior in locomotion, egg-laying, sugar-feeding, blood-feeding, and host-seeking, but not host-seeking after a meal. The study identified four Ae aegypt NLR and N1 as a candidate PF receptor sensitive to Headptide, but found that N1 alone is not required for host-seeking, suggesting other receptors, peptides, or both regulate this behavior.
Researchers in Nigeria used satellite imagery and spatial analysis to identify areas with suitable conditions for schistosomiasis transmission in Akure Local Government Area, Ondo State. The study focused on temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, slope, and land use/cover as factors influencing schosomias incidence. A multicriteria evaluation using Sa's Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was employed to map the importance of each schosias risk factor. Weighted analysis was done after each factor was given weight through the hierarchical process. The prevalence of schos in the area was determined by parasitological analysis of urine samples collected through random sampling. Results showed 82% of the area fell under high and very high risk category, with one community (Ole) having the lowest risk and four others (ju, Igba, Ita, Ogb and Oese) having increased risk. Predictions by the model correlated with field observations, high zones corresponding to known endemic communities. Environmental factors can be used to identify and predict schos transmission as well as monitor risk in rural communities. 

The study used multicriteria evaluation and AHP to obtain weight importance of each schos risk factor. Weighted analysis was done after each factor was given weight through hierarchical process. The prevalence of sch in the area was determined by parasit analysis of urine samples through random sampling. Results showed 82% of area under high and very risk category, with community (O) lowest and others (ju, Ig, It, O and O) increased risk. Predictions by model correlated with field, high zones to endemic communities. Environmental can identify and predict sch transmission as well monitor in rural. 

The study used multicriteria and A to obtain weight of each sch risk. Weight was done each factor given hierarchical. The of sch the area was by parasit analysis urine through sampling. Results 82 area high and risk, community lowest others increased. Predictions correlated field, zones endemic.
A bacterial toxin called pneumolys, produced by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, plays a key role in the development of meningitis, a serious infection of the brain. Research shows that pneumys disrupts the regulation of glutamate, a chemical in the brain, leading to damage to synapses, the connections between brain cells. This damage is seen in post-mortem samples from individuals with pneumoc meningitis and in mice with the infection when pneumys is present. Mouse brain slices exposed to pneumys show dendritic swelling, spine loss, and synaptic damage, which is reduced by blocking glutamate receptors. Pneumys increases glutamate levels in the brain and triggers its release from astrocytes, brain cells, leading to damage. This study is the first to show synapse loss in pneumoc meningitis and demonstrates pneumys dysregulates glut in the brain, causing excitotoxic damage.
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are DNA viruses associated with major human cancers. To develop new prevention methods, such as vaccines and microbicides, a better understanding of the life cycle of HPVs is needed. The HPV life cycle is linked to the state of the stratified epithelium it infects, with progeny virus made in the terminally differentiating supasal compartment. It was known that HPV first establishes infection in the basal layer of stratified epithelium, but why this was not understood. This might be due to specificity of entry receptors, but this could not explain differentiation of infection, as many cells can be infected in monolayer culture. Researchers used chemical approaches to reveal that cell progression through mitosis is critical for HPV infection. Using HPV16 particles with intact genome, synchronized keratinocytes as hosts, and viral gene expression as readout, cells must enter M phase for infection to take place. Late phase inhibitors had no effect, while G, S, G, and M phase inhibitors prevented infection. Cells need to pass prophase for successful transcription of encapsulated genes. This provides reason why HPVs establish in basal compartment of stratified epithel, as only this compartment contains cycling cells. These findings have implications for HPV control.
Researchers have identified microRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) in the dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffi, which causes systemic mycosis in China and Southeast Asia. milRNAs play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in animals and plants, but their function in fungi is less understood. The study used high-throughput sequencing to analyze small RN in mycel and yeast phases of P. marffei and found 24 potential mil candidates, with 17 in mycel and 7 in yeast. Two genes, d-1 and d-2, encoding Dicer-like proteins, and q-2 encoding Argonaute, were identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed d-2 is closely related to homologs in other dimorphic pathogenic fungi, suggesting co-evolution. d-2 demonstrated higher expression in mycel than yeast. Northern blot confirmed expression of two milRN, PMil-M1 and PMil-M2, only in mycel. Deletion mutants showed biogenesis of mil dependent on d-2 but not d- or q-. mRNA levels of predicted targets of PMil-M were upregulated in knockdown PMilKD, supporting regulatory function of milRN.
Researchers studied the ability of two types of mosquitoes, Aedes aegypt and Aedes polensis, to transmit the Zika virus (ZIK) in the Pacific region between 2013 and 2017. These mosquitoes are known to carry other diseases such as dengue and lymphatic filariasis. The team collected mosquitoes from different islands in the Pacific and exposed them to a strain of ZV that circulated in the region during the outbreak. They analyzed the mosquitoes' bodies, heads, and saliva for infection, dissemination, and transmission rates at 6, 9, and 21 days post-infection. The results showed that ZV infection rates varied among Ae. aegi populations, but dissemination rates were more consistent. For Ae. polensis, infection rates were less consistent. Transmission efficiency was low for both vectors. The study suggests that other factors, such as mosquito density, lifespan, and the population's immune status, may have contributed to the rapid spread of ZV in the Pacific during the outbreak.
Researchers have developed a new method called Targeted-StructureSeq to study the structure of non-coding RNA (nc) Xist, a key regulator of X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells. This method combines chemical probing of RNA structure with massively parallel sequencing to provide high coverage of the target RNA with few reads, making it a targeted and scalable approach to analyze RNA conformation in cells. They used Target-Seq to study the full-length Xist lncRNA and developed new models for functional elements within X, including the repeat element in the 5' end of X. Analysis also identified new structural elements X that are evolutionarily conserved, such as an element proximal to the repeats that is important for X function. The study demonstrates the utility of Targeted-Seq to compare RNA structure in vitro and in cells, and identified novel conserved elements that are potentially functional. The approach can be used to develop a conformation model of full X.
Researchers have identified many genetic variants associated with complex diseases, but it's unclear if predicting risk based on genomic profiles will be clinically useful. To evaluate the performance of genetic prediction models, new statistical measures are needed. Previous studies mainly used the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) to judge predictive value of genetic tests, but it has limitations and should be complemented by other measures. This study develops a unifying framework connecting various predictive indices. Given overall disease probability and level of variance in liability (heritability) explained by genetic variants, many metrics can be estimated, such as AUC, mean difference between cases and non-cases, net reclassification improvement, proportion of cases by specific population percentile, variance of predicted risks, and risk at any percentile. Graphs can also be constructed to visualize performance, such as ROC curve, density of risks, and predictiveness curve. Results match well with theoretical estimates. The framework is applied to nine diseases, evaluating predictive power of genetic tests on known variants for each trait.
Researchers developed a new rapid diagnostic test for Trypanosoma brucei gambense infection, a parasite causing African trypanosomiasis, using recombinant antigens. The test, called SDOLINEAT 2.0, was compared to a traditional test using native antigens, SDOLAT, and the Cardagglutination Test for Trypanosomias, CATT. The study involved 57,632 individuals in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with 260 confirmed cases of the disease. SDOLAT 2.0 had the highest sensitivity at 71.2%, followed by CATT 62.5% and SDAT 59%. CATT was the most specific at 99.2%, while SDAT and SDOL 2.0 were 98.9% and 98.1% respectively. The tests were more sensitive in passive screening than active. Combining two tests increased sensitivity: SDAT with SDOL 2.0 reached 98.4% in passive and 83% in active. The recombinant antigen test was as sensitive and specific as SDAT, but less specific than CATT. The study suggests using two or more tests could enhance diagnostic algorithms, but decrease specificity.
Researchers conducted a decade-long study in the municipality of Comapa, Guatemala, a region with persistent Triatoma infestation, to evaluate the effectiveness of Chagas disease control activities. After multiple rounds of indoor insecticide spraying (IRS), the infestation index decreased from 39% in 2001-2 to 27 in 2011, and household materials inspection showed <10% of infested houses. Chagas seroprevalence in school-aged children declined 10-fold from 10% in 1999 to 1 in 2015. However, seropreval in women of child-bearing age remained >10%. Despite reduced transmission, the risk of vector-borne and congenital transmission poses a threat to the 202 Chagas elimination goal. Systematic vector control and Ch disease screening programs are needed to reach elimination in regions with persistent infestation. In areas with <10% Trioma infestation, seropreval is <1 in school-aged children. Guatemala's Ch disease control has been successful in most of the region, but regions with ecological and social factors lead to persistent infestation. In Comapa, infestation decreases after IRS but recovers as insecticides decay.
Citrobacterium is a natural pathogen that causes attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions in mice. It shares a virulence strategy with human pathogens Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and is used to model pathogenesis. The complete genome of Citacterium ICC168 was previously sequenced, showing characteristics of a newly evolved pathogen. This study used PFGE sequencing, isolates variation, whole transcriptome analysis, and mobile elements to find the genome is unstable due to repeat-mediated large recombination and active transposition of prophages. An additional Citacter strain EX-33 was sequenced, showing ICC168 is representative and most mutations occurred early in evolution. This parallels other pathogens' evolution, Citacter is a recently emerged pathogen alongside mice development as human disease model.

Citacter isolates showed genome features of recently passed evolutionary bottleneck, pseudogenes and elements. This study investigates genomic flux with focus on mobile elements' impact on Citacter evolution, demonstrating the pathogen's genome is unstable. Citacter shares virulence with EPEC and EHEC. Isolates from mouse and hamster outbreaks in Japan and USA 1960s-80s were classified as atypical E. coli (M) or atypical Citacter (later reclassified Citacter species). Genetic and biochemical analyses suggested clonal origin, reclassified Citacter. The genome of Cit ICC168 was sequenced, a derivative from disease in Swiss-Web mice Yale University 1972, originally Citacter biotype 0 (ATCC 59). ICC and DB100 from same source are most studied Cit isolates. Many functions confer Cit virulence to E and EHE are on mobile elements. Large genomic rearrangements and gene loss suggest Cit recently emerged path adapting lifestyle.
Researchers have developed a computational framework to analyze stochastic fluctuations in gene expression, which result in varying protein levels across cell populations. Despite existing models explaining this phenomenon, there was a need for a robust, assumption-free approach to infer underlying mechanisms. The method infers biochemical constants governing chromatin modification, transcription, translation, RNA, and protein degradation from stochastic protein expression. It was tested whether these rates could be estimated from expression distributions without assumptions. The approach derived analytical solutions for protein distribution moments, found four moments capture the shape, and developed an algorithm to infer constants from moments. Using this, most distributions were consistent with multiple rate sets. Despite degeneracy, the solution informed underlying mechanisms. For example, it distinguished transcription bursting from constitutive production. The method agreed with standard approach in restrictive regime and identified previously unobtainable constants. Without assumptions, estimates were obtained in 91% of cases, and all constants in some cases. This framework will deduce molecular contributions to gene expression patterns.
Researchers have developed a new vaccine approach to protect against monkeypox, a disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPV), using a recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (Bo-4) vector. The Bo-4 vector expresses different monkeypox glycoproteins, A29, M1, and B6, and was tested for its ability to protect against a lethal MPV challenge in STAT knockout mice. Three recombinant Bo-4 vectors, Bo-4-CMV-A29g106TK, Bo-4-E1-MR106TK, and Bo-4-E-BR106, were successfully constructed and shown to express their transgene. A small study found the vectors to be safe with no weight loss or adverse events after intraperitoneal administration. Bo-4-E1-MR106 alone or in combination with Bo-4-C-A29 and Bo-4-BR was able to protect 100% and 80% of STAT(-) mice from mortality and morbidity, respectively. This demonstrates the efficacy of Bo-4 vectors and its use as a vaccine platform.
In trypanosomes, the major mRNA decay pathway is 5'-3' decay, where deadenylated mRNAs are decapped by the nudix hydrolase DCP of the decapping complex and degraded by the 5'-3 exonuclease. Unlike other eukaryotes, trypanosomes lack homologues to subunits of the decapping complex, while deadenylation and 5-3 degradation are conserved. Research shows that trypan parasites use ApH-like phosphatase AL1 (AL1) as their major decapping enzyme. AL1 was identified as a novel trypan stress granule protein and involved in mRNA binding. A fraction of AL1 co-localises with the trypan 5-3 exonuclease X to a granule at the posterior of the cell, indicating a connection between the enzymes. RNA depletion of AL1 is lethal and causes a massive increase in mRNAs that are deadenylated but not started 5- decay. This suggests AL acts downstream deadeny and upstream of degradation, consistent with a function in decapping. In vitro experiments show recombinant, N-terminally truncated AL1 protein, but catalytically inactive, sensitises capped trypan spliced RNA to yeast X1, only if an 5 polyphatase is included. This indicates the decapping mechanism of AL differs from decapping of D2 by leaving more than one group at mRNA's end.
Researchers have discovered that inactivating the Arx gene in pancreatic α-cells can trigger their conversion into β-like cells. This process involves the mobilization of ductal precursor cells to adopt an endocrine fate, with glucagon cells being converted into β-like cells upon Ar inhibition. Analysis of Ar and Pax double-mutants shows Pax is dispensable for regeneration, indicating Ar is the main trigger for α-cell β-cell neogenesis. Loss of Ar in α-cells regenerates functional β-cell mass and reverses diabetes-induced β-cell depletion. Strategies targeting Ar expression or its molecular coactors may treat diabetes. The β-cell regeneration can counteract toxin-induced diabetes, maintaining euglycemia. Inactivation of Ar in embryonic and adult α-cells is sufficient to induce β-cell conversion. Lineage tracing shows glucagon cells can be converted into β cells solely upon Ar inactivation. Loss of gluc-producing cells initiates endocrine regeneration, gluc+ cells acquiring β-phenotype, leading to islet hypertrophy due β-cell hyperasia.
Eukaryotic cells have mechanisms to prevent the initiation of DNA replication at thousands of origins in their genome to avoid genomic alterations. Global mechanisms reduce the activity of initiation proteins, but origins initiate with different efficiencies when these are disabled. This suggests an additional layer of control can regulate initiation at distinct origins. Novel elements are necessary for preferential initiation of two origins and confer preferential initiation on heterologous origins when control is deregulated. These elements do not enhance S phase timing or efficiency of adjacent origins, acting as initiation promoters (RIPs). RIPs are ∼60 bp AT-rich sequences acting in a distance and sequence-dependent manner. During replication, Mc2 associates with origins that preferentially initiate and those that do not, indicating RIPs can overcome initiation block imposed by Mc2 association. This identifies a level of control in initiation, creating a complex replication landscape revealed when global mechanisms are compromised. If replication contributes to alterations, as in cancer, some regions may be more susceptible than others.
A study of 170 HIV-1-infected men in Japan found that the clinical features of invasive amebias caused by Entamoeba histoly were similar to those in people without HIV infection. High fever, leukocytosis, and high CRP levels were associated with extraintestinal ameb diseases. Two patients died from amebic colitis and three from unrelated causes. Treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole was successful in 165 cases. Luminal treatment was given to 83, but amebias recurred in 6, similar to those without luminal treatment. Recurrence was more frequent in HCV-antibody positive and syphilis acquired during follow-up. Various E histoly genotypes were identified but no correlation with clinical features. Outcome of metronazole and tinazole for uncomplicated amebias was excellent in HIV-1 individuals. Luminal treatment did not reduce recurrence in high-risk populations due to re-infection. The study found no impact of HIV status on amebias forms. Physical and laboratory findings showed fever, leukocytosis, and high CRP with extraintestinal ameb. Results showed excellent outcome for HIV-1 individuals with uncomplicated amebias treated metronazole or tinazole, in agreement with previous reports. Luminal treatment after metronazole tinid does not reduce recurrence in high-risk groups.
Researchers conducted a study in the Mandoul area of South Chad to assess the impact of adding tset control to medical activities on the transmission of Gambian sleeping sickness, also known as African trypanosomiasis. The disease is caused by Trypanosoma brucei and transmitted by riverine tse flies. The goal is to eliminate the disease as a public health problem by 2020 and stop transmission by 203. In the Mand area, around 100 cases were diagnosed and treated annually until 2013. Control relied solely on case detection and treatment, which led to a decrease in cases due to population screening. However, new cases persisted, so the study added vector control to detection to see if it would further reduce transmission and incidence. Tiny targets that attract and kill tse were deployed in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Before, a census of the population was conducted and settlements mapped, and a pre-intervention survey of tse distribution was done. Impact on tse and incidence was assessed through monitoring and medical surveys in 2014 and 201. Modelling was used to assess the impact of tse control on incidence compared to active and passive screening. The study found a population of 74 inhabitants lived in the area. In 2013, the dominant tse species was Glossina fuscipes with a mean catch of 0.7 tse/trap. After deployment, the catch declined to 0.005se/trap. Modelling showed 70.4% of the reduction in cases between 2013 and 201 was due to vector control, and 62.8% of new infections due to tse control and 8.5% to passive. Predictions indicate elimination as a public problem by 2018 if control and screening continue, with virtually no transmission since 201.
A study of 124 cases of imported strongyloidiasis in Spain from 2009-2017 found that most patients were immigrants from South America, with eosinophilia present in 82.2% of cases. Detection of larvae in stool samples was observed in 21.9% of patients, while serological tests made the diagnosis in the rest of the cases. Treatment with ivermectin compared to albendazole was the most associated factor to achieve cure, with an odds ratio of 2.34. The study suggests that screening for S. stercis infection should be mandatory in patients from or traveling to endemic areas, especially with immunosuppressed conditions due to the long latency of infection and risk of severe presentation.
Researchers have explored the impact of the inoculum dose, or amount of antigen or attenuated pathogen, in vaccines on host immunity and morbidity to inform vaccine design. A higher inoculum doses stimulate a stronger immune response but may cause more severe side effects and limit population coverage during shortages. Determining the optimal inoculum is crucial for rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models and experimental data can determine the inoculum's impact. The study used a model to fit data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mice and human parainfluenza (HIV) in rats at different inoculum doses to map inoculum to immune protection and morbidity. The framework combines models with data to study inoculum's effect on outcomes like protection and morbidity. Findings show inoculum's impact on protection and morbidity depend on the pathogen, and protection and morbidity don't increase monotonically with inoculum. Once protection and morbidity levels are specified, the framework can help design vaccines and determine optimal inoculum. 

A modeling framework was developed to predict optimal inoculum for a vaccine setting using live attenuated data from IAV and HPI experiments. The framework can be applied to specific vaccine candidates to determine optimal dose. Influenza A remains a health concern. The framework can be used to rationally design and determine inoculum for any pathogen. Parameters were chosen to produce dynamics and explore inoculum's impact on protection and morbidity for a generic model. Simulated time-series for different inoculum and resulting protection morbidity were shown. For a vaccine, an optimal inoculum is desired, but no definition exists. A framework was developed to systematically determine inoculum's impact on protection and morbidity. The approach was applied to data to illustrate the concept, showing inoculum doesn't always lead to more protection.
Researchers studied the expression of the hetR gene in Anaba filaments, a type of cyanobacteria, under different nitrogen conditions. The gene hetR is essential for heterocyst differentiation, specialized cells that fix nitrogen. They found fluctuations in hetR expression along filaments are coupled, with a range of two to three cells, indicating interactions between cells. This is different from unicellular organisms where fluctuations are independent. Key factors influencing het expression are Het inhibitor Pat, septal protein Sep, and Het auto-regulation. Under nitrogen-rich conditions, these factors determine fluctuations and distribution. Comparing expression under nitrogen-rich and nitrogen-poor conditions, they found differences in Het inhibitors and sept proteins. The study shows proteins involved in development combine with gene expression variability to create a one-dimensional pattern in the organism.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype has shifted from genotype III (GIII) to I (GI) in China, as shown by molecular surveillance data. To confirm this shift at the seroepidemiological level, a serosurvey was conducted in non-vaccinated pigs, revealing an average ratio of GI/GIII of 1.87, indicating co-circulation of both genotypes with GI being more prevalent. To understand the reasons behind this shift, the replication of seven recently-isolated JEV isolates, including three GI and four GIII strains, was compared in C/36 cells, chicken fibroblast (DF-1) and porine artery endothelial (PIE) cells. GI strains replicated more efficiently than GIII in DF- and PIE cells, particularly in DF-1 with titers 22.9-225.3 higher than GIII. This suggests enhanced replication of GI in avian cells. In vivo, young ducklings were inoculated with GI and GIII at 2 days post-hatching, showing GI-inoculated ducklings had higher viremia and longer vmic duration than GIII-inoculated. These results support the hypothesis of enhanced replication for GI in birds. Thirty-six amino acids differ between GI and GIII, some may be responsible for the replication efficiency of GI in birds. It is speculated that enhanced replication of GI in birds leads to higher exposure and infection in mosquitoes, increasing transmission in the birds-mosquito-bird cycle, contributing to JEV shift.
Researchers studied the genetic network of transcription factors that regulate Candida albicans biofilm formation, a key aspect of its pathobiology. They used a systematic approach to generate all possible double heterozygous mutants of the genes and analyze interactions between them. The network is highly susceptible to genetic perturbation, with six heterozygous mutants showing alterations in biofilm formation, similar to homozygous deletions. Many double heterozygous mutants are as severely affected as homozygous deletions, indicating a highly interdependent "small-world" network that is efficient but not robust. TEC1 is a component whose expression is sensitive to small perturbations in other TFs. RO1 expression is dependent on auto-regulation and cooperative interactions with other TFs. Heterozygous N80 mutant is hyperfilous under bio and hypha-inducing conditions in a T1-dependent manner. The study provides insights into individual TF functions and network topology in biofilm formation. The bio TF network is made of six genes with homozyous deletions decreasing bioformation. Double homozyous deletions limit understanding network interactions due to second mutation effects being difficult to quantify. The network functions and topology contribute to biofilm formation under specific conditions. The study focuses on TF regulating biofilm, a sub-network within the larger bio genetic network.
Researchers studied the enzyme asparagine synthase A (AS) in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis, a disease. AS converts aspartate to asparagine using ammonia or glutamine as a nitrogen source. There are two types of AS: one that uses ammonia and one that uses glutamine. AS is absent in humans but present in trypanosomatids, making it a potential drug target. A previous study found AS was essential in Leish donani, a related parasite, making it a promising target. However, this study found that Leish infant AS can use both ammonia and glutamine as nitrogen sources. They created AS null mutants by replacing the gene in Leish and found no significant growth or infectivity defects. Only under aspar limiting conditions, growth was severely impaired. This suggests AS is not essential for parasite survival or infectivity in normal conditions, making it unsuitable as a drug target.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between toxocariasis and epilepsy. The study included 11 case-control studies from 13 countries with a total of 474 participants, 215 with epilepsy and 259 without. The pooled odds ratio (OR) was 1.69 (95% CI 1.42-2.01) for the association between toxocari seropositivity and epilepsy. A positive association was found in restricted analysis of Western blot (WB) confirmatory test, population and population-based studies. Meta-regression showed no significant association between covariates and outcome. The meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidence of a positive association between toxari seropitivity and epilepsy, mainly supported by population studies. Strategies to reduce toxara spp are advised. Further research is needed to understand the physiopathological mechanisms of toxara-associated epileptogenesis.
Researchers have identified a new pathway in cells respond to DNA damage caused by double-strand breaks (DSBs). This pathway involves a protein called ATM and a microRNA called mi-335. When cells are exposed to radiation, ATM is activated, which leads to a decrease in mi-335, a microRNA that targets a protein called CtIP. CtIP is important for a type of DNA repair called homologous recombination repair (HRR). The study found that a protein called CREB is responsible for most of mi-335 expression by binding to its promoter region. After radiation, CREB is reduced, which is consistent with previous findings that ATM phosphorylates CRE to decrease its activity. Overexpressing mi-335 in cells resulted in lower Ct levels and reduced survival after radiation. In cancer cells with low survival after radiation, mi335 was high, Ct low, and BRCA foci were also low. Treatment with mi-335 antisense oligonucleotide restored survival, BRCA foci, and Ct levels. This suggests an ATM-dependent CRE-mi-335-CtIP axis influences the choice of repair for certain DS lesions.
Researchers investigated how people's ability to attribute mental states, such as beliefs and emotions, to others affects their learning in social interactions. They created a game where participants played against artificial agents with varying levels of sophistication in mentalizing, or attributing mental states. Participants believed they were either playing against other people or in a casino, but results showed they performed better against sophisticated agents in the social framing and worse in non-social. Their choices were best explained by sophisticated mentalizing models in the social framing. This is the first demonstration of mentalizing's added value in social interactions. The study shows deciphering behavior requires attributing mental states to others. 

The research draws from economics and psychology on sophisticated mental processes, such as persuading and deceiving. Decisions in games involve recursive thinking, like "I think you think I think...". Cognitive models were extended to repeated games with Bayesian recognition of others' intentions. Experiments show social learning relies on specific processes predicting others' behavior. In this case, social priors induce a sophisticated interpretation involving mentalizing others. People engage recursive updates specific to social interactions. The "Bayesian brain" hypothesis assumes others are also Bayesian, implying mentalizing updates from others' behavior in mutual exchanges. The task-relevant information is identical in both framings. The prediction is that social framing induces mentalizing and recursive, and domain heuristics prevail in non-social are vulnerable to sophisticated agents.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called FastGM for inferring Gaussian graphical models in biological networks, which is a statistical model that characterizes the dependence between variables in a set of random variables. This model is widely used in analyzing biological networks, such as inferring interactions and comparing networks. Existing methods are either not statistically rigorous or inefficient for high-dimensional data with thousands of variables. The new algorithm is based on a recent proposal by Ren et al, 2015, and is faster by several orders of magnitude than the current algorithm without losing accuracy. It has been tested through simulation studies and applied to real data: transcriptomic from a childhood asthma study and proteomic from Alzheimer's disease. The algorithm estimates global gene or protein networks for disease and healthy samples, revealing interactions and differential networks between cases and controls relevant to diseases. It provides a computationally fast and statistically sound procedure for constructing Gaussian model and inference with high-dimensional data. The algorithm has been implemented in an R package named FastGM.
Researchers studied how striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) in the basal ganglia, a brain structure important for learning and movement, interact with cortical activity. They found that MSN population activity varies on behaviorally relevant timescales, forming assemblies that fire coherently. A model of MSN network showed realistic activity only at certain connectivities and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPs) sizes. They investigated how MSN population interacts with temporally varying cortical activity, as in a task. At high connectivity, a "winner-takes-all" regime was found, where activity separates into stimulus dependent firing and quiescent components. Only a few firing components interact with cortical variations. Around a transition to a more active regime occurs, where cells switch between activity and quies. In this regime, components wander and are independent of cortical variations. Only in this regime, changes interact with many components, allowing sequential assemblies to be reproducibly activated for hundreds of milliseconds. This is maximized at striatal connectivities and IP sizes. The MS network is neither too stable to respond dynamically to cortical variations nor too unstable to respond consistently, but optimized to generate activity for periods after cortical excitation.
Researchers have discovered a new link between polarized exocytosis and endocyt in yeast cells, two processes that were previously thought to be separate. They found that the Rab GTPase Sec4 regulates cortical actin polymerization, which induces endocyt after polarized exocyt to the plasma membrane. Sec4 binds to the Wiskott-Ald Syndrome protein Lasp and actin subunits S1 and S2 during actin patch assembly. Mutations in Sec4 or its guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sec2 inhibit actin formation, while an activating Sec4 mutation accelerates it. In vitro assays, Sec4 promotes Arp/3-dependent actin polymerization, overriding S1 inhibition of Lasp-dependent nucleation. This suggests Sec4 relocates along the membrane from polar exytic sites to endytic sites, promoting actin polymer and compensatory endyt, which refines cell polarization.
Acetamin-induced liver injury in mice is a model for drug-induced liver injury in humans, and understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to prevent or reverse damage. The prevailing hypothesis is that differences in NQI (reactive metabolite) formation within hepatic lobules (NQonation) are necessary and sufficient to explain the phenomenon of necrosis beginning adjacent to the central vein (CV) and progressing outward. However, this hypothesis is challenged by the fact that influential variables cannot be controlled and would require intracellular measurements at different locations within the same mouse. Virtual hepatocytes, configured to exhibit location-dependent behaviors, failed to achieve the phenomenon when employing the NQ-mechanism, which targets acetamin clearance and metabolism. To achieve the phenomenon, at least one additional feature exhibiting zonation in the CV direction is required. Two alternatives were explored: glutathione depletion diminishing in the CV direction and ability to repair damage diminishing in the direction. Inclusion of one feature failed, but inclusion of both enabled achieving the phenomenon. The merged mechanism provides a multile, multiscale explanation of key features of acetamin hepatotoxicity in mice. Variants of the mechanism provide plausible explanations for variation in 24-hour necrosis among genetically diverse strains following a single acetamin dose.
Researchers studied the diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in infants born to infected mothers. Current guidelines rely on detecting parasites in blood or specific antibodies at 10-12 months old. The study quantified parasite levels in 51 congenitally infected children at 3 time points: 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year after birth. Infants diagnosed by microscopy at 1 month had 1700 parasites/mL, those diagnosed at 6 months had 20-500 parasites, and those diagnosed by antibodies at 1 year had 5-20 parasites. Parasites were isolated from 19 children, 18 were genotyped as DTU Tc and 1 as Tc. This is the first study to measure parasite levels in over 50 congenitally infected children. Results show 22 of 51 had parasite levels below detection limit of microscopy. Current treatment is effective, but more sensitive methods are needed for early diagnosis. The study correlated parasite levels with ELISA and genotyped parasites to understand congenital transmission and improve early diagnosis. Only infants with high parasite levels can be diagnosed by microscopy at 1 month, despite 94% sensitivity at 1 year. Three groups were studied: A) neonates diagnosed at 1 month, B) infants diagnosed at 6 months, and C) diagnosed by antibodies at 1 year. Those diagnosed at 6 months had lower parasite levels and those diagnosed by antibodies had lowest levels.
Researchers have developed a simplified model of E. coli that predicts its growth rate and cellular composition based on a coarse-grained representation of its genome. The model assumes E. coli is in a state of balanced exponential growth in a temporally and spatially constant environment with rich resources. The model was applied to measurements of growth and rRNA-protein ratio in seven E. coli strains with rRNA operon copy numbers ranging from one to seven, the wild-type number. Results showed growth decreased in strains with fewer copies. The model reproduced these measurements and suggested that the fraction of macromolecules inside E coli is not fixed when r operon copy is varied. It also predicted that increasing beyond seven results in cytoplasm packed with ribosomes and proteins. Assuming overcrowding weakens binding affinities, growth will not increase beyond wild-type rate. The model suggests changing r operon number in wild E coli in constant environment does not increase growth. Other observations, such as nucle compaction and operon response, are qualitatively consistent. The model proposes principles and suggests further experiments to test its validity.
Arabidopsis thaliana MYB protein R1 (RSM) plays a crucial role in seed germination and seedling development in response to abscisic acid (ABA) and salinity. Previous studies suggest R1 may be involved in plant development, stress, and hormone signaling. However, the mechanisms of R1 action in abiotic stresses are unclear. Downregulation or upregulation of R1 alters sensitivity of seed germination and cotyledon greening to ABA, NaCl, and mannitol in Arabidopsis. R1 expression is dynamically regulated by ABA and NaCl. Transcription factors ELONG HYCOTYL5 (HY) and HYHOMOLOG (HY) regulate R1 via the R promoter. Genetic analyses reveal R1 mediates multiple functions of HY in responses seed germination postgermination to A and abiotic stresses and seedling to salinity. R1 interacts with HYHY in vitro and in vivo. R1 and HY may function as a module in responses A and abiotic stresses. R binds the promoter ABI5, regulating its expression, while R1 interaction stimulates HY binding to ABI. However, no evidence supports R enhances ABI expression by HY. HY and R may converge on ABI promoter independently or dependently regulate ABI and ABI downstream A and stress genes, improving plant adaptation to environment.
Mitochondrial complex I, the largest and most complex proton pump of the respiratory chain, links the transfer of electrons from NAD to ubiquinone to the pumping of four protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. In humans, defects in complex I are involved in a range of degenerative disorders. Recent X-ray analysis of prokary and eukotic complex confirmed that redox reactions are confined to the hydrophil peripheral of the L-shaped molecule and take place at distance from the membrane. This implies that proton pumping within the membrane of I is driven via long conformation coupling. However, the mechanism, number, and identity, and localization of pump sites remain unclear. A study found that deletion of the gene for a small subunit of complex I, a stable sub (nbm) is formed that lacks the dist part of the membrane. Analysis of sub composition of holo and sub by proteomic approaches revealed two subunits (4 and 5) with homology to bacterial Na+/H antiporters missing in nb. Despite this, nb still pumps protons at stoichi of the enzyme. Results provide evidence that membrane of I harbours two functionally distinct modules connected by long helical element.
Researchers investigated the effect of fever on the binding of antibodies to malaria and deng antigens in vitro. They used isothermal titration calorimetry and ELISA to measure the affinity of antibody-antigen complexes at 37°C, 40°C, and 42°C. The results showed a marked increase in affinity at 40°C compared to 37°C or 42°C. Thermal equilibration of the proteins prior to measurement further increased binding. This suggests a positive role for fever in vivo and highlights the importance of thermal priming in enhancing protein-protein affinity for samples with limited availability. 

The study used isothermal titration calorimetry to investigate the formation of deng and malaria immune complexes at 37, 40, and 42. The proteins were equilibrated in vitro for 1 hour at indicated temperatures. This ensured the proteins were subjected to temperatures relevant to fever-inducing pathogens and not lethal in vivo. Elevated temperatures alter membrane fluidity, signalling and gene expression, but the role of febrile in affecting antibody for antigens has not been explored. 

The study focused on in vitro changes in affinities for antibodyant immune complexes of two fever-inducing diseases. Antigens from a viral were used. Restrictions may be for thermally equilated EL samples in higher affin compared to ITC or non-equilated EL data. Data indicate potential for reversible physiological temperatures increasing in vitro affinity for tertiary and quatern epitopes and a thermal step for antibodies binding antig. Thermal equil of partners prior EL or other in vitro may improve affin and inform testing conditions, assisting limited samples.
Researchers have studied how actomyosin cortical flow, a key process in cellular morphogenesis, is controlled by the interaction between force generation and dissipation in networks of actin filaments and myosin motors. They developed a computational model to understand how stress production and dissipation depend on motor activity, cross-link dynamics, and filament turnover. The study found that filament turnover is necessary to maintain stress against external resistance and steady flow in response to external stress. Steady stress increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time τ, then decreases with lifetime above τ. Effective viscosity increases with lifetime up to characteristic τ, then becomes independent of lifetime and dependent on cross dynamics. These dependencies define multiple regimes of steady flow. The model predicts that when lifetimes are shorter than both τ and τ, dependencies of viscosity and steady stress on turnover cancel, making flow insensitive to turnover and dependent on motor and cross dynamics. The study provides a framework for understanding how cells control cortical flow through network remodeling.
Researchers have identified a gene, ANAC060, in Arabidopsis thalian, that makes seedlings insensitive to high sugar levels of glucose and fructose. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was used to map the gene in a Col/C24 population, and it was confirmed in near-isogenic lines. Allelism and transgenic tests showed ANAC lies within the AN060 gene. The AN060 allele confers insensitivity and is dominant over the sugar-sensitive C allele. Genomic and mRNA analysis showed a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in AN060 affects splicing, adding 20 nucleotides and creating a stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein lacking the transmembrane domain (TMD). This version of AN060 is found in 12% of natural Arabidopsis accessions. Glucose induces AN060 expression, requiring abisic acid (ABA) signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and expression showed ABI binds AN060 promoter to activate transcription. AN060 reduces ABA sensitivity and Gl-induced ABA, and ABI expression is reduced in AN060 lines. The sugar-ABA cascade induces AN060, but truncated AN060 attenuates ABA and signaling, resulting in insensitivity.
Researchers studied how the molecule c-di-G (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) signaling pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a type of bacteria that forms biofilms and moves using flagella. They found that a protein called Hsb, a c-di-G synthase, interacts with the Hpt regulatory pathway to control biofilm formation and motility. The Hpt pathway controls biofilm formation, twitching, swimming, swarming, and chemotaxis in P. aeruginosa. Hsb and another protein, Sad, contribute to Hpt regulation of biofilm, but have different effects on Hpt-mediated motility. Hsb acts at the cell poles, while Sad is part of a global regulatory network that contributes to high c-G necessary for biofilm formation. Two DGCs, Hsb and Sad, intersect within this network in a hierarchical order. The Gacsm cascade contributes to c-G necessary for biofilm. Hsb binds anti-sigma factor FlM, inducing flagellar expression. Without Hpt, H acts as a kinase phosphorylating H, decreasing swarming and increasing biofilm. P. aerugin biofilm is controlled by Hpt via reduction of RY small RNA levels.
Researchers investigated how people learn to associate visual cues with motor responses in a task that requires pointing to targets of different shapes. Participants were trained on a subset of shape-motor mapping pairs, where the shape and motor response varied in a continuous manner, with a linear relationship. For example, they had to point right to hit spiky shapes and left to hit round ones. After training, they tested generalization to new shapes along the shape scale. The relationship between shape and motor mapping was always linear, with a correlation of 0.875 and a mapping of 75mm. 

In a test without feedback, participants pointed to shapes not used during training. The shape cue ranged from circular to spiky on a continuous scale, identified by a single parameter, morph. The motor response varied with shape, also in a continuous manner. After the experiment, participants answered if they noticed shape contingencies with pointing behavior. Analysis showed they learned shape-mapping for trained shapes. 

A Bayesian model predicted generalization consistent with categorization, using one mapping or other. Results showed participants applied mapping to trained shape most similar to current, consistent with the model. The model also predicted slower learning with more pairs, confirmed by results. The model and results corresponded, indicating a mechanism for multiple shapeotor mappings.
Researchers studied how climbing fibers, one of the two main inputs to the cerebellum, transmit information from the inferior olivary nucleus. Climbing fibers are thought to be involved in timing motor commands and learning. When activated, they cause large action potentials in cerebellar Purkin cells, silencing them for a brief time. Previous studies showed that climbing fibers can transmit bursts of spikes triggered by olary cell spikes, increasing information transfer to the cerebell. This study used a detailed model of the inferioriv cell to investigate factors affecting climbing burst size. Findings suggest that burst size depends on the phase of subthreshold oscillation and charge flow between soma and dendrite. This means that phenomena like cell synchrony can affect burst through dendritic junctions between olary cells. The cerebellum uses two inputs: mossy fibers and climbing fibers. Climbing carry sensory information about events. It's proposed that variability in olary spikes allows for more information transfer than expected. The study predicts a phase dependency of burst size, but only in a limited range of oscillation amplitudes and cell sizes. Inferior cells fire at 1 Hz, making time coding over multiple events unlikely. To understand what inferior can transfer to cerebell, its electrophysiological properties need investigation. The model predicts a correlation between oscillation phase and spike count, matching previous findings.
Researchers have developed a computational model of liver metabolism to understand how iron is regulated in the body. Iron is essential for life, but too much can be toxic due to its reactive properties. The liver plays a key role in controlling iron levels, and misregulation is linked to many diseases. A detailed map of iron's fate in the body has been created, but how its components interact to regulate levels is unclear. The model includes core components and regulatory mechanisms, validated with published data, and recreated experimental findings. A simulation of an oral iron dose matched a clinical study, and a haemochromosis was simulated by altering a gene mutation. The model provides a quantitative understanding of liver overload in this disease. It supports the liver's role as an iron sensor and a framework for further modelling to identify targets and design experiments.

The model allows "what-if" experiments to test hypotheses, but no comprehensive liver metabolism model exists. Previous models cover specific events, such as iron loading in ferritin. A map of mammalian metabolism shows molecular interactions, including cell types. The present model balances detail and coverage to address hepatic regulation. Quantitative modelling is challenging due to lack of interaction values. The model identifies predictions about regulation to investigate. It's the most detailed model to date, describing regulation, and links genotype to phenotype, as shown with haemochromosis.

Data from various sources, in vitro and animal, were used for parameterisation due to limited human data. This modelling is a clinical approach, integrating data to improve understanding. Iron absorption, transport, and regulation form a complex network. The liver regulates through hepcin secretion. The hepatic network in sensing and regulation was analysed through a model and simulation.
Researchers have developed a computer simulation model to study how molecules move in and out of the cell's nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The NPC is like a gate that controls what enters and leaves the nucleus, and it's crucial for cell function and survival. However, how it works is still not fully understood. The model takes into account the flexible nature of the NPC's structure and the attraction between molecules called karyopherins and FG repeat domains. The simulation shows that a 15 nanometer-sized molecule takes about 2.6 milliseconds to pass through the NPC, with most of the time spent attached to the wall and interacting with the FG layer. The attraction between karyins and FG is dynamic and fast, allowing efficient transport. Almost all binding sites on the karyin are occupied during transport. Without filaments, the NPC is more permeable to molecules, suggesting filaments play a role in selectivity.
Researchers have developed a method to determine the optimal infectious dose of a pathogen for non-human primate (NHP) models, which are commonly used to test interventions against human pathogens such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The goal is to find a dose that infects 50% of the animals, known as the ID50. This is crucial for successful experiments, as too high or too low a dose can lead to false results and waste of animals. The new protocol minimizes the number of animals and resources while estimating the ID50 within 1.5-fold of the true value.

The method involves titrating the infectious agent to achieve a limiting dose that infects a fraction of animals. A high dose can lead to false negative results, while a low dose leads to insufficient infections, wasting animals and resources. A 2-fold error in dose can impact the experiment's power. By following this method, investigators can minimize animals and resources to define the pathogen dose in NPs.

On average, the protocol uses 15-25 animals, 3-5 rounds, and estimates ID50 within 40% of the true value. It is generalizable to any path and model, but critical for NPs where animal use is minimized. The ID50 is determined by iterative exposures of animals to pathogen dilutions, adjusting dose between rounds to achieve 50% infection. This requires understanding the relationship between infection probability and dose.
Researchers studied the adaptation of a first-order auditory neuron (AN2) in crickets in response to amplitude-modulated sound stimuli and found that it adapts to higher intensities with a time constant of 1.5 seconds. This adaptation reduces responses to low-intensity sounds. They investigated whether this adaptation improves signal representation by comparing it to two hypotheses: infom, which maximizes information about the entire signal, and selective, which enhances foreground signals while suppressing background. The team tested adaptation's effect on input-response curves with signals having two or three peaks in amplitude, which infom and selective predict conflicting changes. Using Bayesian analysis, they quantified response shifts and found slight decreases in slopes and higher absolute thresholds than inf's predictions. Contrary to inf, adaptation reduces information when considering the whole signal's range. Response changes also don't align with selective, as loudest part's information doesn't increase but remains constant. Less is transmitted about lower-intensity signals.

The study explored properties of a single AN in crickets' auditory pathway and tested two adaptation principles: infom and selective coding. Adaptation times in crickets range from short to long, with AN2 having a 1-second constant. The first auditory stage's primary task is to maintain and condense information for object recognition. Several adaptation scales are observed, similar to vertebrates and other modalities. Motivated by competing hypotheses, they examined adaptation's effects on multimodal stimuli with two or three modes, mimicking scenes. Optimal selective should shift response to peak intensity, while inf aims to maximize output information.
Researchers investigated the role of polybasic domains in prion protein (Pr) in the propagation of disease-associated prion (PrSc). They created prion proteins lacking one or both polybasic domains and expressed them in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as substrates in serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sCA) reactions. After 5 rounds of sCA, prions lacking the central poly domain (Δ) were formed, but surprisingly, they could bind and induce conversion of poly domain mutant substrates into PrSc molecules. However, Δ-PrSc prions displayed diminished or absent infectivity compared to wild-type Pr, despite seeding normal brain homogen sCA ability. This suggests a novel interaction between Δ-Sc and Pr through poly domains, expanding substrate range and efficient Pr propagation. Poly domain deficient Sc provide the first example of dissociation between brain homogen sCA ability and biological infectivity. Results indicate PrSc propagation may not depend on a single mechanism, but Pr/Sc interaction through poly domains may generate infectivity.
Researchers developed an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework to identify animal behavioral strategies from time-series data. They applied this framework to Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) thermotaxis, a behavior regulated by specific strategies. When fed, C. elegans were placed on a thermal gradient without food, they showed an appetitive response to the temperature. The IR approach revealed that fed worms used both absolute and temporal temperature information, involving two strategies: directed migration (DM) towards temperature and isothermal (IM) migration along constant temperature. DM efficiently reached specific temperatures, explaining thermot behavior when fed. In contrast, starved worms escaped using only absolute, not temporal temperature. The neural basis of these strategies was investigated by applying the method to thermosensory-deficient worms. The IR-based approach is useful for identifying strategies from behavioral data and can be applied to various studies, including decision-making in other organisms.
Researchers have sequenced the genome of Chrychromina tobin, a type of algae, and analyzed its transcriptome over a 24-hour light-dark cycle. The genome is small, compact, with approximately 40% coding for proteins, and encodes 16,777 genes. Genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and metabolism show distinct patterns of expression over the day-night cycle. The genome harbors a hybrid polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal synthase complex, anti-microbial peptides, and proteins for multidrug and toxin extrusion. A new algal xanthin was identified, along with two RuBisCOases shared across algal lineages. Chrychromina tobin genome provides information on evolutionary history, ecology, and economic importance of algae. Algae are key players in aquatic ecosystems, contributing to carbon sequestration, forming harmful blooms, and serving as food source for various species. Their dominance in fresh and marine waters is supported by mixotrophic nature of many taxa. Despite importance, only one alga, Emilian hley, has a sequenced genome. This study provides new insights for aquaculture, nutraceuticals, plastics, and biofuel production, as well as understanding harmful algal events.
Researchers have found that breast cancers that lack the markers ESR1, PGR, and HER2 are often belong to the Basal molecular subtype, which is associated with defective RB, p53, and BRCA pathways. Studies in mice show that inactivating both RB and p53 pathways can suppress cell death in mammary epithelial cells, and concomitant inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant metastatic adenocarcinomas. These tumors are poorly differentiated and have histologic features common to human BRCA-mutated tumors, including heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis. Gene analyses show that tumors share attributes of Bas-like and Claudin-low signatures, two subtypes encompassed by broader triple-negative class defined by clinical markers.

p53 is mutated in 20-30% of human breast cancers and defective pathway intermediates increase breast cancer risk. Nearly all Bas-like cancers with BR1 have conitant p mutation. Gerine BR1 mutation predisposes early breast cancers that are triple-negative and correlate Bas-like in microarray analyses. Results show conitant inactivation of three tumor suppressor pathways in mammaryel has additive on tumor latency and predis highly penetrant carcinomas. Although BR1 accelerated tumorigenesis compared TP, no statistical difference chromosomal number in tumors with or without BR1.

Mouse models mimic TNBC complexity will tools for cellular behavior and triaging new candidates. Bas-like cancers inactivate three suppressors infamous roles familial: RB, p53, and BR1. Others argue Bas-like and Claudin signatures reflect progenitor and cell phenotypes, consistent BR mediating stem/progen celluration. Loss BR activity alter phenotype deregulation EMT inducer SL. CG analysis revealed CN consistent mutations human genomic surveys.
Researchers studied the ecology of Aedes aegypt, the primary vector of deng virus, in rural Kampha Phet, Thailand, to understand how to control its population and prevent deng transmission. They found that Aegypt primarily develops in artificial water-holding containers and most adults do not disperse long distances, so containers in areas with high development density are more likely to be used for oviposition and produce more mosquitoes. The study analyzed 84,840 water samples from 2004-2007 and used regression modeling to assess the effect of larval site density, access to piped water, and seasonal variation on container productivity. A varying-coeff model accounted for differences in productivity between container types and a hurdle model for zeroes and overdispersion in pupal counts. The number and density of larval sites were primary determinants of Aegpt distribution and abundance, and productivity increased with habitat density. An ecological approach accounting for site density is suitable for predicting Aeg population and developing control programs.
Researchers studied how the nematode Caenorhabitis elegans integrates information about its environment and internal state to make decisions about growth and development. They found that the Target of Rapamycin complex 2 (TOR2) in the intestine sends signals to the brain about the quality and quantity of food, allowing the animal to adjust its behavior and development accordingly. During larval development, TOR2 regulates the expression of two genes, daf-7 and d-28, in sensory neurons to decide whether to grow or enter the alternate dauer stage. In the adult, TOR2 modulates foraging behavior through a neuropeptide signaling pathway. The study also found that genetic variation affects larval and adult traits and identified quantitative loci associated with these traits. This suggests that TOR2 acts as a hub for gut-to-brain communication, influencing neuronal function by internal state.
Researchers have identified clusters of genes that are active in embryonic stem cells and primordial germ cells, which are essential for maintaining their pluripotency. These genes are involved in transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair. A novel algorithm, Compoby, was developed to predict short DNA sequences that regulate gene expression by combining aligned and non-aligned genome sequences with a probabilistic model. Compoby identified conserved motifs in upregulated genes in pluripotent cells. The motifs are active in undifferentiated mouse embryonic and germ cells in a sequence-specific manner and act as enhancers with an endogenous promoters. Importantly, their activity is conserved in human embryonic cells. The transcription factor NF-Y binds to one motif and is differentially expressed during cell differentiation and required for cell proliferation. This study provides insights into transcriptional networks of plurotent cells and suggests a systematic approach can be applied to mammalian species.
Researchers have studied the structure of a complex made up of two proteins, N and P, which are essential for the replication of a type of virus called vesicular stomatitis virus. This virus has a non-segmented, negative-strand RNA, meaning its genetic material is not divided into separate pieces. To replicate, the virus needs a continuous supply of protein N in the form of a complex with P. The researchers created a version of N without its first 21 amino acids and a 60 amino acids of P that includes a region that binds to RNA-free N. They crystallized this complex and solved its structure at a resolution of 3.0 angstroms, revealing how this region folds upon binding to N and competes with RNA polymerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering and NMR experiments confirmed the binding of this region and showed its flanking parts remain flexible in the complex. The structure suggests a mechanism for initiation of viral RNA synthesis and encapsidation of newly synthesized RNA.
Researchers studied the role of gap junctions, a type of electrical synapse, in the fly's visual system, specifically in the vertical (VS) network, which processes visual information. They found that gap junctions enable the VS to efficiently encode the axis of rotation, θ, of the fly's motion, within 10 milliseconds of visual input onset. This efficiency is near-optimal, meaning it reaches the physical limits set by the visual input's statistical structure. The VS is connected to downstream pathways through a subset of cells, and the subpopulation with gap junctions encodes θ more efficiently than the whole network, and is robust to various signal-to-noise ratios. This efficient encoding is necessary for the fly's visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers. Gap junctions only impact the system's readout, not the dendritic input, suggesting neural circuit principles may be richer than previously thought. The study shows how specific connectivity leads to efficient sensory encoding.
Researchers have identified human-select glycoprotein ligand-1 (PS-1) as a receptor for enterovirus 71 (EV) entry and replication in leukocytes. PS-1 is a sialucin on the surface of leukocytes and serves as a high-affinity counterceptor for selectins, mediating leukocyte rolling on endothelium. The PS-1-EV interaction requires sulfation of at least one of three tyrosines and adjacent O-glycan sial Lewis in the N-terminal of PS-1. To elucidate the molecular basis of PS-1-EV interaction, researchers generated PS- mutants and identified post-transational modifications critical for PS binding to EV. They expressed PS mutants in 293 cells and transfected cells were assayed for abilities to bind EV by flow cytometry. O-glycosylation on T57, critical for PS-select interaction, is not necessary for PS binding to EV. On the other hand, site-directed mutagenesis one or more tyrosine sulfation in N-terminal PS significantly impaired PS binding to EV. An inhibitor of sulfation, sodium, chlorate, blocked PS-EV interaction and PS-mediated replication in Jurkat cells in dose-dependent manner. The study reveals tyros sulfation, not Olycosylation, in N-terminal PS may facilitate entry and replication EV in leukocytes.
Researchers investigated the therapeutic potential of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in controlling Leishmanias, a serious global health problem affecting millions worldwide. Current treatments are limited by toxicity and emergence of resistant strains. Inhibitors of mTOR have shown anti-parasitic properties. This study tested three mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin, G-645, and K-379, in BAL/c mice infected with Leish major. Results showed that clinically relevant doses of rapycin and G-645, but not K-379, significantly reduced foot swelling and parasite load in draining lymph nodes. Importantly, rapycin did not kill promastigotes in vitro. Treatment with rapycin also reduced IL-4 production in splenocytes and increased IFN:IL-4 ratio, indicating a Th1-skewed cytokine profile. Expression of CD, an activation marker, on splenic and lymph CD4 and CD8 cells was enhanced in rapycin-treated mice. These findings suggest mTOR inhibitors may be used in leishias management, with beneficial effects stemming from immunomodulatory properties.
Researchers have studied the process of natural transformation in Neisser species, where bacteria take up free DNA and incorporate it into their genomes, becoming genetically altered. To prevent unwanted transformation, some species preferentially take up their own DNA containing a specific sequence called DUS. They found that Com is the receptor for D in Neisser species, allowing them to analyze the D-Com interdependence. By manipulating Com levels in Neisser meningidis, they found that D-enhanced transformation is dependent on Com, which also controls transformation without D. The inner bases of D are essential, as single mutations impaired interaction with Com and transformation. Interestingly, naturally occurring D variants in human Neisser species, differing from D by one or two bases, are impaired for transformation in Ne meningidis. They showed that Com from Ne sub commal binds its cognate D variant and mediates D-enhanced transformation in a Com mutant Ne meningidis, confirming a similar mechanism used by Neisser species to promote their or related DNA. These findings reveal the molecular events in the earliest transformation step and a mechanism for modulating gene transfer between species sharing a niche.
In the process of cell division in yeast, a contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and septum formation are crucial for cell separation. While many CAR proteins have been identified, how they interact with septum enzymes to form the septum is unclear. A study in yeast shows that cooperation between Pxl, a protein required for ring integrity, and B1, enzyme for β-1,3 glucan synthesis and septum formation, is necessary for CAR anchorage to the plasma membrane before division and furrow formation. Without Pxl and B1, ring contraction and cell growth occur without septum formation. Pxl concentration at CAR increases during cytokinesis and depends on the SH domain of protein Cdc15. B1 depletion in cells with cdcΔ3 allele causes ring disassembly and block, as in cells lacking P1. Absence of P1 is lethal when C15 function is affected, causing CAR sliding with septum material along cortex. Findings indicate CAR anchorage through C15 and Pxl, and conitant B1 activity are necessary for CAR and septum formation in yeast. B1 and P1 cooperate to maintain CAR position and integrity during cytokinesis, essential for septum synthesis. In yeast, R1 inactivation is required for septum formation. P1 increases R1 activity, impeding septum upon B1 repression in px1 cells. Results suggest C15, through SH, and P1 cooperates with B1 to confer CAR stability and septum during cytokinesis.
Researchers investigated a recent outbreak of glanders, a highly infectious disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia malle, in Bahrain. They used high-resolution genotyping and whole-genome sequencing to analyze samples from infected horses and a camel, and compared them to samples from a 2004 outbreak in the United Arab Emirates. The results showed that the Bahrain outbreak was caused by two distinct B. malle strains, suggesting multiple introductions. The strains from Bahrain were more closely related to B. malle from the 2004 UAE outbreak than other B. m, indicating repeated importation from similar sources. High-resolution genotyping and whole-genome analysis revealed phylogenetic patterns among samples. The relationship between Dubai/UAE B. malle populations may indicate a shared geographic origin yet to be identified. The emergence of glanders with horse trading poses a risk for human infections.
A study was conducted to investigate the clinical and parasitological features of patients with American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) who did not respond to treatment with Glucime (a pentavalent antimonial). The study included 43 patients from three Colombian National Army reference centers for complicated ACL, who had received at least one round of treatment with Glime 20mg/kg/day for 20 days and experienced treatment failure or relapse. Leishmania braziliensis was the predominant infecting species (95.4%) and 35% of parasites showed decreased susceptibility to Glime in vitro. Lesion size and infectivity were negatively correlated with Glime susceptibility (r=-0.548 and -0.726, respectively). A negative correlation was found between lesion size and parasite resistance. Leish brazili was the main species associated with treatment failure or relapse. The study suggests that a second round of treatment with pentavalent derivatives may not be effective for ACL caused by Leish brazili.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the biosynthetic pathways of siderophores and colactin genotoxin in Escheria coli. They found that two phosphantin transferases, Ent and ClA, are involved in the production of these molecules. Ent is part of the core genome, while ClA is encoded on a pathogenic island, pks, which is associated with high pathogenic island H in some virulent E. coli strains. The team demonstrated that ClA can contribute to siderore synthesis and that inactivation of both Ent and ClA abolished virulence in a mouse model. The presence of either Ent or ClA is required for survival in vivo. This is the first report of multiple phosphin-requiring pathways leading to distinct metabolites in a microorganism. The association of pks with H may be due to ClA's ability to synthesize both genoto and siderores.
Researchers have developed a new probabilistic model for calculating the probability of a multiple sequence alignment given a phylogenetic tree and evolutionary model, accounting for insertion and deletion events in addition to substitutions. The model, called probabilistic phylogenetic inference with insertions and deletions, uses a rate matrix augmented by a gap character and starts from a continuous Markov process to construct a non-reversible birth-death evolutionary model for insertions and deletions. This model assumes insertion and deletion occur one residue at a time. The researchers applied this model to phylogenetic inference by extending the program dnaml in phip, a widely used tool for phylogenetic inference. They tested the new model on simulated data and real ribosomal RNA alignments, showing it improves accuracy relative to ignoring gaps while retaining efficiency of Felsen's peeling algorithm. 

The new model accounts for insertion and deletion events in addition to substitutions, unlike widely used phylogen models, which only account for residue events. Felsen's pe algorithm efficiently calculates probability of ungapped alignment given model and tree, scaling linearly with length and number of sequences. Its economy makes it basis for maximum likelihood methods in many phylogen inference tools, including phip, paup, and others. The new model describes evolution of residues in one column given phylogen tree, with total alignment probability as product of each column probability.
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infects the skin through the mucous membrane before entering nerve endings. In the skin, epidermal Langerh cells (LCs) are the first dendritic cells (DCs) to encounter HSV, but it is CD103+ dermal DCs that carry viral antigen to lymph nodes for presentation, suggesting cross-talk in the skin. This study compared topically HSV-1 infected human skin explants with biops of initial human herpes lesions, showing LCs are initially infected then emigrate into the dermis. LC bearing markers of maturation and apoptosis formed large clusters with BD3+ dermal DC (thought to be equivalent to murine CD+ dermal DC) and DC-S+ macrophages. HSV-expressing LC were observed inside dermal DC/macrophages and BD3 dermal DC had upregulated damaged uptake receptor CLEC9. No infected epidermal cells interacted with dermal DC. Correspondingly, LC isolated from skin infected with HSV-1 in vitro underwent apoptosis and were taken by BD3 dermal DC and S+ cells. A viral relay takes place where infected LCs undergo apoptosis and are taken by dermal DC for antigen presentation. This provides rationale for targeting these cells with mucosal or intradermal immunization.
Researchers studied the formation of parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) in mouse macrophages infected with Leishmania parasites. They compared PV formation in macrophages exposed to Leish amastigotes of Leishmania major and Leish amazonensis. Tight-fitting PVs, housing one or two L major amastigotes, and giant PVs housing many L amazon amastotes were observed. Using multidimensional imaging, they characterized PV formation and remodeling in macrophages hosting amastotes of L major or amazon and loaded with lysotracker, a lysosotropic probe. Three features of Leish amigote-hosting PVs were documented: entry of lysacker into tight-fitting, fission-prone L major PV, decrease in macrophage vesicles during L major PV and amazon PV enlargement, and amazon PV remodeling homotypic fusion. Multidimensional images provided new insights into Leish species differences in PVogenesis and remodeling, useful for studying other intracellular microorganisms.
Researchers investigated how chromatin structure influences the use of homologous sequences as donors for repair in the chicken cell line DT40. Immunoglobulin genes undergo sequence diversification through gene conversion templated by pseudogene donors. The immunoglobulin V pseudogene array is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin. The study demonstrated the importance of chrom structure for conversion using a regulatable system where heterochrom protein HP (Drosoph melanogaster Su) was expressed as a fusion to Escheria lactose repressor, tethered to polymerase operators within the pseudoλ array. Tethered HP diminished histone acetylation within pseudoλ and altered the outcome ofλ diversification, favoring non-templated mutations over templated mutations. Chromatin regulates homology repair. Histone modifications may contribute to genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences.

The study used immunoglob gene diversification in chicken cells as a model for homolog recombination. Mutations accumulated in Lac-1 transfectants resembled thwarted recombinational repair, characteristic of cells lacking transacting factors for recombination or some of the V donor array. HP regulates chrom structure and heteroch gene silencing by partnering histone transferase and deacetylase. Tethering HP to LacO inrosila showed chrom inactivation of neighboring genes. Tethering vertebrate hist methylase to GAL site impaired nonolog-mediated recombination.

Chromatin regulates homolog re has practical implications. Effort is directed toward harnessing homology repair for gene therapy by providing a donor gene to replace deficient. Results suggest permissive structure at the donor will be important in developing genes for therapy. The study manipulated chromatin at Ig locus in DT40, finding pseudo donors acetylated histones, indicating open structure.
Researchers studied how the cerebellum, a part of the brain that helps adjust motor behavior in response to changing situations, learns from past mistakes. It's thought that the cerebellum uses the difference between desired and actual behavior, or "error", to guide learning. This error not only affects immediate behavior but also leads to lasting changes in connections between brain cells that help adjust behavior. Climbing fibers, which connect to these cells, are believed to carry error information for learning but not memory. The study tested monkeys in a task that challenges this idea. They found a clear signal of error at the time of mistake and a repeat of this signal before a new behavior to improve it. This contradicts the idea that climbing fibers only communicate immediate errors. A previous study on short-term sacc adaptation, a model of cerebell learning, found patterns that didn't match this idea. The study looked at how climbing fiber signals relate to motor learning and wondered if they might be secondary to changes in simple spike discharge. A random sacc adaptation task was used to avoid gradual changes and diminishing error that could obscure the error's fingerprint. The study found changes in climbing fiber discharge before upcoming sacc were a reflection of past errors. The role of climbing fibers in sacc learning has been debated with conflicting findings. It's thought they convey information for future behavior improvement through two types of fibers, climbing from the olive.
Researchers have studied the protein TDP-43, which is often found in the cells of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease that causes loss of motor neurons. In a yeast model of ALS, they found that overexpressing T-43 causes cell damage and reduces the cell's ability to break down misfolded proteins. They also found that overexpressing the protein S1, a type of chaperone, reduces T-43's effect on cell damage and protein breakdown. This effect was influenced by the presence of a yeast protein, Pin1. Overexpressing S1 changed T-43's pattern, but did not physically bind to it, suggesting an indirect effect on T-43 aggregation. Overexpressing the mammalian S1 homologue, DNA1, relieved T-43 toxicity in rodent neurons, suggesting S1 and its homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS. T-43 aggregation is associated with ALS and other diseases and overexpressed T-43 is toxic in yeast and mammalian neurons. The study found that T-43 inhibits the cell's ability to break down misfolded proteins by the ubiquitin proteome system. There are many chaperones in mammalian cells, one of which, DNA1, is similar to S1. The researchers overexpressed WT and mutant T-43 with familial ALS in rodent neurons and found that overing S1 and DNA1 reduces T-43 toxicity. This study identifies S1 as a modifier of T-43 toxicity and suggests S1 and its homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS.
A study was conducted to investigate the parasite load and molecular diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi in patients with chronic Chagas disease from different regions of Brazil. Sixty-five patients were recruited, aged 26-76, with a median of 54 years, 34 females and 31 males. Thirty-five (53.8%) presented amplification by real-time PCR, 20 (30.7%) with the indeterminate form and 15 (23.1%) the cardiac form of the disease. The parasite load for all positive patients was 2.54 [1.43-11.14] parasite/mL, ranging from 0.12 to 153.66.66. Notably, the load was higher in patients over 70 years (20.05 [18.29-86] parasite/mL). Using guanidine-ED blood spiked with T. cruzi strains, it was possible to genotype up to 0.5 parasite/mL with high specificity. Of patients positive PCR, 28 (80%) were identified T. cruzi DT, while 20% had partial results. Analysis showed prevalence of TVI, TII, and mixed TVI+II equal 40%, 17.1%, and 14.3%, respectively. Two were infected by TV and one co-infected by III+VI, all in chronic chag cardiomyopathy stage, born in Bahia State, northeast Brazil. T cruz genotypes compared to load showed elevated loads in infected II (7.56 parasite/mL) compared to VI (2.35/mL). However, frequency of cardiomyopathy was 50% in VI and 16.7% in II.
A study on rabies in bats was conducted in Guatemala between 2009 and 2011, as part of a larger pathogen detection program. A total of 672 bats from 31 species were sampled and tested for rabies virus (RV). The prevalence of RV among all bats was low, at 0.3%. Viral antigens and infectious virus were detected in the brains of two common vampire bats (Desmodus rotus). RV was also found in oral swabs, lungs, and kidneys of both bats, while viral RNA was detected in all tissues except the liver of one. Sequencing of the nucleoprotein showed both viruses were 100% identical, while glycoprotein sequencing revealed one nonsynonymous substitution. The two vampire RV isolates were phylogenetically related to viruses associated with vampire bats in eastern Mexico and El Salvador. Additionally, 7% of 398 sera from bats demonstrated RV neutralizing antibodies. The proportion of seropositive bats varied across troph guilds, suggesting complex intraspecific compartmentalization of RV perpetuation.
Researchers investigated the role of lamin A in herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication and found that it plays a crucial role in targeting the viral genome to the nuclear periphery and reducing heterochromatin on viral promoters. HSV replication compartments were smaller and failed to target the periphery in lamin-deficient cells compared to wild-type cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies showed HSV associated with increased heterochatin in lamin-deficient cells. This suggests lamin is required for viral expression, replication, and growth, with greatest effect on replication at low multiplicity of infection. Lamin/C serves as a scaffold for DNA and protein complexes regulating euchatin and heterochatin modifications. The study provides evidence for lamin-dependent targeting of HSV to the periphery associated with reduction of heterochatin on lytic genes and suggests a role in lamin maintenance of heterochatin and silencing.
Researchers studied the structure of the TOM (translocase of the outer membrane) complex in hydrogenosomes, a type of mitochondria found in the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. Hydrogenosomes are metabolically anaerobic, meaning they don't use oxygen to produce energy, and are found in excavates, a group of eukaryotes. The TOM complex is crucial for importing proteins into mitochondria, but its structure varies between eukotic lineages. The study found that the hydrogenosomal TOM complex, TvOM, has a divergent β-barrel structure and forms a trans channel for protein import. It's composed of four subunits: Tom40, Tom36, Tom46, and Tom22, and an outer membrane protein19. Tom40 and Tom46 have domains that bind to hydrogenosomal proteins, likely acting as receptors. Tom22 has a short domain and conserved transmembrane segment but lacks a domain. Protein19 has no known homology. The study also found that TvOM is associated with sorting and assembly machinery, involved in β-bar assembly. Electron microscopy revealed TvOM has three pores and an unusual skull-like shape, despite lacking Tom7. Phylogenetic profiling predicted Tom7 in freeivingates. The results suggest that the triplet-p TOM complex, composed of three conserved subunits, was present in the last eukotic ancestor, while receptors for substrate binding evolved in different euk lineages.
Researchers have studied the role of CD4 and CD8 T cells in autoimmune diseases, which occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own cells. They analyzed genetic variations in these cells to understand how they contribute to disease. The study found specific genes associated with autoimmune diseases in CD4 and CD8 cells, including a region on chromosome 12 that affects the R26 gene. A variant in the IL27 gene was linked to type 1 diabetes, reducing protein activity and expression of IR1 and STAT in CD4 cells. This suggests IL27 may promote autoimmunity in the pancreas by upregulating the STAT pathway. CD4 regulatory T cells play a key role in controlling autoimmune diseases. Genome studies have identified thousands of genetic variations linked to immune diseases. This study mapped genetic variations in CD4 and CD8 cells, revealing effects on genes associated with autoimmune diseases, showing high specificity and sensitivity. A variant in the R26 gene may affect protein stability or translation of many mRNAs, but its role in type 1 diabetes is unclear. Other genes in the region, such as IK4, ER3, and CD2, may also be involved. A variant in IL27 was found to significantly affect IR1 and STAT in CD4 cells, suggesting it may promote autoimmunity in the pancreas by upregulating the STAT pathway.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, socio-economic factors and cultural barriers hinder the uptake of screening and treatment for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). A qualitative study was conducted in two provinces, Bandu and Kasai Oriental, to understand these barriers. Interviews with current and former H patients, healthcare providers, and program managers of the National Trypanosomiasis Control Program revealed prohibitions after H treatment: no work, no sex, no food, and no sun exposure. Violating these restrictions is believed to cause severe and deadly complications. These prohibitions are well-known by the community, leading people to avoid H screening due to fear of observing tabo upon diagnosis. Originally to mitigate melarsol's adverse effects, they are now obsolete with new safer drugs. Health providers must address community concerns through dialogue to keep up with treatment transformations.

The study aimed to understand these prohibitions' origin and rationale to improve H control in DRC, coordinated by the National Trypaniasis Control Program. Medical advice on H management transformed into tabo, impacting suboptimal uptake of H screening. Tabo might be abandoned with safer options, as seen with NECT. Restrictions negatively affected participation and adherence. Their origin unclear, whether self-imposed or provider-imposed, and basis unknown. Given impact, perceptions were explored in depth. Conducted in provinces with high H prevalence, where tabos identified. Not explored in lower prevalence areas. Follow-up after H no longer recommended by WHO. Non-participation compromises control objectives, explained by multiple factors, including community-enforced prohibitions associated with H treatment.
In Eastern Sudan's Gedare State, Médecins Sans Frontières has been treating patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) at Tabarak Hospital since 2009. A survey was conducted to estimate VL incidence in villages around Tabarak. Between May 5-17, 2011, an exhaustive door-to-door survey was done in 45 villages of Alure locality. Deaths were investigated by verbal autopsies. Individuals with fever for at least two weeks, VL diagnosed in previous year, and clinical post-kala-azar dermal leishiasis (PKDL) suspicion were referred to medical teams for ascertainment. A new VL case was a suspect with positive rk39 rapid or direct agglut test. In 45 villages, 17,702 households were interviewed for 94,369 inhabitants. Crude rate over 409 days was 0.13/10,000 people. VL was possible probable cause for 19% deaths. VL-specific rate was 0.9/100 per year. Teams examined 551 for fever at least two weeks, 16 diagnosed primary VL. Incidence over year 7.0/100 persons or 7.9/100 when possibly due were included. 12.5% reported past treatment. VL represents significant burden in Gedare State. Active case detection had low yield with adequate care, not priority to enhance in similar contexts.
Researchers studied how supercoiling in bacterial chromosomes is controlled in Escherichia coli and Salmonella. They found that supercoiling occurs in two forms: diffusible and constrained. Diffible supercoils are free to move around the chromosome, while constrained supercoils are caused by proteins that bend, loop, or unwind DNA. Both forms contribute equally to total supercoiling in cells. However, Escheria coli has 15% higher supercoiling than Salmonella. To understand how diffible supercoiling is controlled, they analyzed Salmonella with a supercoil sensor inserted at 10 positions around the genome. The sensor monitored supercoiling and transcription rates in wild-type and mutant strains. Transcription increased supercoiling upstream and decreased it downstream of highly expressed genes. Topoisomerase I relaxed excess supercoiling, while gyrase replenished it to maintain equilibrium. Strains with gyrase mutations at permissive temperature showed supercoil losses from 30% of WT to total loss at most locations. Supercoiling was influenced by transcription, as rifampicin caused superco to rebound throughout the chromosome. Gyrase mutants also reduced transcription rates throughout the genome. The study found a link between RNA polymerase elongation and gyrase turnover, suggesting fast-growing bacteria may have higher supercoiling than slow-growing species.
Researchers studied how the parasite Leishmania amazonensis, which causes cutaneous leishmaniasis, grows inside host cells. They found that the parasite grows in parasitophorous vacuoles (PV), which are similar to late endosomes and lysosomes, and that expand during infection. However, the impact of PV size on parasite survival was unknown. The study showed that host cells infected with L. amazonensis upregulate the gene LYSTBe, which regulates lysosome size. Mutations in LYSTBe caused PV expansion and enhanced L. amazonensis replication, while overexpression of LBe led to small PV that did not sustain parasite growth. Treatment of LBe overexpressing cells with vacolin reversed this, expanding PV and promoting growth. The opposite was seen with E-64, which reduced PV in LBe mutant cells and inhibited amazon replication. Large PV appear to protect parasites from oxidative damage, as inhibition of nitric oxide synth had no effect on amazon viability in large PV, but enhanced growth in LBe-induced small PV. The study found that upregulation of LBe in infected cells functions as a host response to limit parasite growth by reducing PV and inhibiting intracellular survival.
Researchers have been trying to understand the mechanisms and treatments for psychomotoration, a condition characterized by motor and cognitive impairment. Allan-Hndonudley syndrome (AH) is an X-linked psychotoration characterized by delayed development, severe intellectual disability, muscle hypotonia, and spastic parapleg, with disturbed thyroid hormone (TH) parameters. Mutations in the monocarboxyl transporter 8 (M8) gene, a TH transporter, have been associated with AH. To determine the pathophysiology of AH, M8 knockout mice were studied, but they replicated abnormal TH levels, but not neurological symptoms. An M8 mutant zebraf were generated using zinc-finger nuc (Z) mediated gene editing. Elimination of M8 decreased TH levels, but not other TH-related genes. Similar to patients, M8 larvae exhibited neurological and behavioral deficiencies. High-throughput assays showed reduced locomotor activity, response to light and dark transitions, and increased sleep. Deficiencies were associated with myelin and neuron formation. Time-lapse imaging revealed reduced filopodia, axon branching, and synaptic density in sensory and motor neurons. This suggests M8 regulates neural assembly, mediating sensory and motor performance. Administration of TH analogs restored myelin and axon growth in M larvae.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common virus that affects newborns and immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients. It infects various cell types using different entry pathways involving forms of the g/g glycoprotein: g/gL/g, gL, and g/UL-131, as well as the fusion glycoprotein B. However, the minimal core machinery for cell fusion is gL and B. This study shows that CMV B and g/g form a stable complex early in the absence of other proteins. g can interact with B mutants unable to mediate cell fusion. B-gL complexes make up to 16-50% of total g in CM virus particles. In contrast, small amounts of g/gL and g/UL-131 complexes are associated with B. Herpesviruses express B and g/g molecules, and most models suggest g interacts B to mediate fusion, but there is no direct evidence. For herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), it has been suggested that after binding gL binds B either before or coincident with fusion. This study's results have implications for these models, demonstrating CM B and g form stable B-gL complexes in virions without receptor or fusion. Data supports the proposal that g interacts B.
Researchers have discovered a gene called Gimap that plays a crucial role in regulating the segregation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in a specific types of cells called leukocytes. Mitochondrial DNA is the genetic material found inside the mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells. The segregation of mtDNA variants, or mutations, determines the onset and severity of certain diseases. In this study, scientists used a mouse model to show that Gimap, an outer membrane protein, regulates mtDNA in leukocytes. Gimap is essential for cell development and survival, suggesting that cell survival may be a factor in regulating mtDNA variants and human diseases.

The study found that Gimap is the first nuclear-encoded gene influencing mtDNA segregation in mammals. It regulates the rate of mtDNA in hematopoietic tissues, which produce blood cells. The segregation of mtDNA in these tissues is complex and age-dependent, but not related to the number of mtDNA copies. A variation in the G3 gene, called CASTi, changes the protein sequence but not its membrane anchoring domain. The protein localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane.

Gimap's role in younger mice is unclear, but it's critical in regulating mtDNA in hematietic tissues. The protein doesn't directly interact with mtDNA as it doesn't span the membrane. Overexpression of G3 in cells didn't affect heteroplas levels. This suggests a cell-specific pathway is required for mtDNA segregation. Mitochondrial copy number may influence mtDNA segregation and human mutations.
Researchers in Victoria, Australia studied the incubation period of Buruli ulcer (BU), a skin and soft tissue infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, to understand how long it takes for symptoms to appear after exposure to the bacteria. Most people who get BU live in areas where it's common, but in Victoria, a significant number of cases come from visitors to these areas. The researchers looked at 443 cases between 2013-2016 and found the mean incubation period, or time between exposure and symptom onset, was 143 days (4.8 months), similar to a previous estimate of 135 (4.5) months. This was despite the area where people got infected shifting from the Bellarine to Morning peninsula. They found no link between incubation period and age, sex, exposure duration, or location of the lesion. The study confirms the incubation period of BU in Victoria is 4-5 months, which can help guide clinicians and suggests the mode of transmission is similar in different regions.
Researchers have identified a protein in the Toxoplas parasite that is related to the human Niemann-Pick type 1 protein (NPC), which plays a crucial role in cholesterol regulation and lipid trafficking. The protein, named TCR1, shares similarities with NPC and contains residues associated with human disease. Unlike NPC, TCR lacks endosomal targeting signals and localizes to flattened vesicles beneath the parasite's plasma membrane. When expressed in mammalian NPC mutant cells, TCR restores cholesterol and GM1 clearance from endosomes. Disrupting TCR in the parasite results in normal cholesterol levels but overaccumulation of cholesteryl esters, sphingomyins, and ceramides. The mutant parasites exhibit abundant lipid storage bodies and membranous tubules from parasitoph vacuoles. They replicate faster in vitro and are more virulent in mice than the parental strain. This suggests TCR's role in lipid homeostasis in Tooplas is to control intracellular lipid levels, leading to stimulation of storage, biosynthesis, and division.
Researchers have identified a genetic mutation in the SMOC1 gene as the cause of ophthalmoacelic syndrome (AS), a rare disorder characterized by eye malformations, including anophthalmia, and postaxial oligodactyly. Homozygosity mapping and targeted mutation analysis of the SM1 gene on chromosome 14q24 identified mutations in eight unrelated families, four of which were nonsense, frameshift, and two missense. Missense mutations were in the thyrogulin-1 domain of the protein. The mouse ortholog, Sm1, shows site and stage-specific expression during eye, limb, craniofac, and somite development. A targeted gene-trap mutation of Sm1 reduced mRNA to 10% of wild-type levels, resulting in highly penetrant hindlim postax oligodactly in homozyg mutant animals. Eye malform, coloma and cleft occurred in a proportion of mutant embryos and pups. Loss of Sm1 results in a convincing phenocopy of the disease. SM1 is a mammalian paralog of Drosoph Pentone, an inhibitor of decaplegic, and Xenopus Sm1 functions as BMP antagonist in early embryogenesis. Loss of BMP antagon during mammalian development explains limb and eye phenotypes in humans and mice.
Researchers have found that a protein called TRIM22 plays a key role in restricting the replication of the HIV virus in human cells treated with type 1 interferon. They identified TR22 as one of the most upregulated genes in cells treated with interferon and confirmed that overexpression of TR22 inhibited HIV replication. To understand the role of TR22 under natural conditions, they compared the effects of interferon in cells depleted of TR22 using RNA interference and found that HIV release was significantly increased in knockdown, indicating TR22 acts as an antiviral effector. Further studies showed that TR22 inhibited the release of virus particles containing Gag, indicating G was the target of TR22. TR22 did not block the release of ML or EIA G particles. Inhibition was associated with diffuse cytoplasmic staining of G rather than accumulation at the plasma membrane, suggesting TR22 disrupts proper trafficking. Mutational analyses of TR22 showed that catalytic amino acids Cys and Cys of the R domain are required for TR22 antiral activity. The study discloses a pathway by which type 1 interferons obstruct HIV replication.
Researchers studied the relationship between fig trees (Ficus) and their specific pollinators (Agonid wasps) to understand why this mutualism is stable. In figs are pollinated by wasps that lay their eggs in the tree's "fruits" (syconia). However, not all wasps can lay eggs in all parts of the fig, and some areas are more vulnerable to parasitic wasps that lay eggs from outside the sycon. The study found that in one fig species, Ficus rubosa, outer areas are more vulnerable to parasitic wasps, but inner areas are safer. This difference in viability may encourage wasps to focus on inner areas, reducing galling rates and contributing to mutualism stability. This is a new explanation for why wasps favor inner areas for oviposition, previously unexplained by other factors such as plant defenses or pollinator constraints. In most fig species, syia receive more wasps than needed, leaving some seeds unexplained, suggesting parasitic wasps play a role in stability. The fig-poll mutualism is a classic example of obligate mutualism, where wasps pollinate and trees provide resources for was offspring. Parasitic wasps may contribute to this stability by selecting inner areas for oviposition due to reduced parasitism. The study shows wasps gain fitness by choosing inner areas with lower parasitism, controlled by the fig, the larger partner in the symbiosis.
Researchers studied how genetic and environmental factors affect plant height in a specific type of grass called Setaria. They grew a group of plants with a mix of genetic traits from two different types of Setaria, one wild and one domesticated, in controlled environments with varying water and density. The study found that plant height is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, with water and density affecting growth. The results suggest that plant height is a complex trait controlled by multiple genes that work together, but can be influenced by environment. The study also found that genetic factors that control height change over time, with some genes affecting early growth and others later in development. The researchers identified 37 genetic locations associated with height in the plants, but found that only a small part of these are from known genes from other plants in the same family. The study contributes to understanding how plant growth is influenced by genetic and environmental factors over time, which is important for understanding how traits are determined. Plant height is a key component of architecture, easy to measure, and important for agriculture, making it a focus of study for over a century.
A study was conducted in the Pantanal wetlands of western Brazil to investigate the circulation of zoonotic arboviruses, which are viruses that can be transmitted between animals and humans. The region is home to a diverse range of wildlife and hematophagous arthropods, such as mosquitoes, which can facilitate the spread of these viruses. Previous research had shown that horses in the area had antibodies to various flaviviruses, including the Ilus virus (ILV), but virus isolation had not been confirmed. To further investigate, 3,234 adult mosquitoes from 16 species were collected in 2009-2010 and tested for infectious virus and flaviral RNA. One pool of 50 non-engorged female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes tested positive for ILV by culture and real-time PCR, indicating a minimum infection rate of 2.5 per 1,000. The full genomic sequence showed 95% identity to the only available ILV genome. This confirms ILV circulation in the Pantanal. The region's wetlands host diverse wildlife and arthropods, favoring zoonotic virus circulation. Despite scarce data on arboirus vectors, local mosquito species reported as vectors have been found in the north and south Pantanal. In 2009, a flavivirus survey among equines in the Ncolia sub-region detected past infection with increasing seroprevalence, Cipore virus, West Nile, Louis encephalitis, and IL. The Pantanal is a seasonally flooded 140,000 km. The high prevalence of IL antibodies in horses combined with IL isolation in mosquitoes confirms an arv of medical importance.
A preclinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of single-dose mectin (MO) as a new oral treatment for scabies compared to two-dose ivermectin (IVM) in a porcine model. Scabies is a common dermatological condition affecting millions globally, but current treatments are insufficient and resistance is emerging. MO has a more favorable pharmacological profile, making it a promising alternative. Twelve pigs were randomly assigned to receive MO (0.3mg/kg once) or IV (0.2mg twice) or no treatment. Treatment efficacy was assessed by mite count, clinical lesions, pruritus, and ELISA-determined anti-S scabei Ig antibodies. Plasma and skin pharmacokinetic profiles were determined. At 14 post-treatment, all MO-treated pigs were mite-free, while only two IV-treated were. MO efficacy was 100% and unchanged until study-end, compared to 62% (26-100) for IV. Clinical scabies, pritus, and anti-Sabei Ig antibodies disappeared in all MO-treated but 75% IV-treated. MO persisted 9 times longer in plasma and skin, enabling long-lasting efficacy. The study demonstrates single-dose MO was more effective than consecutive IV, supporting MO as a therapeutic approach for scabies.
Scientists have studied the process of peptoglycan (PG) synthesis in Staphlococcus aureus, a type of bacteria that causes infections and is resistant to many antibiotics. PG is a key component of the bacterial cell wall and target of many antibiotics. The researchers created a strain of S. aureus with the minimum number of proteins needed for PG synthesis, deleting seven of the nine genes responsible for this process. The remaining two proteins, penicillin-binding protein 1 (PBP1) and bi-functional protein 2 (BP2), were enough for the bacteria to grow and divide. However, in real-world environments, this minimal PG machinery made the bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics and weakened its ability to cause infection in fruit flies, which rely on specific PG receptors. This shows that most PG enzymes are redundant in the lab but important for survival and virulence in the wild. The study aims to identify targets for new antibiotics that inhibit the final stages of PG synthesis.
Researchers studied the bacterium Burkholderia pseudallei, which causes a difficult-to-treat disease called meloidosis in humans. Despite proper diagnosis and treatment, mortality rates are high, ranging from 20% in Australia to 40 in Thailand. Little is known about how the bacterium infects, invades, and survives in hosts, and its iron acquisition mechanisms. It was thought to use common iron-acquisition systems found in other bacteria, but a previous discovery of a clinical isolate with a large chromosomal deletion of the malleactin gene, which encodes its major-affinity siderore, showed other systems might contribute to virulence. The researchers deleted the major siderore mactin and pyelin gene clusters in a strain and found residual activity unrelated to known Burkia siderores, not due to increased secretion of chelators. Deletion of the hem uptake loci showed H is required for utilization of hem and hemoglobin, and cannot complement a deficiency. Prolong incubation of H mutant in hemoglobin medium yielded variants able to utilize hemoglobin and hem, suggesting alternate pathways. Utilization was dependent on mact, not pyelin synthesis/uptake. A quadruple mutant could use ferritin as source and was lethal in murine meloid model. Data suggest Burkia may employ a ferritin-iron pathway to sustain in vivo.
Researchers have developed a new tool called COMM (COnsensus Metabolic Model GENeration) to improve the accuracy of genome-scale metabolic models by reconciling inconsistencies between different models of the same organism. These models, called genome-scale constraint metabolic models (GSMs), provide a comprehensive representation of cellular function but are often hampered by inconsistencies. COMM automatically identifies similarities and differences between models and resolves them, resulting in a more accurate and comprehensive representation of metabolic function. The tool was tested on four organisms and showed that automatically generated consensus models were predictive and increased coherence of knowledge. This tool is particularly useful for complex scenarios where manual curation does not scale, such as eukaryotic organisms, microbial communities, and host-pathogen interactions.

 Genome-scale metabolic models are integrated knowledge and predictive models. A consensus model should be more comprehensive than individual models due to shared and unique parts, and accurate due to reconciliation of inconsistencies. COMM reconciles two or more GSMs of the same organism beyond common namespace. It identifies similarities, dissimilarities, and complements of metabolic networks based on classification problems during integration and algorithms to resolve. Identifying similar reactions in different compartments is difficult but an extension could progress this by combining metabolite information prior to matching. COMM forms a bridge between automation and high-quality curation for consensus model generation.

Genome-scale models are organism-specific knowledge repositories integrating entities, metabolites, reactions, and genes. Automatically generated consensus models have higher predictive power than manually curated models and comparable to manually constructed models. COMM increases coherence with biological while maintaining power. This is important for usability and reliability to elucidate interactions.
Researchers have identified two genes, famb and xyl1, that play a crucial role in the development of cartilage and bone in the body. Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that provides cushioning and support to joints, while bone is the hard, calcified tissue that makes up the skeleton. Cartilage cells, called chondrocytes, interact with a protein-rich matrix and undergo a process called maturation, where they express genes that induce bone formation in the surrounding tissue, perichrium. The study used zebraf mutants to investigate the interaction between cartilage and perichrium and found that cartilage inhibits chrocy maturation, which determines the timing of perichral bone development. Mutations in famb and xyl resulted in decreased cartilage and increased perichral bone formation. Positional cloning identified the genes, which encode enzymes that synthesize proteoglycans, a type of protein found in cartilage and perich. Mutants lacked normal levels of chroit sulfate, a key component of cartilage, and formed perichral bone earlier than wild-type siblings. Chrocy defects may induce bone formation secondarily due to premature maturation, shown by increased expression of markers such as run2, collagen 10, and ih. Ultrastructural analysis revealed aberrant matrix and cellular features of chro hypertrophy in mutants. The study demonstrates that famb and x1 function in cartilage production and regulate the timing of skeletal development.
Researchers studied the role of Topoisomerase II (Top) in the separation of heterochromatic regions during meiosis in Drosila melanogaster females. They found that knocking down Top in the later stages of meiosis resulted in defects in the separation of heteroch regions after spindle assembly. In Top-expressing oocytes, heteroch regions of achmate and chmate chromosomes failed to separate during prometaph and metaphase, and were stretched into long projections with centromeres localizing near the tips. Despite this, bipolar spindles were formed in Top-express oocytes, but achmate chromosomes failed to move towards the poles during prometaph. Both ach and chmate chromosomes showed defects in orientation. Euchromatic regions separate earlier in prophase, no defects were observed in their separation upon Top knockdown at midphase. Embryos from Top-express females failed to initiate mitotic divisions. The study suggests Topois II is involved in resolving heteroch DNA entang during meiosis and these entang must be resolved to complete meiosis.
Researchers conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of using deltamethrin-impregnated collars as a public health measure to prevent canine visceral leishmaniasis (CV) in a highly endemic area in Brazil. The study took place in two areas: an intervention area where dogs were collared and a control area with conventional CV control measures. At baseline, seropositive dogs were removed and seronegative dogs included. Dogs were reevaluated every 7-8 months for two years. In the intervention area, serone dogs received new collars and serone dogs were included. Authorities were notified of seropitive dogs in both areas, which were euthanized as mandated by the Ministry of Health. The first serological survey showed similar seropreval in both areas. The second evaluation showed significant reductions in serreval in both areas, with 6.0% in the intervention and 11.0 in the control. The relative risk (RR) indicated protection against CV in the intervention. Although CV incidence didn't differ, a tendency was observed in the control, possibly due to low seroconversion or loss to follow-up. Deltamrinimpregnated collars likely provide protection over time in endemic areas.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the structure of the X chromosome and gene expression levels in mammals. They found that the X chromosome has a non-random gene content, which is often discussed in the context of sexual antagonism and avoidance in the germline. However, they propose that the biased gene content may be shaped by the limits on gene expression due to haploid expression of the X. Using data from the Encyclopedia of DNA (ENCODE) and Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANT5) projects, they found that the maximal expression of X-linked genes is lower than autosomal genes, with an average expression three times lower on the X than autosomes. Autosome-to-X retroposition events are associated with lower expression of retrogenes on the X than X-to-autosome retrogenes on autos. X-linked genes have a lesser increase in expression than autosomal ones compared to the human-chimpanzee ancestor if highly expressed, but not lowly expressed. The "traffic jam" model explains the lower breadth of expression for genes on X and Z, as broad expression is associated with high expression. Highly tissue-specific genes are rare on X, and broadly expressed genes on X tend to be lowly expressed, indicating the trend is shaped by maximal expression not breadth. A limit to maximal expression explains biased tissue profiles of X-linked genes. Tissues with specific genes highly expressed (e.g., secretory, structural) are in gene rare on X. This cannot be accounted for by alternative models of biased expression. The notion that X is hard for genes to be highly expressed due to transcription jams provides a rationale for features of X content, expression, and evolution.
A recent study investigated the prevalence and population structure of Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen, in Baka Pygmies, a subgroup of Pygmies from Cameroon. The results showed a significantly lower infection rate of 20.8% among Baka compared to 80.2% in non-Baka agriculturalists. Multilocus haplotypes were generated for each isolate, but no Baka-specific lineages were identified, with most assigned to hpAfrica or hpAfrica populations. The hpAfrica population, associated with the Nilo-Saharan language family, was divided into East and West African subpopulations, while hp1, mainly found in Cameroonians, supported Bantu language expansions. An age-structured model suggested low H. pyl prevalence in Baka within a few hundred years due to demographic factors such as small size and low life expectancy. Baka were either H pyl-free or lost lineages during past fluctuations. Coalescent simulations and phylogenetic inference showed Baka acquired H pyl through contact with agricultural neighbors. 

The study analyzed 178 Cameroonians, 77 Baka and 101 non-B, by bacterial culture from gastric biopsies. Among Baka, 46.8% were male, mean age 38.9, while non-B 21.8% male, mean 46. Similar age differences for males and females. High H pyl prevalence was found in non-B. The population structure of H pyl in Baka and Pyies was unknown. Bantu agriculturalists have high H pyl rates, but bacterial structure unknown. H pyl from non-B multiple groups to quantify gene flow between hunter-gather and agriculturalists. H pyl from agriculturalists, whom Baka acquired B language, were tested.
Dengue virus NS5, a highly conserved non-structural protein, plays a crucial role in capping and replication of the flavivirus genome and interacts with host proteins to modulate immune responses. Unusually, DENV2 NS localizes to the nucleus, but its role in replication and pathogenesis is unclear. Researchers examined NS of DENV1 and 2, which differ in localization, using a combination of functional and structural analyses. Gene swapping identified the C-terminal 18 residues (C18) of NS as sufficient to direct the protein to cytoplasm or nucleus. Low-mic affinity between NS C18 and nuclear receptor importin-alpha (Imp) allowed complex purification and crystallization at 2.2 Å resolution. Structure-guided mutational analysis revealed critical residues for NS subcell localization. Notably, proline 884 allows Imp binding, mutating to threonine in D1 NS results in mislocalization to cytoplasm without compromising virus fitness. Mutation to alanine at position 888, conserved in flaviviruses, results in non-viable virus, while R888 mutation leads to attenuated phenotype. R forms hydrogen bond with Y conserved in flaviruses. Data suggests conserved function C18, possibly in RNA interactions critical for replication, independent of subcell localization.
Researchers developed an integrated mapping protocol, called the Integrated Threshold Mapping (IT) Methodology, to control and eliminate neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as lymphatic filariasis (LF), trachoma, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths (STH). The protocol is designed to be efficient and determine whether a threshold for public health interventions has been reached in a unit. It relies on World Health Organization (WHO) recommended indicators for each disease in specific age groups. The study tested the protocol by comparing it to current mapping methodologies for each disease in one district in Mali and Senegal. Results were compared in terms of public health intervention and feasibility, including cost. The IT methodology reached the same conclusions as WHO regarding initiation of public interventions for trach, LF, and STH, but resulted in more targeted recommendations for schosiasis. It was practical and demonstrated an overall saving compared to standard, non-integrated WHO methodologies. The integrated tool could facilitate implementation in endemic countries. 

The IT methodology determines if a disease has reached threshold for public intervention by balancing epidemiologic rigor and practicality. It is logistically practical, cost-efficient and flexible. For schosias, the approach results in more targeted MDAs compared to district implementation by integrated NTD programs. The protocol uses age-specific indicators as recommended by WHO. The study tested the protocol in one district in Mali and Senegal, comparing to current methodologies for each disease.
In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the phosphatase C14 is required for exit from mitosis and is anchored to nucleolar chromatin by the C1/Net protein until anaphase, at which time it is released into the nucleoplasm. Two pathways, the FEAR (C fourteen early release network) and MEN (mitotic network), promote C14 release, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Researchers found that ubiquitination of histone H2 by the ubiquitin ligase Bre1 is necessary for C14 release from nucleolar chrom when MEN is inactivated. This function is mediated by histone H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79, but not histone deacetylase (HD) Sir2, which associates with C14 onolar chrom as part of the RENT complex. Defects in C14 release were also observed in cells lacking H3 lysine methylation and in cells with HD recruited by this modification. These histone modifications are new factors for accessibility and/or action onolar chrom of FEAR components. A redundant role for these modifications contrasts the notion of a combinatorial code of histone marks controlling biological processes.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework called GeneProgram to analyze large datasets of human gene expression data. The goal is to identify groups of co-expressed genes that orchestrate normal or pathological processes and characterize the breadth of these groups. Gene uses Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes to address challenges such as cellular heterogeneity within samples, genetic variation across samples, uncertainty in number of groups and populations, and temporal behavior. Gene organizes tissues and genes into overlapping programs with consistent behavior, producing maps of programs sorted by generality scores that exploit learned groupings. Using synthetic and real data, Gene outperformed popular analysis methods. Applied to a compend of 62 time-series expression datasets, Gene produced a map of 104 programs, many enriched for genes in key pathways and bound by NF-κ transcription factors. Discovered programs implicating surprising pathways or types in response to infection, including Wnt and neurotransmitter receptors. The map will guide future experiments; genes with low generality may be new targets, and high generality maintain common responses in disease states. Gene is multipurpose and can be applied to novel data.
Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) drives epigenetic imprinting of the interferon-gamma (IFN) locus in NKGChi natural killer (NK) cells. NKGChi cells, a subset of NK cells, play a crucial role in defense against CMV and produce IF-γ. Research showed that NKGChi cells in CMV seropositive individuals undergo epigen remodeling of the IF conserved non-coding sequence 1 (CNS1) region, similar to memory CD8+ T cells and TH1 cells. The C1 region enhances IF transcription activity in response to NKG2 and 4 engagement, leading to IF-γ production in NChi NK cells. Epigen imprinting of the IF locus is a hallmark and crucial mechanism driving stable IF- expression in CMV-specific NK expansions, providing a basis for regulation of adaptive features in innate cells.

NKGChi cells in CM+ individuals and cytok-primed NK cells, described as memory-like NK, share an open configuration of the IF locus. The C1 is a crucial enhancer of IF transcription in TH cells, especially in response to TCR triggering. To analyze epigen regulation of IF locus contribution to IF competence and stability in memory-like NK, CM-specific NChi expansions and cytok-prim cells displayed an open at IF C, acting as enhancer of IF activity in response N2 and activating receptors engagement. Epigen imprint in C of IF locus is a hallmark and underlying adaptive features IF- in NK. Epigen remodeling accompanies adaptive features, demonstrating both inflammatory and pathogen induce epigen remodeling NK.

CMV infection shapes the NK repertoire and epigen features of memory-like NK and T cells. It is unclear to what extent adaptive NChi expansions depend on low viral reactivation events in healthy CM+ individuals.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the bacterium Legionella pneumophila regulates its effector proteins within host cells. An effector proteins are molecules secreted by the bacterium to manipulate host cellular processes for infection. Temporal regulation is crucial for distinct effector activities at different stages of infection. The study found a protein, Lub, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, hijacks the host proteasome to target another effector, Sid, for degradation. Delayed delivery of Lub to the cytoplasm leads to shutdown of Sid at later stages of infection. This demonstrates a sophisticated co-evolution between host and bacterium involving an effector as a key regulator of cognate effector function. 

The regulation of Sid by Lub and the host proteasome illustrates a novel mechanism of effector regulation. Previously, membrane ruffling by Salmonella effectors was shown to be susceptible to ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Lub acts as a negative regulator of Sid within host cells, the first example of an eff that targets a cognate eff within host. The designation "metaeffector" is proposed for this class of bacterial effectors. Determinants of susceptibility are encoded in effectors themselves. Sid is an intrinsically stable within cells; Lub controls instability by targeting for ubiquination. Lub represents a metaeff, an eff that regulates another eff within host.
Researchers studied the evolution of HIV-1 in 81 individuals in the early stages of infection to understand how the virus adapts to its new host and immune system. They found that some parts of the virus's genetic code changed rapidly, more than expected, suggesting adaptation to the host's immune responses. This rapid change was seen in 24 sites, 14 of which were in areas targeted by the immune system's T-cells (CTL) and 10 in areas where the virus's genetic code was altered by APOB, a mechanism that helps the virus escape immune response. Some sites were both targeted by CTL and APO, suggesting APO facilitates early escape. Other sites changed rapidly, but not due to CTL or APO, including the most mutated site in the virus's fusion protein gp41. The study also found that insertions and deletions in the virus's envelope protein were due to selection, not random mutations. This research provides insight into how HIV-1 adapts in new hosts, highlighting the role of CTL and APO in shaping the virus's evolution during early infection.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how epigenetic silencing works in yeast, focusing on two key chromatin marks: H4 acetylation and H3 methylation. They found that having both modifications is crucial for the stability of epigen states. The model shows that under certain conditions, chromatin can have both active and silenced marks, a state called bivalent. This bivalent state is stable under perturbations such as mutations or inhibition of enzymatic activity. The researchers also found that a limited supply of silencing proteins can lead to counterintuitive responses. They investigated the design of the silencing system and compared it to experimental observations, including the role of Sir protein, spreading, and stability of silenced regions in mutants like Sas2 and Dot1. The model can be extended to include other silencing and active marks, like methylation, to understand which marks are essential for epigen fate and which reinforce one over another. The model captures mechanisms of cooperativity at the molecular level in yeast silencing, including histone modification and protein interactions. Active chromatin sites are not only acetylated but also hypermethylated at certain residues. One protein, Dot, methylates H79 and competes with Sir for the same patch on histone region. Co-occurrence of sil and active marks, called bivalent chromatin, has been discussed in Poly silencing and HP binding. The model shows how bivalent states emerge from known interactions.
Researchers in Uganda studied the gut microbiota (GM) of children hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) to see if it differed between those with edemat and non-edemat forms of the condition. Edemat malnutrition, also known as kwashiork, is the most severe form of SAM. The study included 87 children aged 6-24 months, with 62% having edemat malnutrition and 66% being boys with a mean age of 16.1 months. GM composition differed between the two groups, with non-edemat children having lower diversity. However, beta diversity analysis did not show significant differences between the GM of edemat and non-ed SAM children. The study suggests non-ed SAM children have lower GM diversity, but no clear compositional differences were found. Previous research links GM to malnutrition, with pathogenic bacteria in the guts of malnourished children. A study transplanted fecal samples from Malian twins discordant for edemat mal, kwashi, into germ-free mice. GM dysbiosis is associated with malnutrition, but it's unclear if GM differs between edemat and nonemat SAM. The study's finding of GM diversity differences justifies further research on therapeutic strategies.
Researchers studied the variation in telomere length in 112 wild-type Saccharomy sensu stricto isolates, a type of yeast, and found extensive variation in telere length among them. The variation correlated with their geographic origin, with European isolates having shorter telomeres (<150bp) and American isolates having longer telomeres (>400bp). They inserted a URA gene near the telomeres to analyze individual telere lengths and telomere position (TPE) and found that crossing American and European strains resulted in F1 spores with a continuum of telere lengths, suggesting multiple loci are involved in length. Variation in TPE was weakly correlated with telere length. Genotyping F1 segregants indicated several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with telere length and silencing variation, including candidate genes and regions with no known telom properties. They detected transgressive segregation for both phenotypes and validated by reciprocal hemizosity that YU and TLC are telere QTLs in two S paradox subpopulations. They propose sequence divergence within Kuod generates negative epistasis in allelic combinations (American-YU and EuropeanU) resulting in short teleres.
Researchers investigated how people make decisions when they are not forced to respond immediately, but can take their time to gather information. Traditional models, called sequential sampling models (SMs), assume decisions emerge from a gradual accumulation of evidence, making response times (RTs) predictable. However, these models don't account for when people choose to delay or terminate the process. A new SM was developed to predict RTs from electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, where participants bought or rejected stocks based on sequentially presented cues and could respond at any time. Standard SMs didn't accurately describe RT distributions, but adding a mechanism for postponing decisions improved the fit. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data showed alternating states of de- and increasing oscillatory power in beta frequencies (14-30Hz), indicating responses were prepared and inhibited, supporting the existence of a decision to not decide. The model also accounted for results of an adapted paradigm where participants pressed a button for more information. Results show computational modeling supports understanding of hidden dynamics in cognition.
Researchers identified a genetic mutation in the SUVH2 gene as the cause of hereditary nasal parakerosis (HN) in Labrador Retrievers, a rare skin disorder leading to crusts and fissures on the nasal planum. A genome-wide association study of 13 HN cases and 23 controls revealed a strong association on chromosome 2. Resequencing of one case's genome detected a non-synonymous variant in the SUVH gene, a histone lysine 9 (H3) methyltransferase, which mediates chromatin silencing. The variant c.972G>T is predicted to change a conserved asparagine to lysine in the catalytically active domain of the enzyme. Histopathological analysis of the epidermis in vivo suggests HN is not caused by hyperproliferation but delayed differentiation of kerocytes. SUVH is involved in epetic regulation of kerocyte differentiation, ensuring proper stratification and sealing of mammalian epidermis.
Researchers investigated the emergence of transmissible reassortant viruses during co-infection of avian and swine influenza A viruses in swine. They found that swine can serve as a "mixing vessel" for generating reassortants of avian and mammalian influenza viruses that could pose a risk to mammals, including humans. Genomic analysis of 571 isolates from nasal samples and respiratory tissues of co-housed pigs (influenza-negative, avian H1N1 IAV-infected and swine H3N2 IAV-infected) identified 30 distinct genotypes of reassortant viruses. Viruses from lower respiratory tissues had the largest diversity, while those from turbinate and nasal fluids had the least. Reassants from lower tracts had the largest variations in growth in respiratory epithelial cells, and temperature in sw nasal cells selected the type of reassant shed by pigs. One reassant in nasal samples was consistently identified in upper, middle, and lower tract, and was efficiently transmitted between pigs. The study suggests that during co-infections of av and sw IAV, reassortments likely occur in lower tracts and tropism is a factor for selecting transmissible reassant.
A study was conducted to investigate the effect of maternal Schistosoma mansoni infection and prazantel treatment during pregnancy on Schistoma mans infection and immune responsiveness among offspring at age five. Offspring of Schistoma-infected women in endemic areas may be sensitized in utero, which may influence their immune responsiveness to Schoma infection and associated morbidity. The study examined the effects of prantel treatment of S mans during pregnancy on the risk of mans infection among offspring and their immune responsiveness when exposed to mans. In a trial, offspring of women treated with prant or placebo during pregnancy were examined for mans infection and cytokine and antibody responses to SW and SEA, as well as T cell expression FoxP at five. Of 134 children, 2.4 had mans infection at five years based on single sample. Infection did not differ between treated or untreated. Cytokine IF, IL, IL, and IL and antibody Ig, Ig and Ig responses SW and FoxP were higher among infected than uninfected. Prazant treatment mans during pregnancy had no effect on responses, exception IL to SW which was higher offspring women received prazant than did not. No evidence found maternal mans infection and treatment during pregnancy influence prevalence intensity mans infection or immune response mans infection offspring five years, but observed on IL suggest mans and treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoreg responsiveness childhood schosiasis.
Macrophages play a crucial role in clearing infectious pathogens from the body, but the process of how they are activated to do so is not fully understood. Researchers have discovered that inflammatory stimuli can reprogram the macrophage's endocytic machinery to switch from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macinocytosis, allowing for rapid transfer of internalized cargo to lysosomes in a receptor-independent manner. This reprogramming occurs through protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the macrophage protein coronin 1, activating phosphoinositol (PI)-3-kinase activity necessary for macinocytic uptake. Expression of a phosphomim form of coron 1 is sufficient to induce PI-kinase activation and macinocytosis even without inflammatory stimuli. This suggests a previously unknown mechanism for regulating internalization and degradation of infectious material during inflammation. Macrophages can internalize large amounts of cargo for direct transfer to lysosomes upon activation. Phosphorylation of coron 1 is the key switch from phagytic to macinocytic mode. Expression of a phosphim coron 1 mutant resulted in mycobacteria being transferred to lysosomes for elimination regardless of macroage state. Macroph expressed a phosphim glutamic acid mutant coron 1, Ig-coated beads were internalized through macinocyt in absence interferon. Phosphorylation of coron 1 is crucial for switch from phag to macin uptake upon macroage activation.
Researchers conducted a qualitative study in Arua District, North Uganda to assess the acceptance of tset baits (insecticide-treated targets) in communities where they had not been previously used. The study involved focus group discussions with male and female participants in eight villages across the district. Results showed that villagers who had never seen the baits before expressed fear and anxiety due to associations with witchcraft and "ghosts from the river", which are linked to illness, death, and misfortune. In contrast, villagers in areas where ba had been used previously had positive attitudes and were aware of their purpose and benefits. The latter group reported similar negative perceptions when tse control started a decade ago. The study suggests acceptance varies between villages and is related to duration of experience with tse programs. Success of community-based interventions against tse will depend on engagement and sensitization that reaches all communities, especially new areas. Community acceptance is vital for effective tse control, as seen in a previous study in DRC where negative attitudes led to damage and failure. The study was conducted in an area where government programs against Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) have been used. Efforts to enhance community participation in tse ba range from encouragement to active construction and maintenance. In all studies, acceptance was crucial for success. Three years before the study, 70 ba were deployed per parish, but efforts did not result in sustainable tse control due to lack of monitoring and maintenance.
Researchers have studied the process of recombination in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to understand its role in evolution. Recombination is a process where genetic material is exchanged between chromosomes, increasing the effectiveness of natural selection in populations. However, previous studies have been limited due to lack of detailed understanding of recombination rates across and within species. This study provides the first high-resolution description of genomic and population variation in recombination, distinguishing between two outcomes: crossing over (CO) and gene conversion (GC). The researchers analyzed 5,860 meioses of Drosila melanogaster, genotyping 139 million SNPs and mapping 106,964 recombination events at 2-kilobase resolution. This allowed for whole-genome CO and GC maps, as well as detailed variation in recombination among individuals. The study found large-scale variation in recombination rates, with hotspots and coldspots along chromosomes, and intra-specific variation associated with hotspots at low frequency. Gene conversion rates were uniformly distributed across the genome, detectable in regions with reduced or absent CO. Local recombination events were associated with sequence motifs, occurring within transcript regions, suggesting chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks. This variation in recombination needs to be considered in population genetic models to understand interaction between selection and linkage.
Researchers have identified ID2 (ID2) as a component of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) machinery in Arabidopsis thalian, but its function in RDM was unknown. They purified ID2 and found it co-purified with two ID paralogs, ID1 and ID2. The coiled domain between the X and X domains of ID2 is essential for ID homodimerization, while the X domain is required for ID interaction with ID1 and ID2. Introducing wild-type ID2 and mutated derivatives into the id2 mutant showed that the uncharacterized X domain is required for ID-ID1/ID2 formation and function. ID1 is required for de novo methylation, RNA accumulation, and transcriptional silencing, while ID2 has overlapping roles with ID1. Unlike ID2, ID1 and ID2 cannot bind double-stranded RNA, suggesting their roles differ from ID2 in the ID-ID/ID complex and are essential for RDM.
Researchers studied how neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, respond to Leishmania braziliensis, a type of parasite. Neutrophils are the first line of defense against invading pathogens and are rapidly recruited to the site of infection. In Leish brazili infection, depletion of neutils significantly increases parasite load. However, co-culture of neutils and L brazili had opposite effect, inducing parasite killing. The study focused on interaction between neutils and Lili, exploring activation and apoptotic fate. Inoculation of serum-opsonized Lili promastigotes mice neutil in vivo, peaking at 24 hours. In vitro exposure of inflammatory bone marrow neutils to Lili modulated expression of molecules CD18 and CD62, and induced oxidative burst. Using mCh-express Lili, effects were mainly observed in infected not bystander cells. Neutil activation with Lili was confirmed by release of TN-α and neutilase. Neutils infected Lili but not L major displayed markers of apoptosis. Lili induces neutil recruitment in vivo and neutils exposed to parasite in vitro through activation and release of inflammatory mediators. This may impact parasite elimination at early stages of infection.
Researchers explored the potential benefits of vaccination as a supplementary control measure for bovine tuberculosis (TB) in cattle. Currently, vaccination is not used in international control programs and is prohibited in the EU due to interference with the tuberculin skin test, used to determine if herds and countries are officially TB-free. New diagnostic tests, Differentiated Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIV), offer the potential to introduce vaccination into existing eradication programs. Using herd models from historical data in Great Britain, they estimated the feasibility of supplemental vaccination. The economic impact of bovine tuberculosis on farmers is dominated by costs associated with testing and restrictions on animal movements. Farmers' willingness to adopt vaccination requires not only reducing the burden of infection but also the risk of restrictions imposed. The study found that under intensive testing in GB, the specificity of DIV test rather than sensitivity is the greatest barrier to herd benefit of vaccination. The negative effects of vaccination could be mitigated through testing relaxation, potentially increasing hidden infection in officially free herds. Models explored the range of DIV characteristics necessary for a protective level of vaccination, estimating a specificity of at least 99.85% and sensitivity of 40% required. Data from experimentally infected animals suggest this target could be achieved with a cocktail of DIV antigens while maintaining sensitivity of 73.3% relative to post-mortem detection.
Researchers have identified a new class of compounds called dihydrobenz[e][1,4]azin-2(3)-ones that show promise as a potential treatment for Trichuris, a parasitic worm infecting over 500 million people worldwide. Current treatments are limited and ineffective, hindering eradication efforts. Using a mouse model for Truris, a library of 480 small molecules was screened for activity against adult parasites, leading to the discovery of dihydrozazepones with anthelmint activity. Further screening and synthesis of related compounds identified 20 active dihydrozepinones, a new class not previously implicated in nematode control. The most potent compounds immobilized adult Tris with EC50 values around 25-50μM, comparable to existing anthelmint levamis, with low cytotoxicity against murine epithelial cells, showing selectivity for the parasite. Dihydrozepin O029 also reduced embryonated Tris eggs' ability to infect mice in vivo, suggesting a potential for a therapeutic that acts in the environment, interrupting the parasite lifecycle. These results demonstrate dihydrozepones as a new anthint active against both egg and adult stages of Tris, with selectivity and scope for optimisation to improve potency and pharmacokinetic properties for a clinical agent.
Researchers have re-examined the concept of "date" and "party" hubs in protein-protein interaction networks, where "date" hubs have low co-expression with partners and "party" hubs have high co. They found that the importance of "date" hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a small subset of extremely central hubs, which do not display low expression, contradicting the idea of a link between quantity and function. The "date/party distinction was motivated by an approximately bimodal distribution of hub-expression, but this feature is not robust to methodological changes. Topological properties of hubs do not correlate with co-expression, but there is a significant correlation between centrality and functional similarity of interacting proteins. The authors suggest conceiving roles for protein-protein interactions rather than individual proteins is more useful.
Researchers have developed methods to reconstruct transmission trees of infectious diseases using whole genome sequences, but a major limitation is the need for genetic diversity to occur on epidemiological timescales. This means that the position of individuals in a transmission tree can only be resolved by genetic data if mutations have accumulated between pathogen genomes. To address this, the concept of "transmission" is introduced, defined as the number of mutations separating genome sequences from transmission pairs. Using literature values, scenarios are simulated with two evolution models to describe transmission of major pathogens. Results show that mean transmission varies between pathogens, but is generally low, with many outbreaks having genetically identical pairs. This limits the ability to reconstruct outbreaks using genetic data, especially for pathogens with low transmission like Streptoccus, Shigella, and Clostrid. Conversely, rapidly evolving pathogens like RNA viruses provide valuable information on individual events. The study highlights limitations of genetic data in certain scenarios and the need to expand tools to integrate other epidemiological data.
Researchers studied how genes on the X chromosome that escape inactivation, a process that silences most genes on one X in female mammals, in mouse tissues and cells. They analyzed allele-specific expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes with single nucleotide polymorphisms to identify escape genes and mechanisms. A continuum between silencing and expression from the inactive X (Xi) was found, with few genes escaping in most tissues (3-7%) but more in embryonic-kid-derived Pki cells (21%). Alle-specific RNA polymerase occupancy and DNase hypersensitivity at promoters correlated with escape, indicating open chromatin structure. CTCF binding on Xi was denser in brain compared to Pki cells, contributing to compartmentalized Xi and fewer escape genes in brain.

A minority of genes escaped X in tissue and cell-specific manner, indicating X and escape are tightly controlled. Bi-allelic versus monoallelic expression probability was calculated using an algorithm applicable to any gene. Surveys in human/mouse cells showed 8-15% consistently escape, 10-13 variable, and 10-20 varying between lines/individuals. Escape results in sexual dimorphisms and bi-alle expression is important for normal females. Mouse 3-7 escape may differ from other mammals with similar human patterns. Pki cells had more escape than tissues, possibly epigenetic changes or cell property.

Escape genes were distributed along X, not influenced by distance from XIC, and play roles in transcription/translation, dosage-sensitive. Tissue-specific genes were identified for sex differences.
Researchers have identified a novel cystine protease, VX-4, in the parasite Plasmod viv, which is a major cause of human malaria worldwide. This protease is involved in the parasite's survival and egress from the erythrocyte. VX-4 has different properties compared to its orthologs in other Plasmod species, showing strong affinity to rodent Plasmod. Recomb VX-4 has dual specificity depending on the microenvironment pH, with highest activity against benzyycarbonyl-Le-Arg-ethyl-amide at acidic pH 5.5 and against Z-Arg-M at neutral pH 6.5-7.5. It prefers positively charged amino acids at P1, with less specificity at P3 and P4, which depends on pH. Three amino acids in the S pocket are different in VX-4 compared to VX-2 and VX-3. Replacement of Glu180 abolished activity against Z-Arg-M at neutral pH, indicating its importance in pH-dependent preference. VX-4 is localized in the vacuoles and cytoplasm of the erythrocy stage of P. viv. It shows maximal activity at neutral pH and against P. viv plasm and hemoglobin at acidic/neutral pH. VX-4 demonstrates pH-dependent switching, which might cleave different substrates in intracellular environments. It might function as hemase in acidic foodu, mase P viv plasm at neutral/acidic, and cytos-degrading in erythrocytos.
Researchers have developed a new genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis (ME) for the bacterium Clostridium ljungahli, a type of acetogen that can ferment a wide range of substrates. This model, named iL965ME, captures all major metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, cofactor, and vitamin pathways, as well as RNA and protein synthesis necessary for these reactions. It's the first ME model of a Gram-positive bacterium and broadens predictability. The model shows how protein and media allocation influence metabolic pathways and energy in acetogens, and accurately predicts secretion of multiple products. Predicting overflow metabolism is crucial for designing new strategies, such as glycerol production, a novel product for C. ljungahli, expanding its metabolic capability. The model also predicts changing secretion rates based on metal availability, opening fermentation optimization and knowledge about proteome and carbon flux in acetogens. 

The iLME includes major metabolic, amino, acid, nucleotide, lipid, cofactor, and vitamin synthesis pathways, and RNA and protein synthesis for catalyzing reactions. It also includes WLP with cofactors and mechanisms for energy conservation. The model predicted secretion of acetate, ethanol, and glycer during carbon and metal availability revealed protein and media influence metabolic and energy in this acetogen.
Researchers used a panel of human osteoblast cells to conduct a transcriptomic survey, similar to previous studies in lymphoblast cell lines, to investigate the genetic control of transcript variation. The study found that osteoblast and lymphlast cells have distinct gene expression profiles, with tissue-specific and functionally relevant pathways. They performed cis-association analysis with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify genetic variations in transcript forms and found that differential expression of transcript forms in osteoblast is partly controlled by cis-regulatory genetic variants. These forms are regulated by variants in both tissue-specific and tissue-independent manners, confirmed by RT-PCR validation. The study suggests that multiple transcript forms are present in both tissues and genetic may affect the expression of one form over another, rather than an all-or-no effect. Examination of top SNPs from genome-wide association studies of bone density showed overlap with associations in this study, including the FAM118 gene, which was tested in additional clinical studies revealing a novel transcript variant. This approach to examining transcript variation in multiple tissues is useful for detecting common genetic variation between cell types and identifying cell-specific variants that may be functionally relevant, an important follow-up for genome-wide association studies.
Researchers studied the yeast Saccharomyces eayan, a parent of the lager-brew hybrid Saccharcesorian, to understand why it can't use maltotose, a key sugar in brewer's wort. Unlike most Saccharces cerevisiae and Saccharorian strains, Sacchar eayan can't use maltose, which is encoded by the MAL gene family and requires transporters for uptake. Sac eayan strain CBS57 has genes for α-glucos maltose uptake but lacks maltose transporters. Sac cerevis sequence suggests maltose and maltose transporters evolved from a shared gene. To study maltose utilization in eayan CBS57, mutants were evolved on maltose-enriched wort and showed improved maltose and maltose fermentation. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel SeALT gene from gene introgression of three SeALT genes. The predicted structure SeALT is similar to original transporters but overexpression enabled growth on maltose, indicating neofunctionalization. The mosaic SeALT resembles Sacorian maltose-transporter SpY with high identity to cerevis MAL1, parayan MAL1 and eayan SeALT.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the impact of influenza virus strains on human mortality by studying the relationship between the virus's antigen variation and the number of deaths it causes. They found a positive correlation between the two, meaning that the more the virus has changed from previous strains, the more deaths it causes. This relationship was used to create a tool to predict the mortality of a specific type of influenza virus, H1N1, by analyzing its genetic sequence. The tool, called EAD, was tested and shown to be accurate in predicting the distance between H1 strains and their impact on mortality. The study suggests that this method can be used to quickly assess the mortality of future H1 strains and other types of influenza, such as H2 and B, with some modifications. The relationship between antigen variation and mortality was studied using a simplified model of virus-host interaction, focusing on strains that cause significant infection in humans. The model showed a direct and positive correlation between antigen variation and mortality. The researchers believe this method will be useful for timely and cost-effective planning for influenza control and prevention.
Researchers have identified a small cysteine-rich protein, PEC23, from the Asian soybean fungus Phakora pachyri, that suppresses plant immunity. The fungus is an obligate biotrophic pathogen causing severe soybean epidemics, but the mechanisms of its interaction with the host are poorly understood. The genome of the fungus encodes many secreted cystine-rich proteins (SCRPs), thought to function within the host, but their roles are unknown. PEC23 was found to suppress plant immunity and interact with soybean transcription factor GPL12, a negative regulator of soybean defenses. Plants with silenced GPL12 have constitutively active immunity, indicating G12 as a negative regulator of soybean defenses. The study provides evidence for a virulence function of a SCP and suggests PEC suppresses soy immune responses and interacts with G12. PEC is unique in its ability to suppress HR and basal responses, with a tandem cysteine motif present in predicted secretomes of other rust fungi and interacts with G12. RNA silencing G12 indicates this factor functions as a negative regulator of soybean responses. Pachy infection on G12-silenced and PEC-sil soybeans showed no change in disease phenotype, possibly due to redundancy of P effector proteins. Data show G12 acts as an immune suppressor ensuring normal growth in absence of infection.
Researchers have discovered that the EphA receptor, a protein on the surface of host cells, plays a crucial role in the invasion and replication of the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachatis. Chlamdia invades host cells and replicates inside a membrane-bound vacuole called an inclusion, where multiple host proteins are recruited and functionally modulated to support its development. The researchers found that EphA activates the PI3 kinase pathway, which is necessary for efficient replication. Interfering with EphA binding, downregulating EphA expression, or inhibiting EphA activity significantly reduced Chlam infection. Chlam interacts with and activates EphA on the surface, resulting in receptor internalization. During replication, EphA remains around the inclusion and interacts with the p85 subunit of PIK to activate the PIK/Akt pathway required for Chlam development. Overexpression of full-length EphA, but not the mutant lacking the intracellular domain, enhanced PI activation and infection.
Researchers have long known that neurons have voltage-gated ion channels in their dendrites, which allow them to exhibit excitability. However, the role of this excitability in dendritic computation has remained unclear. This study shows that the output of a model of an active dendritic tree is a highly non-linear function of afferent rate, achieving large dynamic ranges of over 50 dB. The model also replicates double-sigmoid responses observed in retinal ganglion cells. The researchers propose that the enhancement of dynamic range is the primary role of active dendritic conductances. They predict that neurons with larger dendritic trees will have larger dynamic range and blocking active conductances will decrease it.

Dendrites have active channels that support non-linear summation and dendritic spikes, suggesting they may be involved in dendritic computation. However, spikes are a consequence of excitable dynamics and dend trees without plasticity can still benefit from active dendrites for increased range. Neurons have extensive dendritic trees, and research has focused on their morphology and dynamics since the discovery of dendritic conductances. The purpose of active channels in dendrites is to amplify weak signals and saturate for strong activity, solving the "dynamic range" problem of sensitivity and saturation. This is important for individual neurons, networks, organs, and organisms.

Results suggest dendritic spikes under synaptic bombardment are responsible for a model prediction: the transfer function is not Hill-like, but double-sigmoid, as seen in retinal ganglion cells.
Researchers have developed a new method to infer quantitative models of bacterial promoters from time-series gene data, which is commonly used in drug discovery, cancer research, and biotechnology. Current methods assume that mRNA measurements are representative of protein concentrations and changes in gene expression are solely due to transcription factors, neglecting global effects. This study investigates the importance of this bias and proposes corrections using a combination of models and experiments. They measured in vivo activity of genes in the Fli-FlM module of E. coli and estimated protein concentrations and global effects using kinetic models. Results show correcting bias improves model quality, especially for systems with longer protein half-lives and varying gene machinery activity. The approach is applicable to time-series data to learn regulatory networks. In the Fli-FlM module, results highlight global effects and regulation of Fli and FlM halfives for Fli dynamics.

The study proposes controls for transcript experiments, constitutively-expressed genes, and models to reconstruct protein concentrations and integrate physiological effects into inference. Global effects are measured by a reporter driven constitutive promoter, but model fit is only marginally improved. Concentrations of Fli and FlM are estimated from promoter activities and physiologically halfives, providing a data set to test mRNA and protein influences on inference. The capability to infer regulatory and quantitative function of Fli-dependent gene, not regulated by other factors, is investigated. Estimation of time-vary protein from promoter by kinetic and physologically halfives improves inference. A model with Fli and FlM as regulators, in addition to gene machinery, is compatible with data.
Researchers studied the spatial and temporal distribution of Oligyomys fulcens, a rodent species that serves as a reservoir for zoonotic pathogens, in the Agua region of Panama. They analyzed data from a four-year longitudinal study of rodent populations in the Agua community between 2006 and 2009 using non-spatial and spatial statistical methods. The study area was divided into a 90-node grid with a total area of 6.43 square kilometers. The population density and dispersion of O. fulcens varied across seasons and years, with the species being absent during transitional months and re-establishing in subsequent years. Spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that populations were approximately 300-600 meters apart, with sharp boundaries between suitable and unsuitable habitats. The species showed a defined spatial pattern over time, leading to shifting hotspots of abundance that explain intermittent pathogen transmission. This variation was associated with seasonality and anthropogenic pressures from agricultural activities. These factors define the occurrence, timing, and duration of synanthropic populations affected by human populations, and possible exposure to local populations. The study provides a detailed spatio-temporal characterization of hotspots of rodent habitation and persistence, highlighting challenges in monitoring zoon disease outbreaks at population level.
Researchers have developed a method to infer the impact of genetic mutations on the antigen of the influenza A (H3) virus, which affects its ability to evade the host's immune system. This is crucial for creating effective vaccines. The technique assigns antigen weights to branches on a tree, representing the virus's evolution, allowing the identification of amino acid changes with significant impact. The method was applied to the major surface protein of the virus from 1968 to 2003, with results comparable accuracy to antigen cartography. It also identified known and new sites with antigen impact. The technique can be applied to other viruses and systems with genetic and phenotype data.

The method uses a least squares optimization procedure to fit antigen distances onto a tree for the major antigen determinant of the virus. It provides a fine-grained resolution of impact without time and cost-intensive experiments. However, some branches were not assigned based on maximum likelihood, decreasing interpretability in some cases. The evolution of A (3) from 196 to 200 was studied with antigen trees from Smith et al. (2004), identifying areas and transitions between types. This can be used to identify isolates with large impact for vaccine updates. The method is not limited to influenza and can be applied to any system with genetic and phenotype data.
Researchers conducted a large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify host factors required for human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) infection. They found that a cluster of mitotic genes, or genes involved in cell division, were necessary for the virus to enter the cell's nucleus. The study revealed a new mechanism for how the virus's DNA (vDNA) enters the nucleus: it relies on the breakdown of the nuclear envelope during cell division. In interphase, the virus is engulfed, routed to the perinuclear area, and uncoated, but the DNA fails to enter the nucleus. Upon nuclear envelope breakdown in interphase, HPV infection occurs. During mitosis, the DNA associates with host chromatin on the metaphase plate. The researchers propose that HPV requires nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis to access the DNA to the nucleoplasm. The study highlights the value of RNA screens in investigating viral infections and provides a resource for future virus-host interaction studies.
Black Sigat or black streak disease, caused by the Dothideomyc fungus Pseudocospora fiji (previously Mycoserella fiji), is a major threat to global banana production due to the lack of effective resistance. Frequent fungicide applications increase economic and environmental costs, leading to rapid evolution of fungicide-resistant strains causing disease failures worldwide. To combat this, two P. fiji strains were sequenced and assembled with a new genetic map. The 74b genome of P. fiji is expanded by L retrotransposons, making it the largest in Doideomycetes. Electrophoretic karyotyping and molecular markers showed chromosome polymorphisms and genetic diversity. Genetic differentiation was detected using neutral markers, suggesting selection and limited gene flow at geographic scale. Frequencies of fungicide in treated plantations were higher than untreated P. fiji populations. A homologue of Cladospor fulum Avr effector Pf4 was identified in P. fiji genome. Infiltration of purified Pf4 into leaves of resistant variety Calcut 4 resulted hypersensitive response, suggesting Cal 4 carries unknown gene recognizing Pf4. The P. fiji genome will aid fungicide schedules and banana breeding programs.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how specific transcription factors bind to DNA in different species, focusing on changes that occurred after a common ancestor of humans and mice. They analyzed six transcription factors (GATA, SOX, CTC, MY, MAX, E1, and TS) and found that 58-79% of their binding sites in humans originated after the split from mice. Over 15% of these sites are unique to humans and are near genes related to specific pathways, with more genetic variations than older sites. This method can identify lineage-specific regulatory elements and understand their role in gene regulation variation across species. Unlike previous methods, it doesn't rely on cross-species alignments, which are often low quality in non-coding regions. It uses a "birth-death" model to trace evolution of binding sites. The method was applied to ChIP-seq data for the six factors and produced the most significant motif prediction for five of them. It can determine lineage differences in evolutionary rates of a motif along a branch in the phylogeny. The results support the method's ability to identify lineage-specific elements and their role in gene regulation variation.
Researchers have investigated how light regulates the expression of the zebraf period2 (per) gene, a key component of the vertebrate circadian clock. In zraf, unlike mammals, light exposure to most tissues leads to local entrainment of the clock, and induces expression of certain genes, including per, in various cell types in vivo and vitro. The mechanism linking light to gene expression was poorly understood. Using transgenic fish and stably transfected cell-based assays, a Light Module (LRM) within the per promoter was defined. The LRM, proximal to the start site, is necessary and sufficient for light-driven expression and circadian regulation. Curiously, the LRM is conserved in vertebrate per genes, even in species lacking light-sensitive peripheral clocks. The human LRM can substitute zraf L to confer light-regulated transcription in zraf cells. The LRM contains E and D-box elements critical for function. The E-box directs circadian regulation by mediating BMAL1/CLOCK activity, while D-box drives light expression. The zraf homolog of thyroid embryonic factor binds to L-box and transactivates expression. t mRNA levels are light-inducible, and knockdown attenuates light transcription from per in vivo. Results support a model where light-dependent crosstalk between E and D-box factors determines per expression. This extends understanding of light entrainment and regulation of clock expression in vertebrates.
Researchers studied the role of the actin-binding protein coronin in the motility of Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, the highly motile forms of a rodent malaria-causing parasite transmitted by mosquitoes. They found that coronin is essential for efficient transmission of the parasite from mosquitoes to mice, as parasites lacking coron show defects in salivary gland invasion. Coronin localizes to the periphery of sporites in a calcium-dependent but actin-independent manner and contributes to motility through actin-binding. Mutations and imaging suggest coron organizes actin filaments for motility. Using coronin-mCherry as a marker for actin filaments, protein A was found to contribute to actin disassembly. Calcium and cAMP signaling regulate a switch from rapid motility to host invasion by influencing actin dynamics. Extracellular ligands trigger intracellular calcium release followed by actin formation and coronin relocalization to the rear of the gliding sporite. Parasites lacking coron frequently detach from substrate and struggle to reattach, suggesting a function in adhesion. Act filaments are short in Plmod and related parasites, making it speculative how they are organized. Data suggest interplay between TR-family adhesins, act filaments and regulating adhesion for sporite migration.
Researchers studied four lines of Leishmania parasites that were resistant to the drug Amphotin B, a key treatment for leishmaniasis. They found that all four lines had altered sterol biosynthesis and were sensitive to pentamidine. Genome sequencing revealed a mutation in the sterol biosynthesis gene sterol5-desaturase in one line, but in three lines, RNA sequencing showed loss of expression of sterol 24-ethyltransferase (SMT), responsible for resistance and altered sterol biosynthesis. MT is encoded by two genes with different expression levels, with reduced expression associated with loss of the 3' untranslated region of the dominant gene due to structural variations at the locus. Regions of homology between genes and SIDER retrotranson elements promoted these variations. In one case, loss of MT was not associated with loss of virulence in macrophages in vivo. Sequence instability in Leish genomes is known, but associated with major antileman drug resistance without fitness costs is a concern.
Researchers investigated how attention and prediction interact to modulate information processing in the brain during sensory encoding. They used electroencephalography (EEG) to record neural activity in humans performing a visual task where they attended to or ignored a stream of gratings with predictable, surprising, or unpredictable orientations. Results showed that surprising stimuli evoked responses were encoded as the difference between predicted and observed features, and attention facilitated this type of information in the brain. This supports a predictive coding theory that attention optimizes expectations by increasing the gain of prediction errors. The study found a significant effect of attention on mismatch responses to surprising but not unpredictable stimuli, indicating attention boosts mismatch information evoked by surprising stimuli. This is consistent with a predictive theory that attention optimizes expected precision by increasing the gain of errors. An alternative model proposes attention modulates predictions, not errors, and another suggests attention optimizes expected precision by modulating synaptic gain of error units.
Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite found in sub-Saharan Africa, is divided into three sub-species: T. b. brucei, T. rhodesense, and T. gambense. T. b. brucei cannot infect humans due to sensitivity to trypanolytic factors (TLF) in human serum, while T. rhodense and T. gambense are resistant. Two subgroups of T. gambense, 1 and 2, differ genetically and in human serum resistance phenotypes. Group 1 T. gambense has an invariant phenotype, while group 2 shows variable resistance. Previous research suggested group 1 T. gambense is resistant to TLF due to reduced TLF uptake, mediated by reduced expression of the TLF receptor, haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor (HbHR) gene. This study investigates if this is true for group 2 parasites. Isogenic resistant and sensitive group 2 T. gambense were compared to T. bruce parasites. Both express HHR at similar levels and internalize fluorescent labeled TLF like T. bruce. Both resistant and sensitive group 2, as well as group 1 T gambense, internalize recombinant AP1, but only sensitive group 2 are lysed. Data indicate group 1 T gambense avoids TLF, but is resistant to main lytic AP1. Group 2 T gambense is innately resistant AP1, possibly due to same mechanism. However, group 2 Tense variably displays phenotype and does not correlate with HHR expression or expression. Differences in human resistance mechanisms exist between T gamb groups 1 and 2.
Researchers have investigated the role of DNA methylation in controlling HIV-1 latency, a state where the virus is dormant and not actively replicating. They found that methylation of the HIV-1 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) is an additional mechanism that prevents the virus from being reactivated, making it more stable in its latent state. This methylation occurs after the initial silencing of the virus and is not required for it to become dormant. In people with undetectable HIV in their blood, the virus's promoters and enhancers are heavily methylated and resistant to reactivation, whereas those with detectable HIV have hypomethylated LTR. However, methylation alone does not completely prevent reactivation with certain treatments. A two-step model of epigenetic control of HIV-1 latency is proposed. The study shows that methylation of HIV-1 5LTR is a mechanism that maintains latency by preventing reactivation, explaining previous conflicting results in cell line studies and correlating with data from HIV-infected patients.
Researchers have created a comprehensive catalog of genetic variations in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, including single nucleotide, multi-nucleotide, and structural variants. They used a new approach to identify over 3.6 million distinct variations, with more than 800,000 insertions, deletions, and complex variants. The study found that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are more common near other types of variations, but are not caused by mutations or regions with high variation. Instead, the high SNP density is due to population-level processes. The researchers also studied how genetic variations affect gene expression in adult flies by mapping over 2,000 genes and found that insertions comprise 10% of all variations and have larger effects than SNPs. They discovered more associations in males than females and that most variations are sex-specific, showing a difference in genetic architecture between sexes and importance of factors mediating sex-based expression. Additionally, they analyzed RNA expression in offspring of sequenced lines and found that most variations can be validated in heterozygous individuals. The study expands the catalog of variations in Dophila and reveals high density of polymorphisms, greater than in humans and mice.
A study investigated the impact of amplitude cancellation on the association between frequency components in the neural drive to muscle and rectified EMG signal. Rectified EMG is commonly used to estimate neural drive to muscles and infer synaptic input to motor neurons, but loss of EM amplitude due to overlap of motor action potentials (cancellation) may distort its spectrum and correlation with neural drive. Analytical and computational models of motor activity, force, and EM signal showed that rectified EM without cancellation (EMnc) is superior to actual rectified EM as estimator of neural drive. Simulations confirmed this, with average coefficient of determination (r2) between neural in 1-30 Hz and EMnc (0.59±0.08) matching correlation between rectified EM and neural at low cancellation levels (<40%). However, correlation decreased linearly with cancellation (r=-0.83) to r<0.2 at levels >60%. Simulations showed stronger neural drive implied stronger correlation between rectified EM and neural, with cancellation distorting mainly low-frequency (<5 Hz) components. Results indicate amplitude distorts rectified EM signal, implying valid use of rectified EM as estimator requires low levels and strong synaptic input to motor neurons.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called YCCA (YUC) plays a crucial role in regulating auxin, a hormone that inhibits root growth, in response to aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis plants. Auxin is necessary for the inhibition of root growth caused by Al stress, but the mechanism was previously unknown. The study found that Al stress upregulates YUC3/5/7/8/9 in the root apex, leading to accumulation of auxin and root growth inhibition. This change in regulation of YUC in the root apex and Y-regulated growth is dependent on ethylene signaling. Disrupting eth signaling either enhanced or reduced upregulation of Y in the root apex in response to stress. Ethylene also enhanced growth under Al stress was alleviated in Y mutants or co-treated with yucas, an inhibitor of Y activity, suggesting a downstream role of Y in this process. Eth-insensitive 3 (E3) is involved in regulation of Y9 transcription in this process. Additionally, PHYTOCHROMEACTIVATING FACTOR (P4) functions as a transcription activator for Y5/8. P4 promotes Al-inhibited root growth by regulating local expression of Y and aux in the root apex. Al-induced P4 in the root acts downstream of eth signaling. The study highlights a cascade for Y-regulated aux biosynthesis in the root apex mediating growth in response to stress.
Researchers investigated how certain peptides from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) affect the activity of natural killer (NK) cells in rhes macs. NK cells recognize and kill infected cells through interactions between killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) on NK cells and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands on target cells. The study found that 28 out of 75 SIV peptides bound to a common MHC I molecule, Mam-A*002, suppressed the activity of NK cells that express the inhibitory receptor Mam-K3. These peptides, including three dominant CD8 T cell epitopes, were previously shown to stabilize Mam-A002 binding to Mam3. Substitutions at the C-terminal end of inhibitory peptides turned them into disinhibitory, and vice versa, without affecting binding to Mam002. The effects on NK responses corresponded to effects on Mam002 tetramer binding Mam. In mixtures of inhibitory and disinhib peptides, low concentrations of inhibitory dominated to suppress NK responses. Consistent with inhibition by Mam3 NK cells, SIV replication was higher in Mam002 CD4 lymphocytes co-cultured with Mam3 NK than Mam3 cells. This demonstrates that viral peptides can modulate NK responses by affecting M class I interactions with inhibitory IRs, a mechanism by which immunodef viruses may evade NK cells.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae (NTH) adapts to survive in environments with limited nutrients. They found that a mutation in the ic gene, which affects 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiester activity, helps the bacterium survive in such conditions. In a preclinical model of TH-induced otitis media (inflammation of the middle ear), the mutated strain had less fluid in the ear, indicating resolution of the disease. However, it formed more intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) than the original strain, suggesting a reservoir of bacteria in the mucosa after disease resolution. The study provides insight into TH evolution during nutrient limitation and demonstrates IBs in a preclinical model of chronic disease.
Researchers investigated how the bacterium Burkholderia pseudalle, which causes melioidosis, interacts with its host's iron levels during infection. Iron is crucial for bacterial growth and immune response modulation. The study found that B. pseudalle downregulates the host's iron exporter ferroin, making more iron available for the bacterium. Exogenous iron supplementation increased bacterial growth, while iron chelation reduced it. Infected macrophages showed lower immune response and iron-loaded mice had lower serum iron levels. In vivo, iron supplementation promoted bacterial growth and inflammation, while limitation improved clearance and survival. The study suggests B. pseudalle modulates iron homeostasis to acquire iron and evade immune mechanisms, promoting intracellular growth.
Researchers have developed a new technique called "functional mode analysis" to identify specific motions in proteins that are related to their biological functions. This is challenging because proteins often perform their functions through collective atomic movements, making it hard to pinpoint which motions are responsible for a particular function. The technique uses an ensemble of protein structures and a "functional quantity" that measures the protein's state, then detects the motion most correlated with this quantity. This quantity can be a geometric, electrostatic, chemical, or other variable relevant to the protein's function. Additionally, it estimates the motion most likely to cause a significant change in the quantity. Two correlation measures are used: the Pearson coefficient for linear correlation and mutual information for any interdependence. By detecting the most correlated motion, a model can be derived for the functional state in terms of a single coordinate. This approach was tested on proteins including polyalanine helix, T lysozyme, Trpase, and leucine-binding protein.
Researchers studied the order of intron removal from transcripts of the tubA and gap genes in Euglena gracilis, which contain both conventional and nonconventional introns. Nonventional introns do not have conserved characteristics of spliceosomal introns or U snRNA sequence at the 5' end, but form a stable secondary structure with exon/intron junctions. In contrast, conventional introns have conserved positions or are lost. The study found that nonventional introns are removed before spliceosomal introns, and intermediate products of splicing were analyzed using PacBio Next Generation Sequencing. The results suggest a time gap between the two types of splicing. Nonventional introns in Eugids have been extensively studied, with about 100 described, and are found in nuclear genes aside from spliceosomal ones. They insert at new positions, whereas conventional introns are conserved or lost. Intermediate introns have features of both conventional and nonventional introns. Only few genes have been annotated, but confirmed on genomic level. A whole-genome survey of nonventional intr is needed. Nonventional introns form a stable structure with exon/intron junction, not resembling selflicing or tRNA. This suggests rapid removal of nonventional intr precedes spliceosomal.
Researchers investigated the impact of Coxsackievirus B (CV) infection on cardiac progenitor cells and heart development in mice. CVB is a common virus that causes mild fever in infants, but can lead to severe myocarditis in some cases. The study found that a mild CVB infection in juvenile mice had no immediate symptoms, but led to cardiac hypertrophy and dilation in adult mice when subjected to stress. The virus infected cardiac progenitor cells, reducing their numbers in the heart, which may impair the heart's ability to adapt to increased load. A mouse model of mild CVB infection showed no myocarditis or immune cell infiltration, but triggered apoptosis and premature differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells, reducing their numbers in adult hearts. The virus was eventually cleared from the heart, but lasting effects remained. Infected mice had reduced cardiac progenitor cells and developed left ventricular hypertrophy and dilation when subjected to stress. Viral protein localized with c-kit and Sca-1, indicating infection of progenitor cells. The study suggests self-limited CVB infection may have lasting effects on adult heart's ability to adapt to stress.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Burkholderia pseudalle, which causes meloidosis, interacts with immune cells called macrophages. They found that the bacterium activates a protein called caspase-1 through a receptor called NLRC, but not NLR3, in the early stages of infection. Caspase-1 is involved in a process called pyroptosis, where the cell breaks down and dies. Later in infection, caspase-1 activation is independent of NLRC. The study identified a pathway involving casases-9 and PAR downstream of NLRC and casase-1. Without casase-1, macrophages undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death, which is dependent on other casases. The bacterium's flagellin and TSS3 protein play a role in casase-1 activation and pyptosis. Infection with a mutant bacterium lacking T3S3 showed reduced casase-1 activation, cell death, and IL-1 secretion. In mice infected with the mutant, mortality was lower, bacterial loads in organs, and IL-β, myeloperoxidase, and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were reduced. The study suggests a major role of T3 in NLRC-mediated casase-1 activation and pyptosis and contribution of casase-dependent and-independent cell death in Burkia infection.
Researchers studied the role of Arabidopsis Kβ, a subunit of the SNF1-related kinase complex, in pollen-stigma interactions during pollination. They found that Arabid Kβ is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of vegetative cells in pollen grains and is essential for pollen germination on the stigma. A mutant Arabidopsis lacking Kβ could not germinate on the stigma, but germinated normally in vitro. Further analysis revealed that hydration of mutant pollen on the stigma was compromised, but adding water promoted germination in vivo, suggesting defective hydration led to germination. Mutant pollen had destroyed and reduced mitochondria and peroxomes, and lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Adding H2O2 in vitro partially compensated for reduced hydration, and overexpressing Arabid CATAL 3 reduced ROS levels, compromising hydration on stigma. These results indicate Arabid Kβ regulates ROS by mediating biogenesis of mitochond and peroxomes, required for pollen-stigma interactions.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the enzyme RNase III plays a crucial role in protecting the cell from the expression of toxin genes carried by two prophages, Skin and SP, through antisense RNA. Unlike in other organisms, where RNase is not essential, in B. subtilis, its presence is vital for survival. Researchers found that RNase degrades two toxin-encoding mRNAs, txA and yT, from Skin and SP prophages. Without these prophages or toxin mRNAs, deleting the RNase gene is possible and growth is unaffected. The role of RNase in B. subtil is not related to its function in RNA metabolism or ribosomal maturation, but rather in degrading double-stranded RNA. The absence of RNase in B. subtil results in trace amounts of 30S rRNA precursor, lower than in E. coli. Other enzymes involved in rRNA maturation, RN J, MiniIII, and M, function without RNase action. Microarray analysis of B. subtil depleted of RNase shows minor contribution to antisense RNA stability. RNase has been shown to be involved in bacterial defense against phage DNA in many species and in eukaryotes, in RNA interference and microRNA generation.
Researchers studied the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by the parasitic nematode Brugia malayi, which causes Lymphatic Filariasis. They found that EVs are released by all stages of the parasite's life cycle, including microfilar, L3, L4, adult, and female worms, and are internalized by murine macrophages with no preference for stage, suggesting a uniform mechanism for effector molecule trafficking. Proteomic profiling of adult and female EVs revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in the EV proteome, defining the biogenesis of Brug EVs and revealing sexual dimorphic characteristics in immunomod cargo. Ivermect was found to inhibit EV release by all Brug life stages, also observed in the related nemat Dirofilar imitis but not in iverect-unresponsive isolate, suggesting a mechanism of action for this drug and new platforms for anti-filar drug development.
A study was conducted in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands to determine the prevalence of scabies and impigo, two common and treatable skin conditions. Ten rural villages were included in the study and 190 residents were enrolled. The total prevalence of scabies was 19.2% and impigo 32.7. The highest prevalence of scabies was found in infants under 1 year old at 34.1% and children 1-4 years at 25.7.7%. Impigo was most common in children 1-4 years at 42.6%. Scabies was associated with impigo with 41.1% of impigo cases also having scabies. The study found scabies and impigo are common in the Western Province of Solomon and sc infestation is associated with impigo.
Researchers studied the relationship between immune cells and cell growth in the hippocampus, a part of the brain, in adult mice. They found a strong connection between the number of immune cells and growth in the hippocampus and the proportion of two types of immune cells, CD4 and CD8. This connection is influenced by genetics, with some genes affecting the immune cells but not the growth in the hippocampus. They also found that a specific type of immune cell, CD4, plays a role in growth in the hippocampus. The study used a large group of mice with natural genetic variation to show that the connection is not just a result of unusual conditions in lab mice, but a natural variation in genetics. They found that the connection between immune cells and growth in hippocampus is stronger than previously thought, and that genetics that affect immune cells also affect growth in hippocampus.
Researchers have developed a vaccine, called TVac, to protect against Chagas disease, a major health problem in Latin America and emerging in the US. They identified potential vaccine candidates by analyzing the Trypanosoma cruzi database and tested TVac in a mouse model. Mice were immunized with TVac and then infected with the parasite. TVac induced a strong antibody response and moderate lymphocyte proliferation. Upon infection, TVac-vaccinated mice expanded antibodies and elicited a CD8 T cell response with type 1 cytokines, resulting in parasite control. During the chronic phase, antibody persisted and CD8 T cells and type 1 cytokines subsided, while type 2 cytokines became dominant. TVac-vaccinated mice had undetectable parasitism, inflammation, and fibrosis in the heart and muscle. In contrast, mice with vector or cytokines only responded with a mixed type 1/type 2 response and persistent parasite burden in the myocardium. TVac-induced type 1 and lymphocyte responses provided resistance to acute infection and prevented chronic immunology. This study tested TVac efficacy in antibody, cell, and cytokine responses providing protection from parasitemia and immunology in chasic mice. The vaccine reduced parasite burden below detection limits in chronic animals. Immunized with TVac elicited a parasite-specific response rapidly after infection. TVac antigen candidates were conserved among strains and expressed in infective stages. Mice were immunized with T1, T2, and T4 antigens elicited significant anti-parasitic responses. This increased the pool of protective candidates against T. Heterous-prime and protein-boost is a promising.
Researchers have used a machine learning approach called Support Vector Machine (SVM) to assess the risk of developing type 1 diabetes (T1) based on genetic data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Previous studies have struggled to accurately predict disease risk due to only using a limited number of known susceptibility loci. The researchers applied the VM algorithm to a dataset from the Affymetrix genotyping platform and optimized a risk model with hundreds of markers. They tested this model on two independent datasets, one from the Illumina genotyping platform with 1,008 cases and 1,000 controls, and another from Affetrix genotyping with 1,529 cases and 1,458 controls, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84 in both. In contrast, using only a few known loci in the model or logistic regression resulted in poor performance. The study suggests that disease risk assessment can be improved by accounting for interactions between a large number of markers. The researchers are optimistic that genotype-based risk assessment may be feasible for diseases where a significant proportion of risk is captured by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays.
Researchers studied how memory CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that provides protection against viral infections, behave in the skin during a secondary infection. They found that these cells can enter the skin without needing to go through lymph nodes, which are areas of the body where immune cells are activated, and provide protection against the virus. This is different from naive CD8 cells, which need to go through lymph nodes to enter the skin. Memory CD8 cells can differentiate into two types: central memory (TCM) and effector memory (TEM). The study found that TC cells become cytotoxic, meaning they can kill infected cells, after entering the skin and provide protection, while TEM cells do not. They also found that TC cells express granzyme, an enzyme that helps kill infected cells, after entering the skin. The study shows that TC cells become cytotoxic after entering the skin to protect against infection and then differentiate into functional cells that stay in the skin.
Myosin VI, a minus-directed motor protein, plays a crucial role in the localization of proteins to the surface of axons in neurons. Unlike Myosin Va, a plus-directed motor, which targets proteins to dendrites, Myos VI is responsible for enriching proteins on the axonal surface. Research shows that when Myos VI interacts with non-neuronal proteins, they become highly concentrated at the axonal surface in dissociated cortical neurons. Disrupting Myos VI function or expression leads to aberrant localization of axonal proteins to dendrites. Myos VI mediates enrichment of proteins on axonal surface by stimulating dendrite endocytosis, a mechanism that underlies localization of many axonal proteins. A version of Channelrhodopsin 2 engineered to bind to Myos VI is concentrated on axonal surface of cortical neurons in vivo, suggesting it as a tool for probing circuit and function. Myins contribute to polarized distribution of both axonal and dendritic proteins, necessary for proper electrical signaling. Axonal and dendritic proteins are trafficked by distinct mechanisms, with ax proteins associated with My VI entering both compartments but concentrated in ax through My VI-dependent endocyt from dendritic membrane. My VI is a minus-directed motor that moves towards pointed end of actin filaments, and its involvement in endocyt suggests it enriches proteins on axonal surface.
Researchers have identified two Doublesex (Dsx) genes in the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna, a species that produces males in response to environmental cues. One of these genes, DmaD1, is responsible for male development during environmental sex determination. The organization of DmaD1 is similar to Dsx in insects, which are thought to be the sister group of branchiop crustans. However, the molecular basis of sexually dimorphic expression of DmaD1 is different from insects, with differences in transcript abundance rather than sex-specific pre-mRNA splicing. During embryogenesis, expression ofmaD1 is increased in males and transcripts detected in male structures. Knockdown ofma1 in males resulted in female traits, while ectopic expression in females resulted in male-like phenotypes. Another Dma gene,ma2, has similar expression patterns but silencing and overexpression did not induce clear phenotypic changes. These results establishma1 as a key regulator of the male phenotype. The study reveals how environmental sex determination is implemented by selective expression of a conserved component in genetic sex determination. An ancient link between genetic and environmental sex determination is inferred.
Researchers have developed a vaccine against genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) to prevent pain, reduce neonatal herpes, and decrease HIV transmission risk. The trivalent vaccine contains glycoproteins C, D, and E (g2, D, g2, E) to block virus entry and immune evasion. In rhes macaques, the vaccine induced plasma and mucosal antibodies that block immune activities and stimulated CD4 cell responses. After vaginal challenge, a limited infection was detected in naïve but not immunized macques. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated in guinea pigs. Animals were immunized with D, trivalent, or trivalent followed by booster D. The trivalent and tr +D groups were 97% and 99% efficacious in preventing lesions, outperforming D alone. Vaginal swabs were evaluated for HSV-2 DNA and replication between five and seven weeks after challenge. DNA was reduced in all groups compared to mock. Shedding of replication virus occurred fewer days in tr than D immunized while tr +D had no replication. The tr group had lesions <1% and replication on 0.2%. The vaccine has potential for prevention in humans.
Researchers have developed a new method called Perm-se to improve the mapping of protein-DNA interactions in highly repetitive regions of the genome using chromatin immunoprecitation followed by high throughput sequencing (Ch-se ). These regions are difficult to map because short reads from 50-100 base pairs map to multiple locations in the reference genome. Standard methods discard multi-mapping reads or are prone to false positives and negatives. Perm-se uses data from DNase hypersensitive sequencing and histone Ch-se to allocate reads to specific locations. It was tested on 64 ENCODE Ch-se datasets from GM78 and K562 cells and found many new protein-DNA interactions in segmental regions. These interactions are evolutionarily conserved and share characteristics with non-repet regions. The method was compared to other approaches and showed significant improvement in accuracy. A probabilistic model was developed to use DNase-se priors and histone Ch-se for allocation. This method is versatile and can use multiple data sources.
A nested case-control study was conducted in Tanzania to investigate the effects of schistosiasis on susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and HIV-1 viral load at HIV-1 seroconversion. Approximately 40% of the population had Schistosoma mansoni infection and 2% had S. haematobium. Women with schist infections had a higher odds of HIV-1 acquisition than those without (adjusted OR 2.8 [1.2-6], p=0.019). Schist-infected men did not have an increased odds of HIV-1 acquisition (adjusted OR 0.7 [0.3-1.8], p=0.42). HIV-1 RNA levels in post-serconversion blood in HIV-1 serconverters with schistosias were significantly higher than those without schosias: 4.4 [3.9-4.6] log copies/mL versus 3.7 [3.2-4], p=0.017. Pre-existing schist infection increased odds of HIV-1 in women and raised HIV-1 load at HIV-1 serconversion. This is the first study to demonstrate schist effect on HIV-1 susceptibility and control and differentiate by gender.
Researchers studied the copy number and sequence of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in human and mouse genomes, including those with cancer. They found that the number and sequence of rDNA can change in cancer. Contrary to expectations, human cancer genomes showed a loss of rDNA copies, accompanied by global copy number variation. The sequence was also more variable in cancer genomes. Genomes with lower rDNA copies had evidence of hyperactivity of the mTOR pathway. The PTEN phosphatase, a tumor suppressor, is critical for genome stability and negative regulator of the mTOR pathway. Surprisingly, hematopoietic cancer cells from a P-/- mouse model for leukemia had lower rDNA number than normal cells, despite increased rRNA and protein production. Loss of copies occurred early and was associated with hypersensitivity to DNA damage. The study suggests rDNA copy may be a simple indicator of cancer sensitivity to DNA treatments.
Researchers have developed a new approach to study the dynamics of bacterial growth and death within a host during an infection. They used genetically identical but distinguishable strains of Salmonella bacteria in mice to track the spread of the bacteria within the host. By analyzing the disappearance of the strains over time, they were able to estimate the rate of bacterial death. This method allowed them to understand the timing, occurrence, and control of key infection parameters in the host-pathogen combination. The study found that shortly after infection, rapid bacterial replication and death led to the establishment of separate bacterial populations in different organs, controlled by host antimicrobial mechanisms. Later, decreased mortality led to an increase in bacteria that spread locally, with mixing between organs through the bloodstream and further selection. This approach provides new insights into the pathogenesis of Salmonella infections, illustrating the complex and stochastic effects that drive disease. The method can be applied to other host-pathogen combinations, providing a comprehensive view of within-host dynamics.
Researchers investigated the inverse problem of binocular 3D motion perception, which is the process by which the brain determines the direction and speed of movement of objects in 3D space from visual information from two eyes. Current models of 3D motion perception, such as interocular velocity difference, changing disparity over time, and joint motion and disparity, were found to be insufficient in solving this problem. The study suggests that combining velocity constraints with binocular disparity and other cues provides a more flexible framework for solving the inverse problem. In the context of the aperture problem, two plausible strategies were derived: the normal preferred motion in 3D and cyclopean based on motion in 2D. Predicting motion direction for ambiguous motion allows distinguishing between these strategies of 3D processing. Theoretical results indicate that velocity and disparity from tracking are necessary to solve 3D perception. It is plausible that motion and disparity are processed in parallel and integrated in the visual hierarchy. 

Existing models of 3D perception were evaluated to gain a better understanding of binocular 3 motion. It was shown that existing models are insufficient to solve the inverse of binocular 3 motion. Velocity constraints in bin geometry were established, demonstrating additional information is necessary to disambiguate velocity and derive an estimate. Integration of motion and disparity with other cues solves the inverse of 3 motion, allowing the system to remain flexible when segmenting inputs from different stages into a global 3 percept. Geometric intersection of two planes in binocular geometry defines a line in 3 velocity space. Tracking features in depth with bin velocity provides a strategy to disiguate 3 direction and solve the problem.
Researchers studied the role of two proteins, AlgJ and AlgX, involved in the O-acetylation of alginate, a polysaccharide produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa during lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. They determined the structure of Alg to 1.83 resolution and found it to be a SGN hyrolase-like protein, similar to the N-terminal domain of AlgX, but with a distinct electrostatic surface potential. They identified a conserved catalytic triad of D190, H192 and S288 and demonstrated Alg's acetylester activity in vitro. Residues in Alg's signature motifs formed interactions critical for alginate Oety in vivo. Using electrospray ion mass spectrometry, they compared Alg and Alg's abilities to bind and acety alginate. Alg exhibited weak or no binding to polymannonic acid, while Alg bound specifically in a length-dependent manner. Alg also utilized acetyl donor 4-nitrophenyl acetate to catalyze Oety polymuric acid. The study suggests Alg and Alg have separate roles in alg Oetylation, with Alg as the terminal transferase, providing a rationale for the number of proteins required for polyschar Oety.
Candida albicans, a common cause of human fungal infections and a significant source of mortality, evades detection by the innate immune system by masking its cell wall's inner layer of β(1,3)-gluc with an outer layer of heavily glycosylated mannoprote (mannan). However, mutations or drugs that disrupt the cell wall can lead to exposure of β(1,3)-glan (unmasking) and detection by innate cells like Dect-1, a C-type lectin. The phosphatidylser (PS) synthase Cho1 plays a role in β(1,3)-glan masking. A homozygous mutant Cho1Δ exhibits increased β(1,3)-gl exposure. Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAP) pathways and upstream Rho small Gases regulate cell biogenesis and remodeling. In ChoΔ, C1 and M1 MAPs are constitutively activated, acting downstream of Gases C42 and R1. C42 activity is upregulated in ChoΔ. Activation of C42 or R1 and downstream kinases cause unmask. Disruption of M1 does not decrease unmask in ChoΔ, and hyperactivation R1 in wild-type increases unmask and activation of C1 and M1. Hyperactivation Ste11 in wild-type leads to C1 activation and β(1,3)-gl exposure. Upregulation of C1 causes unmask and may be responsible for unmask in ChoΔ.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study of genetic loci associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies. They defined clinico-path AD or controls, assessed neuropath features of AD (neuritic plaques, NPs; neurofibr tangles, NFT), and evaluated co-mor neuropath changes: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and vascular injury (BI). Genome-wide significance was observed for clin-path AD, NPs, NFT, CAA, and L with variants in apolipoprotein E (APO), GAL7, ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1), and intergenic on chromosome 9. Twelve of 21 non-APO genetic loci for clin-defined AD were confirmed in clin-path sample: CR1, BIN, CL, MSA, PICAL, ABC, CD, TK, SOR, M, ZW, and C with 9 of 12 loci showing odds ratio in clin-path. Correlation effect sizes for AD with NFT or NPs showed positive, while for VBI showed negative. Co-mor neuropath features showed nominal association with known loc. The study discovered new associations with neuropath features and aligned genetic AD risk with neurop changes in the largest autopsy of AD and dementias.
Researchers have long used urea as a denaturant to study protein unfolding, but its role in the process is still unclear: does it induce unfolding or stabilize the unfolded state? To answer this, they analyzed 30 proteins with different folds through molecular simulations using various force fields and found rules for urea unfolding that apply to all proteins. Urea accumulates in the first layer around native proteins, but less densely than in the unfolded state, and doesn't alter vibrations, but reduces their magnitude, slowing unfolding. Long urea molecules near hydrophobic cores stabilize partially open structures generated by thermal fluctuations. Urea doesn't favor open states, but actively unfolds by selecting and stabilizing partially unfolded states, driving the ensemble away from native and thermal conformations. Van der Waals drive ure accumulation, but H-bonding is crucial for long-living interactions near hinges, biasing dynamics towards unfolding. This study provides a complete picture of ure's role in destabilizing folded proteins and mechanisms contributing to unfolding.
A systematic review of epidemiological studies on deng disease in Colombia between 2000 and 201 was conducted. The review included 30 studies published in English or Spanish that mentioned "deng", "epidemi", and "Colia". The results showed a stable annual number of deng fever cases, with major outbreaks in 2001-2003 and 2010. Geographical spread of deng cases increased, with most of the country affected by 2010. The majority of deng cases were among those under 15 years old. Gaps in knowledge on d disease in Colombia include asymptomatic d virus infection, primary infections, and underreporting of disease. Improved understanding of factors that determine disease expression is important for control and management.

The review described national and regional trends of d in Colombia, including incidence by age and sex, seroprevalence and serotype, and other data. It is part of a series on d in the Americas and Asia. The review highlights non-severe d cases in 2010 in Colombia. There is a lack of information on asymptomatic d virus, secondary infections, and factors for severity and underreporting d in Colombia. Improved surveillance may address these gaps.

There was a 90% increase in municipalities reporting d between 2000 and 201, from 424 to 743. Incidence was low in south and south Colombia, due to lowest population density. D is a priority in Colombia and control has been difficult. The period 200-201 had stable annual cases, punctuated by outbreaks 1-3 and 201. Annual DH increased 200-10, then decreased 201.
Leishmaniasis (TL) is a disease caused by Leish parasites that affects skin and mucosal tissues. People with TL may also have other pathogens that can influence the outcome of the disease. This review looks at the frequency of TL coinfections in populations, interactions between Leish and other pathogens in animal and human models, and implications for clinical practice. TL is defined as all forms of cutaneous, localized, disseminated, or mucocutaneous leishiasis. HIV coinfection, superinfection with bacteria, and skin manifestations of visceral leishias are not included. A search of MEDLINE and other databases found 73 records: 21 studies in animals and 52 in humans, mainly cross-sectional and case studies. Reports show high frequency of Trypanosoma cruzi coinfection in TL patients in Argentina (41%) and helminthias in TL in Brazil (15-88%). Different mechanisms of interaction between microorganisms have been explored, but no clear answers. Interactions may involve innate immunity and regulatory networks affecting quality and quantity of immune responses. Diagnostic problems occur when concurrent infections cause similar lesions (e.g., TL and leprosy), when pathogens present in same lesions (e.g., Leish and Sporothrix schenii), or similarities phylogenetically close pathogens affect accuracy of tests (e.g., serology leishias and Chagas). Coinfections (e.g., helthias) reduce effectiveness of antileman treatment and combinations cause cumulative effects. Patients with TL coinfection frequent can lead to diagnostic delays and influence effectiveness and safety of treatment.
Researchers investigated the impact of genetic variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on CD4:CD lineage commitment and MHC expression in rats. They used two genetic models, the heterogeneous stock (HS) and a panel of M-recombinant congenic strains, to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with variation in MHC class I and II protein expression and CD:CD T cell ratio. Ten QTL were found across the genome, and those for individual traits colocalized within a region spanning the MHC. To identify genes underlying these QTL, a large panel of M-recomant congenic strains was generated, and QTL refined to adjacent intervals of 0.25 Mb in the M-I and II regions. An interaction between these intervals affected M class I expression as well as negative selection and commitment of CD single positive (SP) thymocytes. The effect was mapped to transporter associated antigen 2 (Tap) in the M-II region and classical M class gene (RT-A) in M-I. This interaction was revealed by recombination between RT-A and Tap, occurring in 0.2% of rats. Variants of Tap have been shown to influence antigenicity M class molecules by altering the class ligome. Results showed a restricted repertoire on M class molecules leads to reduced selection CD cells. This is the first study showing recombination between natural alleles in M influences commitment of cells.
Researchers analyzed data from Spain's National Hospital Discharge Database to study the evolution of Chagas disease from 1997 to 2011. They found that Spain has the second-highest number of Chagas cases in Europe due to high migration from Latin America. Hospitalization rates increased from 18 to 242.8 per 100,000 population between 199-2004 and 2005-201. The median age was 35 years, with 74% female and 16-45 age group mostly represented. 23.4% of hospitalizations included Chagas with complications. Being male, aged 45-64, and hospital cost over 3,065 euros were associated with complications. Since 2005, detected cases increased, mostly asymptomatic women aged 16-45, highlighting need for early detection. 

Between 199-201, 172 hospitalizations were recorded, 31.6% re-admissions, 90% between 200-201. Hospital rates were 18 and 242.8 per 100,000 respectively. 75.3% were without complications, 23.4 with complications, 81.7 heart and 17.9 other. Invasive procedures were documented 84.6%. 55.6% were female, 16-45 and 46-65 mostly represented 49.3 and 32.7. Surgical 12.2 and invasive 71.4 documented. Urgent admission, male, over 45, Chagas, re-admission, and cost over 3,065 associated with complications.
Researchers have developed a new approach called Blocuster to identify combinations of genetic factors that contribute to complex diseases, such as psoriasis. These combinations, or "combinatorial interactions," are thought to account for a significant portion of the "missing heritability" of diseases, but have been difficult to discover due to computational complexity and genetic heterogeneity. Blocuster efficiently constructs genome-wide, allele-specific networks that segregate homogenous combinations of genetic factors and tests their associations with a given phenotype. The method was applied to psoriasis data, discovering a combinatorial pattern with an odds ratio of 3.64 and a Bonferr-corrected p-value of 5.01×10−16. This pattern was replicated in independent data, demonstrating the method's robustness. Blocuster improves disease prediction and understanding of psoriasis pathogenesis, and shows potential for discovering combinatorial genetic associations in genome-wide data, transcending "small" effects of individual markers examined in isolation.
Researchers conducted a large-scale study to investigate chromosomal copy number variations (CN) in 255 patients with agenesis of the corpus callo (ACC), 220 with cerebell hypoplasia (CBL), and 147 with polymicrogyria (PM), and 2,349 controls. They found that patients with ACC had significantly more rare and large CNs than controls, but not CBL or PM. Rare CNs impacted at least 1% of the population and large CNs over 20 genes. Independent PCR confirmed 9.4% of ACC patients had de novo CNs, which preferentially overlapped with previously observed in autism disorders. Reports show reduced corpus callo area in autism and social/executive function in ACC. The study refined known CNs, including 8p23.1-p11 duplication in 2% of ACC, and found novel CNs in single patients, likely deleterious deletions and duplications. One patient with microcephaly had paternally inherited deletion 16.13 including N1. Exome sequencing revealed recessive matally inherited nonsense in non-deleted N1. This is the first systematic study of CN in congenital malformations, showing higher gene-rich CN in ACC than CBL and PM.
Researchers studied the role of a protein called Yorkie in the regeneration of planarians, a type of flatworm that can regrow lost body parts. They found that Yorkie is important for integrating responses to injury, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue patterning. When York was blocked, the planarians had an overactive and prolonged response to injury, with increased cell growth and gene expression. This led to an increase in epidermal and muscle cells, which are thought to be sources of wound-induced genes. However, the planarians had trouble sensing the size of the injury and could not correctly remodel tissues to the size of the regenerating fragment. The study suggests York is a key molecule that integrates multiple aspects of injury response, including cell growth, gene expression, and patterning.
Researchers have found that the exosomes released by cells infected with the EV71 virus contain a specific type of RNA called miR-146, which helps the virus to replicate by suppressing the host's immune response. Exosomes are tiny particles that can transfer genetic material between cells and play a role in viral infections. The study showed that EV71 infection leads to increased exosome secretion and packaging of viral RNA and mi-146, with mi-146 being enriched in exosomes and not in infected cells. Exosomes with viral RNA and mi-146 can transfer to new cells and replicate, while mi-146 suppresses the host's type I interferon response, allowing the virus to replicate. IF-stimulated genes, BST-2/tether, are involved in regulating exosome secretion. In vivo study, exosomal RNA accumulated in tissues more than free virus particles. The findings suggest exosomes secreted by EV-infected cells package high levels of mi-146 that facilitate exosomal EV RNA replication in recipient cells by suppressing type I interferon response.
Researchers studied the relationship between two proteins, PINK and Parkin, which are involved in maintaining healthy mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells. PINK is linked to early-onset Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder. Parkin has been suggested to work downstream of PINK based on genetic studies in fruit flies. To understand how PINK and Park interact, the researchers purified PINK-binding proteins from human cells and used fruit fly models to isolate molecules involved in PINK pathology. They found a PINK-binding protein, PG5, which modulates the PINK pathway. Loss of PG5 in fruit flies suppressed muscle degeneration, motor defects, and shorter lifespan caused by PINK inactivation, attributed to mitochondrial degeneration. However, PG inactivation failed to modulate Park mutant phenotypes. Ectopic expression of PG exacerbated PINK and Park phenotypes. This suggests PG negatively regulates PINK related to mitochondrial maintenance and acts between PINK and Park, or independently of Park downstream PINK.
Researchers investigated the role of interferon-γ (IFNγ) in the immune response to Mycobacterium ulcerans infection, which causes Buruli ulcer (BU), a chronic skin disease characterized by toxin production of mycolactin. They found that IFγ is crucial for early host defense against M. ulcer in mice, as knockout mice lacking IFγ showed faster disease progression, more tissue damage, and higher bacterial load after 5 weeks. This suggests IFγ activates macrophages to kill intracellular bacteria during early growth phase of M. ulcer. The study supports the idea that vaccine concepts for tuberculosis may also apply to BU, as both pathogens have similar immune mechanisms but M. ulcer produces toxic mycolin that kills host cells and causes necrosis. The researchers used an experimental mouse model to compare disease progression in wild-type and IFγ- mice infected with a virulent M. ulcer strain. They found that IFγ stimulates macrophages to kill intracellular bacteria early in infection, and its absence leads to accelerated and severe pathology with higher bacterial load. This indicates that IFγ plays a key role in early defense against M. ulcer infection.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mitochondria, which is linked to various diseases. They found that hypoxia (low oxygen levels) increases ROS production, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. To analyze this complex process, a new methodology was developed to create a large set of differential equations to model electron transport in mitochondria. This allowed identification of two steady states of operation (bistability) of respiratory complex III at the same conditions. Various perturbations can switch the chain from one state to another. Normally, complex is in low ROS mode, but anox can switch it to high ROS state, persisting after oxygen return. This prediction was experimentally validated, explaining anox-induced cell damage. Bistability of complex operation may lead to new therapeutic strategies for oxidative stress. The model can be used in biology studies.
Researchers studied the role of the terminal gene "huckin" (Hkb) in the development of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. They used a systems-level approach to investigate how Hkb affects the expression of gap genes, which are crucial for segment formation along the body's anterior-posterior axis during the blastoderm stage. The team found that Hkb is involved in regulating the posterior border of the "hunchback" (hb) domain, but has no other essential function. They created mathematical models of gene networks, called gap circuits, to analyze Hkb's effect on gap expression. These models were able to reproduce mutants of terminal genes that previous models couldn't, and capture the dynamics of all posterior genes correctly. This is an important step towards understanding the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of the gap network. The study used quantitative data of H protein expression to fit the models, which produced more consistent and well-determined estimates. They combined this with data from other gap genes to simulate the dynamics of gene expression. The models confirmed previous results and showed that H is required for the anterior shift in the posterior border of the hb domain. This is a significant improvement over previous models that couldn't reproduce this correctly. The study provides a better understanding of the gap network's behavior and its role in development.
Researchers have developed a new treatment for Brucellos, a zoonotic disease that causes significant economic losses worldwide, by using a non-invasive method to monitor its effectiveness. Currently, there is no effective treatment or biomarker for Bruclos, and infected animals remain carriers for life. Two live attenuated strains of Brucella abortus, S19 and 51, were used, but S induces antibodies only, while 51 induces cell-mediated immunity, but is Rifampicin resistant. Both are secreted in milk and can infect humans and cause abortions in animals. Researchers used phage lysates of Bruc abortus 19 and 51, which retain immunogenicity, to treat Bruclos in cattle. The phage lysates induced strong antibody and cell-mediated immunity in vitro and stimulated interferon production in immunized cattle. A single subcutaneous dose of 2ml cocktail of both lysates eliminated virulent Bruc from Bruclos affected cattle, with undetectable Bruc specific RNA by RT-PCR and negative Bruc culture in 3 months post-immun. This is the first report on minimally invasive monitoring of antibacterial therapy employing RNA as biomarker and use of 51 phage lysate for immunotherapy Bruclos in cattle.
Researchers investigated the role of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) in the response to DNA damage in human cells. They found that Cdk is active during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, but is not essential for cell survival, as other CDKs can compensate for its absence. To uncover a specific requirement for Cdk activity, they used a mutant version of C2 that is sensitive to inhibition by adenosine analogs. They showed that transient inhibition of this mutant C2 after ionizing radiation exposure increased cell killing. They also found that C2 phosphorylates the N1 protein, a component of the MRN complex required for DNA repair and checkpoint signaling, on a specific site. Inhibiting C2 delayed N1 phosphorylation and mutation of this site increased sensitivity to radiation. This study reveals a specific requirement for C2 in the DNA response and a target within the repair machinery.
Researchers used a technique called formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) to study how genetic variants associated with blood-related traits, such as platelet count and platelet volume, are linked to specific regions of the genome. They analyzed two types of blood cells, megakaryocytes and erythroblasts, and found distinct patterns of open chromatin, which guided the identification of functional variants. A region on chromosome 7q22.3 in megaryocytes but not erythroblasts was found to harbor a non-coding variant rs342 associated with platelet volume. Resequencing this region in 643 individuals confirmed rs342 as the causative variant. The researchers showed that transcription factor EVI binds to PIKCG gene in platelets and macrophages, and a protein-protein network indicated PI3CG's role in platelet biogenesis and thrombus formation. This is the first identified functional variant among known platelet quantitative trait loci (QTL). The study suggests a mechanism by which non-coding GWA SNP modulates platelet phenotype. Additionally, genetic loci associated with platelet count, SHB-ATX2 and PTP11, have been linked to coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, suggesting platelets may be an intermediate phenotype.
Researchers studied the effects of blocking a specific type of electrical current, called persistent sodium current (INa), in the respiratory system using computer simulations and experiments. This current is thought to play a role in rhythm generation in the pre-Bötzinger complex (preötC), a group of neurons that control breathing. They used two common blockers with different mechanisms: tetrodotoxin (TX) and ruzole (R). TX blocks the current directly, while R shifts it in a way that makes it harder to activate. In experiments, blocking IN with TX or R showed it's important for rhythm in isolated preöt neurons and network. However, results were contradictory, leading to debate on its role. Simulations matched data from isolated neurons to intact network and generated predictions. Key findings: (1) explained contradictory results in vitro studies, (2) INP block in vitro not equivalent to intact, (3) R fails to block INP in intact, and (4) low TX will stop rhythm in intact network. This supports INP's role in rhythm generation and highlights importance of considering mechanism when interpreting data.
Researchers investigated the role of microRNA-218 (mi-218) in gastric cancer metastasis, a process by which cancer cells spread to other parts of the body. They found that mi-218 is decreased in gastric cancer cells that have spread, and its host gene Slit is also low. However, mi-218 targets Robo1, a receptor that interacts with Slit, creating a negative feedback loop. When mi-218 is low, Rob1 is not repressed, allowing Slit-Robo pathway to activate, promoting metastasis. Restoring mi-218 suppresses Rob1 and inhibits cell invasion and metastasis in lab and animal tests. The study reveals a regulatory circuit between Slit, mi-218, and Rob1 that may contribute to metastasis. Targeting mi-218 could block metastasis.
Researchers used a mouse model of human-like hypercholesterolemia to study the effects of lowering cholesterol on atherosclerosis development. They found that atherosclerotic lesions progressed slowly at first, then rapidly expanded and plateaued after advanced lesions formed. Analysis of lesion profiles showed accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages led to rapid expansion with foam formation and inflammation, supported by histology. Lowering plasma cholesterol prevented formation of advanced plaques and transcription profiling identified 37 cholesterol-responsive genes mediating this effect. Validation by siRNA inhibition in macrophages incubated with acylated-LDL revealed a network of 8 cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes regulating cholesterol accumulation. The study identified a network of atherosclerosis genes responding to plasma-lowering preventing formation of advanced plaques, of interest for novel atherosclerosis therapies.
Researchers have developed a high-throughput screening method to identify genes involved in the assembly of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, which is a challenging barrier for antibiotics to penetrate. The method was used to screen a library of single-gene deletions in Escherichia coli and identified known and unknown factors involved in the process. One of the unknown factors, Ely (C), was found to play a role in the metabolism of a lipid essential for cell wall and surface polysaccharide synthesis. Further analysis of Ely and other hits is expected to reveal new information on Gram-negative envelope assembly and vulnerabilities for drug targeting. The screening method is adaptable to other organisms to study different envelope architectures and how bacteria adapt to niches. Understanding envelope assembly is key to combating resistance, with recent progress made in identifying essential biogenesis machineries, but many aspects remain poorly characterized, including regulatory strategies for layer construction. Study of these factors may reveal new assembly mechanisms and targets. The discovery of Ely as a biogenesis factor validates the screening approach. Its functions in lipid metabolism are consistent with data, including Und production or recycling, with implications for understanding biogenesis.
Researchers have been using various techniques to study dynamical processes in biology, each revealing unique aspects of the system. However, integrating multiple datasets into a comprehensive view of multivar dynamics has been a challenge. A new approach is presented that combines heterogeneous data using semi-supervised learning, exploiting the geometry of high-dimensional datasets. This method was applied to a dataset of Drosophila pattern formation, resulting in a continuous trajectory showing joint dynamics of gene expression, cellular localization, protein phosphorylation, and morphogenesis. The approach can be adapted to other imaging modalities and serves as a starting point for further analytics and modeling of biological dynamics.

A semi-supervised solutions were found for each pixel and channel, combining labeled and unlabeled datasets. The result is a multivar trajectory for joint dynamics of tissue and molecular components within the patterning network. A dataset of 100 images was used, showing nuclei position and distribution of patter network components. Pairwise similarities were computed between images using common channels. The semi-supervised approach was applied to fuse this dataset.

The task of synthesizing multivar dynamics from heterogeneous datasets is non-trivial due to limitations. Approaches have been discussed in physics and social sciences, but systematic methods have not been established. This study addresses imaging of developing tissues, where patterns are established by complex networks. The task was posed as a semi-supervised problem, resulting in a closed-form expression for estimated variables. Reconstructed trajectories provide basis for mechanistic studies of multivar processes responsible for reproducible pattern formation.
Researchers studied three types of snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), PI, PII, and PIII, to understand how they cause hemorrhage by damaging blood vessels. They compared the enzymes' ability to break down components of the extracellular matrix, a network of proteins surrounding cells, in the body. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that PII and PIII SVs localized with type IV collagen in capillaries, arterioles, and post-capillaries more than PI SV, which was distributed throughout the tissue. The enzymes broke down lamin, type collagen, and nidogen differently, but equally broke down type IV collagen, suggesting its breakdown is key to vessel destabilization and hemorrhage. Proteomic analysis of exudate revealed differences between the enzymes' effects, with PI breaking more extracellular components and fibrin, while PII and P SVs had more intracellular proteins. The study provides clues on how SVs damage blood vessels and cause hemorrhage.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the homeotic genes are arranged on the chromosome in the order of the body segments they affect, with posterior genes repressing anterior ones. However, this rule is qualified by abdominal-A (ab-A) and abdominal-B (Abd-B). In animals lacking Abd-B, ectopic expression of ab-A is seen in the epidermis of the eighth segment, but not the nervous system. Repression in these cells is accomplished by a 92 non-coding RNA, iab-8. This RNA produces a micro RNA to repress ab-A and has a second, redundant mechanism acting cis. Transcription interference with ab-A promoter is the likely mechanism. The i-8 interferes with ab enhancer, which must lie downstream of the i-6 breakpoint, as ab-A is derepressed in PS CNS embryos homozygous for this. The ab-A promoter is the likely target of interference, as the poly site of i-8 lies 1.1 kb upstream of initiation of ab-A and i-8 transcript continues past poly site. Embryos with strong ab-A misexpression in CNS of 8th segment suggest i-8 can repress ab on chromosome it is transcribed from. Control for haploinsufficiency of i-8, Δmi-8 was tested over Df9, removing entire bithor complex. Δmi-8/D9 embryos show no ab misexpression. Two mechanisms i-8 represses ab, first through i- miRNA acting trans and second repressive acting cis. Rearrangements truncating i- near start cause derepression ab in CNS of 8 segment, indistinguishable from Df3 homozyg. Same ab spread into CNS seen Fab deletion removing i- promoter.
Researchers have studied the patterns of focal seizures, which are episodes of abnormal brain activity that start in a specific area of the brain. They found two main types: low-amplitude fast (LAF) and high-amplitude (HAS) oscillations. Using a computer model of brain tissue, they simulated these patterns and found that they arise from different mechanisms. Low-amplitude oscillations start with localized activity that spreads slowly, while high-amplitude is a global transition to a seizure state triggered by a local event. This transition is enabled by increased excitability of surrounding tissue that doesn't generate seizures but can support them. Simulations showed this difference in tissue excitability explains clinical differences in surgical outcomes. The model also suggests that tissue excitability around the seizure core determines the pattern and outcome.
Researchers have identified a protein called ZES-4 in maize plants that plays a crucial role in the process of pollen tube burst and sperm release during fertilization. Pollen tubes are long, thin structures that transport sperm cells from the male gametophyte to the female gamete, where fertilization occurs. ZES-4 is produced in the female gamophyte and accumulates in vesicles at the secretory zone of the syner cells, which are gland-like cells. Upon pollen arrival, these vesicles are released and Z-4 interacts with a potassium channel called K1, causing it to open and allow potassium ions to flow in. This influx of potassium leads to water uptake and osmotic pressure, causing the pollen tube to burst and release its contents. The process is species-specific, meaning it only occurs in certain plant species, and may be a pre-zygotic barrier contributing to reproductive isolation. Using RNA knockdown and synthetic Z-4 proteins, researchers found that it induces pollen tube burst in a species-specific manner. The channel K1 is a direct target of Z-4 and opens at physiological potentials and closes after washing out.
Researchers have developed a targeted oncolytic herpes virus, called RM249, that specifically infects and kills cancer cells expressing high levels of the HER2 protein, which is overexpressed in ovarian and breast cancers. To test its effectiveness, they used a mouse model that mimics the spread of ovarian cancer to the peritoneal cavity, a common in women with advanced ovarian cancer. Intraperitoneal administration of RM249 strongly inhibited the growth of tumors, with 60% of mice free from peritoneal diffusion and 95% reduction in total neoplastic nodules. The virus also reduced growth of ovarian and breast cancer metastases in the peritone and brain. Notably, RM is effective against HER2-trastuzum-resistant cells, a property important for clinical application. Previously, RM showed anti-tumor activity against subcutaneously injected human ovarian cancer cells. This study evaluated its activity against intraperitoneal cancer, which frequently spreads to lungs, peritone organs, bones, brain, and peritone cavity. Results show RM effectively inhibits peritone dissemination of HER2 ovarian and breast carcinomas.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism that regulates the duplication of centrosomes, the structures that form the poles of the mitotic spindle, in yeast cells. They found that a protein called Sfi, a component of the centrosome, is the first target of a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) that restricts centome duplication to once per cell cycle. Phosphorylation of S1 by Cdk is necessary for separation of duplicated spindle bodies and preventing premature duplication during mitosis. Defects in this process lead to defects in spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and cell growth. The study suggests that dephosphlation of S1 by protein C14 activates licensing for the next cycle.
HIV-1 protein Vpr plays a crucial role in accelerating viral replication during acute infection by exploiting proliferating CD4+ T cells, particularly regulatory T cells (Tregs), in vivo. Previous studies have shown that V causes G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HIV-1-infected cells in vitro, and is conserved in transmitted/founder HIV-1 and primate lentiviruses. However, its role in vivo was unclear. Using a humanized mouse model, researchers demonstrated that V causes G2 cycle arrest and apoptosis in proliferating CCR+ CD+ T cells, mainly Tregs, resulting in T depletion and enhanced virus production during infection. V-dependent replication and T depletion observed in C5ropic but not Xropic HIV-1-infected mice, suggesting effects dependent on coreceptor usage by HIV-1. Immune activation observed in Cropic wild-type but not V-deficient HIV-infected humanized mice. Treatment with denileuk difoxin (DD) to deplete Tregs showed massive activation/proliferation of memory cells compared to untreated. This activation/prolifer enhanced C5 in memory CD+ cells and made them susceptible to Cropic wild-type HIV-1 than V-deficient virus. Results suggest V takes advantage of proliferating C5 CD+ cells for viremia Cropic HIV-1. Tregs exist in higher state than other subsets, making them vulnerable to V during acute infection.
Researchers studied the genetic changes in the Plasmodium vivax population in South Korea from 1994 to 2008 using microsatellite DNA markers. P. viv was eliminated in South Korea in the late 1970s but re-emerged in 1993. The study aimed to understand the population structure and transmission dynamics of the parasite to control malaria. They analyzed 14 microsatellite loci of 163 isolates from 1994 to 2008. The results showed a decrease in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and genetic differentiation between successive years. A Bayesian analysis suggested a drastic change in the population in 2002 and 2003. Relapse and asymptomatic parasite carriage may have influenced the population, but the study suggests introduction of P. viv from other sources, possibly North Korea in 2002 and 2003. Microsatellite DNA analysis is effective for assessing population and transmission dynamics, aiding malaria elimination in endemic areas.
Researchers have discovered that a specific type of intron, a non-coding region within genes, plays a crucial role in regulating the direction of transcription in eukaryotes. They found that the presence of this type of intron, called splicing-competent intr, influences the direction of transcription by facilitating the recruitment of termination factors near the promoter region. Using a technique called strand-specific transcription run-on analysis, they showed that transcription of mRNA is favored over antisense transcripts initiating from the promoter in the presence of this intron. Mutating the 5 or 3 splice site of the intron resulted in a reversal of promoter direction, indicating that the entire intron, not just the 5 splice site, regulates directionality. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that termination factors are recruited near the promoter in the presence of intron, but not in its absence or with mutated sites. The team previously demonstrated that intron-mediated enhancement of transcription depends on gene looping, and now found that looping is essential for recruitment of termination factors in the promoter-proximal region of intr-containing genes. In a looping-defective mutant, despite normal splicing, occupancy of termination factors for poly A-dependent transcription was compromised, accompanied by loss of direction. The study proposes that intron-dependent looping places termination factors near the promoter for termination of antisense transcription, conferring direction.
Researchers have identified a novel transcription factor called ZBED, derived from a domesticated DNA transposon, which regulates IGF2 expression and muscle growth. A single nucleotide substitution in the IGF2 gene's intron 3 abrogates a repressor binding site, leading to a 3-fold upregulation of IGF in skeletal muscle, affecting muscle size, heart, and fat deposition. ZBED is a previously unknown protein specific to placental mammals and silencing it in mouse C2C myoblasts affects IGF expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing identified 2,500 ZBED binding sites in the genome, with a consensus motif matching the established IGF site. Genes associated with ZBED sites show significant enrichment in development and transcription regulation. ZBED's effects in mutant pigs and silenced C2 myoblasts, sequence conservation, nucleolar localization, and broad distribution suggest it's an important transcription factor in placental development, proliferation, and growth. ZBED binds to IGF, repressing its expression in skeletal muscle and C2 cells. Genes associated with neurogenesis are overrepresented, despite using C2 mylasts, suggesting further transcript analysis is needed. Silencing ZBED increases cell proliferation, myotube formation, and wound healing in C2 cells. Z's ability to interact with chromatin is likely from ancestral transase, with nucleolar localization suggesting transcriptional silencing. Over 1,000 genes are putatively regulated by ZBED in mouse, including Max, Myc, Fos, Jun, and NF2 transcription factors in cell proliferation and development. Z6 and Z3A proteins are detected in mouse postnatal muscle and brain, and 6-month-old pig skeletal muscle.
Researchers have used next-generation sequencing technology to study the RNA editing process in rhes macaque, a close relative of humans. They identified 31,250 editing sites, with 99.8% being A-to-G transitions, and verified 96.6% in coding regions and 97.5 in non-coding regions. The study found that adenosine deamination is associated with A-to-G editing sites flanked by ADAR substrates, and AD sequence and expression are factors in editing variance across sites and tissues. Some editing sites showed decreased divergence, suggesting evolutionary constraint maintaining double-stranded structure. This study provides a framework for understanding RNA editing in humans and highlights its functional regulation in primate evolution.
Researchers have found a new perceptual bias that affects how people perceive visual stimuli in a two-alternative discrimination tasks. In these tasks, observers try to determine which of two possible stimuli caused a certain responses. To do this, they integrate noisy neural responses into a more reliable representation of the likely stimulus. However, an ideal observer should evaluate the likelihood of each stimulus with high precision and only consider the relevant ones involved in the task. The study discovered that observers read the representation with low precision when discriminating spatial frequencies. By using spectrally filtered noise, an asymmetry was induced in the likelihood of spatial frequencies. This mainly affected frequencies irrelevant to the task, yet a significant shift in perceived frequency was found, indicating observers evaluate a range of irrelevant frequencies and discard prior knowledge of alternatives when performing two-altern discrimination.

 In an experiment, filtered noise altered perception of known gratings in a two-altern spatial discrimination, shifting frequency to lower and higher frequencies in low-pass and high filtered conditions. Observers considered log values of frequencies a-prior unlikely to occur, lowering detectability and biasing perceived frequency. Log functions were asymmetrical around vertical frequency in low and high filtered noise. Gratings were presented at high contrasts, corresponding to 84% correct thresholds in broadband noise. High performance and steep psychometric functions indicate decisions based on vertical frequency.

The study differs from traditional models of visual encoding gratings in noise, assuming external noise affects variability without changing average response. Grating detectability and discriminability were measured in filtered noise, finding backgrounds alter perception of spatial frequency. Low-pass noise decreased perceived frequency, while high-pass increased.
Researchers have discovered that in Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of worm, piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play a crucial role in defending the genome against foreign genetic elements. These piRNAs are derived from a long, polycistronic RNA, but in Caenorhabdis elegans, each piRNA is a tiny, autonomous transcriptional unit. A 21-nucleotide piRNA sequence and a 50-nucleotide upstream motif with limited genomic context are required for expression. The upstream motif is necessary for gerine-enriched, Pi-dependent piRNA expression, and a single nucleotide within the motif determines gerine enrichment. Over 70% of Caenoridis piRNAs are selectively expressed in male or female gerine, suggesting these populations have evolved independently. The study reveals that Caenoridis piRNA upstream motifs act as promoters, specifying which sequences are expressed as piRNAs, how abundantly they are expressed, and in gerine. The genome encodes over 15,000 unique pi sequences, rivaling the number of mRNA genes in the Caenor genome.
Brucella species replicate within host cells in the form of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vacuoles, and the mechanisms by which the bacteria are sequestered into such vacoles and obtain a continuous membrane supply for replication remain to be elucidated. Research has shown that during Bruc infection, the IRE pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in a time-dependent manner, and COI vesicle components Sar, Sec23, and Sec24 are upregulated. A marked accretion of ER-derived vacoles is observed around replicating bacteria using microscopy and electron microscopy. A novel host factor, Y1, is identified for activation of the IRE pathway in response to tunic treatment and infection with B. abort. Y is responsible for phosphorylation of I through high assembly of Ire molecules at exit (E) under UP conditions. In Y-knock cells, B abort fails to generate ER-derived vacoles and remains in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Activation of theRE and formation of-derived vacoles are critical for B to establish a safe replication niche, and Y is indispensable for these processes. Autophagy proteins Atg and WI, but not D, are required for biogenesis of ER-derived compartments.
Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBS) and carnation Italian ring spot virus (CV) recruit the cellular Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) into the viral replication compartment. The function of V34 is crucial for TBS replication, suggesting that PI(3) phosphoinoside is utilized by TBS for building the replication compartment. The expression of V34 and abundance of PI(3 is increased in the presence of tombviral proteins, leading to efficient tombvirus replication. Overexpression of PI3 phosphatase in yeast or plants inhibits TBS replication on peroxomal membranes and CV on mitochondrial membranes. Purified PI phosphatase reduces TBS assembly in a cell-free system. Detection of PI with antibody or probe reveals enrichment of PI in replication. V34 is recruited into replication through interaction with p33 protein. Gene analysis in yeast unravels TBS requires vesicle transport of V34. Absence of V34 TBS cannot recruit Rab-positive endosomes, providing membranes for biogenesis of TV compartment. V34 and PI are needed for stability of p33 protein, degraded by 26 proteasome when PI abundance is decreased by V34 inhibitor.
Researchers conducted a study in Iqu, Peru to assess the feasibility of feeding Aedes aegypt mosquitoes on deng virus-infected human volunteers for vector competence studies. The study aimed to compare artificial and natural blood-feeding methods of DENV infection and dissemination in mosquitoes for a field-based epidemiological study. Between 2011 and 2015, participants aged 5 years or older with 5 days of fever were enrolled from clinic and neighborhood studies on deng in Iitos. Wild, laboratory-reared Aedes aegypt were fed on febrile individuals or blood collected from participants with or treated with EDTA. Mosquitoes were tested after 14 days of extrinsic incubation for DENV infection and dissemination. A total 58 participants with vireas from 1.3 × 102 to 2.9 × 106 focus-forming units per mL of serum participated in one or more feeding methods. DENV infection and dissemination rates were not significantly different between direct and indirect-ED feeding, but were lower for mosquitoes fed on blood with no additive. Relative direct feeding showed greater variation following indirect-ED than indirect-no feeding. Dissemination rates were similar across all methods. No differences were detected in D infection or dissemination in mosquitoes fed on participants with different deng severity. The study demonstrates direct and indirect feeding for field-based studies vector competence. Direct feeding is preferable in terms of ease, biosecurity, and reliability.
Researchers investigated why some cancer patients respond differently to chemotherapy drugs that target topoisomerase II, an enzyme essential for cell division. They used Caenorhabditis elegans, a model organism, and found that strains vary in sensitivity to these drugs. An unbiased genetic approach revealed a single amino acid substitution, methionine to glutamine, in topoisomerase II (TOP-2), explains this variation. The non-polar methine residue increases hydrophobic interactions with etoposide, a topoisomerase poison, compared to polar glutamine. This stabilizes the interaction, leading to increased genomic instability in strains with methine residue. The affected residue is conserved from yeast to humans and differs between human topoisomerase isoforms, methine hTOIα and glutamine hIβ. This difference affects cytotoxicity of topois II poisons in human cell lines, explaining why hIα and hβ are differentially affected by poisons. The study demonstrates the utility of C elegans in understanding drug responses.
Researchers studied the genetics of lifespan in long-lived rodents, specifically the African mole rat, to gain insights into mechanisms determining mammalian lifespan. They analyzed genomic and transcriptomic data from 17 rodent species and identified 250 genes associated with enhanced longevity, known as positively selected genes (PSGs). These genes showed an expression pattern in long-lived mole rats and short-lived rats that fits the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging, where genes have opposite effects at different stages of life. The PS genes were enriched in cellular respiration, ion homeostasis, and processes regulated by the mTOR pathway: translation, autophagy, and inflammation. Key genes included RHE, regulator of mTOR and IGF, central to aging pathways, and new candidates like RBL, AM2, PSM1, and GER. Protein modeling suggested functional consequences of amino acid changes under selection. The study provides a resource to link genes and amino acids to aging and lifespan determination. A systematic scan of PSG on African rat family branches examined more branches than previous studies, providing high resolution of positive selection. Consistent with antagonistic patterns, lower expression of related genes and pharmacological inhibition was associated with longer lifespan in worms, killifish, and mice. mTOR regulates inflammatory and immune responses. Results indicate PSG changes during aging consistent with antagonistic theory. Gene ontology analysis showed significant downregulation in long-lived and upregulation in short-lived, fitting antagonistic theory. PSG cover processes regulated by mTOR: translation, autagy, cellular respiration.
Researchers have developed a new strategy to control the spread of diseases transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito by exploiting the endosymbiont Wolbachia to produce sterile males and females with reduced vector competence. Aedes aegypt transfection (ARP) was generated by introducing Wolbach in the ARP line, which had previously been established by replacing AlA and AlB Wolbach with the P strain. Various infection and fitness parameters were studied by comparing ARP, ARP, and wild-type Aegypt sharing the same genetic background. The competence of ARP to Chikunya, Dengue, and Zika viruses was evaluated in comparison with ARP. ARP showed 100% maternal inheritance of Mel and P Wolbach. Survival, fecundity, and fertility did not differ between the Aegpt lines. Crosses between ARP males and wild-type females were infertile regardless of male age, while egg hatch in reverse increased from 0 to 17 with wild males aging 3 to 17. When competing with wild males for females, ARP males induced sterility significantly higher than expected. The Wolbach density in ARP females was 15 fold higher in ARP, mostly due to Mel infection. This corresponded to reduced competence for Chikunya and Deng viruses (5 and 0 rates at 14 and 21 post-infection with ARP females. Results regarding Zika did not highlight differences ARP and ARP, however, none tested ARP females capable transmitting ZV. These findings promote the exploitation of Wolbach to suppress wild-type Aeg populations.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify peptide-mediated interactions between proteins using high-resolution 3D structures. These interactions occur when a globular protein domain recognizes a linear peptide from another protein, creating a small contact interface. Peptides are often found in unstructured regions of proteins and have a consensus motif complementary to their binding partner's surface. Unlike current methods, this approach focuses on how peptides adopt a defined structure when binding to their partner. Analysis of known peptide interactions showed that their structure can be characteristic of the consensus motif, even if they don't match established patterns. Peptides tend to be stretched and elongated, unlike other peptides of the same length. A Support Vector Machine was used with structure information to scan 50,000 3D protein complexes and identify unnoticed interactions. Derived patterns were compared to established motifs and domains, and cross-validated in four organisms' interactomes. 64 new domain-peptide interactions were found, 6,000 total, suggesting molecular details of binding.
Researchers studied 49 adults with environmental enteropathy (EE) in Lus, Zambia to understand how the condition affects the small intestine's ability to absorb nutrients and respond to vaccines. They used confocal endoscopy, histology, immunohistochemistry, and mRNA sequencing of intestinal biops, and correlated with plasma lipopolysacide (LPS) and zinc uptake. The study found widespread damage to the small intestine's epithelial lining, with defects at the villi tips, which corresponded with leakage in vivo. Multivariate analysis showed circulating LPS correlated with cell shedding and serum glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) uptake. Zinc uptake was reduced in 64% of individuals and correlated with GL-2. Transcript analysis identified 23 differentially expressed genes in EE, including protective peptides and proteins. Confocal endcopy, claudin immunostaining, and histology identified epithelial defects as sites of bacterial translocation, with increased epithelial surface area increasing translocation burden. GL-2 and other peptides may play a role in mucosal protection in EE.
Researchers have studied a phenomenon called superinfection exclusion (SIE), where some viruses block the re-infection of host cells by the same or similar viruses. They found that in turnip crinkle virus (TCV) uses a protein p28 to achieve this. p28 is one of two proteins encoded by the virus and is responsible for SIE. When p28 is expressed, it blocks the replication of a different TCV replicon. Transiently expressed p28, delivered with or ahead of TCV replicon, also recapitulates this repressive activity. Interestingly, p28-mediated SIE is enhanced by C-terminally fused proteins but weakened by N-terminal modifications and inversely correlates with p's ability to complement a p-defective TCV replic. p28 in S-positive cells form large, mobile inclusions that aggregate non-coalesce with S-defective yet replication-competent p mutant. This suggests p28 forms multimer complexes that intercept fresh p monomers from superfect genomes, abolishing superfect replication. This mechanism could be applicable to other RNA viruses and offer targets for antiviral therapy.
Researchers have developed a vaccine against Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that causes Chagas disease, using a plasmid DNA encoding Trypanosoma cruzi transialase (TS) with or recombinant TS protein (rTS) and Cp adjuvant. The vaccine induced strong immune responses and protection against lethal challenge in mice. However, long-term protection was not reported. To improve long-term protection, the researchers added plasm encoding IL-15 (IL-15) to the vaccine. Immunized BALB mice with TS with or without IL-15 and studied immune responses and protection against lethal challenge at 1-6 months post-vaccination. Mice with TS alone developed TS-specific IF-γ responses and survived lethal challenge within 3 months. Adding IL-15 did not alter responses or protection during this period. However, mice with TS and IL-15 challenged 6 months post-vacc were more protected than TS alone (p<0.05). Protection correlated with higher TS-specific IF-γ producing CD8+ T cells. These cells expanded better in vitro-stimulation. IL-15 improved long-term cell survival, expansion, and protection against T. cruzi.
Researchers have identified a protein called WDR1 that plays a crucial role in controlling the levels of a protein called TbK in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. TbK is essential for the segregation of the basal body, attachment of the flagellum, and cytokinesis. WDR is a WD-repeat protein that interacts with the Cull4 ubiquitin ligase complex and the DNA-binding protein TbDB1. It binds to the PEST motif in TbK and the N-terminal WD motif to TbDB. Depletion of W1 inhibits the duplication of the basal body and flagum, disrupts the assembly of the new flagum attachment zone, and detaches the new flagum. Consistent with its role in TbK degradation, depletion of W1 causes accumulation of Tb in the basal and bil, leading to phosphorylation of Cent2 in the bil at late cell stages. This identifies WDR as a receptor for TbK in the Cull-D1 ubiquitin ligase complex, degrading Tb in the basal and bil after the G/S cell transition, promoting duplication, basal separation, and flagum adhesion.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the RNA helicase DDX3 in the innate immune system, which is the body's first line of defense against infections. They found that mice lacking DDX3 in their immune cells were unable to fight off the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes and had altered immune cell populations in their bone marrow and spleen. This was due to decreased availability of immune cells and impaired cytokine production. The study suggests DDX3 is essential for innate immunity and may contribute to differences in resistance to microbes and disease between males and females. DDX helicases, like RIG-like receptors, are known to play a role in immunity, and DDX3 is the first non-RL helicase to be shown to do so. DDX3 regulates gene expression in macrophages, cells that fight infections, and its loss impacts the immune system through its role in hematopoiesis and regulation of response to Lister infections. RNA analysis showed D3 altered the expression of genes contributing to antimicrobial response in macroages, depending on the sex of the cells. DDX3 was previously found to regulate IFN transcription in infected cells with viruses and Lister monocogen.
A computational model of the insect pherone transduction cascade in male moth olfactory neurons is presented. The model accounts for pre-effector processes, including pherone molecule translocation from air to sensillum, deactivation, and interaction with receptors, and G-protein effector activation, and focuses on post-eff processes. These involve production and degradation of second messengers IP3 and DAG, opening and closing of ionic channels IP3-gated Ca2+, DAG-gated cation, Ca2-g Cl, and Ca2-voltage K, and Ca2 extrusion. The network is regulated by modulators protein C and Ca2-calmodulin, exerting inhibition on effector channels. The model simulates evolution of chemical species and currents and membrane response to single pherone stimulation of various intensities. Parameters were fitted to experimentally measured receptor potentials at pherone doses. The model captures main features of dose-response curves, wide range, rising, and falling times, and reproduces second messenger kinetics. It suggests two types of depolarizing channels play different roles at low and high pherone concentrations, DAGated cation at low, Ca-g Cl at middle and high. Predictions are proposed and future developments discussed.
Researchers studied how the tumor suppressor protein p53 responds to cellular stress by binding to specific DNA sequences and activating genes in human cells. They mapped p53 binding and histone H3 modifications in untreated and doxorubicin-treated human lymphoid cells to understand how chromatin context and sequence affect p53 binding and gene activation. The study found that p-regulated genes were associated with steady chromatin status, with most being suppressed and marked by repressive histone modifications or CTC binding. p53 sequences in open chromatin were weaker, while those in enhancers and repressed chrom were stronger. p occupancy was correlated with sequence similarity to p53 consensus, but inversely with existing nucleosome accessibility and conservation. p binding to transposable element repeats was higher and correlated with stronger sequences, but not associated with gene activation. Occupied p in L-like repeats were unique, displaying negative phylo scores and altered H3me and DHS. The study highlights the interaction between chromatin and p53 context in the response, suggesting evolutionary processes may have led to repression or utilization of pRE from transposons.
Researchers have explored a specific motif in bacterial two-component signaling systems, where a single histidine kinase (HK) can reversibly phosphorylate two response regulator (RR) proteins. They found that this motif allows for rapid signal termination, where one RR acts as a "sink" for the other, and implements a sigmoidal signal relationship. This means that the system exhibits a threshold response, where the output remains low until a certain level of signal is reached. Two conditions on system parameters are necessary for this relationship, and key parameters control the threshold and sensitivity of the curve. The findings were confirmed by reconstituting the HK-RR motif in Sinorhizob meli chemotaxis and measuring the signal curve. The level of sigmoidality can be controlled by the presence of the RR and an auxiliary protein that binds to HK, yielding Hill coefficients above 7. This motif allows bacteria to implement tunable switch-like processing and provides a basis for developing threshold devices in synthetic biology.
Researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to study how yeast cells respond to stress and found that individual cells within a population show significant variation in tolerance to stress. They found that this variation is due to differences in how cells regulate their genes, both before and after stress is applied. A subset of cells decouples the expression of ribosomal genes from the stress response, which is related to the cell cycle but not the metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing fluorescent regulators showed coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Transcript analysis suggests cells maintain a filter against decoupled bursts of transcription but mount a coordinated response upon stress, even in unstressed cells. This study provides new insights into heterogeneity in yeast stress response, but many questions remain unanswered. The researchers addressed these through single-cell RNA sequencing and profiling of transcription factor dynamics before and after stress. Results show variable activation of the Environmental Stress Response (ES) and condition-specific regulators after stress, and heterogeneity in ES activation in unstressed cells due to coordinated and discordant induction of ES regulators. Cell-to-cell variation in M2 activation could explain heterogeneity in stress tolerance, but it's unclear if this correlates with broader transcript changes or cell cycle phase.
Researchers have found that the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African trypanosomiasis, accumulates in the male reproductive organs of mice, specifically in the epididymis, epididymal adipose tissue, and fibrous tunics of the testis, but not in the lumen of epididymal duct or seminiferous tubules of the test. This suggests that the majority of parasites are not in immune-privileged sites. Instead, they are associated with inflammatory cell infiltration, degeneration, and tissue rupture of epididym ducts, which may lead to reduced fertility. The study used fine aspiration cytology and histological analysis to detect parasites in the male reproductive system and found a strong immune response to T. bruce in the male organs, similar to the bloodstream and other tissues. The epididym and test are surrounded by adipose tissue, epididym adipose, a major reservoir of T. bruce parasites. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed trypanosomes in different stages post-infection in test, epidid, epidym, and epidid adip tissue. Parasites also infiltrate fibrous tun that encloses test, but not test per se inside semifer tubules or stroma. The majority of parasites are in epidid stroma and epidid adip tissue, not protected by tissue barriers. T. bruce infection is associated with moderate to marked inflammation in male reproductive organs, in tissues infiltrated by parasites and test, where no parasites detected. Inflammation disrupts blood-test and blood-epid barriers at infection stages. Parasites accumulate in male organs at least 6 post-infection, epidid adip tissue and epidid stroma most parasitized, epid showing increase density 105 parasites mg organ late disease.
Researchers studied how fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) respond to their environment through their sense of smell and taste, which is crucial for survival. They looked at how genes that code for smell and taste receptors in the fly's genome are turned on and off at different stages of development, between males and females, and in different social situations. They found that groups of these genes are regulated independently and some are sensitive to the fly's reproductive state and social interactions. When flies are exposed to the opposite sex's scent, it changes which genes are turned on, but this is different from when they are in contact with the same or opposite sex. The team analyzed how these genes work together and found they group into small, biologically relevant modules. This organization allows the fly to fine-tune its sense of smell and taste in response to relevant environmental and physiological conditions. The study shows how the fly's sense of smell and taste is highly adaptable and can change in response to different situations.
Studies of human trisomies have shown a link between abnormal meiotic recombination and nondisjunction at meiosis I or II. Specifically, failure to recombine or recombination events near or far from the centromeres are associated with human trisomies. Researchers used immunofluorescence to examine meiotic recombination in human females and studied crossover proteins (e.g., ML1) in fetal oocytes to analyze nondjunction-prone chromosomes and genome-wide recombination. Results indicate ML1 foci are lower than predicted, but pattern conforms to crossover protein localization. Observations of individual chromosomes show "vulnerable" crossover in fetal oocytes, consistent with nondjunction events in adult oocytes.

Meiotic errors cause many chromosome abnormalities in humans, mostly in first meiotic oocyte division. Studies over 10-20 years linked disturbances in recombination to human tris of maternal origin. Researchers evaluated ML1 as crossover marker in females and achmate and suboptimal crossover patterns in human meiosis. This report results on 103 prophase oocytes from 31 fetal samples. Direct analyses crossover in fetal oocytes reveal "ulnerable" configurations consistent with tris conceptions (e.g., chromosome 16 distal exchanges, 21 proximal and dist exchanges, achmate). If true, recombination patterns in tris reflected by ML foci in pacheneocytes. Not all clear, e.g., no "spikes" in dist or proximal ML1 on 21, despite prox and dist exchanges with tris 21.

The study analyzed 103 prophase I oocytes from 31 fetal samples and found that the number of ML1 foci was lower than expected, but the pattern of localization was consistent with a crossover protein. Observations of individual chromosomes showed "vulnerable" crossover configurations in fetal oocytes, consistent with nondisjunction in adult oocytes.
Exposure to saliva from blood-feeding arthropods like mosquitoes, flies, and ticks can have a significant impact on the progression of diseases they transmit, such as Leishmaniasis, Plasmod, and arviral infections. When an arthropod bites a mammal, it injects saliva containing immunogenic compounds that facilitate feeding. Research suggests that the immune response elicited by pre-exposure to arthrop saliva can alter disease progression if the host becomes infected. Pre-sensisation of the host has been reported to both exacerbate and limit symptoms, depending on the system in question, with implications for recovery. To explore how preensisation affects vector control, a model of vector-borne disease was developed. Results show that abundance of preensised hosts increases when control efforts moderately increase vector mortality. If preensisation leads to rapid clearance of infection, increasing mortality may achieve greater control. However, if preens prolongs duration, e.g. through symptomatic cases unlikely to be treated, control can increase total infected. Infections may go unnoticed unless active surveillance detects subclinical individuals, providing reservoirs for transmission and long-term health consequences. Sensitivity analysis suggests negative consequences mitigated through integrated management. Immunological and clinical consequences of pre-exposure are largely uncharted for other vector-parite-host combinations. A range of epidemiological outcomes, positive and negative for health, underscore need to quantify preensisation modulates recovery and transmission in vectororne diseases.
Researchers studied how the immune system of mice affects the Leishmania parasite, which causes a disease that affects 12 million people worldwide. They compared the proteins of Leish parasites from two types of mice: BAL/c and BAL nude mice. BAL mice have a weakened immune system, similar to people with diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, a severe form of the disease. The study found 44 proteins that changed in the parasites due to the immune response. Some are related to oxidative stress and proteases, and known virulence factors like oligopeptase and tryparedin peroxidase. These proteins were more abundant in parasites from nude mice, suggesting the immune system modifies them in BAL mice. On the other hand, an HSP70 protein was more abundant in parasites from BAL mice. This study may help identify virulence factors and how they are regulated.
Activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID) plays a crucial role in immunoglobulin gene diversification by deaminating cytosines in DNA, leading to somatic hypermutation, class recombination, and gene conversion. However, A is highly mutagenic and causes genomic instability, contributing to chromosomal translocations in B cell malignancies. Research shows that A is cell cycle-regulated, with degradation occurring more slowly in G1 phase than S or G2/M phase. Mutations affecting phosphorylation or catalytic activity alter A stability and abundance. Enforcing A localization in G1 phase accelerates somatic hypermutation and class recombination, while compromising viability in S2/M phase. Derivatives that accelerate somatic mutation with minimal impact on viability are potential tools for gene engineering and mutagenesis. Cell cycle regulation of A stability determines the cellular response to A-initiated DNA damage. A degradation is limited by proteasomal and CRM-dependent export, and catalytic activity can be improved by site mutations, but also stimulate translocation and compromise viability. Low A levels in G2 may lead to elevated levels in G1, as seen in A-merryCD1 transductants. A Ser is a site of regulation, phosphorylation downregulating SH and CSR.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how microbes break down plant biomass, a crucial for environmental, nutritional, and industrial processes. They applied this method to the bacterium Clostridium phyfermentans, which ferments various plant components including glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabin. The bacter breaks down these polysaccharides with different efficiencies, prioritizing certain substrates. RNA sequencing revealed how the bacter responds to polysacides by upregulating specific enzymes and transporters to metabolize sugars. Fifty-six upregulated enzymes were purified, showing polysacides are degraded by multiple enzymes, often from the same family but with different specificities and localizations. These enzymes were tested in combination to identify synergies between acting on the same substrate with different catalytic mechanisms. This study advances understanding of how microbes degrade and metabolize plant biomass.
In Sierra Leone conducted three rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) to control lymphatic filariasis (LF) in 12 districts previously treated for onchocercias from 2008-2010. The program had good geographic and drug coverage. A mid-term assessment in 2011 showed the impact of MDAs on LF in these districts. Microfilaria (mf) prevalence fell from 2.6% to 0.3%, a decrease of 88.5%. Four districts had a 0% prevalence: Bo, Moyamba, Kenema, and Kono. Seven districts had reductions between 70-95%: Bombali, Bonthe, Kail, Kambia, Koin, Kadugu, Portoko, and Tonkol. Pehun had 0% baseline prevalence, maintained. Bomb had 1.58% prevalence, the district with highest baseline 6.9%. Mean mf density after MD was 17.59/ml, a 65% decrease from 50.9/ml and 0.05/ml for the entire population, a 96% decrease from 1.32/ml. Results showed mf <1% in all but one district after MD. Density reduced 65% among positive individuals and 95% for the population.
Researchers have used high-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, to study microbial communities in various environments, including the ocean and human gut. However, analyzing this data is challenging due to its compositional nature, where data is presented as relative fractions or species rather than absolute abundances. This can lead to unreliable results, as shown through simulations and real data from the Human Microbiome Project, where many correlations among taxa are artificial and true correlations may have opposite signs. Community diversity is a key factor that modulates the severity of compositional effects. A new approach, SparCC, is developed to estimate correlations from compositional data. It was applied to infer a network of interacting species across 18 human body sites, showing standard methods yield 3 spurious species interactions and miss 60% of true interactions in human microbiome data, with most errors in low-diversity samples.
Researchers studied how the enzyme lysozyme, found on mucosal surfaces, affects the colonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a type of bacteria that can cause pneumonia. They found that lyzyme's ability to break down peptoglycan, a component of the bacteria's cell wall, is key to its antimicrobial effect. Two enzymes, Pgd and Ad, modify the peptogcan to make it resistant to lyzym. The study showed that both modifications are necessary for full resistance to lyzym in vitro. Experiments with mice showed that wild-type pneumocci outcompeted a mutant lacking Pgd and Ad in mice with lyzym, but not in mice without ly. This suggests that resistance to lyzym's peogly-degrading activity is important for colonization. However, strains with single mutations in P or Ad outcompeted wild-type in both mice with and without ly. This indicates that peog modifications reduce fitness, but resistance to lyzym outweighs this disadvantage. The study highlights the complex effects of peog modifications on bacterial growth and survival in different environments.
Researchers investigated the use of NS1 antigen capture tests as an alternative method for detecting deng virus in tissue specimens from confirmed fatal deng cases in Brazil. A total of 74 tissue samples from 23 cases were analyzed, including liver, lung, kidney, brain, heart, skin, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes. Three tests were evaluated: Dengue Early ELISA, Platelia NS, and NS Ag Strip. The overall deng diagnosis based on these tests was 34.7%, 60.8%, and 91.3% respectively. Dengue EL detected NS in 22.9% of specimens and Plat NS in 45.9%. The highest sensitivity, 78.3%, was achieved by NS Strip. The Strip was most sensitive in liver, lung, kidney, brain, spleen, and thym compared to other EL assays. This study shows NS capture as a valuable approach for postmortem deng confirmation.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of 718 multiple myeloma (MM) samples from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation's Compass Interim Analysis 9 study to investigate differences in molecular alterations between African American (AA) and Caucasian (CA) cases. They used somatic whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing to identify mutations and correlated them with self-reported race and ancestry. The study found significant differences in mutation frequencies between the two groups, with B7, BR3, and AUT2 showing higher frequencies in AA cases, which are involved in B-cell malignancies. TP53 and IRF4 mutations were more common in CA cases. This study is one of the most comprehensive genomic analyses of MM in patients of African descent, highlighting potential ancestry-related differences in myelogenesis. Three genes involved in B malignancy translocations are new candidates that may have been overlooked due to lack of AA cases in previous studies. Understanding oncogenic processes in multi-ethnic cohorts is needed to address disparities in incidence and outcomes among AA patients. Previous studies have provided a view of MM's somatic landscape, but AA representation has been limited. The F46 mutation frequency in MM ranges 5-11%, but was 8.3% in CA and 12.6% in AA in this study, suggesting a potential role in MM biology among African tumors.
Researchers have found that most mutations in cancer cells are "passengers", which do not affect the cell's reproductive rate. Passengers can provide information about the cancer's evolutionary history and serve as a molecular clock. They can also be targets for immunotherapy or treatment resistance. The study analyzed the expansion of cancer cell populations, describing primary tumors and metastatic lesions. They looked at the process forward in time, calculating the probabilities and frequencies of passenger mutations by time of appearance. They computed the likelihood of evolutionary trees, informing phylogenetic reconstruction of cancer in patients. Next, they looked backward in time, estimating the number of cancer cells present when a subclonal mutation arose. They derived formulas for the expected number of subcl mutations of any frequency. Fitting the formula to sequencing data estimated the birth and death rates of cancer cells during early stages.

The ratio of birth and death rates determines the cancer's phylogenetic tree shape, which is star-shaped for fast growth and linear for slow. If a mutation has a certain frequency in cancer cells, they asked how many were present when it arose. The answer varies with the death-birth ratio, which changes from 0 to 0.99. Frequencies of first and most abundant passengers are influenced by mutation and death-birth ratio. If close to 1, several clonal passengers may not be present but collected during expansion. If 0.99, there are about 150 passengers in more than 1% cells. The formula can be fitted to data to determine the branching model and extract parameters. They fit it to a colorectal cancer dataset, showing neutral evolution during clonal expansion. Passengers can be used to infer the process. For close to 1, the number of subcl above 50 is equal to collected during progression. Subtracting subcl above 50 from all cl will estimate the number in the first cell.
Researchers have studied the misfolding of the huntingtin protein's exon 1 (X1), which is linked to Huntington's disease, to understand how it forms amyloid aggregates. They found that the number of glutamines (Q) in the poly region of X1 determines how easily it misolds into a β-rich state, which is associated with disease. The flanking sequences surrounding the poly region play a crucial role in determining the misolding and aggregation of X1. The study used molecular simulations on monomeric X1 with full flanking regions, missing polyproline regions, and isolated Q peptides of different lengths (23, 36, 40, and 47). They found a positive correlation between Q length and probability to form a β-rich state. The flanking regions of X1 affect its probability to form a β state compared to isolated Q. Polyline regions form polytype II helices decrease the probability of Q to form β state. Lengthening Q, the first 17 residues are more likely to adopt β-sheet rather than α-helix conformation. This study provides insight into X1 misolding and the role of flanking sequences in aggregation.
Researchers have studied the CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindrom Repeats) system, a defense mechanism used by bacteria and archaea to protect against foreign DNA, such as phages and conjugative plasmids. They analyzed hundreds of metagenomic datasets from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) to explore the distribution and diversity of CRPRs in human microbial communities and discover new ones. A targeted assembly strategy was developed to reconstruct CRPR arrays that whole-genome assemblies failed to identify. For each known CRPR type, its repeat sequence was used to recruit reads from HMP datasets and assemble into CRPR loci, with unique sequences extracted for analysis. Novel CRs or CR variants were identified in whole-genome assemblies and targeted to comprehensively identify CRs across samples. The distribution of CRs, including 64 known and 86 novel ones, was largely site-specific. Several CR loci, including novel CRs, were analyzed. Streptocococcal CRPRs were found in oral microbiomes, with ~8,000 unique spacers in samples from the same individual and site sharing most spacers, while different sites from the same individual shared fewer and individuals almost none, indicating niche impact on CRPR evolution. CRs were used to trace rare species and virus exposure in individuals, highlighting the importance of identifying CR loci for microbiome ecology study.
Researchers studied the nematode Caenorhabdis elegans to understand its circadian rhythms, which are internal biological clocks that synchronize with environmental signals like light and temperature. Previous studies showed behavioral rhythms in C. elegans, but not at the transcriptional level. This study used genome-wide profiling to identify light and temperature-entrained transcripts in C. elegans, which exhibited rhythmic expression with 24-hour periods and sustained under constant conditions, indicating circadian regulation. Light and temperature drove gene expression and entrained largely non-overlapping sets. Mutations in a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel required for sensory transduction abolished light and temperature-entrained gene expression, suggesting environmental cues act non-autonomously entrain circadian rhythms. This demonstrates circadian-transcriptional rhythms in C. elegans and suggests further analysis will provide new information on the evolution and function of this biological clock.
Researchers studied the effects of mutations in the RAD3 gene in yeast, which is a homolog of the human XPD gene involved in DNA repair and transcription. Mutations in RAD3 (rad-101 and rad-102) led to a hyper-recombination (hyper-Rec) phenotype, characterized by persistent single-stranded DNA gaps converted to double-strand breaks (DSBs) by replication. They used a system to detect reciprocal mitotic recombination products and found rad-101 and rad-102 increased crossover frequency by 100-fold. Mapping showed three-quarters of crossovers were double-chromid breaks (DSCBs) and one-quarter single-chromid breaks (SCBs, similar to spontaneous recombination in wild-type cells. They mapped 216 genomic alterations, including crossovers, conversions, deletions, and duplications, and found associations with gamma-H2 and hotspots at IMA and H11 near the end of chromosome XV. Data suggests a subset of spontaneous recombination in wild-type cells may be initiated by incomplete repair and DSBs that cannot be repaired by sister-chromid recombination.
Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen, has a set of simple sequence repeats (SSR) that generate heterogeneous populations through slipped strand mispairing, allowing adaptation to the changing host environment. Researchers found that an intergenic tract, via slipped mispair, operates like a rheostat to fine-tune expression of the sialic acid adhesin, SabA promoter. In an isogenic strain, varying the tract length of the tract generates multiple outputs from the Sab promoter, altering H. pylori binding to sial-Lewis receptors on gastric mucosa. Analysis of post-infection clones shows the tract length is highly variable in H. pylori, mirroring the host-pathogen interplay where the bacterium generates clones with best-fit phenotypes selected in the host. In silico and in vitro analyzes revealed the tract length affects DNA structure and RNA polymerase binding, shifting the alignment between promoter and UP elements. Additional H. pyl genes with tract similar to Sab show variations modulate promoter output. This mechanism, mediated by promoter-prox SSR, provides an alternative regulation in bacteria with limited transacting factors.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) must evade the immune system to establish persistent infections and amplify its genome upon cell differentiation. The JAK/STAT pathway, which regulates the immune response, is targeted by HPV to downregulate STAT1, allowing for stable viral genome maintenance. However, STAT5, a member of this pathway, modulates inflammation and cell cycle progression in response to cytokines and growth factors. Research shows that HPV activates STAT5 phosphorylation without altering total levels. Inhibiting STAT5 with pimide abolishes genome amplification and late expression in differentiating keratinocytes, but has no effect on undifferentiated cells stably maintaining episomes. Knockdown studies reveal STAT5 isoform is responsible, mediated through ATM damage response, a downstream of STAT5, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) contributes to effects on ATM pathway. These findings identify a new mechanism where innate regulator STAT5 promotes viral replication through DNA damage response.
Researchers in Nepal identified 13 antigens from Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) that are expressed in the biliary tract of chronic carriers, but not in healthy individuals from a typhoid endemic area. These antigens include putative membrane proteins, lipoproteins, and hemolysin-related proteins. One antigen, YE (ST147), an uncharacterized with ATP-binding motif, gave prominent responses in screen. Responses to YE in patients with biliary S. Typhi were compared to those without S Typhi, patients with typhoid fever, and healthy controls. Seven of 10 (70%) chronic carriers, 0 of 8 (0%) bile-negative controls, 0 8 (0%) healthy, and 1 8 (12.5%) Bangladeshis with tyoid had detectable anti-YE IgG in blood. IgA responses were also present. Further evaluation of YE and other antigens could lead to improved diagnostic assays for asymptomatic S. Ty carriers. The study used in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVAT) to identify immunogenic antigens expressed in vivo, not in standard lab conditions, to understand host-pathogen interactions in biliary tract of chronic carriers. Currently, little is known about this interaction, and no reliable diagnostic for asymptomatic S Ty carriage exists. The identified antigens represent potential biomarkers for asymptomatic S Ty carriage and may lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.
Researchers have discovered a new epigenetic phenomenon called transactivation, where a non-functional copies of a gene can reactivate the expression of a functional copy of the same gene that is silenced by heterochromatin. This occurs when non-functional alleles of the white gene, which cannot produce a coding transcript, can still influence the expression of a wild-type copy of the same gene that is silenced by heterochatin. The presence of homologous RNA is necessary for this phenomenon, and mutations in genes involved in post-transcriptional silencing affect it. This new level of gene control is mediated by homolog RNA in the context of heterochromatic genes. 

In experiments, non-functional white alleles were found to transactivate the expression of a wild-type white gene silenced by heterochatin, leading to the discovery of this new epigen phenomenon. Data suggest that non-coding transcription can transactivate expression of a functional copy of the same gene silenced by heterochatin, revealing a new level of gene control in heterromatic genes. The mechanisms and features of transactivation differ from other epigenetic events such as paramutation, transduction, and transvection. In transactivation regions, non-coding RNAs can positively influence the transcription state of homolog locus silenced heterochatin.
Researchers have studied Boophil, a multifunctional protease inhibitor from the midgut of the tick Rhipphalus microplus, a vector of Babesiosis. Boophil targets thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein, enzymes involved in the coagulation and complement cascades. The study aimed to determine the kinetics of Boophil interaction with these enzymes, its effect on platelet function, and thrombosis in vivo. Boophil was expressed in HEK cells and purified to homogeneity. Amidolytic and surface plasmon resonance experiments showed Boophil behaves as a classical non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin with respect to chromogenic substrates, dependent on exosite and catalytic site. Inhibition blocked plate aggregation, fibrin formation, and clot throm in vitro. Boophil also inhibited FXa, preventing activation, and kikrein activity, indicating it targets the contact pathway. Additionally, it abated cathepsin and plmin-induced plate aggregation and affected elastase cleavage of Tissue Pathway Inhibitor TF. In vivo, Boophil inhibited carot artery occlusion triggered by Fe3 and promoted bleeding in mice tail transection. Boophil plays a role in maintaining midut hemostasis and inflammatory response, allowing ticks to digest blood for metabolism and egg development. It is the first midut FXa inhibitor also inhibiting thromosis.
Researchers have developed a computer model called the Spatially Explicit General-purpose Model of Enteric Tissue (SEMT) to study how inflammation affects the structure and function of the lining of the intestines. The lining of the intestines is a delicate system where its structure and function are closely linked, serving as both an absorptive surface and barrier. Inflammation plays a significant role in the development of many gastrointestinal diseases and is a key factor in maintaining the lining's architecture. To understand the role of inflammation in shaping the lining's structure, the researchers created SEMT to represent the behavior of intestinal cells under the influence of inflammation and generate various disease processes. SEMT reproduces healthy lining dynamics and simulated experiments where certain genes are knocked out or inhibited, providing insights into cellular and molecular mechanisms such as the role of PTEN/PI3 in inflammation and morphogenesis, enterocyte sloughing in ischemia-reperfusion, and chronic inflammation driving colonic metaplas. SEMT can serve as a platform for studying inflammation in gastrointestinal diseases.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of Wolbachia, a bacterium that reduces arbovirus transmission, in controlling Aedes aegypt populations. Traditional control methods like insecticide spraying have limited success. Wolia was deployed in Tubanga, Rio de Janeiro, but failed to spread due to high pyreoid resistance in local mosquitoes. A new strain, wRio, was created by crossing wBr females with field males to introduce pyre resistance. wRio increased mosquito survival but negatively affected fecundity, reducing egg size and hatch. Despite fitness costs, wRio established whereBr failed, highlighting the importance of matching local genetics, especially pyre resistance, for invasion. Household support was high, 90%, and temperature did not affect Wolia expression on Brazilian background. Wolia should match insecticide profile of wild population to succeed. Pyre resistance is widespread in Ae populations, future deployments must maintain resistance in lab colonies.
Researchers studied the role of the vaccinia B protein in the poxvirus, a type of virus that causes smallpox and cowpox. They found that the B protein plays a crucial role inactivating a cellular antiviral factor called BAF, which helps the virus to replicate. To understand how B works, they created a virus without the B gene and let it evolve over time to see how it adapts. They found that mutations in the B pseudokinase, a part of the B protein, made the virus more fit. This suggests that losing the pseudokinase can be beneficial for the virus. They also found that the pseudokin localizes to the nucleus, a rare for a poxiral protein, and reduces BAF phosphorylation when present, indicating it may enhance antiral activity of B. The study shows that a paralog kinase-pseudase pair, B and B, can have an epistatic relationship, where one enhances the other's function. This may help the virus conserve B during evolution and orchestrate nuclear events during infection. The researchers also found that losing the pseudokin suppresses the defect of B mutant viruses but not wild-type viruses. This suggests the pseudokin acts as a repressor of replication in a B-dependent manner. Future studies will investigate if this action extends to other poxviruses and pathogens.
Researchers studied the behavior of two synthetic peptides, LKKKLLKKLL (L) and EAAEAAEAAE (E), with built-in alpha-helix secondary structure, in water and at macroscopic interfaces. These peptides are too short to form stable structures on their own, so their conformation is influenced by environment. Simulations showed they don't form random coils or full alpha-helices, but adopt multiple conformations with short lifetimes. Conformation changes with environment, such as pH, salts, or presence of interfaces. At macroscopic interfaces, peptides adopt alphael conformation due to hydrophobic/hydrophobic partitioning. Their response to interfaces depends on surface charge and hydrophobicity.
Researchers studied the role of telomeric repeats (TMR) in the human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) genome, a virus that infects humans early in life and establishes latency in various cells. They found that HHV-6 integrates its genome into the telomeres of host chromosomes in latently infected cells, but the mechanism was unclear. Interestingly, HH-6 and other herpesviruses have TMR identical to human telomere sequences at the ends of their genomes. The HH-6 genome has two TMR, perfect (pMR) and imperfect (impMR). To determine if TMR are involved in integration, researchers deleted pMR and impMR in the HH-6 genome and reconstituted the virus. Replication was comparable to wild-type, indicating TMR are not essential for HH-6 replication. To assess integration, an in vitro system was established to evaluate efficiency and maintenance in latently infected cells. Integration of HH-6 was impaired without T and the genome was lost, suggesting integration is crucial for maintenance. Deleting pMR and impMR revealed pMR plays a major role in HH-6 integration, while impMR makes a minor contribution, establishing a model for HH-6 integration. Data shows TMR are dispensable for replication but crucial for integration and maintenance in latently infected cells.
Researchers have discovered the 2.6 Å crystal structure of the protein D13, a key component of the outer scaffold of vaccinia virus, a type of poxvirus. The structure reveals a double-barrel organization with two jellyroll domains and a head domain that assembles into trimers similar to double-bar capsid proteins of adenoviruses and icosahedral viruses. When attached to artificial membranes, D13 forms a honeycomb-like structure similar to the viral crescent and immature particles. This suggests that poxviruses use an ancestral lipid-remodeling strategy common to icosahedral viruses, infecting all kingdoms of life. The protein D13 is essential for viral assembly, as its neutralization by mutation or rifampin completely inhibits viral assembly. The structure of D13 will aid in the development of poxirus inhibitors.
Researchers studied the role of auxin and ethylene in root development in the plant Brachypodium distyon, a monocotyledon, and compared it to the dicotyled Arabidopsis thalian. They found that a mutant with reduced tryptophanminotransferase activity, which is essential for auxin biosynthesis, displayed elongated roots, contrary to Arabidopsis mutants with reduced tryophminotransferase activity which showed reduced root growth. Auxin levels were unexpectedly elevated in the Brachodium mutant, not due to alternative biosynthesis pathways, but increased expression of YCCA genes, which convert indole-3-pyruvic acid to auxin. Ethylene was found to inhibit the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis in Brachodium, making aux levels suboptimal for root elongation. The study suggests a delicate balance between auxin and ethylene to control cell elongation in Brach roots and an alternative wiring of aux-ethylene crosstalk compared to Arabidopsis.
Researchers studied how genes in yeast species evolve at different rates and found that the organization of their promoter regions, called nucleosomes, plays a key role in this process. Genes without a nucleosome-free region, called OP, vary widely between species, while those with a nucleosome region, DPN, remain similar. To see if early evolution affects this difference, they artificially selected for high expression of a protein and found that both OP and DPN genes increased expression similarly. However, they adapted in different ways: DPN duplicated large regions, while OP favored mutations. When selection stopped, DPN returned to normal levels, but OP did not. This suggests that nucleosome organization influences early evolution and directs its path. 

In yeast, gene expression divergence is linked to nucleosome organization, connecting evolution with regulation. Genes that diverged quickly lack a nucleosome near start site, OP, while DPN remained conserved. When selection stopped, DPN returned to normal, but OP did not. Results suggest nucleosome impacts early dynamics and long-term evolution. To test if OP and DPN differ in responding to selection, they selected high expression and examined genomic response. Expression increased, regardless of class. 

Forty-one proteins with mid-to-high levels were chosen, no preference for function or position. Distributed between DPN and OP, quantified by nucleosome occupancy. Alternatively, DPN and OP may be subject to similar forces, but satisfied by OP due flexible structure. This supports flexible organization directing evolution's path.
Human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) transactivator/oncoprotein Tax activates Iκ kinases (IKs) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κ) to promote cell proliferation and transformation. However, paradoxically, Tax expression in most cells leads to upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21IP/W1 and p27IP, causing p53/pR-independent cellular senescence. Research demonstrates that p21IP/W1/p27-mediated senescence constitutes a checkpoint against IK/NFκ hyperactivation. Senescence induced by Tax in HeLa cells is attenuated by mutations that reduce IK/NF activation and prevented by blocking NFκ using degradation-resistant mutant Iκα despite constitutive IK activation. Small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown indicates Rel induces senescence program acting upstream anaphase complex and Rel to stabilize p27IP and p21 mRNA. Downregulation NFκ by HT-1 antisense protein HB delays or prevents Tax-induced senescence. The balance between Tax and HB expression determines HT-1 infection outcome. Robust HT-1 replication and Tax expression drive IK/NF hyperactivation and senescence, while HB modulates Tax-mediated replication and NF activation, allowing HT-1-infected cells to proliferate and persist.
Researchers have proposed a new model to explain how the human brain's frontal lobe makes decisions in uncertain, changing, and open-ended situations. Current models of frontal function don't fully explain decision-making in these situations. The new model, called PROBE, shows that the frontal lobe monitors up to four behavioral strategies at a time and chooses the most reliable one to guide action. If a strategy is unreliable, a new one is formed from stored memories and tested, and if confirmed, used. The frontal lobe has a limited capacity for four strategies, which is compensated by a control system that promotes exploration and creation of new strategies in ambiguous situations. The model integrates reasoning, learning, and creativity in decision-making and behavior. 

The PRO model clarifies how the frontal lobe creates, stores, retrieves, and selects strategies for action. It regulates exploration and exploitation of rules and creativity for adaptive behavior. Results support a model of frontal function that integrates reasoning, learning, and creativity in executive control and decision-making. The frontal lobe manages an expanding repertoire of flexible strategies for action in uncertain, changing, and open environments. This involves managing task representations in long-term memory for action. According to reinforcement learning, the actor adjusts behavior to maximize utility. The model suggests how the frontal lobe creates and manages a collection of strategies and decides to create new ones rather than switching between learned ones, according to environmental cues. Little is known about how the executive continuously arbitrates between adjusting the current set, switching to learned, and creating new sets for action.
Researchers have developed a new approach called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations Parameter Trajectories (ADAPT) to study the long-term effects of pharmacological treatments and identify potential side effects. This method uses a time-dependent model to analyze the dynamics of molecular adaptations, predicting necessary changes in parameters to describe transitions between experimental data at different stages of treatment. AD provides insight into affected biological systems and identifies events to study for mechanistic understanding of treatment outcomes. It captures interactions with proteome and transcriptome levels, often less understood, by time-dependent parameter descriptions. AD was applied to pharmac activation of liver receptor LXR, a target for atherosclerosis treatment. Trajectories showed a counterintuitive function of scavenger receptor B1, facilitating hepatic cholesterol uptake. Activation promotes cholesterol efflux and excretion, but analysis showed reduced hepatic clearance upon prolonged treatment, confirmed by immunoblot measurements. AD can identify unwanted effects and design interventions to prevent them.
Researchers have proposed a new hypothesis on how the spinal and cerebellar neuronal circuitry works together to coordinate multi-segment limbs and bodies. They suggest that sensory and motor signals are combined in spinocerebell neurons to approximate spatial and temporal dependencies between limb segments, necessary for coordination. However, the number of granule cells limits the number of recombinations that can be represented in the cerebellum. Instead, the spinal circuit provides useful recombinations, described as linear projections through multi-dimensional sensorimotor input space. Granule cells, aided by Golgi cells, enhance these projections, allowing Purkinje cells to approximate non-linear functions. This hypothesis provides a new view on the cerebellum's function, supported by spinal system recombinations. 

The spinocbell system avoids superfluous recombinations by combining signals and commands in individual neurons, forming "good" recombinations with high probability. The spinal circuit makes sensorimotor functions available to cerebell via SCT systems, and granule receives this information. The spinocbell network structure prior to granule must be considered to lift dimensionality. A simplified example of a planar double arm joint illustrates coordination. Researchers seek a theoretical explanation for these observations in spinal and cerear circuitry, providing integration across dimensions for coordination. The cerebell is key for coordination, but little is known about its mechanisms.
Researchers used next-generation sequencing to study the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the Aedes aegypti mosquito during Chikungunya virus (CHV) infection. They identified 88 known and 79 miRNAs in uninfected and CHV infected mosquito cells, respectively, and nine novel miRNAs in the mosquito. The study found that CHV infection altered the expression of 77 miRNAs, specifically eight of which were upregulated. The researchers predicted the targets of these miRN and classified them into pathways. This study provides insight into the modification of miRN during CHV infection and identifies potential candidates for vector-based antiviral strategies. 

The researchers used next-generation sequencing to profile miRN in Aedes aegypt and analyzed their expression upon CHV infection. They identified 90 miRN in the mosquito, eight of which were common to uninf and infected cells and differentially regulated upon CHV. Through computational analysis, they predicted the targets of modulated mi and studied pathways in the mosquito. They analyzed the distribution and abundance of mi and evaluated their modulation upon CHV. Target and pathway analysis of mi were performed to shed light on the role of mi.
A study was conducted to estimate the economic burden of Cysticercosis (CE) in Iran, a parasitic disease affecting humans and livestock. Data from hospitals, literature, and government reports were used to determine the prevalence and incidence of CE in humans and animals. Economic data, including treatment costs, productivity losses, and livestock losses were obtained from national and international datasets. Monte Carlo methods were used to represent uncertainty. The estimated number of surgical cases per year 2000-2009 was 1,295, and asymptomatic individuals 635,232 (95% CI 149,466-1,120,998). The overall cost of CE in Iran was $232.3 million (95 CI $103.1-397.8), including direct and indirect costs. Human cost was $93.3 million (95 CI $6.1-222.7) and livestock $132 million (95 CI $61.8-246.5). The cost per case was $1,539. CE has a significant impact on Iran, costing 0.03% of the country's GDP. A surveillance system and control program are necessary to reduce the burden. A cost-benefit analysis of control programs is recommended, incorporating knowledge of losses due to CE in Iran. Productivity in asymptomatic, prevalence in sheep, and fecundity in cattle had the largest impact on overall cost. However, studies were not concerned with human and potentially biased livestock losses. Accurate assessment is crucial for decision-makers to prioritize resources for prevention.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive analysis of mouse polyomavirus (MPV) infection in mouse cells to understand the dynamics of viral and host gene expression. They used deep sequencing to follow MPV infection in NIH3T cells at various times and analyzed both viral and cellular transcriptomes. The study revealed a switch from early-to-late transcription with both strands being transcribed at all times. Novel insights emerged, including widespread RNA editing of viral transcripts late in infection. By late infection, 359 host genes were upregulated and 857 downregulated. Gene ontology analysis showed upregulated transcripts in translation, metabolism, RNA processing, DNA methylation, and protein turnover, while downregulated in extracellular adhesion, cytoskeleton, zinc binding, SH domain and GTP activation. Noncoding RNAs were also altered, with MAL1 downregulated and several upregulated. This study provides a global view of MPV infection and its effects on host growth and metabolism.
Hundreds of thousands of runners attempt to complete a marathon each year, but over two-fifths experience severe performance-limiting depletion of physi carbohydrate reserves, known as 'hitting the wall', and drop out before reaching the finish. Analyses of endurance have suggested glyc reserves are insufficient to fuel a marathon, making 'hitting the wall inevitable, or that maximal glycogen loading is required to complete without it. However, this study demonstrates that energetic constraints on runners are more subtle, depending on physi variables including muscle mass, liver glycogen, and running intensity, in personalized but quantifiable and predictable ways. The approach estimates the distance at which runners exhaust glyc stores as a function of intensity, providing a basis for ensuring safety and optimizing performance by setting paces and prescribing fuel requirements. The analysis sheds light on standards in running that have remained empirically defined, such as Boston Marathon qualifying times. Carbohydrate loading influences performance by permitting runners to run at greater speeds without 'hitting the wall, succumbing to exhaustion. Typical levels permit completion in four to five hours, as indicated by intersections with the 'Gc Loading Supercomp' region. The model incorporates running cost and dependence on exertion, revealing dependencies of distance to glyc depletion and pace.
Researchers studied how different strains of Toxoplas, a parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, interact with mouse immune cells called macrophages. They infected mouse macrophages with 29 different Tooplas strains from around the world and used a technique called RNA-sequencing to look at the genes expressed by both the parasite and the host. The study found large differences in gene expression between strains, including some that affect how the parasite interacts with the host. They also identified novel host pathways regulated by atypical Tooplas strains, such as the type I interferon response, which helps kill the parasite without the need for interferon gamma and is dependent on Toll-like receptors and a protein called RIG. 

The study found that non-canonical Tooplas strains have unique interactions with host cells, which may explain why some strains cause more severe disease in humans. They also showed that Tooplas strains differ in how they activate the inflammatory response, a key part of the immune system. The study provides a global view of how host and parasite respond to infection with both typical and atypical Tooplas, and identifies strain-specific host responses and parasite effectors. The results suggest Tooplas adapt to certain hosts, as different species show large differences in susceptibility and Tooplas differ in virulence in the same species.
Researchers have investigated the process of recombination in enteroviruses, a mechanism that allows viruses to acquire new genetic material and is thought to contribute to the emergence of new disease-causing variants. Despite its importance, the process is not well understood. They used a new approach to isolate chimeric poliovirus genomes with duplicated sequences at the recombination site and found that viruses with imprecise junctions had increased fitness. Mutations affecting polymerase or replication altered the yield of recombinants but not non-recombinant viruses, indicating the process is replicative and can be enhanced or reduced. The study proposes that recombinants result from a biphasic process: initial recombination followed by resolution of extraneous sequences and optimization of fitness. This has implications for understanding evolution in positive-strand RNA viruses.

A panel of poliovirus type 1/type 3 recombinants with 21% sequence divergence showed 70% contained additional sequences and 85% distinct junctions. In contrast, another study found sequence and structure correlated with recombination hotspots. Most recombinants contained sequences within the recombination region. Since previous recombin poliruses did not, imprecise recomants might be disadvantageous. Inhibiting polirus replication with guanidine hydrochloride yielded no recombinants. Cloned intra-type recombinants showed conservation at the junction, making recombination identification difficult. The study suggests recombination is biphasic, generating imprec followed by precise recombinants with enhanced fitness.
Researchers have identified a new route for the clearance of norepinephrine (NE) in white adipose tissue, which is mediated by the organic cation transporter 3 (Oct) in adipocytes. This route is distinct from previously known routes such as sympathetic neurons or macrophages. Oct is highly expressed in white adipose tissue and has the greatest uptake rate of NE compared to other routes. Adipocytes express high levels of degradation enzymes Mao, Maob, and Com, providing molecular basis for NE clearance by adipocytes with reuptake Oct. Administration of Oct ablation induces higher thermogenesis and lipolysis compared to littermate controls. After prolonged cold challenge, inguinal white adipose (W) in adip-specific Oct-deficient mice shows stronger browning and elevated thermogenic genes than litter controls, involving β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)/protein kinase (PK)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive binding (Cre) pathway. Glycolytic genes are reprogrammed higher to compensate for loss of ATP in adip-specific Oct knockout (KO) mice, indicating fundamental role of glucose metabolism beig. Inhibition β- largely abolishes higher lipoly and therm activities in Oct-deficient W, indicating NE overload in vicinity adipocytes Oct KO. Reduced alleles in OCT are associated with increased basal metabolic rate (BMR). Oct governs β-activity as NE transporter in whiteocytes, offering therapeutic applications for metabolic disorders.
HP1 proteins play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by interacting with chromatin. They have two domains: the chromo and chromadow. The chrom domain binds to histone H3 when it's methylated on lysine 9, but in vivo and vitro experiments show that HP proteins don't bind well to methylated chromatin. This led researchers to investigate if HP have other histone binding activities. They found the chromadow domain interacts with histone H in a region inside the nucleosome. This region is also contacted by the SWI/SNF complex's catalytic subunits. In vitro, SW/SNF needs this contact to remodel chromatin and is blocked by HP proteins. This antagonism is seen in vivo on interferon-regulated genes. SWNF helps load HP proteins onto chrom in vivo and vitro. The study suggests HP chromadow domains use nucleosome opening to bind chromatin and HP use this to stop chrom remodeling.
Researchers have identified a property called "self-containment" in RNA molecules, which refers to their tendency to maintain a specific secondary structure regardless of their surrounding sequence context. They developed a scoring method called the self-containment index to measure this property and found that microRNAs (miRNAs) exhibit high self-containment, consistent with their requirement for structural invariance during biogenesis. In contrast, most other structured RNAs do not show self-containment. Analysis revealed a trend towards higher self-containment among conserved miRNAs, suggesting it may be a characteristic of miRN acquiring new genomic contexts. miRNAs display enhanced self-containment compared to other functional RNAs, with a trend towards natural selection for self-cont in functional classes. The study suggests self-cont arises from selection for robustness against perturbations, invariance during biogenesis, and modular composition of function. Containment analysis is important for RNA annotation and design.
Researchers have identified four transcription factors (TFs) in Arabidopsis that play a crucial role in limiting the spread of necrotrophic fungal pathogens, such as Botrytis cinerea and Plectphaella cucina. Mutants defective in any of these TFs showed increased susceptibility to these pathogens, indicating their importance in disease resistance. Transcriptome analysis revealed a common signature of 77 up-regulated genes in these mutants, including several encoding secreted peptides named PROIR (provulence factors). Forward and reverse genetic analysis showed many PROIRs contribute to disease susceptibility to necrophic pathogens. The TFs and PROIRs identified are novel determinants of plant susceptibility to necrophic fungal pathogens.
A transcription factor called FOXO1 plays a crucial role in making the uterus receptive for embryo implantation. The uterus needs to be in a specific state to allow the embryo to attach and grow. If the uterus is not receptive, it can lead to failed pregnancies or unsuccessful in vitro fertilization attempts. Researchers found that removing FOX1 in the uterus using a mouse model resulted in infertility due to changes in the lining of the uterus, preventing the embryo from attaching. Analyzing the uterus after FOX1 removal showed changes in genes involved in cell invasion, transport, apoptosis, and signaling pathways. Progesterone receptor (PGR) signaling increased due to P being present in the uterus lining during receptivity. Constitutive expression of P in the lining during receptivity inhibited FOX1 in the nucleus of the uterus. In human samples, P and FOX1 expression were found to be reciprocal during the proliferative and secretory phase. This suggests that FOX1 and loss of P during receptivity are related and critical for implantation. The interaction between the embryo and receptive uterus is necessary for successful implantation, and the uterus conditions are regulated by progesterone via P-mediated activity. P interacts with factors for endometrial receptivity, including FOX1. FOX1 ablation in the uterus affects multiple pathways, including P and inflammatory and growth factors required for proper function. Transcript analysis showed activation of the P pathway. Observations indicate spatiotemporal and localization of FOX1 and P in the epithelium requires mutual regulation for implantation. FOX1 expression was analyzed with P in human endrial tissue across the menstrual cycle. It is possible that FOX is involved in downregulation of P, leading to infertility. FOX and P may be in a regulatory relationship in the epithelium at the window of receptivity, substantiated by sequestration of FOX in response to constitutive P in nuclei during implantation.
Researchers developed a statistical model to map the spread of deng cases in Bangladesh, accounting for under-reporting and spatial and temporal effects. They analyzed district-level data from 2000 to 2009, using a negative binomial generalized linear mixed model with integrated Laplace approximation. The study found that mean temperature and its interaction with mean diurnal temperature lagged by two months were significantly associated with deng incidence, while mean rainfall two months prior was positively associated. Densely populated districts and those bordering India or Myanmar had higher incidence than others. The model estimated 92% of annual deng cases occurred between August and September, with 94% in the capital Dhaka. Less than half of affected districts reported cases were observed from surveillance data, varying by month with higher in high-incidence districts and lower towards the end of transmission.
Researchers have identified a new type of preferred location in mice called "knots" that are characterized by high tortuosity, or winding paths with twists and turns, during exploratory behavior in an open field. These locations, termed "knots", are distinct from "home bases" which are marked by frequent visits and high cumulative time spent. Mice tend to visit nots sporadically, tracing them with a tortuous paths, and perform a behavior called "knotcribbling" during these visits. Nots are typically established at the point of introduction into the arena, away from walls, and are not characterized by high inbound speed and low outbound speed. The establishment of nots is enhanced by injecting mice with saline and placing them in an exposed portion of the arena, suggesting stress and arousal consolidate a long-term contingency between locale and notcribling. In an environment devoid of proximal cues, mice mark a locale with twisting and turning, creating a self-generated, centrally located landmark. The tortuosity of path during notcribling implies multiple views of the environment, allowing recalibration of the mouse's locale and compass directions. Rich vestibular input from notcribling may improve interpretation of the scene.
Researchers have identified a potential new target for antifungal compounds in a protein called Sec14, which is essential for the growth and virulence of the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. The compound NG04, an ergoline, was found to inhibit the growth of C. neoans with selectivity over mammalian cells. High-resolution chemogenomics identified Sec14 as the target of NG04, and mutations in Sec14 defined the compound interactions in the binding pocket of the protein. Sec14 is involved in lipid transfer and virulence in pathogenic fungi, making it an attractive antif target. NG04 inhibited growth of two clinical isolates of C. neoans and related compounds showed equal or higher potency. NG04 also showed fungicidal activity against fluconazole-resistant C. neoans strain. Sec14 is conserved in S. cerevisiae and C. neoans, with critical sites for NG04 sensitivity conserved. Testing NG04 and related ergoline analogs against C. neo was prioritized due to high medical need. NG04 binds to fungal proteins in a similar way, with conserved residues Y, Y, Y, Y, S, and T. In vitro, NG04 showed anti-cryptoccal activity and potent derivatives were identified. Secp-dependent virulence is only described for C neo, but not other pathogens.
Researchers have investigated the antischosomal properties of mefloquine, a drug used to treat malaria, in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni and S japonicum, two major schistosome species. A single oral dose of meflo (200-400mg/kg) resulted in 72.3-100% to 100% worm burden reduction in adult worms, and high reductions in young stages of S mansoni and japon in mice. Both meflo enantiomers showed comparable worm reductions in mice with subpatent or patent S mans infection. These findings suggest a potential for a new antischosomal drug based on aminoal functionality. Further in vitro and in vivo studies aim to elucidate meflo's mechanism and effect on S haematium and other trematodes. Mefloquine, used to treat malaria, may also impact schosomias in areas where both diseases coexist.
A study was conducted in Cameroon to map the distribution of podoiosis, a non-filar elephantiasis causing massive swelling of the lower legs, identified as a neglected disease by WHO in 2011. A multi-stage sampling design stratified the country by environmental risk of podoiosis, with 76 villages from 40 districts in 10 regions surveyed. Individuals 15 years old or older were house-to-house screened for lymphedema. A clinical algorithm diagnosed podoiosis excluding filarial lymphema. Individuals with lymphema were tested for Wuchereria bancrofti antigen and IgG using Alere Filasis Strips and Standard Diagnostics BIOLymphatic filasis Ig4 tests. No microfilar W bancft were found in blood of individuals with lymphema. 52 people with podoiosis were identified after applying the algorithm. Prevalence of podoiosis was 0.5% (95 CI 0.4-0.7). At least one case podo was found in every region except Adamawa. 40 districts had no cases, 15 had 0.2-1% and 8 had 1.2-2.7%. The study demonstrated low but widespread podo in Cameroon. Designing podo control is vital. A health response to burden podo is important through surveillance and morbidity services.
Researchers investigated how aging affects the ability of germline stem cells (GSCs) to occupy their niche in Drosophila. They found that Notch signaling increases with age in Gs, leading to their removal from the niche. Analysis showed that Gs with low levels of Notch signaling have increased adhesion to the niche, outcompeting neighbors with higher levels of Notch. Adhesion is altered through regulation of E-cadherin expression. Enhancing Not signaling in Gs hastens age-dependent loss from niche, and is partially mediated by lethal. Disrupting Not signaling in Gs does not delay loss during aging or affect BMP signaling, which promotes self-renewal of Gs. In contrast, Not activation in niche maintains niche integrity and mediates G retention, and is reduced with age. This suggests Notch regulates G-niche adhesion both intrinsically and extrinsically. The study reveals a novel role of Notch in G-niche response to aging and is relevant to metastatic cancer, where Not suppresses cell adhesion.
Researchers studied the conserved herpesvirus protein kinases (CHPKs), a group of kinases encoded by eight human herpesviruses, to determine if they share cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity. They found that the beta and gamma herpesvirus PKs, but not alpha herpesvirus PKs, can phosphorylate the retinoblastoma (R) tumor suppressor protein and lamin A, and disrupt the nuclear lamina. In a yeast assay, the beta and gamma PKs displayed authentic Cdk activity, while alpha PKs did not. The PKs were also found to have non-dk activities, such as disrupting promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies and cytoplasmic aggres, but these were not conserved among all PKs. The study suggests that these kinases, some of which are targets of antiviral drugs, have overlapping and non-overlapping functions during infections.
A systematic review was conducted to define the global distribution of Burkholderia pseudalle, a Tier 1 select agent and cause of meloidosis, in the environment. The study aimed to update the risk map for meloidosis and propose international guidelines for soil sampling. A working party, the Detection Environmental Burkholder pseudalle Working Party (DEBP), was formed during the 6th Meloidosis Congress in 2010. PubMed was searched from 1912 to 2011 using MeSH terms pseudalle and meloidosis. The geographical distribution of pseudalle in the environment was mapped as definite, probable, or possible, and the methodology for detecting pseudalle was extracted. Coverage was patchy, with a lack of studies in areas where meloid is suspected. Sampling and identification methods were variable and not robust. Consensus guidelines were developed to reduce false results and provide affordable, low-tech methods for developed and developing countries. The guidelines provide a basis for a comprehensive global map of pseudalle.
Researchers have discovered that peptides derived from the stem region of the Dengue virus protein can inhibit the virus's ability to enter cells by targeting a specific intermediate stage of the fusion process. This stage, called the post-fusion conformation, is a crucial for the virus to merge with the cell membrane and release its genetic material. The peptides bind to this conformation and prevent the virus from fusing with the cell membrane, reducing its infectivity. The effectiveness of the peptides is directly related to how well they bind to the conformation, even if they are removed from the virus before it enters the cell. This suggests that the peptides attach to the virus before it reaches the cell and are carried with it into the endosome, where fusion occurs. The process is temperature-dependent, with no effect at 4°C but not at 37°C. The study proposes a two-step mechanism for fusion inhibition by targeting the viral entry pathway, which could be an effective way to block infection. The findings support existing theories on how the conformation change promotes fusion and suggest strategies for inhibiting flavivirus entry.
Researchers have developed a method to sequence the entire genome of Vibrio cholera, the bacteria that causes cholera, from dried stool samples preserved on filter paper. This is significant because cholera is a major global health concern, with approximately 4 million cases and 95,000 deaths annually, and recent outbreaks in Haiti and Yemen highlight the need for effective control measures. The new method allows for low-cost, safe, and sustainable sequencing of cholera strains in resource-limited settings, providing valuable data for public health policy. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to recover a complete sequence of V. cholera O genome from stool enriched alkaline peptone water (APW) and culture isolates spotted on filter, with a minimum DNA concentration of 0.02 ng/μL required for quality information. GS confirmed the presence or absence of genes of interest, including cholera toxin and pilus loci, and identified co-infecting pathogens that may impact disease severity. GS placed the strains within the global cholera phylogenetic tree, identifying them as the 7th pandemic El Tor. GS allowed mapping of reads from AP-enrich specimen and culture isolate filter papers provided molecular epidemiological information on V cholera strains in remote, low-resource settings. Analysis of 700 V cholera genomes from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean showed epidemics stem from a single pandemic lineage introduction from Africa and Asia, possible due to WGS phylogenetic measures. DNA from AP-enrich and isolate filter papers showed a correlation (Spearman score 0.42, p<0.1), with a minimum 0.02 ng/μL V cholera DNA generating 75% coverage. Meta-analysis of AP-enrich spotted papers identified V cholera through assemblies in more samples than isolate filter papers. Preliminary species analysis showed V cholera represented the most abundant species in majority of samples.
Researchers have identified a protein called Dyne that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and organization of epithelial cells, which are a type of cell layer that forms the lining of organs and glands. Epithelial cells have a distinct top and bottom side, known as apical and basolateral, and precise targeting of proteins to these areas is necessary for their proper function. A genetic study in fruit flies, Drosophila, found that Dyne is essential for apical-bas polarity, or the arrangement of proteins on the top and bottom of epithelial cells. Dyne works with a protein called Stardust (Sdt) to target a protein called Crumbs, which is on the surface of epithelial cells, by localizing it to the apical side. The study found that a specific part of the Stardust mRNA, or genetic material, is responsible for this localization and that is only present in early stages of epithelial development, but not in mature epithelia. This is the first time Dyne has been shown to be necessary for epithelial polarity and suggests that localization of mRNA may play a role in regulating ap-bas organization. Additionally, the study found that an alternative splicing, or variation, of the Stard mRNA, is used to control its localization during development.
Researchers have investigated the reproductive mode of Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes cutaneous leishmaniasis, and found evidence of intraclonal genetic exchange within its natural vector, the sand fly Phlebotom periciosus. They created transgenic L. infant lines expressing drug resistance markers linked to green and red fluorescent reporters and hypothesized that cells with identical genotypes could recognize each other and mate. The markers were successfully exchanged within the sand midgut of the vector when individuals were fed a mixture of parental clones. Using yellow and drug markers, they provided evidence of genetic exchange in L. infant. Hybrid progeny appeared to be triploid based on DNA analysis and was stable throughout the parasite life cycle. Infections by the hybrid in BAL/c mice showed reduced parasite loads in spleen and liver and weight similar to uninfected mice. Sple argin activity was also reduced relative to parental strains.
Researchers studied Leishmania donani strains from patients in Ethiopia with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and HIV co-infections. They analyzed DNA from 63 strains using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting three regions: internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS), cystine protease (cp), and HASPB. The ITS and cp PCR identified the strains as Leishmania donani. However, the HAS PCR amplicon size varied depending on the patient's geographic origin. Most strains from northwestern Ethiopia produced a 290bp product, while a minority gave 410 amplicons, all from HIV-VL co-infections. Southwestern strains produced 450 amplicons, with smaller products observed in three. Sudanese strains had amplicons identical to northwestern, while Kenyan gave larger products 500-650bp. High-resolution analysis distinguished different products. Sequence analysis showed the HAS repeat region in Leish donani comprised polymorphic 13-14 amino motifs. The 13 amino peptide, prevalent in Leish donani, is rare in Leishum. The order of repeats in Leishani varies between regions. The HAS region shows considerable polymorphism among Leish strains from East Africa. This should be considered when designing diagnostic and vaccine assays based on this antigen.
Researchers studied the distribution of HIV-1 recombinant breakpoints to understand how they contribute to the diversity of the HIV pandemic. They developed a probabilistic model of HIV-1 recombination based on sequence identity and compared it to the distribution of breakpoints in the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The model accurately predicted the frequencies of inter-sub recombination across much of the HIV genome, indicating that local sequence-dependent recombination is sufficient to explain breakpoint locations. However, some regions showed significant over or underrepresentation of breakpoints, suggesting natural selection influences the recombination pattern. The envelope gene had fewer breakpoints, indicating recombinants in this region are less likely to be successful. Breakpoints at higher than predicted were near the envelope, indicating selection for recombinants due to this region's tendency to be recombined as a unit. The study found a specific portion of the genome deviates from the probabilistic model, suggesting only a minority of recombination events contribute to HIV-1 evolution.
Researchers in neuroscience have traditionally used separate statistical methods to address two interconnected problems: estimating model parameters for a population of subjects and comparing candidate models to individual data. However, these methods are interdependent, as the population parameters of a model depend on which subjects express the model. A new hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) framework is proposed for concurrent model comparison and parameter estimation at the population level, combining previous approaches. This framework has advantages for both parameter estimation and model comparison theoretically and experimentally, with estimated parameters showing smaller errors compared to other methods. Model comparison by H is robust against outliers and not biased towards simplistic models. A fully Bayesian approach enables researchers to make inference on group parameters by H-test.

A novel hierarchical and Bayesian method is introduced to address both model fitting and comparison within the same framework using variational techniques. The approach has consequences for both parameter and model estimation. A fully Bayesian quantifying uncertainty at the group level enabled statistical tests about parameters and corresponding errors. Empirical Bayes play a role in modern statistics.

The HBI framework is hierarchical, with individual parameters regularized by statistics across individuals, and Bayesian with uncertainties at both levels represented by distributions. Evaluating a model for a subject's data precedes estimation of its values; previous research used separate tools for these problems. However, they are interconnected, as parameters and fit depend on subjects belonging to the population expressing the model. This is addressed from a Bayesian viewpoint.

The work addresses statistical inference both parameters and models, elusive with previous methods. Notably, the best-fitting model may vary subject to subject, hierarchical estimation assumed the model expressed all subjects.
Researchers studied how the development of the auditory circuitry in the brainstem, specifically the part of the brain responsible for processing sound, in mice. They found that a group of cells called rhombomeres, which contribute to brainstem development, play a crucial role in forming sensory and motor components of the auditory system, including the ventral nucleus of the lemniscus, ventral cochlear nuclei, and olivochlear neurons. The assembly of these components is necessary for sound perception and relies on interactions between Hox1 and H2 genes. In mice lacking these genes, transmission of low-level auditory stimuli is impaired. On the other hand, H2 regulates axon guidance and contralateral projections from the ventral cochlear to the trapezoid nucleus, a circuit involved in sound localization. Each rhomere and its associated H codes control distinct subcircuits in the developing brainstem. The study also found that a single rhomere, r4, contributes to various derivatives of the auditory pathway distributed across multiple rhomeres. H1 and H2 are crucial in rhom patterning, and r4 changes identity in their absence. The study suggests H genes are involved in assembling sensorimotor circuits in the hindbrain. The researchers found that rostral rhomeres and associated H genes are required for two major circuits in the central auditory system with different origins.
Scientists have sequenced the complete genome of a marine bacterium called Saccharagus deans strain 2-40, which is capable of breaking down complex carbohydrates. This bacterium is part of a newly discovered group of marine and estuarine bacteria that recycle polysaccharides. The genome analysis reveals an unusually large number of enzymes that degrade complex polyscharides, with many exhibiting novel combinations of catalytic and substrate modules. These features are thought to facilitate depolymerization of complex polyschar in the marine environment. This is the first sequenced genome of a marine bacterium that can degrade plant cell walls, a component of the carbon cycle not well-characterized in the marine.

The bacter's carbohydrases are regulated by multiple mechanisms, with more enzymes induced for more complex polyschar complexes. Glucose is a key regulation mechanism. The carbohydrases are functional in microcos as S2-40 grows on plants as sole carbon sources, fully degrading them. This is the first marine proary shown to do so. Saccharagus deans 2-40 is a free-living marine bacterium capable of degrading cellulos algae and plant material. 16 rDNA analysis shows it's a member of the gamma-class of phylum Proteacteria, related to cellulitic nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

The bacter's enzym capabilities suggest a significant role in the marine carbon cycle, functioning as a "supergrader" breaking down complex polyschar from plants and invertebrates. It's an understudied system. The S2-40 genome is sequenced and closed. Polyschar degrading systems contain multiple enzymes with synergistic activities, such as cellulase with endo and exo-acting enzymes.
Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) is a zoonotic flavivirus that causes significant childhood neurological infections in Asia. Over the past 20 years, JEV genotype has shifted from genotype III (GIII) to I (GI). The mechanism of this shift is unknown. Culex (Cx) mosquitoes are common in China and play a key role in JE transmission. This study used Cx pipiens mosquitoes from China to explore if they played a role in JEV shift. Female Cx pip mosquitoes were exposed to GI or GIII JEV strains. Midgut, organs, and salivary glands of infected mosquitoes were collected at 7 and 14 days post-infection (dpi) to measure infection, replication, dissemination, and transmission of JEV in Cx pip. Cx pip was competent for both GI and GIII infection with similar rates and kinetics. Both genotypes disseminated to secondary organs at similar rates. GI-infected saliv glands were 16.2% positive at 7dpi, while GIII was undetectable. However, 29.4% and 36.3% were positive at 14dpi. No difference in transmission rate between GI and G-infected was detected. Data showed GI and GIII have similar infectivity in Cx pip, suggesting C pip may not play a role in J shift.
A two-year review of the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of deng deaths in Malaysia between 2013 and 2014 was conducted. Dengue is a rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease affecting people in tropical and subtropical countries. The study aimed to investigate demographics and clinical characteristics associated with deng deaths in Malaysia. A retrospective review of all deng deaths nationwide between January 1, 2013 and December 31,2014 was conducted. Data were extracted from mortality reports and investigational forms. Cases were categorized into children (<15 years), adults (15-59 years), and elderly (≥60) to compare clinical characteristics. A total 322 deng deaths were reviewed, with a mean age of 40.7±19.7 years, half were females, and 72.5% were adults. Diabetes and hypertension were common co-morbidities among adults and elderly. The most reported symptoms were lethargy and vomiting, with lethargy being more common in children and abdominal pain in adults. 22.4% had no symptoms. Only 34% were suspected deng at initial presentation. Adults developed severe plasma leakage more often. More than half suffered multi-organ involvement and 20.2 had no organ involvement. Deaths occurred at 3 days post-admission. Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) caused 70% of deaths, followed by severe involvement 69% and bleeding 29.7%. In Malaysia, deng deaths primarily occurred in adults, with SS leading cause regardless of age. Atypical presentation and progression prompts early recognition and intervention to prevent deaths.
Researchers studied how female fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, choose their mates and what makes them attractive to males. They found that insulin signaling, a nutrient-sensing pathway, affects female attractiveness. Insulin signaling in the body's fat and ovarian follicle cells makes females more attractive, while insulin in the body's fat makes them less attractive. The ovaries are necessary for insulin's effect on attractiveness, and manipulating insulin in follicle cells alone replicates global effects. Insulin in the body and follicle have opposite effects, suggesting a competitive relationship. Modulating insulin in these tissues changes attractiveness and fecundity in the same direction, pointing to insulin as a link between the two. Cues, cuticular hydrocarbons, respond differently to body and follicle manipulations, indicating independent activity from these tissues. A system is described where attractiveness results from connection between cues and organism's state of fecundity, both created by insulin in body and follicle.
Researchers analyzed data from the 2013-2015 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to understand how the virus spread differently across districts within and between countries. They used a statistical model to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) for each district and country, which measures how many people one infected person can infect on average. R ranged from 0.36 to 1.72 in Guinea, 0.53 to 3.37 in Liberia, and 1.14 to 2.73 in Sierra Leone. At the national level, R was estimated at 0.97 for Guinea, 1.26 for Liberia, and 1.66 for Sierra. The study found that urbanization, high population density, and wealth were linked to higher R, suggesting rapid urban growth in West Africa may have contributed to the spread of Ebola.
Researchers investigated the factors that influence a protein's rate of evolution, focusing on the interplay between its structural properties and age. They analyzed a large dataset of one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse proteins with mapped PDB structures and found that previously observed correlations between structural properties and evolutionary rates also held within each age group, including relationships between solvent accessibility, designability, and rates. However, age also played a role in modulating the relationship between solvent and rate. Younger proteins, despite being less designable, tended to evolve faster than older ones. The researchers showed that reported relationships between age and rate could not be explained by structural biases among groups. They introduced a knowledge-based function to study protein stability through large-scale computation and found that older proteins were more stable in their native structure and robust to mutations than younger ones.
Researchers have identified a protein called Polycomb-like 3 (P3) as a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (P2) that plays a crucial role in regulating embryonic stem cell (ES) self-renewal. P3 is found to interact with Suz12, a core component of P2, and promotes the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3me3), a mark associated with gene repression. Knocking down P3 in ES cells leads to increased differentiation, but not affecting early cell fate decisions, indicating P3's specific role in self-renew. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing reveal P3 co-localizes with Suz12 and depletion of P3 decreases Suz binding at 60% of P2 targets. Mutation of conserved residues in P3's Tudor domain, implicated in recognizing methylated histones, compromises H3me formation. P3 and its paralog P2 exist in different P2 complexes, binding many of the same targets, particularly Cp islands regulated by P3. P3 is critical for ESC-renew, histone methylation, and P2 recruitment to a subset genomic sites.
Researchers have investigated how the nematode C. elegans modifies its chemosensory behavior in response to changes in feeding state. They focused on the chemoreceptor gene sr-234, which is expressed in the AD sensory neuron of C. elegans and is regulated by the transcription factor MEF-2. The study found that MEF-2 acts together with basic helix-loop-helix (bHL) transcription factors to regulate sr-234 expression as a function of feeding state. A cis-regulatory M2 site is necessary for starvation-induced downregulation of sr-234, while an E-box binds HL factors to drive sr- expression in AD neurons. HL-2, HL-3, and HL-4 transcription factors act in AD neurons to regulate sr-234. The study also showed that MX-3 and HL-30 in the intestine regulate sr- expression in AD neurons, dependent on insulin signaling in AD neurons and a subset of insulin peptides. These results suggest that chemore gene expression is regulated by cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms mediated by M2 and HL factors, allowing C. elegans to fine-tune chemens responses to changes in feeding state.
A study was conducted to investigate the association between the detection of Mycobacterium ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of Buruli ulcer disease in southeastern Australia. Adult mosquitoes were trapped in seven towns on the Bellarine Peninsula, Victoria, from 2004 to 2009, and screened for M. ulcer using real-time PCR. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases of BU in residents during the same period was tallied to determine the average incidence in each location. A strong correlation was found between the detection of M. ulcer in mosquitoes and the risk of disease (r = 0.99; 95% CI 0.92-0.99; p<0.001). The study suggests that mosquitoes are involved in the transmission of M. ulcer in southeastern Australia. This has implications for the development of strategies to control and prevent BU. In the absence of alternative transmission theory, mosquitoes are believed to play a role in spreading M ulcer to humans in Australia, and measures to minimize bites in residents and visitors should be encouraged in endemic areas. The study also raises questions whether mosquitoes are involved in transmission in other BU areas, such as Queensland and Africa, where majority of cases occur.
Researchers have identified a genetic mutation in the MRS2 gene, which codes for a magnesium ion channel in the mitochondria, as the cause of demyelination in rats. The mutation leads to severe myelin breakdown in the central nervous system after normal myelination is complete. By cloning, they found a G-to-A transition in the MRS2 gene created a new splice site, inactivating the mutant allele. Transgenic rescue with wild-type MRS2DNA confirmed the findings. M2 encodes a component of the major magnesium influx system in mitochondria of yeast and human cells. Rats with the mutation have major mitochondrial deficits, high lactic acid in cerebrospinal fluid, 60% reduction in ATP, and swollen mitochondria in oligodendrocy cytoplasm. M2-GFP transgenic rats showed M2 expressed in neurons, not oligodrocytes, and ultrastructurally in inner mitochondria membrane. Observations suggest demy rats suffer mitochondrial disease, myelin maintenance different from production. Mg2 homeostasis in mitochondria essential for myelin maintenance.
Researchers analyzed eight publicly available clinical microarray studies to evaluate the consistency of gene expression signatures in diagnosing diseases. They found that current documentation standards for signatures do not allow for unambiguous application to external studies, hindering independent evaluation and clinical use. The study showed that discrepancies between internal and external diagnoses can be as high as 30% in the worst-case and 18% in median. A proposed documentation strategy, which includes quantitative information, reduced the discrepancy to 1%. The process of bringing microarray gene expression signatures to clinical practice can be improved and made more reliable with better documentation. 

The study used eight clinicalarray studies involving different diseases and diagnostic problems. Rawarray data is subject to noise, and preprocessing is common prior to analysis. The consistency of diagnoses depends on the documentation of the signature, with optimal obtained using the proposed strategy. No strong evidence was found favoring one approach over the other. Microarray signatures hold promise to improve diagnosis and prognosis, but evaluation is difficult and subject to research. A signature needs to hold independent information to existing prognostic markers. To impact clinical practice, signatures need to be communicated for external evaluation and use, requiring unambiguous documentation.
Researchers have studied the structure of amyloid fibrils produced by a type of bacteria called Enterobacteriaceae, which help the bacteria stick to host cells and form biofilms, making them resistant to environmental stress. They found that these amyloid fibrils have a similar structure to those found in human diseases like Alzheimer's, and used peptides designed to stop Alzheimer's amyloid formation also stopped the bacteria's amyloid formation and biofilm growth. The study also showed that the bacteria's amyloid can trigger human amyloid formation, suggesting a possible link between the two. The researchers found that two peptides, designed to stop Alzheimer amyloid, also stopped the bacteria's amyloid formation and biofilm growth. They also found that the bacteria's amyloid can trigger human amyloid formation, suggesting a possible link between the two. The study provides insights into amyloid regions important for biofilm formation and suggests a strategy to disrupt amyloid biofilms and hypothesizes that amyloid from bacteria could contribute to neurodegenerative diseases.
Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is a significant cause of encephal in Asia, with high case fatality rates and neurologic sequelae among survivors. In the Philippines, the epidemiology of JE is not well-defined. A systematic review of literature and surveillance data from 2011-2014 was conducted to support consideration of JE vaccine introduction into the national schedule. 29 reports on JE in the Philippines were identified, including 5 serologic, 18 clinical, and 8 animal studies. Clinical studies reported 257 laboratory-confirmed JE cases from 1972-2013, with JE virus as causative in 7-18% of meningitis and encephalitis, and 16-40% encephal cases. Predominantly affected children under 15, with 6-7% resulting in death. Surveillance 2011-2014 identified 73 laboratory-confirmed JE out of 497 tested. This review demonstrates endemicity and geographic range of JE in the Philippines, supporting vaccine use in the country. Continued surveillance and laboratory confirmation are needed to quantify the burden, guide prioritization of high-risk areas, and age and schedule of vaccine introduction, and measure preventive measures against this public health threat.
Researchers investigated the origins of genetic robustness in bacteria by studying the metabolic networks of hundreds of species across various environments. They found that variations in robustness among species reflect adaptations to their ecological niches. Robustness was decoupled into two components: environmental, responsible for 20% of non-essential reactions and associated with lifestyle (specialized/generalist), and environmental-independent, associated with intrinsic metabolic capacities (0.6 correlation). Higher robustness was observed in fast growers and organisms with extensive secondary metabolite production. Reactions uniquely susceptible to perturbations in pathogens were identified as potential drug targets.

The study used a large-scale computational approach to analyze metabolic networks, providing a significantly improved fit over individual measures. The association suggests that increased metabolic capacities drove the evolution of robustness in bacterial networks. Robustness can be studied at various biological levels, from molecular to organismal, where it's considered robust if a mutation has insignificant effect on a trait. Environmental robust differs across species, with some tolerating wide habitats and others having specialized requirements.

The contribution of environmental robust to genetic was demonstrated by a new pathway allowing a species to use an external metabolite as an alternative to an existing one, promoting robustness. Environmental robust correlates with modularity of networks (-0.43, P<e-16). The effect of environmental on genetic in networks was studied in yeast, where half of non-essential genes were active under restricting conditions. However, environmental cannot fully explain dispensability, two other hypotheses proposed: adaptive and intrinsic origins.
Researchers conducted a randomized trial to investigate the effect of Schistosoma mansoni infection on antibody responses to measles catch-up immunization in pre-school children and the impact of prazantel treatment on this outcome. The study, called the Immune Modulation and Childhood Immunization (IMCI) study, took place in Enteb, Uganda, and included 193 Schistoma-infected and 61 uninfected children aged 3-5 years. Infected children were randomly assigned to receive prantel 2 weeks before, at the time of, or 1 week after measles immunization. Plasma-meas IgG was measured at enrollment, 1 and 24 weeks after immunization. The primary outcomes were IgG levels and percentage of participants with levels considered protective against measles. Results showed that Schistoma-infected children had lower anti-meas Ig levels at 1 week post-immun compared to uninf children (adjusted mean ratio 0.4, 95 CI 0.2-0.7) and lower percentage with protective levels (odds ratio 0.1, 0.9). However, among Schoma-inf children, anti-meas Ig 1 post-imm was higher in those treated with prant than those not (treated before immun, ratio 2.3,1.5-4.8; at immun ratio 1.8,1.3.5). At 24 post-imm, Ig levels did not differ between groups but tended to be lower in previously-inf children still Schoma-positive than those who became negative. The study suggests Schoma infection impairs antibody response to measles immun in pre-school children and prant treatment improves it.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding bacterial evolution by analyzing large-scale population samples of DNA sequences. However, traditional methods like phylogenetic analysis are limited when dealing with extensive sampling and recombination. To address this, new statistical tools for detecting recombination and population representation are introduced, along with a model describing population sequence space in terms of variability and affinity to other populations. These tools are combined with phylogen analysis to demonstrate their potential using Neisseria data. The software BAPS 5.2 is available for download, capable of capturing various biological signals in molecular data, but interpretation requires complementary phylogen methods and knowledge. A population of 508 Neisser strains is analyzed, assuming a simplified evolutionary model with a common local ancestor and global ancestor. Traditional genetic tools are not applicable to bacterial data due to lack of population conditions, while phylogen may distort relationships with recombination. The introduced tools in BAPS enable large-scale population analysis, overcoming computational complexity of standard methods. Neisser species are chosen for validation due to frequent recombination and horizontal gene flow.
Researchers investigated the role of top-down beta rhythms in attentional modulation using a computational model of cortical areas. Beta rhythms in the 20 Hz frequency band have been linked to attention in previous studies, with top-down beta from higher areas to sensory areas supporting attentional gain. The model showed that top beta can activate ascending projections from L5 to L4 and L2/3, responsible for biased competition in superficial layers. Slow inhibitory interneurons resonated to 20 Hz and modulated superficial activity in an attention-related manner, providing a potential mechanism for cholinergic support of selective attention.

The study explored top beta projected to L5 interneurons, finding mechanisms for selective attention: L cells resonating to beta modulated superficial activity by ascending to upper layers. Excitatory and inhibitory projections from L5 to upper layers were associated with top beta activity in superficial layers, consistent with neural modulation by attention. The model proposed interamin interaction regulated by top beta supported selective attention. Biased competition has been thought to underlie attentional control, with beta associated with top-down attention in recent studies. The model addressed whether top beta can bias competition and how it achieves this. Top beta reproduced neurophysiological findings that stimulus generated gamma and elevated spiking, and attention enhanced neural responses. Bottom-up inputs simulated 100 Hz trains of EPs to L4 and FS cells of columns.
Researchers have developed a new method called Multiple Shooting for Stochastic Systems (MSS) to calibrate and predict stochastic compartmental models of epidemics. These models are useful for studying the emergence of new pathogens when the number of infected individuals is small, but current methods for estimating and predicting these models are limited. SS uses a linear approximation to describe the size of fluctuations and updates the belief about the epidemic state with each new observation. The method was tested on simulated outbreaks of a viral pathogen and showed accurate estimates of key parameters, such as duration of infectiousness, R0, and Reff, and the number of unobserved individuals during the epidemic. It also accurately predicted future hospitalizations and attack rate. SS outperformed three benchmark methods: likelihood with Poisson assumption, particle filtering, and Kalman filter in most scenarios. The method addresses challenges in estimating and predicting epidemics when the state is partially observed and spread is stochastic. The posterior from one observation can be used as prior for the next. The goal is to improve predictions of future epidemics. The method was tested with competing approaches in accuracy, estimating parameters, predicting behaviors, and inferring the state, and sensitivity to noise and misspecification.
Researchers have discovered that human perception is influenced by two opposing forces: adaptation and past decisions. In a series of experiments, they used multilevel modeling and cross-validation to investigate the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on behavioral reports during forced-choice tasks. The results showed that perceptual reports are biased by a hierarchy of serial processes: low-level adaptation repels perception away from previous stimuli, whereas decisional attracts percept reports towards the past. This hierarchy of dependence arises from decisional inertia, not low sensory processes. A two-process model suggests persistence compensates for adaptation, leading to attractive biases in perception. A unified account proposes distinct mechanisms at different stages promote differentiation and integration of visual information over time.

The study used multile modeling and cross-validation to characterize serial dependence, concluding: two forces interact at any moment shaping perception, biasing appearance towards or away from past. Repulsive forces, low-level adaptation dominate stimuli requiring perception. The goal was to determine if dependence depends on past stimuli or previous response. Recent work showed past biases decisions about sensory input, but decisions may represent a source of bias combining or outweighing stimuli. This result supports a hierarchical view and shows decisional affect percept even with new stimuli.

The study provides a unified account of perceptual and decision processes, proposing a hierarchical model of dependence. Two contrasting forces, adaptation and decision inertia, interact shaping experience and reactions to stimuli. In line with low continuity, dependence should originate from early neurons and be immune to later stages. However, results revealed mechanisms: repulsive after sensory and attractive percept.
Researchers have investigated the role of transcription in circadian timekeeping in Drosila by analyzing the effects of a CY-viral protein 16 (VP) fusion in the Drosila system. The addition of the potent transcriptional activator VP to the CLKCY-VP complex enhanced transcriptional activity compared to the normal CLKCY heterodimer. This increase was observed in S2 cells and flies expressing CY-VP, which also had increased levels of CLKCY direct gene mRNAs and a short period, indicating circadian transcription contributes to period determination. Examination of reporter gene expression in CYVP-expressing flies suggested the short period was due to rapid transcriptional phase. Behavioral effects required the per promoter and were not merely a consequence of higher PER levels, indicating CLKCYVP effects were due to increased transcription. The study suggests timing of transcription activation, not activation itself, is key to behavioral effects in CYVP-express flies. The results indicate circadian transcription contributes to core function in Dila.
Researchers investigated how a horizontally acquired gene, pmr, functions in two closely related bacteria, Salmonella and E. coli. They found that pmr activates the Pmr/PB system in Salmonella, but not in E. coli, suggesting a difference in an additional component controlling PA levels. The E. coli pmr protein has higher phosphatase activity towards PA-P than the Salmonella pmr, and replacing the E. coli pmr gene with the Salmon homolog renders E. coli resistant to polymyxin B under pm-inducing conditions. This shows that quantitative differences in biochemical activities of ancestral proteins dictate the ability of a horizontally acquired gene to confer species-specific traits. The study suggests horizontally acquired genes can potentiate at ancestral loci. The pmr was likely acquired by lateral transfer, as the divergent E. coli pmD can rescue a Salmonella pmD mutant to activate Pmr/PB in low Mg+. E. coli with Salmonella pmB requires pmD for transcription of PA-activated genes in low Mg+, but not in high Mg+. E. coli is resistant to polymin in Fe+, but not in Mg+, a process requiring pmr and pbg.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify genes involved in the early stages of cell differentiation, a process where stem cells become specialized. This method, called Differentiation-Test, analyzes gene expression data from a mixture of cells without separating them into types. Traditional methods often include genes that respond to differentiation, not regulate it. The test was applied to mouse embryonic stem cells differentiating into embryoid bodies and identified Smad1, a novel regulator of pluripotency and self-renew. This approach can be used for other differentiation processes.

 Cell differentiation is a process where a cell becomes more specialized by expressing specific genes. Finding these genes is crucial, but a clear method is lacking. Different-Test assumes cells start homogeneous and become heterogeneous with gene expression changes. It was tested on mouse embryonic stem cells differentiating into embryoid bodies. Early on, subsets show expression changes towards different lineages.

The test identified regulators of pluripotency and selfnew. Selfnew regulators have lower expression in differentiated cells and should be detectable in 4-day embryoid bodies. Short hairpin RNA was used to study two regulators, Smad and P2. Expression was compared in Oct4 expressing and non-expressing cells. Regulators were separated into two modules: upregulated during differentiation (differentiation) and downregulated (pluripotency).
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze genetic data from next-generation sequencing studies, called unbiased clustering of gene variants with phenotypic-link network. This method addresses a common issue in previous studies where genes with longer coding sequences were more likely to be associated with disease, leading to false positives. The new method uses a large database of mammalian genotype-phenotype relations and semantic similarity to identify functional links between genes. It was tested on different types of data and networks and found that genes associated with the same disease clustered more in the phenotypic-link network than other networks. This method can identify functional associations between genes in the same disease, even after accounting for sequencing bias, and is suitable for polygenic disorders. 

The method was compared to other networks, including NETAG, and found to be more powerful. Functional enrichment approaches are used to identify shared functions in mutated genes, as case-control studies have limited power to associate rare variants with disease. Associations between genes are often inferred from large-scale data, such as protein-protein interactions and gene-expression networks. Statistical significance is assessed by comparing mutated genes to random sets. However, this can be affected by bias, leading to false findings. The new method controls for bias in coding sequence length and uses over 100,000 mammalian genotype-phenotype relations to enhance the phenotyp-link network.
Mexico implemented an 8% tax on non-essential foods with energy density ≥275 kcal/100g and a peso-per tax on sugar-sweet beverages (SBs) in January 2014 to prevent obesity and diabetes. This study evaluated changes in volume of taxed and untaxed food purchases in response to these taxes, stratified by socioeconomic status (SES). Data from 6,248 households in Nielsen's Mexico Consumer Panel (2012-2014) showed taxed food purchases declined by 5.1% in 2014 compared to expected pre-tax trends, with no change in untaxed foods. Low SES households purchased 10.2% less taxed foods, medium SES 5.8% less, while high SES didn't change. Taxes were implemented nationally, limiting inference of causality, and sample only representative of urban areas. Purchases of non-essential energy-dense foods declined in the first year after implementation. Future studies should evaluate impact on energy intake, dietary, and food patterns.
Researchers have proposed a new model to explain the behavior of collision-sensitive neurons, such as the Lobula Giant Detector (LG) neuron in the locust, which responds to objects approaching on a collision course. Previous models used a power law for scaling inhibitory input, but this new model assumes noisy channels with a response threshold. By pooling these channels, an approximate power law is obtained. This mechanism can predict many characteristics of the LG neuron's response, and is robust against noise in the excitatory pathway but sensitive to noise in the inhibitory pathway. The model, called n-ψ, is biophysically plausible but not as detailed as previous models. It's based on predecessor η, which used an exact power law for scaling inhibitory input. The nψ model is for a class of collision-sensitive neurons with maximum response before collision to objects with constant velocity. Noise approximates a power in the inhibitory pathway through threshold smoothing, predicted by integrating many inhibitory inputs. A power law alone doesn't suffice, as η would distort the LG's response to approaching objects. The new model, nψ, is based on an equation describing the LG neuron's membrane potential, receives Θ(t) and Θ(t) as input. Integration could be carried out by the LG's dendritic tree. Conditions are noise across channels and a response threshold.
Cameroon has been endemic for Buruli ulcer (BU) since 1969, but institutional control efforts began in 2002. The National Buruli Ulcer Control Programme (NBPUC) aimed to detect cases early, confirm 70% of clinical cases by PCR, treat all cases according to guidelines, and heal 95% of patients without joint limitation. From 2001-2014, 370 cases were reported, with a significant drop in detection rate from 3.89 to 1.45 per 100,000 inhabitants. The number of endemic districts increased from 2 to 64, with 5 functional diagnostic and 2 planned treatment centers. The health system was strengthened, research and education gained interest. Although control began 30 years after first cases, progress was made in detection, management, system reinforcement, and research. However, reduced resources led to steady decline since 2010.
Researchers investigated how people's confidence in their choices affects learning and decision-making when outcomes are framed as gains or losses. They found that participants were more confident in their choices when learning to gain compared to avoiding losses, despite equal performance and difficulty between the two contexts. A computational model revealed that this bias is driven by context-value, a dynamic estimate of the average value of options, necessary to explain performance in both gain and loss domains. This bias effect is domain-general and has significant consequences, showing that individuals' flexibility in learning strategies differs when outcomes are framed as gains or losses. 

A previous study showed that stakes can influence confidence in choices, regardless of correctness, with gains and losses biasing confidence upwards and downwards, respectively. Confidence is crucial in mediating learning strategies in changing environments, so investigating judgments and biases in reinforcement-learning is important. Confidence impacts subsequent decision processes and information seeking, and acts as a currency to trade-off between strategies. Biases could have critical consequences on learning and reveal features of learning and decision-making in different contexts. 

The researchers hypothesized that individuals would exhibit lower confidence in choices while learning to avoid losses compared to seeking, despite equal performance and difficulty between contexts. This bias was generated by learned-value, a latent variable in reinforcement models. The study investigated behavior and estimations in a reinforcement task where outcome valence was manipulated (gains versus losses). Participants performed equally well in gain-seeking and loss-avoid contexts. Confidence can be a meta-cognitive variable for comparing learning and deciding to adjust strategies. Despite models of confidence in decision and prediction, how-makers estimate confidence in reinforcement remains poorly investigated.
Researchers have investigated the function of the non-structural protein 3 (ns3) of alphaviruses, a group of viruses that includes Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis virus (SINV), and Chikungunya virus (CHV). Ns3 is a component of the viral replication complex and has a conserved amino-terminal domain involved in RNA synthesis and a poorly conserved carbox-terminal region. Despite the lack of overall homology, a carbox-terminal proline-rich motif is shared among alphavirus ns3 proteins and serves as a target for Src-homology 3 (SH) domains of amphiphin-1 and -2. The study found that ns3 of SF, SINV, and CHV show avid and SH-dependent binding to amphins. Upon alphavirus infection, intracellular distribution of amphin is altered and colocalized with ns3. Mutations in ns3 disrupting amphin SH binding and RNA-mediated silencing of amphin-2 resulted in impaired RNA replication in HeLa cells infected with SINV or SF. Infection of Bal/c mice with SF carrying SH binding-defective ns3 was associated with decreased mortality.
Researchers studied 123 strains of a disease-causing fungi in Brazil, known as chromoblastycosis, to understand its diversity. They used DNA sequencing to identify the genetic makeup of the fungi. The results showed that the disease-causing fungi were divided into three groups, with Fonseea being the most common, making up 80% of the cases, followed by F. monora and F. nica. Two new species, Rhinadiella and Cyphora, were also found, making up 3% and 1% of cases respectively. 

The study found that Fonsea pedso was the most prevalent in humid climates of South America, while F monora was more common in southern China. Four Fonsea species were found in Brazil, with pedso and nica strictly associated with the disease. All isolates were from humid zones, with no Cladophora found, which is common in arid conditions. Two new species of fungi causing chromobyc were identified, Fonsea, Rhinella, and Cyphora.
Researchers have studied how the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes interacts with its host cells to cause infection. They found that L monocytogenes induces DNA breaks in host cells, but surprisingly, the cells' response to these breaks is only moderately activated. The team discovered that the bacterium's toxin, listeriolysin O (LO), blocks the cellular response to DNA damage by degrading a key sensor protein, Mre11. Knocking out or inactivating proteins involved in the DNA damage response pathway promotes bacterial replication, highlighting the importance of this mechanism in controlling infection. The study shows that dampening the DNA damage response is crucial for successful Listerial infection. 

Further, researchers found that deleting or inhibiting proteins involved in the DNA response leads to higher infection levels, demonstrating that the response can be a negative regulator of bacterial infection. Other bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria gonorrhoe, have been shown to induce DNA damage, but this has not been studied during Lister infection. The study reveals that LO degrades M11, a major sensor of DNA damage, through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Additionally, dampening the response is important for infection, as inhibiting proteins in this pathway increases bacterial infection. The study uncovers L monocogen's subversion of the DNA response during infection and a role in blocking bacterial proliferation.
Researchers have identified a protein called bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4) as a key player in the infection of two common human viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2. They found that blocking a specific part of the protein, called the BD domain, with a compound called JQ, increased the viruses' ability to infect cells. This was confirmed by showing that knocking down BR4 expression, or blocking its activity, reduced JQ's effect on infection. BR4 regulates viral replication by forming a complex with other proteins CD9 and RNA polymerase II, while J1 promotes infection by directing this complex to viral gene promoters. Suppressing BR4 or CD9 activity hindered infection. The study suggests J1 enhances infection by switching BR4 to regulate viral gene expression by targeting chromatin.
Researchers investigated the microbial communities in the mouths of children with noma, a rare and devastating disease that causes severe facial disfigurement in over 140,000 malnourished children every year. The cause of noma is still unknown, but a mix of microbial infection, poor oral hygiene, and weakened immune system likely contribute to the development of oral lesions. These lesions are entry points for unidentified microorganisms that trigger gangren facial infections. The study analyzed 16S rRNA gene fragments from samples of gingival fluid from 12 healthy children, 12 with noma lesions, and 12 with Acute Necrotizing Gingitis (AN) lesions and healthy sites. Compared to healthy individuals, samples from diseased mouths were enriched with Spirocha and depleted for Proteobacteria. Samples from healthy sites of diseased had similar proportions of Spiro and Proteobacteria to healthy controls. Samples from n mouths did not have higher abundance of Fusobacter, casting doubt on its role as causative agent. Microbial communities from n and AN lesions were dominated by Prevotella intermedia OT, less abundant in healthy sites from same mouths. Multivariate analysis confirmed different bacterial communities in healthy and lesion sites. Several OTUs in Erysotrichales, Cloidales, Boid, and Spirotales were identified as indicators of n, suggesting one or more microbes within these orders associated with n lesions.
Bacillus thuringis, a bacterium that infects insects, uses a communication system called quorum sensing to adapt to its environment and decide whether to form spores or commit to a necrotrophic lifestyle. The quorum sensing system is regulated by proteins belonging to the RNPP family, which are controlled by internal signaling peptides. One of these regulators, Npr, acts as a transcription factor with its cognate peptide Npr, regulating genes for survival in the insect cadaver. However, in the absence of Npr, Npr independently controls sporulation by inhibiting the expression of SpoA-regulated genes, preventing Kin-dependent phosphorylation of phosphotransferase SpoF, thus delaying the sporulation process. Npr's function is similar to Rap proteins, which belong to RNPP but lack DNA-binding and control gene expression through protein interactions. Conservation of residues interacting with SpoF suggests common inhibition of sporulation. The structure of Npr shows a flexible Rap-like structure, proposing a regulatory mechanism where Npr's key residues are involved in two functions: Npr binding switches from dimer inhibitor to tetramer transcription activator in necrotrophic lifestyle. N thus coordinates sporulation and necrotism, ensuring survival and dissemination during infection.
Researchers have developed a new computational model to predict the effectiveness of HIV treatment for individual patients based on their viral genotype. Current models only use sequence data from genotyping, but this new model combines chemical and protein properties to improve accuracy. A large dataset of 300,000 data points was used to train the model, which achieved a prediction error rate below 0.5 log change. Compared to previous models, this new model performed better in resistance prediction and classification, with a 0.76 log unit difference. The model was also able to identify known and unknown resistance-conferring mutations in HIV Reverse Transcriptase and Protease. The model was applied to a public database and achieved a correct prediction rate of 84%, higher than previous work on a high-quality subset. This model can predict phenotypic resistance from genotyp data, even for novel and mixed mutants, and informs users about prediction reliability.
Researchers have proposed an alternative mechanism for chemotaxis, the process by which cells move towards or away from chemical attractants. The traditional view is that attractants cause actin polymerization, leading to pseudop formation and movement. However, this study suggests that pseudops are formed by a self-generated cycle, and attractants modulate the cycle rather than directly causing actin polymerization. A computational model based on pseudop autocatalysis was developed to test the explanatory and predictive powers of this mechanism. The model reproduces a wide range of existing data on cell movement and chemotaxis, simulates cell polarization and persistence, and predicts pseudop bias in attractant gradients. It also predicts lateral pseudop initiation in high attractant gradients. To test the model's ability, a prediction was made that the angle between successive pseudops at the front of the cell would increase with the difference between the cell's direction and the attractant gradient. This was measured in Dictyostelium cells under different conditions and agreed with the model. The model and data suggest that rapidly moving cells like Dictyostelium and neutrophils have an intrinsic pseudop cycle at the heart of motility, implying the mechanism relies on modification of pseudop behaviour rather than generation or actin polymerization by attractants.
Researchers studied how fleas transmit the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which causes plague, to rodents. They found that fleas can transmit the bacterium in two ways: early-phase transmission (EPT) and bio-dependent transmission (BDT). However, the efficiency of transmission varies among flea species and rodent species. To understand the mechanism of E, they fed fleas bacteremic blood from mice, rats, guinea pigs, or gerbils and observed the location and characteristics of infection in the digestive tract and transmissibility of Y. pest. Surprisingly, 10-28% of fleas fed bacteremic rat or guinea blood regurgitated a portion of the infected meal into the esophagus within 24 hours. This phenomenon is called post-infection esophageal reflux (PIER). In contrast, P was rarely observed in fleas fed bacteremic mouse or gerbil blood. P correlated with accumulation of dense aggregates of Y. pest, red blood cells, and hemoglobin that filled the proventulus. At next feeding, fleas with P were 3-25 times more likely to be blocked with blood retained in the esagus than fleas without P. Three days after feeding on bacteremic blood, Oropsa montana transmitted significantly more CFU than groups using mouse blood, and this transmission was bio-dependent.
Researchers have found that positive correlations between the activity of neurons in the brain can actually improve the accuracy of coding, rather than hinder it. Contrary to previous studies, which suggested that correlations were detrimental or only marginally beneficial, this study shows that they can enhance performance by several orders of magnitude. The probability of error can be suppressed by many orders of magnitude and the number of stimuli encoded, or capacity, can be increased more than tenfold. These effects do not require unrealistic correlation values and can occur in populations with just a few neurons. The study also found that heterogeneity in activity is beneficial and that both error suppression and enhancement depend on a specific pattern of correlation. Tuning one or several parameters can lead to perfect coding, where the pattern of positive correlation leads to a "locking" of probabilities that eliminates variability in the space relevant for stimulus discrimination.
Researchers have developed a new vaccine against cholera, a severe diarrheal disease caused by Vibrio cholera, by combining the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of Vibrio cholera O1 Inaba strain with a recombinant fragment of tetanus toxin heavy chain (rTHC). This conjugate vaccine, called OSP:rTH, was tested in mice to assess its ability to induce immune responses and protect against cholera. The study found that mice immunized with OSP:rTH developed antibodies against OSP and tetanus toxin, as well as vibriidal antibodies and memory cell responses after intramuscular or intradermal vaccination. Intestinal IgA responses targeting OSP occurred after intradermal vaccination. Results showed comparable immune responses in mice immunized with different vaccine variations, although memory and vibri responses were lower in mice receiving the highest dose. Administration of OSPTH resulted in 55% protection in a mouse cholera challenge model. The study reports development of an Inaba:rTH conjugate vaccine that induces responses and protection against cholera in mice. An effective cholera conjugate vaccine that induces high and long-term responses against OSP would be beneficial, especially in children who poorly respond to polyschar antigens.
A study was conducted to investigate the cross-reactivity of immunochromatographic test (ICT) cards in areas with contrasting endemicity of Loa loa and Mansonella perans in Cameroon. The study assessed the prevalence and intensity of Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Mansonella perans in 42 villages across three regions of the Cameroon rainforest domain. Blood samples were collected for detection of circulating filarial antigen by ICT and assessment of microfilaria using thick smear. Clinical manifestations of lymphatic filariasis were also assessed. Overall, 219 individuals participated, with 24 testing positive by ICT, ranging from 0% in South-west to 2.1% in North. Lymphedema was diagnosed in 20 individuals, with majority in North, none tested positive by ICT. No microf W. bancfti found in blood of individuals with positive ICT or lymphedema. Positive ICT associated with high Loa microf intensity, 21 with over 8,000 Loa/ml blood (odds ratio 15.4; 95%CI 6.1-39.0; p<0.001). Strong association observed between Loa prevalence and ICT area (Spearman rho 0.900; p0.037). No association between ICT and perans prevalence (Spearman -0.200; p0.747) and microf (odds 1.8;95CI0.8-4.2; p0.192). The study confirmed association between ICT and Loa intensity and demonstrated ICT strongly associated with high Lo prevalence. Results suggest main confounding factor for positive test results are high Lo levels. Findings indicate W bancft less prevalent in Central region than previously assumed, accurate re-mapping useful for shrinking LF distribution map.
Researchers have studied how the SARS-CoV virus replicates in host cells and found that it uses a network of modified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes to support its replication. This network includes double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes that are not previously thought to be involved in RNA synthesis. The study used electron tomography to image infected cells at high resolution and found that DMVs are not isolated vesicles but part of a reticuloves network of ER membranes. The convol membranes were mainly labeled with viral replicase subunits, while double-stranded RNA, likely the site of RNA synthesis, was found in the DM interior. The study raises questions about how DMs form and where SARSV RNA is synthesized. The virus reorganizes host membranes into a network to replicate and possibly hide from antiviral mechanisms.
Researchers have investigated the role of suberin, a chemical compound found in plant roots, in regulating water and nutrient uptake from the soil. They used a genetically modified Arabidopsis plant, es1, with increased suberin levels, to study its effects on water and nutrient transport. Results showed reduced transpiration rates and increased water efficiency during growth, and changes in nutrient accumulation in the shoot, including increased sodium, sulfur, selenium, and molybdenum, and decreased calcium and manganese. This suggests suberin acts as a barrier controlling water and ion transport to the leaves. The study provides direct evidence that suberin plays a critical role in regulating water and nutrient uptake.
Researchers investigated the kinetics of rhodopsin deactivation and its role in regulating the reproducibility of the single photon response (SPR) in vertebrate phototransduction. They used a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CT) model based on the biochemistry of rhodin activation and deactivation, interfaced with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction. The model reproduced both wild-type (WT) and mutant responses in mice with variable numbers of phosphorylation sites. The sources of variability were dissected into components, revealing that only the randomness of sojourn times in each phosphorylated state contributed to the coefficient of variation (CV) of the response, while the randomness of number of R*off steps had a negligible effect. This contradicts the view that more decay steps of R* lead to a more stable photoresponse. Results indicate R* shutoff is responsible for variability, while diffusion of second messengers acts as a suppressor. 

The biochemistry of rhodin deactivation was put into a stochastic framework, reproducing SPR in WT and mutant mice, capable of analyzing randomness each phosphorylation state. This was interfaced with a spatio-temp model, tracking diffusion of messengers and geometrical changes on photoresponse. The prevailing view is that activation causes variability, deactivation suppresses, and more decay steps lead to stability, was expressed in mice with 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6 phosphorylation sites. However, analysis had inconsistencies Mechanistically, probability of RK dissociation increases with phosphates, reaching 1 when all sites are phosphorylated, consistent with in vivo observations. Initial deactivation is attributable to phosphorylation, preserved in arrest knockout mice, while later deactivation is abated. Deactivation of one or several phosphorylation sites can be simulated, mutant rhodins bearing fewer sites generate extended SPRs.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical framework to analyze stochastic reaction networks in cells that are affected by external factors, such as fluctuations in ribosome numbers or chemical concentrations. These external factors can make it difficult to model and analyze the networks. The new framework separates the network from its environment by incorporating the environment's effect into a new model. This allows for the marginalization of fluctuating external components, such as chemical species, to obtain a decoupled model. The decoupled model's process and master equations are derived, and stochastic simulations can be performed. Case studies demonstrate the significance of the approach.

The goal is to create a self-contained model that summarizes all behaviors under possible external fluctuations. This model can be used for uncoupled analysis of a network subject to external noise. The provided answer is marginalizing the system with respect to external fluctuations.

There is evidence that biochemical networks need to account for intrinsic and extrinsic noise caused by intracellular variations. Recent studies extend the model's state by environmental species, whose dynamics are described with the system. The decoupled dynamics provide a tool to study stochasticity in reaction networks. Environmental noise splits into two terms: suppressed and effective noise sensed by the network.

The decou process can reduce computational effort in Monte Carlo simulations, especially if the network is costly. This highlights the framework as a tool to split biochemical networks into parts that are easier to simulate.

A stochastic network is described by a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) with species and channels. The state is denoted and its path on intervals.
Researchers have developed a new brain-machine interface (BMI) system that allows people to control devices with their thoughts at a faster and more precise scale than current systems. The system uses two main components: an infinite-hor feedback model of the brain's behavior and a point model of neural spikes. The feedback model infers the user's motor intention and is used for training and adaptation. The point model enables processing and adaptation with every spike, unlike current systems that adapt in batches. Experiments in a non-human primates showed improved performance with the new system compared to current methods. Spike-based adaptation was faster and more consistent than batch-based and robust to initial conditions. The system also controlled tasks beyond those used for training. This has implications for developing clinically viable neuroprosthetics.
Researchers investigated how the retina processes stimuli with varying levels of structure and correlation. They presented natural and artificial stimuli to populations of retinal ganglion cells and recorded their responses. The results showed that ganglion cells responded more to spatio-temporally structured stimuli, such as movies, than to white noise, but less than predicted by a non-adaptive model. Cells responding to spatially correlated stimuli showed correlations consistent with a non-ad receptive field and nonlinearity. Temporally correlated gang cells had faster kernels and stronger surrounds, which explained correlations across receptive field measurements. The retina reduced redundancies in spatio-temporally correlated stimuli but not completely decorrelated. Output correlations were lower than predicted by a non-ad model, similar to responses to white noise. The study found moderate correlations across a range of stimuli, from noise to movies, with changes less than predicted by a non-ad model. Experiments presented stimuli with varying spatial and temporal correlations, the retina never fully decorrelated input, with some correlations present even in least correlated stimuli. Results recall previous studies on LGN and cortex structure with natural versus random stimuli. Gain of ganglion cells responding to correlated stimuli changed with effective contrast, the standard deviation of input in a linear-non model. The retina may adjust coding strategy to represent stimuli efficiently.
Researchers have developed an integrative multi-network and multi-classifier approach to predict genetic interactions, specifically synthetic lethality, in yeast. Synthetic lethality occurs when a combination of mutations results in a surprising phenotype, capturing functional redundancy and important for understanding protein complexes, pathways, and disease mechanisms. Due to the large number of possible gene pairs, only a small proportion have been tested for interactions. The new approach improves upon existing methods by defining features from various data sources, independent of known interactions, and using a non-parametric multi-classifier for simultaneous classification. Experiments showed improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art method. The approach was used to derive a yeast transcription factor genetic network, supported by literature, and predict interactions between non-essential gene pairs. This method is expected to uncover new interactions in yeast and higher organisms like mouse and human, where few have been identified.
The BRCA Challenge is a long-term data-sharing project initiated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GAH) to aggregate BRCA1 and BRCA data to support collaborative research. The goal is to generate an informed understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk across the predisposition genes BR1 and BR2. Initially, reported variants in BR1 and BR2 from public databases were integrated into a single site, www.brca.org. The BR Exchange aims to provide a reliable and accessible record of interpreted variants for high-pen phenotype. Over 20,000 variants have been aggregated, three times the number in the largest public database at the project's outset, with approximately 7,250 classifications. The data is based on information from clinical databases, such as the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC), ClinVar, and Leiden Variation (LOV), as well as population databases linked to a single access. The BR Challenge brought together the international Evidence Network for Interpretation of Genetic Mutant Alleles (ENIG) expert panel, clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and providers to advance understanding BR1 and BR2 variation. Ongoing work includes contact with centers to access BR1 and BR2 data, development of methods for extraction, and engagement with communities to understand clinical significance.
Malaria, caused by the Plasmodium parasite, remains a significant threat to human health, resulting in approximately one million deaths annually. To cope with oxidative stress and maintain redox balance, Plasium relies on an adequate redox system. Researchers have mapped the subcellular localization of major antioxidant and redox proteins in Plasium falcum, providing the first complete redox compartment map. Two Plasium peroxiredoxins and a putative glyoxal system are targeted to the apoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid. The compartmentation of thiorexin and glutaredin-like proteins is also described. Notably, Plium uses alternative translation initiation (ATI) to target two major antioxidant enzymes, glutathione reductase and thioreductase, to different subcellular locations. This dual localization by ATI may occur in other Apicomplex and offers new therapeutic avenues.

The study provides the first comprehensive subcellular compartment of red metabolism in malaria. The apoplast, a non-photosynthetic plast of Plium, harbors plant-like metabolic pathways, including fatty acid and hem biosynthesis. Until now, antioxidative capacity of the apoplast was unknown. Two major antioxidants, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, are absent in the parasite. This offers potential for chemotherapeutic agents disrupting redox balance in Plium. Many redox enzymes contain targeting sequences, but localization has not been demonstrated due to intra and extracellular environments, high metabolic rate, intraparas digestion, and host immune system ROS. Plium has two NAD-dependent red systems with broad antioxidant mechanisms. The study maps Pl red system, understanding cellular functions and interactions, and demonstrates ATI in Applex, translating isoforms with subcell localization from gene.
Researchers studied the role of electrostatic interactions in the binding of a protein called PUM to its partner Mcl-1. PUM is an intrinsically disordered protein, meaning it doesn't have a fixed shape, and folds into an alpha helix when binding to M-1. They used a computer model to simulate the binding process and found that electrostatic interactions, particularly non-native ones, play a key role in forming the initial complex. The model was tested against experimental data and shown to be consistent with previous findings on how binding rates change with ionic strength. The study suggests that intramolecular electrostatic interactions have little effect on PUM's unbound state, but intermolecular electrostatic interactions, including non-native ones, are involved in the initial complex formation. The research highlights the importance of electrostatic interactions in binding of intrinsically disordered proteins and could be used to predict results of mutational studies.
Researchers studied the distribution and movement of Polycomb (Pc) proteins, which play a crucial role in silencing gene expression during development, in fruit fly embryos. They used a combination of techniques to analyze the formation and movement of Polycomb bodies, which contain silenced genes, and compared it to condensed chromatin. The study found that Poly bodies correspond to 3D structures of genomic domains identified in genome-wide studies. During early embryogenesis, Poly and Polyhomeotic (Ph) proteins accumulate in Poly bodies, which form on distinct chromatin domains with histone H3-methylated on K27. Time-lapse analysis showed two types of motion: long-range movement of Poly bodies and chromatin domains, and fast, constrained motion of individual Poly bodies and chromatin. Both types move within smaller volumes than chromosome territories, limiting interaction with other nuclear structures. Fast motion decreases in late developmental stages, suggesting chromatin dynamics in gene silencing maintenance.
Researchers used ultra-deep sequencing to study mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in mice that age normally and prematurely. They found that mice with a proofreading-deficient mtDNA polymerase, called mt mutator, had 10 times more mutations than their normal siblings. These mice also had more linear mtDNA fragments and less sequence coverage in deleted regions. In contrast, circular deletions were rare in mtator mice and not the cause of premature aging. Sequence analysis showed most mutations in mtator and normal mice came from their mothers, indicating germline transmission. No increase in mutations or deletions were found in normal mice with age, questioning their role in aging. Oxidative damage was not a major cause of mt mutations. The study suggests most mt mutations occur during development, not in adult life.
Researchers have discovered a new type of sodium-driven ATP synthase membrane motor in the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum, which uses glutamate decarboxylation to generate a transmembrane gradient of sodium ions. They found that this ionotive force is directly coupled to ATP synthesis via an F1-ATP synthase with a novel sodium recognition motif shared by other human pathogens. Molecular modeling and free energy simulations of the rotary element of the enzyme, the c-ring, indicate sodium specificity in physiological settings. Consistently, activity measurements showed sodium stimulation of the enzyme, either membrane-embedded or isolated, and ATP synthesis was sensitive to sodium ionophore monens. Furthermore, sodium has a protective effect against inhibitors targeting ion-binding sites in both the ATPase and c-ring. Definitive evidence of sodium coupling is provided by identical structures of the c-ring solved by X-ray crystallography at 2.2 and 2.6 resolution at pH 5.3 and 8.7, respectively. Sodium ions occupy binding sites, each coordinated by four amino acids and a water. Intriguingly, two carboxylates instead mediate ion binding. Simulations and experiments demonstrate this implies a proton is bound to all sites, although sodium alone drives the rotary mechanism. The structure reveals a new mode of ion coupling in ATPases and provides a basis for drug efforts against opportunistic pathogen.
Researchers studied how the interaction between T cells and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells affects the immune response to foreign substances. They found that in a living organisms, optimal immune responses occur when the interaction between T cells and MHC is not too strong or too weak, but rather intermediate. This is in contrast to previous studies in a lab settings where stronger interactions were thought to lead to better immune responses. The team tracked the activation of CD4 T cells in response to various peptides with different levels of interaction with MHC and found that those with the strongest interaction led to weaker immune responses. This was due to reduced signaling, expansion, and function of the cells over time. The study highlights the importance of considering the interaction between T cells and M in the design of vaccines to elicit effective immune responses.
The fungus Nect haematocca, also known as Fusarium solani, is a member of a group of over 50 species known as the Fusarium solani complex. This group has diverse properties, including the ability to cause disease in over 100 plant genera and opportunistic infections in humans. Research on the most studied member of this group, N haematocca mating population VI (MP), found that genes controlling its ability to colonize specific habitats are located on supernumerary chromosomes. Optical mapping revealed that this isolate has 17 chromosomes ranging from 530 kb to 6.52 Mb, with a physical genome size of 54.43 Mb and 15,707 predicted genes, the largest for ascomycetes. Two classes of genes contributed to expansion: those not found in other fungi, including its relative Fusarium gramineum, and those commonly single in other fungi but multiple in N. haematocca MP. Supernary chromosomes 14, 15, and 17 were confirmed absent in pulsed gel electrophoresis experiments, lacking chromosome-specific sequences on their ends. These contain more repeat sequences, unique and duplicated genes, and lower G+C content than other chromosomes. The origin of extra genes and supernary chromosomes is unknown, but expansion and size consistent with species' diverse habitats. Unique genes on supernary might account for isolates having different niches.
Researchers have developed a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method to study the final stages of herpesvirus egress, the process by which herpesviruses exit infected cells. The method uses total internal reflection (TIR) microscopy to image virus particles near the plasma membrane and a pH-sensitive probe to visualize the exact moment of exocytosis. Single-particle tracking and mean displacement analysis were used to characterize particle motion, and a panel of proteins were imaged to identify those spatially and dynamically associated with exytosis. Results show that virus particles travel to the plasma membrane inside acidified secretory vesicles, containing Rab GTPases Rab6, Rab8, and Rab11, regulators of the plasma-directed secretory pathway. These vesicles undergo fast directional transport to the site of exyt, frequently near patches of LLβ, a complex anchoring microtubules to the plasma. Vesicles are docked at the site of exyt for seconds before membrane fusion, displacing the virion across the plasma. After exyt, particles remain confined on the outer surface. This study contradicts previous research that observed membrane invaginations containing virus, inferring sites of egress. Instead, particles are confined at the membrane before and after exyt, with sharp movement after pH change. The study identifies Rab proteins spatially and dynamically associated with exyt and rules out cytoskeleton-depleted exyt sites.
Researchers investigated the impact of Enterobius vermicularis infection and mebendazole treatment on the intestinal microbiota and immune response in 109 primary school children in Taiwan. The study found that Enterobias increased gut diversity, which peaked after mebendazole treatment. At the phylum level, pinworm and meendazole were associated with decreased Fusobacteria and increased Actinobacteria. The relative abundance of probiotic Bifobacterium increased after enterobias and meend treatment. Intestinal SIg levels were lower in the pin-infected group and elevated in the meend-treated group. A higher pre-treatment Salmonella proportion was linked to increased SIg after meend dewing. The study suggests that exposure to pin and meend is associated with increased bacterial diversity, Actinob, and probiotic Bifobacterium, and decreased Fusob. Intestinal SI levels were lower in pin-inf and increased in meend-treated. 

The study's findings are consistent with previous research on helmin-infected microbiota, showing increased bacterial diversity. Further studies are needed to evaluate if pin and meend alter commensal metabolism and influence the host immune system. The change in microbial composition after meend in pin-inf children may be confounded by late effects of enterias. More experiments, including animal studies, are required to understand relationships between pin, microbiota, and immune responses. The immunomodulatory effect of pin may depend on interaction with individual microbiota.
Researchers studied the genetics of root length in Arabidopsis thalian, a plant species, and found that most of the genetic variation in root length was not due to individual genes acting alone, but rather to interactions between genes. This is known as epistasis, where two or more genes work together to affect a trait. They used a method called genome-wide association analysis to identify genes involved in root length and found four pairs of interacting genes that together explained a large part of the variation in root length. However, these pairs were not detected in a standard analysis that only looked at individual genes. The researchers estimated that half of these pairs were true associations, and experiments confirmed that four of the genes affected root development. This study shows that epasis is important for understanding genetic variation in complex traits and that standard methods should account for both additive and non-additive genetic variance to detect contributing genes. The narrow heritability, a measure of genetic variation, for root was low because epasis cancelled out the effect of individual genes, making them undetectable in standard analysis. This contrasts the common view that most genetic variation is additive. The study highlights the importance of considering epasis in genetics and using methods that account for both additive and non-additive variance to identify contributing genes.
Researchers analyzed a large dataset of 30,506 mitochondrial DNA (mt) sequences from around the world to understand how inherited mt mutations contribute to disease. They found that the likelihood of disease-causing mt mutations varies between different mt haplogroups, which are groups of related DNA sequences. Some disease-causing mutations occurred in multiple haplog backgrounds, while others were specific to certain groups. The study suggests that mt background influences the likelihood of acquiring or retaining disease-causing mutations, with some mutations more common in younger sequences and those with two or more disease-causing mutations than expected by chance. This implies that mt background has played a role in purifying selection in older populations, explaining low disease frequency in specific ethnic groups. The researchers also found that disease-causing mutations in major haplog were 6 times lower than expected, and that 43% of recurrent-causing mutations clustered by haplog. This indicates that some disease-causing mutations may be rare haplog markers, not directly pathogenic. The study's dataset is representative of global populations, not enriched with rare variants or pathogenic mutations from patients with mitochondrial diseases.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study how cells interact and move together in groups, a process known as collective motility, which is crucial in cancer, embryonic development, and wound healing. To understand these interactions, they used microped substrates that restrict cells to move in one direction, leading to frequent collisions between polarized cells. The model includes cell shape mechanics and a minimal chemical model for contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), a process where cells stop moving when in contact. It reproduces all possible outcomes of cell collisions: reversing, sticking, or walking past each other. A balance between cell polarization, IL, and adhesion governs the outcome. Parameters such as adhesion strength, propulsion, and IL rates control transitions between outcomes, suggesting why different cell types behave differently and how interventions affect collisions. The model also reproduces heterogeneity in neural crest cell collisions by tuning parameters or assuming cell-to-cell variation in adhesion.
Researchers have studied the mechanism of thioredoxin (Tr) disulfide dissociation, a process that has been debated for over 20 years. They used the complex between Tr and its substrate arsenate reductase (Ars) as a model. In this complex, a disulfide is formed by the nucleophilic attack of CysTr on CysArs. Theoretical analysis, molecular simulations, and biochemical experiments with mutants were used to study disulf dissociation. Conformation changes around the disulf bring Cys in contact with Cys, activating it for nucleophil attack. Cys is more reactive than CysArs. C directs nucleophil attack on C, not CysArs. This approach provides insights into universal thiol/disulf exchange mechanism in reduced and oxidized Tr.
People's preferences are not fixed and can be influenced by the preferences of others, even if there is no reward for conformity. Researchers hypothesized that people are uncertain about their own tastes and can learn about them by considering others' preferences and updating their beliefs. A study of 14-24 year olds examined discounting behavior, including variability before and after observing others' choices, found evidence for taste uncertainty and Bayesian updating. Participants' decision variability was better accounted for by a random taste model than a response noise model, and taste shifts were described by a Bayesian model taking into account uncertainty and social information. 

The study modelled subjects as uncertain about their tastes, reflected in choices before learning others' preferences, and captured in the taste-uncertainty (K) model, assuming subjects updated a distribution and sampled to make a choice. The premise is subjects are uncertain about taste, not beliefs given tastes. Uncertainty in absence of social influence is a basis for preference shift. 

The paradigm of discounting modelled learning from others' preferences to form one's own, tested in a study of 700 young people. The presence of social information Bayesian updates beliefs, better fit the K model, dependence of preference-shift on variability and decrease in taste with age, suggesting variability reflects taste rather than noise. Uncertainty does not necessitate variability, people might estimate own taste by samples and act on it.
Researchers studied how different signaling pathways in yeast converge to regulate a complex response called filamentous growth, which occurs under specific environmental conditions. They used a novel approach called secretion profiling to measure the release of a protein called Ms2, which functions at the head of the filament growth pathway. The study found that many pathways that regulate filament growth, such as AS, R101, O1, and RT, were also required for the pathway's activation, making it more sensitive to stimuli and synchronized with the global network. Several regulators were needed for Ms2 expression, identifying it as a "hub" where signals converge. Accessibility to the Ms2 promoter was regulated by a protein called HDAC R3, which positively regulated the pathway and growth. The findings show a regulatory hierarchy among pathways controlling filament growth, suggesting systems integration of circuitry coordinates other networks controlling complex behaviors.
Researchers studied the evolution of fruiting body morphology in filamentous fungi, specifically in the Sordomycetes, to understand how changes in gene expression contribute to divergent morphologies. They cultured five species in a common environment and profiled genome-wide gene expression at five developmental stages, reconstructing ancestral expression phenotypes and identifying genes with the largest increases in expression. Knockout and phenotypic analysis in two divergent species showed altered fruiting development in species with increased expression. This approach proved more efficient than targeting whole genome or gene families. Combining gene measurements with phenotypes refined Bayesian networks of fruit body regulation, a complex process in multicellular development.

Fruiting bodies in Sordycetes show few genes retain common expression or phenotypes, yet numerous retain function in the process. Stages are morphologically comparable, making it an ideal system for analyzing evolutionary questions: common and divergent sources of homolog phenotypes and how novelty arises despite constraints. Neurospora and Fus spp. revealed key genes in sexual development and regulation using systematic comparison and contrast of expression across taxa. Mapping variational properties with processes is critical to understanding why evolution occurs.

Bayesian networks based on wild type measurements are hypothetical until verified by functional studies. Combining with phenotypes builds relationships among genes to morphological processes and their evolution. Estimation in ancestral lineages identifies changes in expression key to morphological innovation. If phenotypes depend on expression, changes should map to regulation.
Researchers investigated the use of electroporation to introduce transgenes and macromolecules into Schistosome eggs, a developmental stage with a high ratio of germ to somatic cells, allowing for potential propagation and amplification of transgenes in infected snails from hatched eggs. Eggs were incubated in Cy-labeled siRNA with and without electrop, showing Cy-signs detected by fluorescence in eggs and miria hatched from treated. Electrop was employed to introduce mRNA encoding firefly luciferase into eggs, with lucifer activity detected three hours later, not evident in soaked eggs. Schist eggs were exposed to Moloney leukemia virus pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein, proviruses detected by PCR in genomic from miria hatched vir-exposed, indicating trans in larval schosomes. Quantitative PCR showed electrop resulted in 2-3 times copies of provirus in schosomes compared to soaking. Electrop was more effective for transduction of eggs with pseudyped ML than soaking alone.
Researchers have developed a new approach called the Perturbation Markovian Transmission (PM) model to study the dynamic behavior of large macromolecular assemblies, which are crucial for various biological processes in cells. These assemblies communicate with each other through allosteric interactions, playing key roles in cellular signaling. Previous studies on topology and fluctuation dynamics of coarse-grained residue networks provided insights, but not time-dependent behavior of macrom assemblies. The PM model monitors responses of over 8,000 residues across 6 decades from perturbation to equilibrium using Klov subspace projection, yielding rich information. Criteria of relaxation time, flow, amplitude, and oscillation dynamics identify important residues for movement, signaling, and binding. Analysis of the Gro-Gro chaperone system showed 71-84% accuracy with experimental studies. This approach is general and can be applied to other machineries like capsid and ribosomal complex.
Researchers investigated the role of fungal galectins, a type of carbohydrate-binding proteins found in fungi, in the defense against predators. They used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism and fed it with a galectin from the mushroom Coprinus cinerea, CGL2. The results showed that C2 inhibited the development and reproduction of C elegans, ultimately leading to its death. The study found that the toxicity of C2 depended on its interaction with a fucose-containing glycojugate on the nemat's surface. A screen for C2-resistant mutants identified the glycojugate as a Gal1,4Fuc1,6 modification of the nem's N-gly core. Analysis of Nly structures in wild and C2-resistant nematodes confirmed this and identified a putative glycosylase required for its biosynthesis. The crystal structure of C2 and Gal1,4uc,6Glc at 1.5 resolution revealed the basis for this interaction. The study suggests fungal galectins play a role in defense against predators by binding specific glycojugates of these organisms.
A long-lived reservoir of latently infected CD4 T cells is a major barrier to curing HIV and has been extensively studied, but its effect on the virus's evolutionary dynamics has received little attention. Researchers developed a within-host quasis model that incorporates a long-lived reservoir and nested it into an epidemiological model of HIV dynamics. For biologically plausible values, they found that the presence of a reservoir severely delays within-host evolutionary dynamics, with longer delays associated with larger reservoir sizes and homeostatic proliferation of cells within the reservoir. This delay can change the virus's dynamics at the epidemiological scale. The within-host delay can be sufficient for the virus to evolve intermediate loads consistent with maximising transmission, observed, not the high loads previous models predicted. This effect can be enhanced if viruses similar to those initiating infection are preferentially transmitted. Results depend on within characteristics, such as reservoir size, with evolution observed only when dynamics are sufficiently delayed. The reservoir has an underappreciated role in both within and between-host evolution. 

The presence of a latent reservoir affects HIV's evolutionary dynamics within individuals and at the population level. Surprisingly, it causes a significant delay in the within-host process. If within evolution is sufficiently delayed, the virus can evolve intermediate levels of virulence optimising transmission at the population level. Models show that latently infected cells impact the virus's evolution. The reservoir plays a role in determining the within evolutionary rate and outcome at the population level of virulence. The transmission of ancestral strains could explain lower rates observed at the epidemi scale compared to individuals, and the high heritability of viral load despite within transmission events. A quasis model of within evolutionary dynamics incorporates a latently infected reservoir. Data support the hypothesis that a large reservoir delays within dynamics, but caution is needed due to other factors, such as APOEC mutations. The number of latently cells containing provirus in patients is a challenge. Delays caused by the reservoir have a large impact on the virus at epidemi, and under conditions, be enough to evolve towards levels maximising transmission.
Researchers studied how the Coxsackievirus B3 (CV3) virus evades the host immune system by inhibiting antigen presentation to T cells. They used transgenic CD4 and CD8 T cells as sensors to evaluate in vitro and in vivo antigen presentation by CV3 and found that the virus almost completely inhibits presentation via the MHC I class pathway, evading CD8 T cell immunity. In contrast, presentation of CV3-encoded MHC II epitopes is relatively unaffected and CV3 induces in vivo CD4 T responses that are phenotypically normal. These cells display an effector phenotype and mature into multi-functional CV3-specific CD4 T cells that expand following infection and differentiate into secondary effector cells capable of secreting multiple cytokines. The findings have implications for the efficiency of antigen presentation during Coxsievirus infection. 

The study used epitope-specific transgenic CD4 and CD8 T cells with recombinant CV3 to evaluate CV-specific T responses and assess the virus' ability to inhibit MHC I and II presentation in vitro and in vivo. They found CV3 induces no detectable primary CD8 T response. The researchers attempted to identify the reason for weak responses and used transgenic cells to assess presentation by CV3 in vivo. Their approach allowed evaluating the virus' effects on M I and II antigen presentation. The goal was to evaluate CD4 and CD T responses, and M I II presentation by CV3 in vivo. They constructed recombinant CV that encode characterized CD8 and CD T epitopes from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCV). Using transgenic cells as sensors in vitro in vivo presentation, they conclude CV3 profoundly inhibits M I presentation, explaining the weakness of primary CD T response. In contrast, II presentation is relatively uninterrupted and CV3 induces primary and memory CD T responses.
A randomized double-blind trial was conducted to compare the effectiveness of high-dose intravenous methylprednisone and oral prednisone versus intravenous saline and oral prednisone in individuals with leprosy Type 1 reactions and nerve function impairment. Forty-two individuals were randomly assigned to receive methylprednisone followed by predone (n=20) or predone alone (n=22). There were no significant differences in the rate of adverse events or improvement at the end of the study. However, individuals treated with methylprednis were less likely to experience deterioration in function between day 29 and 113 than those treated with predone. The study also found that 50% of individuals with Type 1 reactions and nerve impairment required additional predone despite 16 weeks of corticosteroids. This supports the use of prolonged corticosteroid treatment for Type 1 reactions and investigation of factors for recurrence during corticoid treatment.
Researchers investigated the role of regulatory T cells (Treg) in modulating CD8 T cell responses in chronic HIV infection. They found that Treg from HIV-infected patients (T/HIV+) did not inhibit polyclonal autologous CD8 T function, suggesting a defect in suppressive capacity or lack of sensitivity of effector T cells. However, T/H+ inhibited IFNγ expression of autologous CD8 T stimulated with CMV/EBV/Flu (CEF) antigens, but not HIV-specific CD8 T. Cross cultures showed T/H- inhibited differentiation of CEF or HIV-specific CD8 T from infected patients. PD-1 and PD-L expression was higher on HIV-specific CD8 T compared to CEF CD8 T, and did not change after T depletion or co-culture with T/H-, unlike C-specific CD8 T. A defect in T/H modulating differentiation and PD-1/P-L on HIV CD8 cells was observed. Results suggest this defect contributes to exhaustion of HIV-specific T responses. T/H suppressed differentiation of effector-memory CD8 T in HIV-infected patients, with HIV CD8 T less sensitive to suppressive effects compared to recall-specific CD T. HIV-specific effector CD T were resistant to T-mediated modulation of PD-1/P-L. T from HIV donors with controlled viral load inhibited differentiation of naïve CD T into CCR- CDRA-EM cells and favored accumulation of cells with CM CDRA+CCR+ phenotype. In chronic infection, T exert subset-specific inhibitory effects on CD T. Failure to contain HIV-associated activation is due to impairment of T function and responsiveness of effector clones, associated with high PD-1/P-L levels.
Researchers investigated the potential of Wuchereria bancrofti glutathione-transferase (GST) as a vaccine candidate for lymphatic filariasis. They cloned the GST gene from the third larval stage of W. bancroft and expressed and purified the recombinant protein. Serum samples from individuals living in an endemic area showed significant levels of anti-WGST IgG antibodies compared to those who were microfilaremic or had clinical symptoms. Isotype analysis revealed a predominance of IgG and Ig3 antibodies in endemic individuals. The recombinant GST retained enzymatic activity and antibodies from endemic sera inhibited this activity. Similar results were obtained with anti-GST antibodies raised in mice in a neutralization assay. Brugia mal GST and WGST showed significant similarity. To evaluate vaccine potential, B. mal was used as a challenge. The recombinant GST provided approximately 61% protection against B. mal infection in immunized jirds. The study suggests recombin GST is a potential vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis.
Researchers investigated the potential off-target effects of CRISPR-C9 gene editing in mice using whole-genome sequencing of 8 parents and 19 embryos, 10 of which were genetically modified with well-characterized guide RNAs targeting the tyrosinase (Tyr) locus. The study aimed to determine if CRIS-C9 mutagenesis caused single nucleotide variations (SNVs) or insertions/deletions (indels) in embryos, which could be distinguishable from de novo mutations (DNMs) occurring due to other processes. The results showed that if CR-C9 mutagenesis caused SNVs or indels in embryos, the number of these mutations was not statistically different from the rate of DNMs occurring due to other processes. This suggests that CR-C9 mutagenesis under the described conditions did not introduce significant off-target mutations. The study used a trio design, sequencing parents and offspring, to distinguish generational or colony differences from true DNMs. This work supports the development of CR-C9 as a therapeutic tool. The study compared data to MiSeq from 324 mice mutated with Tyr2 gRNA, showing good concordance of targeting and mosaicism.
Researchers have identified two proteins, Hypersensitive to Red 1 (HR1) and Phosphatase 7 (PP), that play a crucial role in controlling the opening and closing of stomatal pores on plant leaves. Stomatal pores regulate carbon dioxide uptake for photosynthesis and water loss through transpiration, affecting photosynthesis efficiency and crop yields. Blue light is a key environmental signal that regulates stomatal opening, perceived by blue/UV light-absorbing cryptochromes phototropins. The study found that mutations in HR1 or PP lead to misregulation of stomatal aperture and reduced water loss under blue light. Both HR1 and PP are expressed in guard cells in response to light-dark or dark-light transition. HR1 interacts with PP through its N-terminal zinc finger motif and requires PP for stomatal response. HR1 is phosphorylated in vivo and PP dephosphylates HR1. In the dark, HR1 is dephosphylated in a 193kDa complex, while light increases to 285Da. In PP mutant, this shift is impaired and HR is predominantly phosphorylated. The study proposes that HR modification by PP under light is essential for proper conformation and assembly of HR complex.
A Mediator subunit MDT-15 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to ingested materials in Caenorhabditis elegans. It interacts with transcription factors such as NHR-49 and SBP-1 to control metabolic pathways, including fatty acid metabolism and detoxification. Depletion of MDT-15 or mutation of the mdt-15 gene impairs induction of detoxification genes in response to xenobiotics and heavy metals, rendering worms hypersensitive to toxins. M-15 selectively affects stress responses related to ingestion, as defects do not abrogate other stress responses like thermotolerance. M-15 integrates transcriptional pathways to monitor availability and quality of ingested materials, including nutrients and xenobiotics. Expression arrays show M-15 targets genes involved in detoxification and metabolism, interacting with N-49 and SB-1. M-15 also integrates transcription response to environmental stressors like xeniotics and metals with different regulatory factors. Previous studies found M-15 impacts fatty acid metabolism in N-49 and SB-1-dependent ways, and conveys regulation of fatty desaturases by SB-1, an ortholog of mammalian sterol regulatory binding proteins. M- affects energy genes responding to food supply and detox genes to contaminants. Several M- targets are affected by mutations altering life span, and stress is linked to life extension in C. elegans. M- is part of a system coordinating adaptation to ingestion stress, ensuring health and longevity.
Researchers investigated how the hippocampus, a brain region responsible for creating mental maps of the environment, encodes spatial information. They hypothesized that the pattern of neuronal firing, particularly co-firing, is key to decoding spatial information and since coiring implies spatial overlap of place fields, a map by coiring will be based on connectivity and adjacency, a topological. They tested this hypothesis with a model of hippocampal activity varying parameters (firing rate, place size, number) in simulations of rat trajectories in topologically and geometrically distinct environments. Using computational tools from algebraic topology, they found that patterns of coiring convey topological information in biologically realistic time. Simulations revealed a "learning" region highlighting interplay between parameters producing hippocamp states more or less adept at map formation. For example, lower neurons can be compensated by adjustments rate or field, but beyond point formation fails. They propose this region provides a theoretical lens to view conditions impairing spatial by altering cell rates or specificity.
Researchers have investigated the process of how the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is secreted from infected cells. They used a technique called RNA interference (RNAi) to identify the host genes required for HCV secretion and combined it with live cell imaging to track the movement of HCV's core protein. The study found that HCV is enveloped at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and exits the cell through the secretory pathway. Multiple components of the secretory pathway were identified, including ER to Golgi trafficking, lipid and protein kinases that regulate budding from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), VAMP vesicles and proteins, and recycling endosomes. The results support a model where HCV is enveloped at ER and exits the cell via secretory pathway. A tagged HCV was created to track the dynamics of H core in association with cellular cofactors. Only trafficking events required for essential H assembly factor NS2 were quantified. Core moved to the periphery along microtubules and was inhibited by nocodazole. Subpopulations localized to Gol and co-trafficked with recycling endosome components. Silencing recycling component Rab11 resulted in accumulation of H at Gol. Majority trafficked with apolipoprotein (Apo) and VAMP vesicles. This study identified new cofactors for H egress and dynamic studies of core in infected cells.
Research has identified a link between the loss of a specific gene called Grb10 and the formation of tumors in mice with a genetic mutation in the Neurofibromatosis tumor suppressor gene (NF1). Gr10 is an imprinted gene, meaning it is expressed from only one parent and loss of the expressed allele leads to complete loss of protein. Analysis of tumor cells from mice with NF1 mutation found Gr10 expression was absent, and further analysis showed the expressed allele was commonly lost in NF mutant tumors. Studies tested whether restoring or losing Gr10 altered tumor growth features. Restoring Gr10 in NF mutant tumors decreased proliferation, colony formation, and downregulated Ras signaling. Conversely, silencing Gr10 in normal cells increased proliferation and Ras-G levels. Expression of a constitutively active MEK rescued cells from Gr10 reduction in colony formation. These results show Gr10 loss can occur in tumorigenesis with consequences in normal cells. In tumors, Gr10 loss promotes Ras hyperactivation, a feature of tumor development. In a NF mutant mouse model, this work identifies a role for an imprinted gene in tumenesis.
Researchers investigated how humans learn to predict threats from environmental cues, a fundamental skill found in many species, through Pavlovian fear conditioning. This process involves associating neutral cues (conditioned stimuli) with aversive events (unconditioned stimuli). Despite many studies on neural mechanisms, computational understanding is fragmented, with different models giving opposing predictions for trial-by-trial dynamics of autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses. To address this, researchers used a statistical framework for psychophysiological modeling to obtain precise, trial-by-trial, single-subject estimates of ANS responses. They considered non-probabilistic, probabilistic, and non-learning models, as well as different functions to link models with ANS activity. Across three experiments, skin conductance (SCR) and pupil size (PS) responses were measured. A probabilistic model best explained ANS responses, with SCR tracking a mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty, and PS tracking expected outcome alone. Combining psychophysiological with computational theory, evidence suggests Pavlov threat formation in humans relies on probabilistic inference and uncertainty estimation. This could inform neural implementation of aversive learning theories.
Researchers have identified a protein called PomA in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans that regulates asexual reproduction by affecting the phosphorylation of a protein called HogA. The septation initiation network (SIN) is a conserved pathway that plays a crucial role in cytokinesis and conidiation, while the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) pathway responds to stress and environmental factors. PomA is a negative regulator of septation and conidiation, and its absence leads to defects in septation and coniation, while overexpression of Pom suppresses septation. Under normal conditions, Sep positively regulates Hog phosphorylation, while Pom reverses this process. In the absence of Pbs, a putative upstream member of Hog, Pom and Sep are unable to affect Hog phosphorylation. Under osmotic stress, phosphorylated Hog bypasses the requirement of Sep, a key player in early cytokinesis, but not Mob/Sid, last in the SIN kinase cascade, indicating osmotic-induced septation bypasses Sep requirement but not whole SIN. Findings show crosstalk between SIN and MAP pathways, with Pom and Sep regulating Hog phosphorylation through Hog upstream kinases.
A study investigated the association between the presence of Leishmania virus 1 (LRV1) and mucosal manifestations of tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) in 156 patients in Brazil. Tegary leishias is endemic in Latin America, causing approximately 20,000 cases per year. The pathogenesis of TL is not fully understood, with clinical manifestations ranging from cutaneous leishias (CL) to severe disseminated leishias (DL), mucosal leishias (ML), and diffuse cutaneous leish (DCL). The study found five Leish species: 121 (77.6%) Leishmania (Viann) brazili, 18 (11.5%) Leish (V) guyensis, 3 (1.8) Leish (V) laini, 2 (1.3) Leish (Le) amazonensis, and 2 (1.3) Leish (V) shawi. LRV was detected in 54 L. brazili, 5 L. guy, 2 L. amazon, 1 L laini, and 6 inconclusive samples. Patients with CL+ML and DCL were excluded from analysis. Association between LRV and disease outcome was tested among 147 patients (CL=109 and ML=38). 71.1% (n=27) muc lesions were LRV+ and 28.9% (n=11) LRV-. Cutaneous lesions 36.7 (n=40) LRV+ and 63.3 (n=69) LRV-. The ratio LRV+/LRV- was 2.93 (CI 1.57-5.46; p<0.001), confirming LRV association with muc leishias as in animal models. LRV not the only factor contributing disease.
Type I interferon (IFN) plays a crucial role in protecting against pneumocococcal disease by inhibiting bacterial migration from the lung to the bloodstream. Mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (Ifnar−/−) or treated with a neutralizing antibody against type interferon exhibited enhanced development of bacteremia following intranasal pneumoc infection, while maintaining bacterial numbers in the lung. Treatment with IFβ or IF-inducing synthetic double-stranded RNA (poly(I:C) reduced development of bacteremia following intranas infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. IFβ led to upregulation of tight junction proteins and downregulation of pneumoccal receptor plate-activating factor (PAF receptor). In accordance with findings, IF reduced pneumoccal invasion and migration across epithelial and endothelial layers, and Ifnar− mice showed enhanced lung permeability. Our data identify IF as an important component of host defense regulating mechanisms involved in pneumoc invasion, i.e. PAF-mediated transcytosis and tight-dependent perellular migration, limiting progression from localized lung to invasive disease.
Researchers have developed a neural network with multiple layers that uses a type of plasticity called spike-dependent plasticity to learn a complex foraging task. This type of plasticity allows the network to adjust the strength of connections between neurons based on the timing of spikes, or signals, between them. The network has two types of plasticity: one that is modulated by rewards and one that is not. It also has mechanisms to regulate the strength of connections, including heterosynaptic plasticity, gain control, and normalization. The addition of a layer with non-rewarded plasticity allowed the network to recognize specific patterns, while a layer with rewarded plasticity enabled it to learn to distinguish between rewarding and punishing patterns without labeled data. Synaptic noise allowed the network to learn through trial and error, identifying effective strategies for solving the task. This study shows that a set of properties of spiking networks with spike-dependent plasticity can solve complex tasks involving pattern recognition and decision-making.
A study investigated the role of the transcription factor ELF5 in driving metastasis in luminal breast cancer. During pregnancy, ELF establishes the milk-secreting alveolar cell lineage by driving a cell decision of the mammary luminal progenitor cell. In cancer, ELF is a key determinant of tumor subtype and has been implicated in development of insensitivity to antiestrogen therapy. In a mouse model of luminal breast cancer, induction of ELF increased leukocyte infiltration, angiogenesis, and blood permeability in primary tumors and greatly increased size and number of metastases. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells, a group of immature neutrophils recently identified as mediators of vasogenesis and metastasis, were recruited to tumor in response to ELF. Depletion of these cells using LyG antibodies prevented ELF from vasogenesis and metastasis. Expression in luminal breast cancers indicated increased myel invasion and inflammation correlated with ELF, and ELF staining predicted shorter metastasis-free and overall survival of luminal patients. In a mouse model, increased ELF drives metastasis by co-opting the immune system. ELF has been implicated in development of antiest resistance, this finding implicates ELF as factor in acquisition of lethal phenotype in luminal breast cancer.
Recent research has shown that the interaction between chromatin loops, characterized by three factors: connection pattern, distance, and communication, plays a significant role in determining cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. A model was developed to address how these factors affect expression in a systematic way, rather than case-by-case. The model maps three patterns of interacting DNA loops into a 4-state model of transcription. It was found that nested loops enhance expression and reduce noise, while alternating loops have opposite effects. Comparing facilitated and direct looping on gene expression, the former performs better in controlling and tuning, but this control is distance-dependent, with a limit where the difference between forms disappears. Analysis supports the chromatin-loop hypothesis. Experiments have shown loop pattern, distance, and form influence gene expression, but their impact on cell-cell variability remains unclear. A stochastic model was developed to address this, mapping patterns between DNA loops into a multi-state model. Rates of chromatin looping also affect expression, depending on distance between elements and other pairs. Experimental results support the model. Transcription complexity is in ordered interactions among regulatory elements, including loop formation and DNA interactions, leading to stochastic transcription and variability. Without communication, nested loops promote expression but reduce noise, while alternating reduce mean but enlarge, compared to side-by loops. To quantify variability, transition rates between active and inactive states depend on loop lengths, as different lengths lead to expression.
Researchers have developed a new approach to design riboregulators, which are RNA molecules that can control gene expression by blocking translation initiation, without the need for extra proteins. This approach, called translation inhibiting RNAs (tiRNAs), aims to overcome the limitations of current ribg design methods, which are often laborious and inefficient. The team analyzed 12 structural and thermodynamic features of tiRNAs and selected 18 ribgulators that showed repression of up to 60% of original protein expression levels. A model was created to link tiRNA properties to gene repression, showing both structural and thermodynamic features are important for efficient repression. This approach enables reliable design of effective ribg, expanding the toolbox for gene modulation.
Researchers investigated how associations between neurons in the brain occur and how they can be identified. They recorded electrical activity at multiple sites in the cortex of awake monkeys and brain cells in a dish. They found that when a group of neurons become active, their activity is transmitted to other parts of the brain without delay through synapses. These large electrical signals, called coherence potentials, last hundreds of milliseconds and carry information like single-cell signals. However, they have a unique shape, allowing them to encode and identify specific associations. This behavior is similar to how ideas spread in social networks.

Coherence potentials have been used to identify groups of neurons responding to stimuli, but little is known about how they spread across the brain. The study found that coherence reflects the pattern of underlying activity, suggesting it carries meaningful information. This is consistent with previous findings that waveforms predict behaviors better than single-cell signals. They looked for evidence that coherence preserves the pattern of activity and found it does.
Researchers conducted a genetic screen in the yeast Schizoscharomyces pombe to identify factors involved in controlling nuclear size. They found 25 essential genes that affect nuclear size and discovered that RNA processing and LINC complexes play a role in this process. The study revealed a wide range of nuclear sizes, from small to large, and identified cellular processes and structural components important for size control. Bioinformatic analysis implicated RNA and LINC complexes in control. 

The study used genetic and nutritional methods to create cells with varying volumes, observing a constant nuclear to cell volume ratio. In small-scale experiments, nuclear size increased with cell volume during the cell cycle, maintaining a constant ratio throughout interphase. However, a sudden increase in size occurred during DNA replication in the S phase. Yeast is genetically tractable and undergoes closed mitosis, making it a useful system to study nuclear control in vivo. A screen of non-essential mutants implicated nucleocytoplasmic transport and lipid biosynthesis in size. This suggests regulation of global processes, nucleoplasmic transcription and cytoplasm translation, and structural nucleus components are important for size. 

In multicellular organisms, the ratio varies between cell types but is generally within a narrow range for each. There is evidence that volume is determined by volume or related to it, not directly by DNA. Volume correlates with across a range in both budding and fission yeasts.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict the effects of deep brain stimulation (DB) on neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor (ET). The model uses coupled oscillators to represent areas of the brain generating pathological oscillations. A reduced form of the Kuramoto model was used to analyze how patients respond to stimulation when oscillations have a given phase and amplitude. The study found that the best stimulation strategy should be phase-specific and have a greater effect when the amplitude of brain oscillations is lower. This prediction was compared to data from ET patients. A new hybrid strategy combining two closed-loop approaches, phase-locked and adaptive DB, was proposed. The model's phase-dependent effects have been shown to generalize to other models and biologically realistic neural circuits. However, predictions have not been directly compared to experimental DB effects. Two closed-loop approaches, adaptive and phase-locked DB, were focused on. Adaptive DB applies high stimulation when oscillations exceed a threshold, while phase-locked applies stimulation at the instantaneous phase of oscillations. The study aimed to describe how neural oscillators give rise to LFP and tremor oscillations. Coupled models have been used to describe DB effects at particular phases of oscillations.
Researchers have developed a new diagnostic tool, called Biom-LAMP, to detect Schistosoma mansoni, a parasite that causes intestinal and liver schistosomiasis, in Biomphalaria snails, its intermediate host. This parasite affects over 230 million people worldwide. BiomAMP is a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay that can detect 0.1 fg of S. mansoni DNA in 63 minutes at 63°C. It was tested on experimentally infected snails exposed to miracidia at different times post-exposure: prepatent period, light infections, and pooled samples. DNA was extracted using a commercial kit or simple NaOH method. BiomAMP detected S. mans in all snail groups with no complicated procedure. This assay is suitable for large-scale field surveys in schistosomiasis endemic areas with basic facilities. It's an important for snail control interventions to detect schosiasis elimination. No LAMP has been evaluated for S. mans before. This study developed a new LAMP to detect S. haobium and S. mans has been used for schosomal DNA detection in snails by RT-PCR or oligochat dipstick assay. However, this LAMP needs validation with other Biomalaria species and Schosoma species. S mans DNA in snails helps evaluate transmission risk in schosias areas and effective control measures.
In Sri Lanka, dengue has been a reported as a public health problem since the 1960s and has become a priority for public health authorities. The Ministry of Health is responsible for controlling deng and other disease outbreaks and healthcare. The involvement of large numbers of public health staff in deng control activities and provision of free care to deng patients at secondary hospitals places a financial burden on the public sector. This study estimated public costs of deng control and hospitalizations in Colombo, the most urbanized district in Sri Lanka, during epidemic 2012 from Ministry's perspective. Total cost of deng control and hospitalization was estimated at $3.45 million ($1.50 per capita) in Colombo in 201. Personnel costs accounted for largest share of total deng control (79%) and hospitalization (46%). Results showed per capita of $0.42 for deng control. Average hospitalization costs ranged $216-609 for pediatric and $196-866 for adult according to disease and treatment severity. This is first attempt to assess economic burden of deng response in public sector in Sri Lanka. Country-specific evidence needed for setting health priorities and deploying new technologies. Results suggest deng poses major burden on public sector in Sri Lanka.
A recent study has re-examined the origins of the most common European Y-chromosome lineage, Haplog Rb1b2 (R-M269), which is found in 110 million men. Previous research suggested it originated in the Paleolithic era, but this study shows it spread from a single source in the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic period. The findings indicate that most European Y-chromosomes originate from the Neolithic expansion, linking technological and cultural change with the expansion of a Y-chromosome lineage. This pattern contrasts with maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA, suggesting a unique role for males in the transition. The study analyzed the distribution of microsatellite diversity within the haplog and found it best explained by a single source in the Near East during the Neolithic. Other European haplogroups, such as E1b1 and J, also show evidence of Neolithic expansion. The majority of European Y-chromes have their origins in the Neolithic expansion. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA shows a different picture, with no east-west line and most lineages having Paleolithic origins. The study used microsatellites to define Y-chromosome lineages, applied to hap E, J, and I, but not the major European lineage Rb2. The frequency of Rb2 follows a line from 12% in Turkey to 85 in Ireland and is carried by 110 million men.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between movement variability and the speed of motor learning. Contrary to previous suggestions, computational modeling and experimental results show that variability can have both positive and negative effects on learning. In some cases, it can even slow down the learning process. A meta-analysis of published studies found no statistical correlation between movement variability and learning rate across a range of experiments. Motor learning is a complex process that can be modeled, but further research is needed to understand the factors involved.

 Simulations showed that increased variability does not typically lead to faster learning and can sometimes slows it down. However, this does not rule out the possibility of a positive correlation between variability and learning. Factors can affect learning and variability in distinct ways, leading to positive, negative, or zero relations between them. It is hypothesized that variability is correlated with learning in a task-specific way, depending on the factor that affects performance. Computer simulations of error-based learning with a widely accepted model were performed to test this hypothesis.

Variability is a significant problem for motor control and has received attention. Studies on its relation to learning are sparse, except those showing reduction is a characteristic of learning. Simulations suggest the relation between variability and learning varies in adaptation, depending on the factor that dominates performance in a task. Divergent results in experiments can be explained by taking into account uncertainty or noise. Over trials, people converge to solutions where variability minimally impacts accuracy. A study suggested initial can predict learning in reinforcement and motor tasks. It was the first to show a facilitatory effect for error-based adaptation.
Researchers have studied the interaction between RelA, a member of the NF-κ family, and CB/p300, a transcription coactivator, to understand its role in NF-κ-driven transcription. NFκ plays a crucial role in immune and inflammatory responses, cell survival, and proliferation by regulating genes involved in these processes. RelA interacts with CB/p300 through two domains: the Rel's DNA binding domain with CB's KIX domain and Rel's transcription activation domain with CB's TAZ. Phosphorylation of Rel's Ser276 is necessary for this interaction. The researchers used NMR spectroscopy to determine the structure of the Rel:CB/p300 complex, revealing how Rel's TAD folds upon binding to TAZ's hydrophobic sites. Mutational and calorimetric analyses led to Rel mutants that selectively disrupted the interaction's components. Studies using cell-based techniques, modeling, and genome-wide expression analysis showed that more Rel-activated genes are affected by this interaction than previously thought. The interaction controls NFκ's response through a negative feedback loop. Chromatin analysis of Rel target promoters showed CB/p300's constitutive recruitment, suggesting CB300's role in Rel recruitment to target sites.
Researchers have developed a new method called Time-course Gene Set Analysis (TSA) to analyze gene expression data from repeated measurements over time. Unlike previous methods, TSA considers predefined groups of genes and accounts for heterogeneity within these groups. It uses random effects modeling and maximum likelihood estimates to handle missing data and unbalanced measurements. TSA is a hypothesis-driven method that identifies significant changes in gene expression over time and compares patterns between conditions. The method was applied to two real datasets: an HIV vaccine trial and a study on influenza and pneumocococcal vaccines. In the HIV trial, TSA found significant changes in 69 gene sets over time, while standard individual gene analysis and Gene Set Enrich Analysis failed to detect patterns. In the influenza study, TSA identified 4 gene sets linked to the vaccine not previously associated with pneumococcal vaccine. Simulations showed TSA has good statistical properties and increased power compared to other methods. The method is available as an R package.
Researchers have created a detailed map of the global distribution of Plasmodium vivax, a type of malaria parasite that has been less studied than Plasium falciparum. They used data from 9,970 surveys from 1985-2010 and a statistical model to estimate the parasite rate in every 5x5km square. The map shows that Plas viv is found in a narrow range of areas, mostly in the Americas, Africa, and parts of Asia. The Americas have 22% of the area at risk, but only 6% of the 2.5 billion people at risk. Africa has 3.5% of the risk, mainly in Madagascar and the Horn of Africa. Asia has 82% of the risk, with high areas in India and Myanmar. East Asia has the highest risk, with Indonesia and Papua New Guinea having 9% of the risk. The map aims to help control and eliminate Plas viv by targeting areas with high risk. 

The model was accurate, especially in areas with low risk, but less so in areas with higher risk. The map does not show how many people are infected, but how likely to be infected. It assumes some people are resistant to the parasite due to a genetic trait.
Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections, expresses several cell-wall anchored proteins that facilitate adhesion and invasion of host tissues and immune evasion, contributing to its virulence. One of these proteins, clumping factor B (ClB), has been shown to facilitate nasal colonization through high-affinity interactions with the cornified envelope in the nares. However, its role in skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) has not been investigated. This study reveals a novel role for ClB in STIs. ClB is crucial in determining abscess structure and bacterial burden early in infection and is dependent on interaction with ligand loric, expressed in abs tissue. Targeting ClB with a vaccine induced both humoral and cellular responses, leading to protection against S aureus skin infection. This study identifies Cl as an important antigen for future ST vaccines.
To achieve the UNAIDS goal of reducing new HIV infections to 500,000 by 2020, pre-exposure prophylaxis (Pr) is one of the five pillars. Truv (emtricabirabine-tenofovir) is the only approved Pr medication, but it's costly and requires daily adherence. To improve Pr, next-generation regimens, including long-acting formulations, are being investigated. However, preclinical testing often fails to translate to clinical efficacy, and quantifying prophylactic efficacy in the clinic is ethically problematic. To prioritize and design Pr regimens, tools are needed that integrate pharmacological, viral, and host factors. A stochastic approach was developed to predict prophyl efficacy, using dolutegravir (DT) as an example. Combining DT's population pharmacokinetics with the framework, predicted plasma concentrations of 145.18 and 722.23nM prevent 50 and 90% transmissions respectively. Daily PrEP with 50mg DT prevented 99-100% infections, and 85% when 50% of dosing events were missed. Pr 'on-demand' prevented 79-84% and PEP >80 when initiated within 6 hours and continued. The framework can be adapted to other Pr candidates, indicating oral 50 DT is inferior to Truv. Predicted 90% concentrations guide release kinetics of developed DT nano-formulations.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces autophagy to enhance its replication, but how it regulates the autophagic pathway is unclear. Researchers found that HCV infection induces the expression of Rubicon and UVR, which inhibit and stimulate the maturation of autophagosomes, respectively. Rubicon is induced early, while UVR is delayed, leading to accumulation of autagosomes at early in infection. Rubicon inhibits maturation of autag in H-infected cells, confirmed by siRNA knockdown and overexpression, enhancing and suppressing maturation. Rub plays a positive role in H replication, suppressing its expression reduces replication and overexpression enhances. In contrast, overexpression of UVR facilitates maturation and suppresses H replication. The H subgenomic RNA replicon, expressing nonstructural proteins, induces Rubicon and autag accumulation. Analysis shows NS4 protein induces Rub and autag. Results indicate H, by differentially inducing Rub and UVR, temporally regulates autagic to enhance replication.
Cyclin-like 1 (Cny1), a newly identified member of the cyclin family, is highly similar in protein sequence to Cyclin Y (cny). However, its function is poorly characterized in any organism. This study found that Cny1 was most abundantly expressed in the testis of mice, seven times higher than the level of Cny. Male C1- mice were infertile, whereas male and female C- mice displayed normal fertility, suggesting that C1, not C, is indispensable for fertility. Spermatoa from C- mice displayed impaired motility and thinned annulus region/bent head. The protein, not mRNA level of cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CD16) was decreased in testis C- mice. Further study demonstrated that C1 interacted with CD and this increased stability of two. Moreover, interaction increased kinase of CD. In addition, observed alteration phosphorylation of CD in presence C1. Identified phosphorylation of CD by mass spectrometry revealed several modifications on-terminal of CD indispensable for C binding and modulation CD kinase activity. Results reveal a previously role of C in regulating spermatogenesis through interaction and modulation CD.

C1 and CD16 complex is essential for spermatogenesis and fertility in mouse. C is specifically expressed in testis and C- mice, although sterile, healthy, normal testosterone levels mating. C may be molecule for male contraceptive or screening drugs inhibit C expression or C/CD activity. Study showed C- male reproductively normal, deletion C1 leads infertility male, not female, cooperating CD maintaining enzymatic C complex membrane sperogenic cells. Unlike homologue C, had uniform pattern C1 specifically high in testis. Data defects impaired motility C- spermzo prevent propulsion entry oocytes, fertilization.
Enterohemorrhagic Escheria coli (E) strains cause diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome due to toxin-mediated vascular endothelial injury. E. coli hemolysin (E-Hly), a member of the RTX repeats-toxin family, is an E. coli virulence factor of increasing importance. The toxin exists as free E-Hly and E-H associated with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released by E during growth. While the free toxin is lytic to human endothelium, the effects of OM-associated E-H on vascular endothelial and epithelial cells, major targets during E infection, are unknown. This study demonstrates that OM-associated E-H does not lyse cells but triggers apoptosis in human microvascular endothelial and intestinal epithelial cells. OM-associated is internalized via dynamin endocytosis and trafficked into endosomal compartments. Upon acidification and pH drop, E-H is separated from OM, escapes lysosomes via pore-forming activity and targets mitochondria, decreasing membrane potential and cytochrome translocation to cytos, indicating permeabilization. Subsequent caspase and casp-3 activation leads to apoptotic death evidenced by DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation. The ability of OM-associated to trigger apoptotic pathway in microvascular and epithelial cells indicates a mechanism E-H involvement in pathogenesis E diseases.
In the yeast Schizoscharomyces pombe, histone H2 ubiquitylation (H2ub) plays a crucial role in regulating transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPI). H2ub promotes the methylation of histone H3 by the methyltransferase Set1, and also regulates gene expression through an unidentified methylation-independent mechanism. This study reveals a bidirectional communication between H2ub and Cdk, the ortholog of metazoan transcription elongation factor PTEb. Lowering Cdk activity or preventing phosphorylation of its substrate, the processivity factor Spt, reduces H2ub in vivo. Conversely, mutations in the H2ub pathway impair Cdk recruitment to chromatin and Spt phosphorylation. An Spt phosphorylation-site mutation combined with deletion of histone H3 Lys methyltransferase Set phenocopies morph and growth defects due to Hub loss, suggesting partially redundant roles for Cdk and Set downstream Hub. Surprisingly, mutation of histone H2 ubiquitin-acceptor relaxes Cdk activity in vivo, and Cdk mutations suppress cell-morph defects in Hub-deficient strains. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrate opposing effects of C9 and Hub on transcribing RNAPI.
Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in South America. A phylogenetic analysis of the largest YV dataset to date, comprising 133 isolates from 22 countries over 76 years, suggests that circulating strains of YV arose in Africa within the last 1,500 years and emerged in the Americas following the slave trade approximately 300-400 years ago. These viruses then spread west across the continent and persist in the jungles of South America. The study illustrates how sequence data can be used to test hypotheses of viral dispersal and demographics, and the role of human migration in the spread of disease. 

The analysis of 71 additional sequences from GenBank resulted in an alignment of 133 wild-type isolates representing 22 countries (14 African, 8 American). Phylogenetic analysis shows YV can be divided into geographic groups, with distinct lineages in Africa and Americas. In Africa, outbreaks are reported annually, with five West African cities facing YF epidemics since 2001. However, analysis revealed no difference in evolutionary dynamics among viruses in South or Africa, neither exhibited increases in diversity expected of expansion. Subsequent urban outbreaks in cities both east and west coasts of America established a sylvatic cycle within Amazon, Aragua, Orin river basins vectored by Haemus, Sabeth mosquitoes. The hypothesis of slave introduction is often repeated, but not subject to rigorous examination using sequence and phylogen techniques estimating divergence.
Researchers studied a virulent Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading bacterial pathogen, in an infant mouse model of colonization and disease transmission, with and without influenza A (IAV) co-infection. They aimed to identify vulnerable points in the steps involved in pneumocococcal pathogenesis. The study found that in the setting of IAV co-infection, the organism must pass through single bottlenecks during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and transmission between hosts. These bottlenecks were not associated with genetic adaptation of the pathogen. The bottleneck in transmission occurred between exit from one host and establishment in another, explaining the number of organisms in secretions is critical to overcoming. Observations demonstrate viral infection and T-dependent immune responses stimulate and are required to control bacterial contagion.

The study used an animal model to examine the effects of clinically viral co-infection. IAV increased the burden of colonizing pneumocci consistent with prior observations in mice. Targeting stages when bacterial size is restricted, there is less opportunity for selection of phenotypically and genetically diverse pneumocci. The study employed an infant model that recapitulates key pneumoccal path features. Regardless of IAV-infection, sampled at 12 days prior to onset, detection of pneumonia by lung homogen culture was unusual. The bottleneck in IAV could be due to selection of subpopulation pneumoc for de novo adaptation or passage.
Researchers studied the reaction of human antibodies against recombinant saliva proteins of Phlebotus orientalis, a sand fly species that transmits Leishmania donov, the causative agent of visceral leishiasis in Eastern Africa. The study aimed to evaluate exposure to sand fly bites in populations from disease-endemic areas by testing volunteers' sera against recombinant P. orient saliva antigens. Recombinant proteins from P. orient secreted saliva sequences were produced using bacterial or mammalian expression systems and tested as antigens for detecting anti-P orient Ig in human sera. Sera from Sudan and Ethiopia, endemic for visceral leishias, were screened by ELISA and immunoblot to identify markers of P orient bites. Two recombin proteins, mY1 and m5, were identified as promising antigens with high correlation and specificity to whole fly saliva homogen. Combining both proteins increased correlation and predictive values of orient exposure. This is the first report screening human sera for anti orient antibodies using recom saliva proteins. Recombinant proteins mY1 and m5 proved valid for screening sera from Sudan and Ethiopia for orient bites. Utilizing both proteins increased detection of anti orient responses.
Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI) is a mobile genetic element associated with multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of pathogenic Enterobacteraceae. It is mobilized by IncA and Inc plasmids, also known as A/C plids, following excision from the chromosome, triggered by the transcriptional activator ACD encoded by these plids. Although SGI is not self-transmissible, it carries genes NS, HS, and GS, coding for homologs of the mating pore subunits NC, HC, and GC, encoded by A plids. Researchers investigated the regulation of NS and HS and the role of these genes in SGI transmissibility. They found that expression of NS and HS is inducible by ACD and essential for SGI mobilization. Mating experiments revealed interactions between SGI and the Inc plid pCR, showing that NC and GC are essential for Inc plid transfer, but SGI can rescue mutants of each gene, indicating that NS, HS, and GS are functional. Complementation assays showed that NS, HS replace NC, GC in the pore encoded by plids and that GS and HS are required for SGI optimal transfer. Remodeling the Inc-encoded pore by SGI enhances transfer rate over the plid. GS allows DNA transfer between cells bearing Inc helperids, disabling an Inc-encoded exclusion mechanism.
Researchers studied the role of Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo kinase C5 (CDC5) in the DNA damage checkpoint response, a mechanism that prevents cell division when DNA damage is detected. They found that CDC5 promotes adaptation, allowing cells to continue division despite damage, by inhibiting hyperphosphorylation of the checkpoint kinase Rad53. Overexpression of CDC5 accelerated adaptation, indicating that high levels of CDC modulate the checkpoint's ability to inhibit the cell cycle. The study pinpointed the step in the pathway where CDC acts by overexpressing CDC from the GAL promoter in damaged cells and examining key checkpoint steps individually. CDC overproduction had little effect on early steps leading to Rad activation, but significantly reduced hyperosphorylation of Rad53, consistent with cell cycle loss during adaptation. This suggests CDC attenuates the DNA checkpoint through loss of Rad hyperphosphorylation to allow cells to adapt to damage. Polo kinase homologs have shown to inhibit the ability of Clpin to activate downstream kinases, suggesting this is conserved in vertebrates.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework, called the Kirchhoffern-Planck (KNP) framework, to study the dynamics of ion concentrations and electrical potential in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain on large spatial and temporal scales. This is important for understanding conditions such as seizures, stroke, and depression, which are associated with changes in ion concentrations in the ECS. Previous models were limited to small spatial and temporal scales or simplified one-dimensional processes due to computational power requirements. The KNP framework assumes electroneutrality, making it feasible to run simulations on spatial scales of millimeters and seconds on a standard computer. It was used to simulate the dynamics of ion and electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell, demonstrating its efficiency. The framework can be applied to more biologically realistic systems to explore pathologies with large variations in ECS. To estimate electrodiff effects, simultaneous knowledge of all ion concentrations is needed, which is currently unfeasible experimentally but achievable with computational models based on biophysical principles. Most models only partially or ignore ion dynamics. The 3-D KNP model predicts ion concentrations in all directions surrounding neuronal sources and can be applied to broader biological problems. It addresses diffusion due to concentration gradients on large spatial scales.
A proposed budget cut to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding for mosquito-borne disease surveillance, such as deng and West Nile virus, could leave the country unprepared to handle emerging and existing diseases. A study evaluated the impact of delayed responses to deng epidemics in a developed urban environment, using a mathematical model to generate scenarios of delayed response to deng introduction in Cairns, Queensland, Australia. The results showed that halting surveillance increased epidemic management costs by an order of magnitude compared to sustained surveillance and early detection. The total costs of preparedness through surveillance were lower than responding to vector-borne pathogens, even without considering human lives and well-being. The study provides a science-based justification for reassessing the CDC budget cut and emphasizes the need for sustainable vectororne surveillance systems.
A study was conducted in western Nicaragua to investigate deng as a cause of acute febrile illness in children and adults. A total of 740 patients aged 1 years with fever were enrolled and tested for deng IgG and IgM and serotypedeng virus using reverse transcriptase PCR. The results showed that 63.5% of patients were seropositive for deng at enrollment, with seropreval increasing with age, reaching 90% in those over 20 years. Acute deng serotypes 1 and 2 were identified in 5.1% of patients. Only 8.1% of confirmed cases were clinically suspected. The study found deng to be an important and largely unrecognized cause of fever in rural Nicaragua. Since Zika virus is transmitted by the same vector and associated with severe congenital infections, the population is at risk of being devastated by the Zika epidemic that has reached Central America.
Arabidopsis leucine-rich receptor-like kinase NIL1 (NIL1) plays a crucial role in the induction of innate immunity against parasitic nematodes. Nematodes are destructive pests that cause billions of dollars in losses annually, and effective defense against them relies on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized receptors, leading to the activation of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Research has been conducted to characterize the role of PT in various plant-pathogen interactions, but less is known about PT in roots and plant-nemat interactions. This study shows that nemat-derived elicitors can induce PT in Arabidopsis in a manner dependent on the immune receptor BAK. Consistent with BAK's role, a leucine-rich receptor-like kinase, NIL1, is regulated upon nemat infection and essential for PT responses initiated by nematodes. NIL1 loss-of-function mutants are hypersusceptible to broad nematodes. NIL1 is the first immune receptor involved in induction of basal immunity PT in plants or animals to nematodes. Manipulation of NIL will provide options for nemode control in crops.
Researchers investigated the effect of milteine, an anti-cancer drug, on Schistosoma mansoni worms in vitro. They found that treating the worms with miline exposed previously hidden antigens on the parasite's surface, making them recognizable to the immune system. The study used an indirect immunofluorescence assay to show that rabbit antibodies reacted with the worm's surface after miline treatment. Four proteins were identified as targets: fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase, Sm22.6, alkaline phosphatase, and malate dehydrogenase. These proteins were also found on the surface of 3-hour schosula and induced agglutination, suggesting a potential role in immune protection. The study reveals a new mode of action for miline as an anti-schosome agent, similar to previous findings with prazantel (PQ), which unmasks surface antigens not exposed during infection. The antigens involved could be targets for intervention and antibodies may increase drug efficacy and prevent re-infection.
Researchers have studied how the opportunistic pathogen Bacillus cereus acquires iron from its host, a crucial for growth and virulence. Iron is often bound to hemoglobin, but also stored in ferritin, a protein that holds thousands of iron atoms. Bacillus cereus has a surface protein, IlsA, which binds to hemoglobin and ferritin in vitro and is involved in virulence. This study shows Ils acts as a ferritin receptor, causing ferritin to aggregate on the bacterial surface. Ils binds to ferritin through its subunits, destabilizing the iron core and enhancing release. Bacillus's siderophore, bacibactin, then acquires the mobilized iron for growth. Disrupting bacibactin production reduces Bacillus's ability to use ferritin and attenuates virulence in insects. A new model proposes Ils binds to ferritin, followed by siderophore-assisted iron uptake. This highlights the interplay between a surface protein and siderore, providing insights into Bacillus adaptation and pathogenesis.
Researchers have developed a new thermodynamically consistent model of the post-translational circadian clock in the cyanobacter Synechoccus elongatus. The clock is driven by a protein phosphorylation cycle of three proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. KaiC forms a hexamer with two domains, CI and CII, which can bind and hydrolyze ATP, but only CII can be phosphorylated at two specific residues. The model suggests that ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain provides the thermodynamic force for the clock, switching KaiC between active and inactive states. Phosphorylation of CII provides the timer for hydrolysis in CI. The model also explains how KaiA stimulates phosphorylation of KaiC and the differential affinity of Kai for different Kai phosphoforms generates the temporal order of phosphorylation. As phosphorylation in CII rises, release of AD from CI slows, making the inactive state of Kai more stable. Inactive Kai binds KaiB, stabilizing the state and sequestering Kai, leading to dephosphorylation. A kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm simulates the system, showing the model describes experimental data.
Hepatitis B virus (HB) has a unique ability to evade the host's immune system and cause chronic infection. Despite being a DNA virus, its pre-genomic RNA can be sensed by RIG and activate MAVS to produce interferon (IF) λ. However, the mechanism behind HB's failure to induce interferon-β (IF) synthesis remained unclear. Researchers found that HB induces parkin, a protein, to recruit the ubiquitin assembly complex (LAC) to mitochondria and suppress IF β synthesis. Parkin interacts with MAVS, accumulates unanchored polyubiquitin chains on MAV via LAC, disrupting MAV signalosome and IR3 activation. This study highlights parkin's role in antiviral signaling involving LAC recruitment to mitochond. The results provide avenues for investigating mitochondrial dynamics in innate immunity. 

HB is considered a stealth virus due to its ability to evade immunity and cause chronic infection. Previous studies show HB cripples R-I-MA signaling and a recent study shows R-I senses HB RNA to stimulate IF production but not β. Notably, perisomal MAV stimulates IF production via IR-1. This suggests MAV signaling that stimulates β production is suppressed in HB infection. The likely role of park in suppressing MAV signaling via LAC recruitment to mitochond is proposed. Park interacts with MAV and HB potentiates this interaction. HB activates R-I-MA axis to countermeasures to abrogate IR3 and β synthesis. HB induces Park translocation and Park-dependent mitagy to promote persistence. Mitochondrial dynamics and mitagy modulate antiral signaling. HB-localized Park interacts with MAV and causes ubiquination. Park recruits LAC to mitochond, leading to M-linked polyubiquitin on MAV, disrupting TRs and abating IR3. Park modulates LAC and LAC abrogates MAV signaling via MAV-TR or TR25. Park silencing restores β in HB cells upon R-I stimulation.
Researchers have identified a novel superantigen, pT, encoded by the gene of Pseudomonas fluorescens, which is associated with Crohn's disease. They determined the crystal structure of pT at 1.7 Å resolution and analyzed its interaction with human class II MHC molecules. pT and its homolog PA5 bound to mammalian cells and stimulated human lymphocyte proliferation, which was inhibited by anti-class II MHC HLA-DR antibodies and to a lesser extent by HLA-D and DP antibodies, indicating class IIHC-specific binding. pT efficiently precipitated both endogenous and purified recombinant HLA-DR molecules, indicating direct interaction with HLA-DR. Competition studies revealed pT and superantigen Mycoplas arthritidis mit (M) competed for HLA binding, indicating overlapping sites. Structural analysis established pT belongs to the Tet-family of DNA-binding regulators. The distinct pT structure indicates a new T superantigen family. p is a biomarker for disease and clinical phenotype of Crohn disease, and its interplay with microbiota is a source of antigens in immune activation and microbial products targeting epithelial function. Strong T responses are elicited by microbial superigens via interaction with TCRβ elements and in some Tα chains. Novel enteric superigen p and its full-length product pT are encoded by microbial associated Crohn disease. Selective activation was observed for murine TCRβ subpopulation and p exhibited T-cell activity. PA5, Pseudomonas aeruginosa hom of pT (78 sequence) stimulated murine CD T proliferation.
Researchers have found that the gene Nanog, a key regulator of embryonic stem cell pluripotency, has distinct allelic patterns of expression within stem cell populations in vivo and in vitro. This heterogeneity is influenced by allelic control of the Nanog gene, which affects stem cell fate decisions. A mathematical model was developed to understand how allelic regulation influences Nanog heterogeneity in stem cells. The model considered allelic expression, gene noise, and partitioning at cell division. Results showed that alle Nanog expression led to three distinct states, but combined with transcription noise, the profile became bimodal. Initially, uniform stem cells gave rise to same Nan heterogeneity within ten cycles. Depletion of NANOG in cells was slower than accumulation of intracellular NAN after turning on at least one Nan gene, indicating Nan state dynamics. Allelic transcription raises questions about using stem cell lines with reporter genes knocked in single locus. Divergence was observed in reporter and protein profiles depending on half-lives insertion in one or both alleles. In stem populations with restricted Nan expression, allelic facilitated maintenance of self-renew cells with sufficient Nan content to prevent pluripotency loss. Findings highlight alle control of Nanog as determinant of stem population heterogeneity, warranting investigation in cell specification and reprogramming.
Researchers have developed a new method to quantify and classify the unused proteins in E. coli, a type of bacteria, across different environments. They found that nearly half of the proteins are not used in certain environments, and the cost of these unused proteins explains 95% of the variation in growth rates across 16 different environments. Reducing unused protein expression is a common mechanism to increase growth in adaptive experiments. Unused proteins encode functions for nutrient and stress preparedness, which may provide benefits in varying environments. This unused expression is a source of large and pervasive costs that may provide benefits against environmental change.

A genome-scale model of E. coli and absolute proteomics data were used to determine the environment-specific cost and utility of the proteome on a gene basis. The model, called ME-Model, formalizes the function and synthesis of proteins for metabolism and expression necessary for growth, referred to as the proteome. Unused proteins are catalytically active but present in excess, operating at maximal capacity. The MEModel quantifies and underutilized protein, which results in a predictable reduction in growth. Microbes express some unused protein in any environment, reducing growth. However, the magnitude and variability of unused expression is unknown due to environment-specific proteome challenge.

Unused proteins are quantified across 16 environments, showing the fraction can vary greatly. The cost of unused expression and processes and regulators are characterized. Unused expression is a source of large and pervasive costs providing benefits against environmental change.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate the genetic factors contributing to type 2 diabetes (T2) in three ethnic groups in Southeast Asia: Chinese, Malays, and Indians. The study included 3,955 cases and 1,945 controls, 2,034 cases, and 1,240 controls, and 2,146 cases and 1,169 controls, respectively. The study aimed to identify new genetic variants associated with T2 and assess the transferability of previous findings from European populations to these ethnic groups. Of the previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with T2, CDKAL and HXIDE/K11 showed the strongest association in a meta-analysis of all three groups. However, the direction of effect was consistent for many SNPs in this study and those in European populations. Examination of CDAL and HXIDE11 loci showed evidence of locus and allelic heterogeneity in relation to T2 and variation in linkage disequilibrium between populations. These factors may contribute to failure to detect associations in diverse populations. The study highlights the importance of surveying diverse ethnic groups for fine-mapping causal variants and searching population-specific variants. This is the first GWAS in Malays, the largest group in Southeast Asia, comprising 300 million people. Meta-analysis showed strong associations at CDAL and HX11 loci consistent in multiple populations. Signals at CD1 were calibrated, with effect sizes in Chinese and Indian populations similar or larger than European studies. GW allows unbiased survey of the genome for novel loci causally responsible for T onset. Conditional analysis at CDAL and HX11 included genotypes as covariates and lead SNPs to assess differences in linkage disequilibrium between populations.
Researchers studied the process of cell division in the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, a type of yeast. They found that a protein called Aurora kinase I1 (I1) plays a crucial role in the breakdown of the nuclear envelope that surrounds the cell's genetic material during division. I1 is essential for the cell's survival and helps maintain the structure of microtubules, which are tiny threads that help the cell divide. Without I, the microtules become unstable and division is delayed. A computer model predicted that microtules and dynein, a type of motor protein, work together to move the cell's genetic material to the new cell during division. Adding more details to the model, researchers found that I and dyin create a force that helps move the genetic material to the new cell. Without I, dyin levels are altered and division is delayed. Live cell imaging showed that I spatiotemporally regulates dyin and microtule stability to ensure timely division. The study suggests that I breakdown of the nuclear envelope by I allows it to enter the nucleus, helping regulate division in Cryptoccus neoans.
Researchers investigated the role of a synonymous mutation in the RET proto-oncogene in a case of aggressive medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). The mutation, previously considered clinically irrelevant due to its synonymous nature, was found to be in cis with a somatic RET driver mutation. Next-generation sequencing of tumor tissues revealed no evidence of gene amplification. Expression analysis showed an increase in RET transcript levels in the patient with both mutations compared to those with only the somatic mutation. Minigene assays demonstrated the synonymous mutation was sufficient to explain increased mRNA levels. In silico and immunoprecipitation experiments showed the synonymous variant created new splicing enhancer motifs, enhancing SR55 recruitment to the mutant allele, leading to efficient pre-mRNA maturation and increased mature mRNA encoding a constitutively active receptor. These findings document a novel mechanism by which synonymous mutations can contribute to cancer progression.
Researchers have developed a new bioinformatics system to remove contaminants and low-complex genomic sequences from draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. This system was applied to a comprehensive database of sequenced eukotic pathogen genomes, removing human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences, as well as low-complex genomic sequences that can cause false positives. The resulting database of "clean" eukotic pathogen genomes was used for bioinformatics analysis and classification, showing improved sensitivity and reduced false positives when identifying eukotic pathogens in metagen samples compared to using original genomes. The method was tested on a large set of eukotic pathogen genomes, producing a cleaned and filtered database for use in bioinformatics pipelines, including NGS diagnostics, with decreased false and negative rates.
Researchers investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of Trypanosoma brucei in Uganda to understand the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region. They genotyped 269 isolates from different regions in Uganda and southwestern Kenya at 17 microsatellite loci and checked for the presence of the SRA gene that confers human infectivity to T. bodesense. The results showed three distinct genetic clusters: cluster 1 and 3 include isolates from central and southern Uganda, while cluster 2 contains mostly isolates from southwestern Kenya. These clusters are not sorted by subspecies (T. b. brucei vs. T. bodesense) or date of collection. There is evidence of genetic admixture among clusters and long-range dispersal, suggesting recent and ongoing gene flow between them. The expansion of the disease to new foci in central Uganda occurred from northward spread of T. bodesense. The emergence of human infect strains from non-infect T. bruce strains of different backgrounds and the importance of cattle as reservoir shape the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region.
Researchers investigated the role of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXIP) in the inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock. They found that mice lacking TXIP (Tx−/−) were more susceptible to endotoxic shock due to increased production of nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The absence of TXIP led to excessive NO production, which was the main driver of endotoxic shock. TXIP regulates the NFκB pathway, which affects the iN pathway in response to LPS. Additionally, excessive NO inhibited NLR3-dependent IL-1 secretion via S-nitrosylation of the NLR inflamome. The study suggests a cross-talk between TXIP and NFκB/iN pathways, regulating disease states associated with sepsis. The absence of TXIP also reduced IL-1 secretion due to increased S-nrosylation of NLR3 compared to wild-type controls. The data indicate that TXIP is a novel molecule linking NO synthesis and NLR inflamome activation during endotoxic.
Researchers have identified a protein called ZTF-8 in the nematode worm C. elegans that plays a crucial role in repairing damaged DNA and ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division. This protein is important because mutations in DNA repair genes can lead to cancer and problems with cell division. Z-8 interacts with a complex called the 9-1 and is required for fixing double-strand breaks in DNA, which can occur during cell division or meiosis. When Z-8 is missing, cells are sensitive to radiation and chemicals, have trouble dividing, and accumulate damaged DNA intermediates. It also fails to trigger a checkpoint that prevents damaged cells from dividing. Z-8 localizes to the nucleus and changes location in response to damage, supporting its role in DNA repair. It interacts with a component of the 9-1 complex and is rescued by a human protein called RHINO, suggesting conservation across species. Z- promotes repair of stalled replication forks and double-strand breaks, and activates the 9-1 pathway for damage signaling. This is important for genomic stability in the germline.
During neural development, multipotent progenitor cells differentiate into specific cell types in a spatial and temporal patterns. Researchers investigated the mechanism linking progenitor identity and differentiation in the neural tube, where motor neuron (MN) progenitors differentiate faster than other progenitors. Using single-cell transcriptomics, they defined the transcription changes associated with the transition of neural progenitors into MNs. The study found that the transcription factor O2 (O2) plays a crucial role in MN differentiation, repressing the Notch signaling pathway effectors H1 and H5. O2 repression of H5 appears to be direct, via a conserved element within the H5 locus, restricting expression from MN progenitors. This reveals a tight coupling between patterning and differentiation networks, with O2 acting as a developmental pacemaker coordinating spatial and temporal MN generation.

The findings establish a mechanism where neural patter and neurogenesis intersect. Modulating the Notch pathway, Shh and retinoinduced O2 not only specifies MN identity but also determines the rate of differentiation, imposing kinetics of MN production. Notch signaling controls the transition between O2 expression phases, restraining O2 in MN progenitors. Inhibition of Notch leads to increased expression of neurogenic markers and neuronal genes, suggesting Notch controls the transition between phases of O2 expression. Canonical Not effectors H1 and H5 decrease as cells switch from O2LOW to OHIGH expression. Inhibiting Not signalling upregulates O2. Distinct O2 dynamics underlie MN to MN progression, raising the question of what upregulates O2 prior MN.
Researchers used a non-human primate model to investigate the role of T cells in protecting against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. They first infected rhesus macaques with a seasonal H1 influenza isolate, which elicited cellular and antibody responses but no neutralizing antibodies against the pandemic virus. Four months later, the animals were challenged with the pandemic virus. In naive animals, T cells with an activated phenotype appeared in the blood and lung 5-7 days post-inoculation, while in "primed" animals, T were recruited to the lung as early as 2 days post-inoc and peaked in blood and lung 4-7 days. Interferon-gamma Elisp and intracellular cytokine staining showed the virus-specific response peaked and reached higher in "prim" than naive animals, involving both CD4 and CD8 T cells. "prim" animals cleared the virus from upper and lower respiratory tract earlier than naive, before neutralizing antibodies appeared. The study suggests cross-reactive T responses mediate early clearance of antigenically novel virus in primates, and vaccines inducing such cells may protect against emerging influenza.
Researchers have developed a rapid and sensitive method to detect Q fever, a widespread zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii, which is difficult to diagnose in humans and animals due to lack of specific symptoms and identifiable features. Conventional serodiagnosis requires sera from acute and convalescent stages of infection, unavailable at early diagnosis. Nested PCR and real-time PCR require equipment. The Loop-Med Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay was developed to identify C. burnii rapidly and sensitively. A universal L primer set was designed to detect the repeated sequence IS1 of the hAB gene of C. burnii using Primer V software. The sensitivity of the LAMP was evaluated using known quantities of reference plasmids containing the targeted gene. The specificity of the LAMP was determined using 26 members of Ricketiae and 18 common pathogens. The utility of LAMP was compared with real-time PCR on 24 blood samples including 6 confirmed and 18 Q cases diagnosed by serological and real PCR. Additionally, 126 animal samples from 4 provinces including goats, cattle, horses, marmots, and deer were compared by two methods. The limits of detection of LAMP for hAB were 1 copy per reaction. The specificity of LAMP was 100%, no cross-reaction among bacteria. The positive rate of febrile patients was 33.3% for LAMP and 8.3 for real PCR. Similarly, total rate animals was 7.9 for LAMP and 0.8 for real. Using LAMP, fever in Yi area Xinjiang was confirmed. The LAMP is a tool to support diagnosis Q in humans and animals, especially in rural China due to rapid detection without equipment or complicated protocol.
Researchers have discovered a new class of regulatory elements called ES-specific enhancers (ESs) in hematopoietic cells that are prone to DNA methylation changes in cancer. These enhancers are involved in controlling the expression of genes in undifferentiated cells, similar to those found in cancer. Methylation of ESs is associated with gene activity in cancer, with methylated ESs being hypermethylated in cancer and unmated ES being hypomethyl. Constitutive hematopoietic cell enhancers do not show this trend, suggesting selective reactivation of ESs in cancer. Analysis of hypomated ES downstream the VFA gene revealed a regulatory circuit affecting VFA transcript levels in cancers and patients. The study suggests that these enhancers provide a framework for reactivation of genes in cancer. DNA methylation is linked to enhancer states and gene expression in cancer, and ESs are prone to methylation alterations in cancer. Methylation of ES correlates with VFA expression in cancers, but not with promoter methylation and gene expression in other cancers. Genes proximal to hypomated ESs expressed in ES but downregulated in hematiet cells are upregulated in cancer. These genes participate in developmental pathways. The methylation state of ES affects its activity as a transcription enhancer in leukemia, supporting its role in reactivating genes in cancer.
Researchers investigated the effect of subdividing a population on the time it takes to cross a fitness valley or plateau in a rugged landscape. They used a generic and minimal model that includes population subdivision into demes connected by migration, without significant changes in deme size, environmental heterogeneity, or geographic structure. The study found that subdivision can significantly accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus, but only if demes are in the sequential regime. Using Markov chain theory, they obtained expressions for the conditions under which the subdivided population crosses a valley or plateau as fast as its fastest dem. Analytical predictions were verified through stochastic simulations. Subdivision was shown to accelerate the crossing of valleys and plateaus in a wide range of parameters beyond the optimal. The effect of varying the degree of subdivision and the trade-off between speed and range was investigated. Results for valleys and plateaus also held for weak beneficial mutations. The study was extended to a population connected by migration to one or several islands, showing subdivision with migration can accelerate crossing and shedding light on necessary conditions.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the midgut metabolome of Aedes aegypt, the primary vector for arboviruses such as deng, Zika, chikunya, and yellow fever, to understand how these viruses replicate and disseminate within the mosquito. They used high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyze the metabolic changes in the midut tissue following deng virus infection, the primary site of infection and replication. The study identified metabolites that exhibited a dynamic profile across early, mid, and late infection time points, with a marked increase in lipid content, glycerophospholids, sphingolids, and acyls coinciding with viral replication. Elevated glycerolip levels suggested a diversion of resources from energy to synthetic pathways, while elevated acylcarnines indicated disruptions in mitochondrial function and energy production. A critical hub in the sphingip pathway, dihydroceramide to ceramide ratio, was found to influence the virus cycle. This study also reconstructed the sphip pathway in Aedes aegi, highlighting biochemical points that could be targeted to disrupt transmission of multiple pathogens by mosquitoes.
Researchers have developed a simplified model of the action potential (AP) in rabbit heart cells, called the "parsimon" model, to better understand the underlying mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias. Current models of AP are complex and varied, leading to different predictions, so a simpler model is needed to reproduce significant phenomena with few parameters. The new model combines the Hodgkin-Hux formulation of sodium current (INa) with a phenomenological repolarization model similar to the voltage-dependent, time-independent potassium current (IK). It was calibrated using experimental data from rabbit cells under physiological conditions: current-voltage (I-V) relationships during AP, rapid recovery of excitability during refractory period, and steady IN inactivation via clamp. The model reproduced phenomena including alternans at 250 beats per minute, reentrant waves on the heart surface, and spiral breakup. Variants showed the minimal requirements for alternans and spiral breakup: IN kinetics and IK non-linearity. The model's simplicity and physiological parameters make it ideal for mechanistic insight and a building block for more detailed models.
Researchers have studied the process of genome assembly in the ciliate Parameum during its sexual cycle, where thousands of non-coding sequences (Internal Eliminated Sequences or IES) are precisely excised and rearranged. These rearrangements are initiated by developmentally programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) that depend on the domesticated transposase PigMac. The researchers found that Ligase IV and Xrccp, components of the non-homologous end-joining (NHE) pathway, are required for the repair of I excision sites and circularization of excised IES. The transcription of LIG and XR4 is induced during the sexual cycle and Ligp-GFP protein accumulates in the developing somatic nucleus during I excision. RNA-mediated silencing of either gene results in persistence of free DNA ends, apparently protected from resection. At the nucleotide level, removal of 5-terminal nucleotide occurs in L4-silenced cells while addition to 3 ends of breaks is blocked, indicating a coupling between NHE polymerase and ligase activities. The data indicate I excision is a "cut-and-close" mechanism involving introduction of double-strand cleavage at both ends of I, followed by DSB repair via precise joining. This broadens current view on how cellular HE pathway cooperates with domestic transases for emergence of new mechanisms in genome dynamics.
A study analyzed the mode of death in patients with heart failure caused by Chagas disease, comparing it with non-Ch cardiopathy. The REMHE trial included 342 patients, 185 (54.1%) of whom died. Death occurred in 56.4% of Chagas patients and 53.7% non-Ch patients. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and heart failure was higher in Ch patients with Chagas compared to non-Ch. However, there was no difference in cumulative sudden mortality between the two groups. In the Cox model, Ch etiology (HR 2.76, CI 1.34-5.69, p=0.006), left ventricular end diastolic diameter (HR 1.07, CI 1.04-1.10, p<0.001), creatinine (HR 0.98, CI 0.97-0.99, p=0.006), and amiodarone (HR 3.05, CI 1.47-6.34, p=0.003) were associated with heart mortality. Left ventricular diameter (HR 1.04, CI1.01-1.07, p=0.005) and beta-blocker (0.52, CI0.34-0.94, p=0.014) were associated with sudden mortality. In Chagas disease, heart failure is the main mode of death.
Researchers have identified a protein called rp10 as a key player in a plant's defense against a type of virus called geminivirus. The protein rp10 works with a kinase called N1, which is a part of the plant's defense system. When N1 is activated, it phosphorylates rp10 and sends it to the nucleus where it can help fight the virus. However, the virus has a way to stop this by interfering with N1's activity. The virus binds to N and prevents it from working, keeping rp10 in the cytoplasm where it can't fight the virus. Without rp10, the plant is more susceptible to the virus. The researchers also found that the virus interferes with N1's ability to send rp10 to the nucleus as a way to counter the plant's defense. The N1 defense doesn't activate a common plant response called RNA silencing or make the plant more sensitive to the virus, but it does slow down plant growth. The virus studied here can overcome this defense, but N1 may help against other viruses. The virus traps rp10 in the cytoplasm by binding to N and preventing it from working, stopping it from going to the nucleus where it can fight the virus.
Researchers studied the role of an enzyme called alternative oxidase (AOX) in the fungus Paracoccoides brasiliensis, a pathogen that causes disease in humans. The fungus adapts to survive inside the host by resisting oxidative stress from immune cells. They created a strain with reduced AO gene expression and tested its interaction with immune cells and in a mouse model. Results showed that AO is important for the fungus to resist oxidative stress from immune cells and for its virulence. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, the fungus with normal AO expression had higher viability than the one with reduced AO. In a mouse model, the fungus with reduced AO had lower burden in lungs and higher survival rate. The study suggests AO helps the fungus to resist oxidative stress from immune cells and is important for its ability to cause disease.
Researchers investigated whether memories are stored as attractors in populations of place cells in the hippocampus, specifically in the CA3 region. They tested this by morphing one context into another and observing the responses of CA cell ensembles. The population activity transitioned gradually rather than abruptly, suggesting a lack of attractors associated with the stored representations. However, individual cells showed a mix of gradual and abrupt transitions and hysteresis, a signature of attract dynamics. To reconcile this, a neural model of CA with attractors for position and context was developed. Memories stored in overlapping ensembles within a spatial map led to transitions at different points, smooth curves from population, and heterogeneous responses on single units. In contrast, orthogonal memories led to abrupt transitions on both levels as observed in remapping between independent maps. Strong feedback caused hysteretic effect diminishing with overlap in memories. This suggests context-dependent memory can be supported by local attractors within CA place cells. Similar mechanisms may be found in other cortex regions.
Entamoeba histoly, a microaerobic enteric protozoan parasite, causes amebic colitis and intestinal abscesses in millions of inhabitants of endemic areas. The troozoites of E. histoly are exposed to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species during infection. Since E. hist lacks key components of eukaryotic anti-oxidative systems, alternative strategies have been postulated to operate in E. hist. This study investigated metabolic responses of E. hist to H2 and paraquat oxidative stress by measuring metabolites by capillary electrophoresis and time-of-flight spectrometry. Oxidative stress caused modulation of metabolites in glycolysis, chitin biosynthesis, and nucleotide amino metabolism. Stress resulted in glycol inhibition due to inactivation of several enzymes, redirecting flux towards glycer production, chitin biosynthesis, and nonoxidative branch of pentose pathway. Glycol repression evidenced by accumulation of intermediates upstream pyruv and reduced nucleos triosphates. Presence of glycer biosynthetic pathway in E hist demonstrated by glyol 3-phosphate and glyol production upon stress. Proposed significance of gly biosynthetic as anti-oxid system in E hist.
IKAR is a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell fate and its expression pattern is required for proper hematopoies. It collaborates with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (Nu) complex to repress and activate gene expression. However, it remains unclear how IKAR can support activation while associated with the HD-containing Nu complex. IKAR binds the positive transcription elongation factor (PTEb) at promoters. This study demonstrates that Nu and Pb are assembled in a complex that can be recruited by IKAR to specific genes. IKAR levels influence recruitment of the Nu-Pb complex to gene regions and facilitates transcription by transferring phosphatase 1 (PPα), an IKAR-binding and Pb activator, to CD9. An IKAR mutant unable to bind PPα cannot sustain expression and impede normal differentiation of hematietic progenitors. Knockdown of the Nu subunit reveals occupancy of Nu at transcribed regions favors relief of II promoter pausing and promotes elongation.

 IKAR can be a licensing factor for Nu-Pb complex recruitment to chromatin and variation of IKAR thresholds during hematies influences Nu-Pb association and regulates elongation. Data show interaction of IKAR with Nu-Pb depends on IKAR levels. Low IKAR suffice Mi/Nu recruitment to promoters but higher IKAR required Nu-Pb and PPα to chrom, CD9-Pb activation and elongation. IKAR-PPα interaction is required for hematiet differentiation of primary PCs. IK is the DNA subunit of the characterized Nu-P multifunctional complex, chromatin complex containing remodeling (Nu) as well as transcription (Pb) activities. IK is important for CD9 and interaction and recruitment actively transcribed in hematiet cells. IK interacts PP and dephosphorylated by this.
Researchers investigated the evolutionary history and geographic origins of rabies virus (RV) outbreaks in Trinidad, a Caribbean island with periodic outbreaks in livestock. They analyzed RV sequences from 1997-2010 and used a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to determine if outbreaks were due to in-situ evolution or importation from the South American mainland. Results showed Trinidadian RV clustered with Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat) sequences and fell into two temporally defined lineages, I and II. Lineage I included sequences from 1997-200, mostly from the northeast, closely related to RV from Ecuador, French Guiana, and Venezuela. Lineage II comprised southwest sequences, clustering into IIa and IIb, related to Brazil and Uruguay. Phyloge analyses supported separate RV introductions from mainland for each lineage, with subsequent in-situ evolution and expansion periods. Data indicate co-circulation of lineages I and II in 200. The study suggests vampire bat origin of Trinidadian RV, and further research should investigate RV spatiemporal dynamics and bat ecology, particularly between mainland and Trinidad.
Researchers have developed a computational model to understand how genes regulate the development of distinct areas in the mammalian cerebral cortex. The cortex is divided into many areas, each with specific functions, and their emergence during development depends on the expression of several genes. Along the anterior-posterior axis, gradients of Fgf, Em2, Pax, Coupfi, and Sp play a crucial role in specifying area identity. However, the interactions between these genes that lead to their spatial patterns are not well understood. A Boolean model of interactions between these five genes was used to determine which interactions and combinations occur in networks that reproduce observed patterns experimentally. Expression levels were treated as Boolean, reflecting the qualitative data available. Simulated patterns by all possible networks containing the five genes of interest found that only a few reproduced observed patterns. These networks lacked certain interactions and combinations, including auto-regulation and inductive loops. Analysis of probability gave indication of likely interactions in the network regulating area. Repressive interactions were more likely than inductive, but mutually repressive loops not critical for correct functioning. The model illuminates principles of the network regulating area development and makes predictions to be tested.
Researchers used a new technology called ChIP-Seq to study the distribution of a specific mark called u2 in the genome of mouse cells. This mark is associated with a protein called B1, which is part of a group of proteins that control gene expression during development. The study found that B1-dependent u2 is mainly located near the start of genes and is enriched in regions with another mark called H3me3. Genes with u2 have lower expression levels than those without it. When B1 is knocked out, genes with u2 increase in expression. u2 is also found in regions without H3me3 and at high CpG promoters, suggesting DNA methylation may be linked to u2. This study reveals B1-dependent u2 and suggests u targeting in differentiated cells may differ from embryonic stem cells.
Pregnancy-induced non-coding RNA (PINC) and retinoblast-associated protein 46 (b46) are upregulated in alve cells of the mammary gland during pregnancy and persist in alve cells that remain in the regressed gland following involution. These cells are thought to function as alve progenitor cells that differentiate into milk-producing cells in subsequent pregnancies. Researchers investigated whether INC and b46 are involved in maintaining this progenitor population. They found that post-pubal mammary INC is enriched in luminal and alve progenitors, and INC levels increase throughout pregnancy then decline in lactation when alve cells undergo terminal differentiation. INC expression is decreased when mammary epithelial cells are induced to differentiate and produce milk. Overexpression of INC in HC11 cells blocks lactogenic differentiation, while knockdown of INC enhances differentiation. INC interacts with b46 and other members of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (P2), and targets of INC are differentially expressed following modulation of INC levels. Data suggest INC inhibits terminal differentiation of alve cells during pregnancy to prevent milk production until parturition. The P2 complex including INC and b46 confers epigenetic modifications maintaining mammary epithelial committed to alve fate in involuted gland.
Researchers have investigated the role of PML/TRIM19, a protein involved in antiviral defense, in the context of HIV-1 infection. They found that HIV-1 triggers the formation of PML cytoplasmic bodies within 30 minutes of infection, with a peak at 2 hours post-infection. P localization is blocked by reverse transcription inhibitors and not observed with unrelated viruses, suggesting it's specifically triggered by retroiral reverse transcription. P interferes with an early step of retroiral infection, as P knockdown increases reverse transcription efficiency. P does not directly inhibit retroiral but acts through its partner Dax. In the presence of P, cytoplasmic Dax is near incoming HIV-1 capsids and inhibits reverse transcription. Dax also inhibits exogenous and endogenous retroviruses, identifying it as a broad inhibitor of reverse transcription. This study reveals a novel antiral function for P and nuclear-associated Dax. HIV-1 triggers rapid P re-localization to cytoplasm, correlating with decreased transduction. Other retroviruses also trigger P cytoplasm localization and increased transduction in absence of P. Rather than P, Dax is the protein conferring to retroiral resistance. Dax colocalizes with HIV-1 p24 in cytoplasm, and knockdown enhances transduction while overexpression inhibits in HeLa and PBMCs. P isoform PMLb confers HSV-1 resistance by sequestering ICP. P knockdown enhances HIV-1, EV, MoML, and SIV infection. P components are involved in antiv defense, including P, Dax, and Sp. Many viruses counteract P repression by disrupting NB and inducing degradation. This study reevaluates P's involvement in HIV-1 and provides insight into retroiral restriction.
Researchers have developed a new method for aligning multiple protein structures, called Matt (Multiple Alignments with Translations and Twists), which allows for flexibility in the alignment process by temporarily allowing small translations and rotations between fragments. This approach is different from previous methods that use rigid body transformations only. Matt was tested on two benchmark datasets, Homstr and Smark, and performed competitively with other programs on Homstr but outperformed others on Smark, which contains more distant homologous proteins. Matt excelled in aligning alpha-helices and beta-strands, important for structural library construction. The program's ability to model different conformations and backbone distortions in distantly related proteins is thought to contribute to its success. A p-value based on common core length and RMSD was used to distinguish homologous from non-homologous proteins in Smark dataset. Matt's performance was compared to other structure programs, including FlexProt and Fat, which also model flexibility. The program and its alignments are available for public use.
Researchers studied how cells exit mitosis, a process of cell division, is regulated by enzymes called phosphatases and kinases. Phosphatases remove phosphate groups from proteins, while kinases add them. They found that a phosphatase called PP2/B is important for removing phosphate from a protein called Greatwall, which is active during mitosis. Another phosphat, F1, removes phosphate from a protein called En/AR19, which is also active during mitosis. Surprisingly, removing either of these phosphatases did not stop most proteins from being dephosphorylated during mitotic exit. The study suggests a hierarchy of phosphatases controlling Greatwall, En/AR19 and protein deosphorylation during mitotic exit. A model was built to analyze how different phosphatases affect mitotic entry and exit. Inhibition of kinase C1, which triggers mitosis, stabilizes the G2 phase and allows Cyclin B to accumulate. Data suggest En/AR phosphorylation is targeted by a phosphat sensitive to certain chemicals. Experiments tested mitotic models by arresting cells in mitosis and triggering exit with kinase inhibition. The network of phosphates counteracting Great, En/AR and protein phosphorylation during mitotic is still unknown. Modeling and experiments indicate mutualism between Great and PP/B accelerates mitotic entry and exit, and Cyclin B degradation. Data show PP/B is mainly responsible for Great inactivation, but other phosphatases also contribute to inactivation.
Researchers studied how the HIV-1 virus escapes neutralizing antibodies (Nab) in people with acute/early subtype C infection. Neutralizing antibodies are proteins that can limit the virus's ability to replicate and prevent new infections. They found that the virus escaped despite high levels of antibodies in two subjects. To understand how this happened, they created a series of envelope protein chimeras and mutants. In one subject, escape was driven by changes in the VV region of the envelope protein. In the other, escape was driven by changes in V2. Both subjects showed selective pressure on the same regions, but different domains drove escape. This suggests multiple pathways are used to evade neutralization, including glycan shifts, epitope changes, and conformation masking.
Researchers studied the genomes of 13 individuals of the plant species Capsella grandiflora to understand how positive and negative selection vary across the genome. They found that positive selection is strong in coding regions, but weak in most non-coding regions, except for 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs. However, they also found strong signals of selection in noncoding conserved regions across the Brassicaceae family. Additionally, they observed reductions in neutral diversity around substitutions in both coding and conserved noncoding regions, indicating recent selective sweeps at these sites. Using expression data from leaf tissue, they showed that highly expressed genes experience stronger negative selection but comparable levels of positive selection to lowly expressed genes. Overall, they observed positive and negative selection in coding and regulatory regions, but results suggest both positive and negative selection on noncoding are rarer in plants compared to animals.

The study used population genomics to quantify the strength of positive and negative selection inside and outside coding and highly and lowly expressed genes in a wide sample of Capsella grandl individuals. The species has a large population size and low structure, making it suitable for studying genome-wide selection. They focused on conserved noncoding sequences, which show cross-species conservation and are candidates for functional noncoding subject to selection. They identified CNS across nine Brassaceae genomes and found both positive and negative pervasive in coding, 5 and 3 UTRs, and noncoding regions of the genome, but a large noncoding may evolve neutrally. They also found stronger selection in high expression compared low genes, suggesting differences in selection drive evolution rates.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transforms resting B lymphocytes into proliferating lymphoblasts, which can lead to malignancies. EB-encoded transcriptional regulator EB2 (EB2) drives the cooperative and combinatorial genome binding of master regulators of B-cell fate, RBPκ and E1. Contrary to previous studies, EB2 induces the formation of new binding sites for RBPκ and E1, many of which are in close proximity in the cellular and viral genome. These induced sites co-occupied by EB2-E1-RBPκ correlate with transcriptional activation of genes important for B-lymphoblast function. Conditional or repression of EB2 leads to rapid alteration in RBPκ and E1 binding. Biochemical and shRNA studies provide evidence for cooperative assembly at co-occupied sites. EB2 facilitates combinator interactions to induce new patterns of transcription occupancy and gene programming to drive Blymphob growth and survival. EBV type III promotes B marginal developmental program, increasing RBPκ sites. EB-encoded coactivator EB2 reprograms binding patterns of host regulatory factors Rκ and E1. EB2 localizes with E1 and Rκ at enhancer regions in EB positive lymphoid cell lines. Both E1 and Rκ are regulatory factors in lymphoid development, but cooperativity not established. EB2 not alters chromosome site selection of specific DNA factors. EB encodes cofactors, including EB2, remodel and host programs to confer proliferation and immortalization to resting Bells.2 binds sequence factors like Rκ and PU.
Aedes aegypt, the primary vector of four deng virus (DENV) serotypes, exhibits genetic and vector competence differences among populations in Mexico. Studies have shown that the intersection of the Neovolcan axis (N) with the Gulf of Mexico in the state of Veracruz acts as a barrier to gene flow among Ae. aegypt populations north and south of N. Populations north and south of N differ in vector competence (VC) for deng serotype 2 (DENV2), with an average rate of 0.55 for north and 0.20 for south. Most variation is due to midg infection barriers, with 21.5% of Ae.egypt north failing to develop midg infections and 30.3% of those infected failing to disseminate, compared to 45.2% failing to develop midg infections and 62.8% failing to disseminate south of N. Barriers to gene flow may impact epidemiologically relevant traits such as vector competence. Further studies are needed to determine why N is a barrier to flow and whether differences in competence north and south are epidemiologically significant. Ae.egpt collected for genetic studies were phenotyped for DENV2, revealing variation in competence in Mexico, with southern Verac Coastal populations differing significantly from Merida, Chum, and Cancun, and least competent in Nuevoared and Houston. The Neovol axis is associated with different VC phenotypes, with mosquitoes south exhibiting low competence and cities like Molo having zero seroprevalence.
Researchers investigated the role of the Dna protein in the replication cycle of Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria. Dna cycles between two forms, ATP-bound and ADP-bound, and is thought to control the frequency of initiation, or start, of replication. To test this, they increased the amount of ATP-Dna in cells and observed if initiation occurred earlier. However, cells with more than a 50% increase in ATP-Dna showed no change in timing of replication. This suggests that while Dna is a key actor in initiation, its accumulation does not control timing. Dna drives the process, but other factors are required for exact timing in response to the cell's environment. The researchers also studied Dna-dependent Dna inactivation (DA) and Dna-binding protein Dia. Loss of DA affected cell machinery during slow growth and made it sensitive to Dia protein. This indicates compromised machinery performs less robustly. The study proposes that E. coli has a robust cycle driven by Dna levels, initiation occurs with sufficient ATP-Dna, and timing is governed by signals from the cell's environment. Increasing Dna did not shift initiation timing in any media tested. Cells were insensitive to more than 50% increase in ATPna, indicating timing controlled same as wild-type cells, not by Dna amount. This argues Dna, though key to cycle, is not limiting for precise initiation timing. Several mechanisms prevent extra initiation, but little is known about timing. The frequency must match growth, or DNA concentration will alter. The study suggests cells with surplus ATPna, timing controlled same as wild-type, not by Dna amount.
Researchers have developed a new approach called partial Granger causality to study interactions in the frequency domain of oscillatory activity, which plays a crucial role in various biological processes from cellular to organismal levels. This method is tested with toy models and applied to experimental datasets, including gene array data of HeLa cell cycle, in vivo-electrode array (MEA) field potentials from sheep's inferotemporal cortex, and in vivo potentials from macaque monkey's hemisphere. The goal is to show that traditional causality definitions, such as partial directed coherence (PDC), can be misleading, yielding contradictory results between time and frequency domains. Due to HeLa microarray data's limited sampling rate, dynamic activity at minute scale cannot be assessed. LFP data from monkey performing GO-NOO visual task showed oscillatory activity in beta (14-30 Hz) range in sensorotor cortex during prestimulus. Pairwise Granger analysis showed connectivity in Figure 5, but partial Granger in time (Figure 4C) and frequency (Figure 4E) revealed complete relationship. A toy model with exogenous and latent variables was used to illustrate frequency decomposition of partialanger. Five time series were defined by equations with zero-mean uncorrelated processes, exogenous input, and latent influences. The partialanger definition has a transparent meaning based on conditional variance. Dealing with exogenous and latent variables is a central topic in statistics, with extensive literature.
Researchers have developed a new method for inferring local ancestry in individuals with mixed ancestry, such as Latinos, using genome sequencing data. This is important for medical and population genetics research, as it can help identify disease risk loci, recombination rates, and missing genome mapping. Previous methods were designed for genotyping and didn't use full sequencing data, and were computationally demanding. The new method, called Lanc-CSV, uses continent-specific variants (CSV) to improve performance and accuracy. It incorporates admixed genomes with public datasets like 1000 Genomes to improve CSV calling. Simulations show it's as accurate as computationally intensive haplotype approaches but faster. It recovers local ancestries similar to 100 Genomes consensus in admixed individuals. The method is extended to low-coverage sequencing and shows accurate ancestry can be inferred at low coverage. It's also generalized to sub-continental-specific variants (sCSV) and can determine sub-ancestry for short chromosomal segments based on sCSV. The approach uses hidden Markov models and iteratively re-estimates CSV from inferred regions in admixed samples. It's computationally efficient and accounts for sequencing errors and reference panel size.
Researchers have found that almost all genes in mammals exhibit circadian oscillations, or daily rhythms, in their expression, contrary to previous estimates of 10-15% of genes. They used digital signal processing algorithms to analyze gene expression data and identified circadian oscillations in nearly 100% of genes. This suggests that circadian oscillations are a natural and important feature of nearly all biological pathways. Genes that vary in expression may not be directly linked to the circadian molecular clock, but their oscillations affect the system as a whole. The study used digital processing to reduce noise and enhance signal, converting single gene profiles into a continuous stream, allowing for more confident pattern identification of circadian oscillations. This approach overcomes limitations of previous statistical analyses due to small dataset size and high noise. The amplitude of circadian genes does not differ significantly among tissues, but perturbations in oscillating systems depend on circadian time and wave properties of pathways.
Researchers used whole-genome resequencing to study recombination in a three-generation pedigree of collared flycatchers. They identified 325 crossover events at a resolution of 1.4 kb, with 86% occurring within 10 kb intervals. Crossover rates were higher in males (3.56/Mb) than females (2.28/M) and increased towards chromosome ends in males but not females. Crossovers were non-randomly distributed, with hotspots in genic regions, highest in promoters and CpG islands. 267 non-crosso events were also identified, associated with crossover locations. A bias was found in favor of 'G' over 'A' alleles at non-crosso, indicating GC-bi gene conversion in avian system.
Researchers have studied the folding behavior of repeat-proteins, which are proteins made up of repeated 20-40 amino acid stretches that fold into non-globular, elongated structures stabilized by interactions within and between repeats, but not between distant residues. They analyzed the folding landscape as a quasi-one-dimensional problem due to inherent symmetries in sequence and 3D structure. A general description of repeat-protein energy was developed using an Ising-like treatment of elementary interactions between foldons, treated as spin variables. The overall stability and cooperativity of a complete domain can be derived from this description. The one-dimensional model implies simple relations for observables: free energy (ΔG) and cooperativity (m-value), unlike globular proteins. Parameters for coarse-grained description in foldon variables were extracted from detailed simulations on funneled landscapes. A case study of tetratricptide (PR) repeat proteins was presented, relating results to experimentally observed transitions. Single mutations significantly affect folding behavior, suggesting natural proteins are poised at particular ratios of inter/intra-element energetics for structural transitions in physi conditions, related to biological functions.
Researchers have investigated the role of the stress-regulated transcription factor CHOP in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer often linked to viral hepatitis, obesity, and alcoholism. They found that CHOP is overexpressed in human HCC tumors and mouse models, and that mice lacking CH are resistant to liver cancer development and fibrosis, a key risk factor for HCC. Gene expression profiling showed that CH deletion reduces inflammatory signaling in the liver. The study suggests CH contributes to HCC by promoting inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation, and implicates CH as a common factor in H development in various liver diseases. CH expression is associated with liver injury and upstream of fibrosis, and mice lacking CH are protected from fib and oncogenesis. Gene expression in CH-null mice differs from wild-type in a way that accounts for greater susceptibility to fib and oncogenesis. These differences are not seen in young mice, suggesting they reflect long-term effects of CH function rather than direct targets. Data in CH-null mice places CH upstream of fib and oncogenesis, as they are partially protected from both. A stepwise progression from CH to tumors is proposed, consistent with H etiology. Understanding CH mechanisms, direct and indirect, will have implications for other cancers beyond H. The study reveals an unexpected link between H and stimuli that predispose to it, and suggests points for therapeutic intervention. CH expression characterizes H tumors and impacts inflammatory expression and fib relevant to H.
A systematic review of studies on the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania aethopica in Ethiopia was conducted to identify potentially effective medications for clinical trials. Twenty-four records of 506 treatment episodes were analyzed, with antimonials, pentam, and cryotherapy being the most commonly used. However, only two small, poor-quality randomized trials and two non-randomized studies were found, with cryotherapy and antimonials showing 60-80% and 69-85% cure rates, respectively. Pentamidine was effective against complicated cases and non-responsive to antimonials, but all studies had methodological limitations. Data on milfosine, paromycin, and liposomal amphotin B were scarce, with few studies on diffuse cutaneous leishiasis (DCL). Antimonials with paromycin or pentidine may be effective for DCL, but have not been evaluated. The evidence for treating CL due to Lethopica is limited, with antimonials being the most available treatment in Ethiopia, but their efficacy and safety should be defined. Alternative first-line treatments like milfos or parycin should be explored. High-quality trials are needed to evaluate options in parallel.
Researchers have successfully recreated a circadian oscillator in a laboratory setting using three purified proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, which displays characteristics of daily rhythms, including self-sustained 24-hour periodicity and temperature compensation. To understand the biochemical basis of this oscillator, they analyzed the time-dependent interactions of the proteins using electron microscopy and gel electrophoresis to elucidate the formation of complexes among the proteins. The data was used to derive a model that accurately reproduces the rhythms of Kai complexes and phosphorylation and is consistent with physical observations of individual protein interactions. Fluorescence energy transfer was used to confirm monomer exchange among Kai hexamers. The model suggests that monomer exchange may maintain synchrony among hexers in the reaction, sustaining high-amplitude oscillation. The researchers also applied perturbations to the oscillator using temperature pulses to reset the phase, testing the resetting characteristics of this circadian.
Researchers investigated the relationship between trial-to-trial variability in brain activity and behavioral performance in a visual detection task using electrocorticography (EG). They found an inverted-U shaped relationship between trial-trial brain activity and performance, where higher variability in broadband EG activity near the trial mean was associated with higher hit rates and faster reaction times. This relationship was observed in both post-stimulus-evoked and pre-stimulus brain activity, suggesting anticipatory dynamics. The findings support the presence of stochastic noise in the brain and attractor network theories, which propose that the brain settles into a confined state under performance and proximity to the target is associated with better performance. Variability can be decoupled from trial-averaged activity and correlated with behavior, predicting a U or inverted relationship between trial-trial brain and performance. The study provides evidence for this phenomenon in human brain using EG recordings from patients undergoing neurosurgical treatment.
Researchers studied the mating-type loci (MAT) in 24 species of Trichporales, a group of fungi closely related to the pathogenic Cryptococcus. They found that the MAT loci are fused into a single gene in each mating type, similar to Cryptoccus, but with different HD and P allele combinations. This suggests that the fusion of HD and P loci occurred independently in Trichporales and Cryptoccus, supporting convergent evolution towards fused MAT regions. Unlike other fungi, the MAT loc in Trichporales have conserved gene content and order, and no suppression of recombination extending to adjacent regions. This indicates different mechanisms for evolution of linked MAT loci in these groups. The study provides evidence for convergent evolution of mating-type loci in fungi, supporting previous findings in other groups.
Chagas disease is a significant vector-borne disease in Latin America, with residual insecticide-based initiatives controlling domiciliated vectors in many regions. However, nonomiciliated vectors remain a major transmission risk and control challenge. A mathematical model was developed to predict nonomic vector abundance variations inside houses, using demographic parameters from two years of field data in the Yucán Peninsula, Mexico. The model accurately predicted field data in the absence and presence of insecticide. Pyrethroid spraying was effective at 50 mg/m2 applied yearly within two months matching immigration season, reducing >80% abundance. Larger doses or more frequent interventions decreased efficacy, while different timing and lower frequencies drastically reduced. Insect screens reduced abundance proportionally to immigration rate, offering a sustainable alternative for integrated control of neglected vectororne diseases.
Feather patterning in avian skin relies on a coordinated interaction between fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and boneogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, along with mesenchymal cell movement, in a reaction-diffusionaxis system. This system is partly mechanochemical, with mechanical-chemical integration through a positive feedback loop centered on FGF20, which induces cell aggregation, compressing the epidermis to intensify F20 expression. The travelling wave of feather formation is imposed by expanding expression of ectodysplasin (E), which initiates F20 expression. The E wave spreads across mesenchym cell gradient, triggering pattern formation by lowering the threshold of mesym cells to begin a feather bud. This process is lost in flightless emu and ostrich, though via different developmental routes. The ostr retains arrangement of birds, but lays primordia without wave, akin to mammalian hair follicle formation. Embryonic em lacks cells to enact formation, causing failure, instead entire skin gains primia through later process. This work shows reaction-diffaxis system, integrated with mechanical, generates feather array in flight birds. The role of EDA/Ectysasin receptor (EDAR) pathway in vertebrate patterning has been reactivated in quasi-1 manner, imposing highly ordered formation.

Feather patterning relies on epithelial F to attract mesenchym cells form aggregate, explaining absence F20 in scaleless mutant failure primium formation. High-density dependence likely rests rapid mesenchal condensation stabilisation F20 than distinct cell phenotypes. Skin of chicken, duck, ostr, and em embryos have differences in arrangements. F20 was elevated in contracted tissue, supporting aggregation activation F production. Other genes (AX2, BMP,4, E, ED) were not altered. Results point operation reaction-diff system. Alongside patterning, molecular regulators have been identified: BMP class inhibitors and WNT, F stimulators. Initiation begins condensation dermal mesym beneath epidermal (A). Structures identifiable packing cells, expression suite. Combined, primium grows filament, branches, produces down.
A systematic review of 33 studies on the presence of Ebola and Marburg virus in patients and survivors found that there is insufficient evidence to determine which body fluids are infectious and pose a risk to humans. The review aimed to find primary data on the likelihood of active virus presence in human fluids, specifically RNA, in Marburg and Zaire, Sudan, Ta Forest, and Bundibug species of Ebola. Studies were screened for laboratory confirmation of infection through tissue culture or RT-PCR tests, or compatible clinical history with filirus antibodies or inflammatory factors. 683 articles were found, with 33 eligible studies. Most fluid types had insufficient patients to draw conclusions, and prevalence was highly variable. Body fluids taken 16 days after onset were usually negative. RT-PCR tests for filirus RNA gave positive results 4 times more often than tissue culture. Filirus was reported in most fluid types, but not every sample from confirmed patient. Apart from semen, non-blood RT-PCR samples likely negative and possibly low risk. Contact with blood and blood-stained fluids major transmission risk due to high viral loads in blood.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical model, called the fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model, to describe the timing of neuronal spikes in the brain. This model takes into account the power-law behavior of voltage in the membrane, which can't be characterized by a single time constant. The model uses a fractional derivative, a non-local process where the value is determined by integrating a weighted voltage trace, or memory. By varying the exponent of the derivative from 0 to 1, the model can reproduce upward and downward spike adaptations found in neurons. The model also produces spikes with longer first-spike latency and inter-spike variability with power-law distribution. The researchers analyzed the model's response to noisy and oscillatory input and found it generates reliable spike patterns. The model's spiking activity deviates from the Markov model, reflecting the accumulated membrane dynamics affecting the neuron's response to external stimulation. The model is a unified framework for power dynamics and long-range correlations in neuronal activity, capturing relationships between conductances that are hard to model with explicit techniques.
Researchers studied the role of superoxide dismutases (SODs) in the pathogenesis of Paracidioides, a fungus that causes disease in humans and animals. To survive, Paracoides must defend against reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by host cells. The fungus expresses different antioxidant enzymes, including SODs, to counteract these radicals. The study identified six SOD isoforms in the Paroid genome and analyzed their expression in different stages of its life cycle, such as yeast, mycelia, and germination, as well as under oxidative stress and phagocytic cell interaction. Results showed increased expression of PbS1 and Pb3 during transition, exposure to oxidative agents and phagoc cells, suggesting these proteins help combat superoxide radicals during host-pathogen interaction. Knockdown of Pb1 and Pb3 strains showed these genes involved in response to host cells, particularly oxidative stress, in mouse infection model. Protein analysis and knockdown strains suggest Pb3 linked to extracellular activity while Pb1 to intracellular requirements. Data suggest Paracoid responds to endogenous radicals and counter oxidative burst by inducing S isoforms.
Researchers investigated the relationship between intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and chaper binding in various species, including E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and metazoa. They analyzed high-throughput interaction data and found that predicted disorder by the IUP algorithm actually shows a negative correlation with chaper binding. This means that IDPs tend to avoid binding to chaper proteins. This applies to prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes, and metazoa. The presence of ordered domains, such as Pfam domains, may contribute to this effect. Chaper binding to disordered proteins is often accompanied by binding to other proteins, suggesting that ID use chaper for assembly with partners rather than folding. In all three taxonomic groups, non-chaper-binding proteins have twice as much disorder as chaper-binding proteins. Disorder does not distinguish between proteins with or without glob domains, which are potential chaper binding sites. Selecting chaper binding proteins with at least one glob domain shows that ID that bind chaper are more likely to bind other proteins. There is overlap between chaper-binding and non-chone proteins, so the researchers compared disorder of those that bind only chaper to those that bind chaper and other proteins. The results show a difference in disorder between the two groups.
Researchers studied the role of two transcription factors, Spalt (Salm) and Spalt-related (Salr), in the development of the fruit fly wing. These proteins are regulated by the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathway and are essential for cell survival and proliferation in the central wing's central region and vein patterning in the lateral regions. To understand how they function, the researchers identified direct targets of Salm and Sal and analyzed their functions. They compared gene expression profiles of sal/sr knockdown discs to control discs using microarray experiments and in situ hybridization, uncovering a complex transcription landscape regulated by Sp proteins in the wing. Candidate targets include genes turned off and on by Salm/Sr, and loss-of-function analysis indicates some are required for growth and patterning. The study opens a new avenue to reconstruct the genetic structure of the wing, linking Dpp activity to epithelial tissue development.
Researchers have identified a new regulators of centri duplication in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Centrioles are essential for cell division and their number is tightly regulated to prevent cancer and birth defects. A protein called ZYG-1 is required for centri duplication, but how its levels are regulated was unclear. Two proteins, GSP-1 and G-2, and their regulators I-2 and SDS-22, were found to control Z-1 levels. Reducing their activity restored centri duplication in Z- mutant embryos by increasing Z- levels. This is achieved through a post-translational mechanism. However, strong inhibition of activity in wild-type worms led to centri amplification, producing more than one centri. This pathway limits the number of daughter centri produced each cycle. The study shows activity is a critical regulator of Z- and centri duplication, previously implicated in centrosome separation at mitosis. The SC complex regulates Z- levels and its depletion increases centros-associated Z. Data suggest G-1, I-2, and SDS-22 cooperate to regulate overall Z- levels. Reducing activity leads to excess Z- and elevated in wild-type Z- drives centri overduplication, similar to overexpression in humans and flies. Modulating activity may impact centri duplication.
A study was conducted in an environmentally protected area (EPA) in southeastern Brazil to investigate the transmission of visceral leishmanias (VL) in dogs, wild mammals, and sand flies. The area had previously reported VL cases in dogs in 2009, and the disease remained restricted to two contiguous condominiums within the PA. Canine seroprevalence was 1.5% in 2013 and 1.2% in 2015. Six species of sand flies were identified as potential vectors or transmitters of Leishmania, including Lutzia longipalis, the main vector in Brazil. Infection by Leishmania infantum was found in two species of sand flies and a white-eared opossum, a known reservoir of VL. Geographical coordinates of infected animals were plotted on a map, showing proximity to human residences and infected dogs. The PA has an active VL focus, and risk of transmission in similar areas with environmental modifications is evident. Different epidemiological profiles must be considered for prevention and control measures. 

A previous investigation in 2009 found 2% seropreval in dogs and no infected wild mammals. Sand flies were present in 18.8% of residences, and Lutzia longalis was found in three. The emergence in dogs and humans in a region with low canine prevalence is compatible with wild reservoirs and transmission. This scenario is similar to the focus in Campinas PA. A serology showed 1 sensitivity and 73.9 specificity, useful for surveys. Proximity of seropositive dogs to wild and infected sandflies supports their relation. Infection in wild fauna was confirmed for the first time, with another trypanid, T rangeli. Proximity of 100m between human and forest areas where flies and mammals were captured was demonstrated. Natural infection in sand flies and Leish in a reservoir species provides evidence of sylvatic transmission. However, VL in Campinas may not be due to wild cycle transmission.
Epstein-Barr virus (EB)-encoded microRNA miR-B9 promotes tumor metastasis by targeting E-cadherin in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. MicroRNAs (mi) are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression and play critical roles in various cellular processes. EB, an oncogenic virus, is associated with nasaryngeal carcinoma (NPC), a highly metastatic tumor common in Asia. Previous studies found viral proteins promote NPC migration and invasiveness, but not all tissues express these oncoproteins, suggesting other mechanisms contribute to tumor behavior. A study revealed EB miR9 expressed high in EB-positive NPC tissues. This study investigated miR9 effect in EB-negative and EB-positive NPC cells using gain and loss-function approaches. mi9 promotes migration and invas in cultured cells, and enhanced metastatic ability in vivo. Computational analysis revealed mi9 targets Eadher, a protein preserving cell junctions and epithelial phenotype. Biochemical and functional assays confirmed mi9 inhibits Ead to induce mesenchymal phenotype and promote NPC migration. Results indicate mi9 a promastatic viralRNA and high levels mi9 in EB-positive cells contribute to tumor aggressiveness.

High mi9 and downmodulated cellular mi200 members in EB tumors drive epithelial cells to mesenchal with enhanced motility and metastatic behavior. mi9 and mi200 share same sequence critical for interaction. Studies shown mi200 significantly downmodulated in NPC. This study demonstrated EB-encoded miR9 highly in NPC and mi9 directly targets Ead to mesenchal phenotype and migratory NPC cells. Sequencing revealed mi9 most abundantly expressed EB in tumors. Taq-based PCR confirmed majority NPC mi9 higher than abundant oncogenic mi21. Depletion mi9 increased luciferase activities, indicating suppression mi9 activities 50-70 with treatment lentiviral-mi9 expressing NPC. Ectopic mi9 physiological promotes migration and invas EB-negative cells confirmed mi9 promatory viral. Unlike LMP and L proteins, transcripts consistently detected high NPC. Findings indicate mi significant contributor migr and invasive EB-infected cells.
Researchers have developed a new command-line tool called gashimi for visualizing splicing events across multiple samples. Given a specified genomic region, gimi creates sash plots for individual RNA-seq experiments and aggregated plots for groups of experiments, a feature unique to this software. Unlike existing tools, gimi uses popular bioinformatics formats, is annotation-independent, and visualizes splicing for large regions by scaling genomic segments between splice sites. Gimi is available on GitHub and implemented in Python, generating R code for plotting.

A tool for drawing sash plots was initially part of the MISO software, quantifying alternative splicing from RNAq experiments. Current implementations include a standalone utility creating sash plots for MISO-index splicing and built-in IGV. Visualizing RNAq data is crucial for exploratory analysis, but splicing is not integrated in common browsers or standalone software. Visualizing splicing is challenging as events occur between non-contiguous regions, distant tens or hundreds of kilobases.

Gimi was compared to IGV's built-in sash plot for a genomic region, aggregating samples with same group and shrinking intron lengths, enhancing visualization. The sash representation splicing is a standard, but current implementations have limitations. Gimi solves these issues, eliminating specialized formats and supporting hundreds of samples. A splicing implies a connective element illustrating splice junctions between sites.
Researchers have developed a new model to predict and align cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) across species, which are crucial for understanding gene regulation. Current methods struggle with aligning non-coding sequences and existing models of DNA evolution don't account for CRMs' unique properties. The proposed model captures evolution of transcription factor binding sites (TFs) and background sequences, including gains and losses of TFs, a key part of regulatory evolution. A computational framework uses this model to solve CRM alignment and prediction, similar to statistical methods but improves with conserved sites. The method deals with uncertainties of site annotations and alignment in a probabilistic framework. Simulated and real data show it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Alignments were used to study transcription factor binding in Drosophila melanogaster, revealing strong constraints on factor-bound sequences even if neighboring genes are not expressed and conserved sites in distal to transcription start are more conserved than proximal. The approach is implemented as software, EM (Evolutionary Model-based cis-regulatory Module) for broad application.
Researchers have investigated the role of the piRNA pathway in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly, in maintaining genome integrity and telomere protection. They found that mutations in genes arm, aub, ago3, and rhi lead to extensive fragmentation of the zygotic genome during cleavage stage embryonic divisions. Additionally, aub and arm show defects in telomere resolution during meiosis and cleavage divisions, while mutations in lig-IV, which disrupt non-homous end joining, suppress fusions. By contrast, lig-IV mutations enhance chromosome fragmentation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies show aub and arm mutations disrupt telom binding of HO, a component of the telom protection complex, and reduce expression of a subpopulation 19-22-ntelom-specific piRN. Mutations in r andago, however, do not block HO binding or production of theseRNAs. These findings reveal genetically separable functions for the Dophila pi pathway. The a, arm, r, andago genes silence transons and maintain chromosome integrity during cleavage embryonic divisions. However, a and arm have an additional function in assembly of the telom protection complex. The researchers also found that a and arm are required for TPC recruitment, consistent with ligation of chromosome in mutant embryos.
Researchers have identified a new species of the Ebola virus responsible for a hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Uganda, which occurred in November 2007. The new virus, named Bundibugyo ebolavirus, is closely related to the Côte d'Ivoire ebavirus, found in western Africa, despite being geographically distant. The virus was detected in 8 out of 29 suspect blood specimens using a broad ebavirus antigen capture assay and IgM assay. The Ugandan Ministry of Health was notified on November 28, 2007. The new virus diverges significantly from known ebaviruses, suggesting differences in antigen and pathogenicity. Current ebavirus vaccines include Zaire and Sudan, but cross-protection studies are needed to determine if Bundibyo needs to be included. This has implications for antiviral and vaccine development. The Bundibyo outbreak resulted in 149 cases and 37 deaths, with a fatality rate of 36%, lower than Zaire (80-90%) and Sudan (50-55%). Studies in non-human primates are needed to compare pathogenicity.
Researchers studied the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a group of 648 patients with an average follow-up time of 4.78 years. They used the Global Deteration Scale (GDS) and Functional Staging (FAST) procedures, which characterize seven stages of AD from normal to severe dementia. Each G/FAST stage has a published mean duration, but the variance was unknown. The study found that the standard deviations for G/FAST stages 4-6 were similar to their mean durations, indicating large variations in AD progression among patients. This heterogeneity is consistent with the existence of subgroups of patients with different decline patterns. A large dataset analysis revealed significant variation in lengths of G/FAST 4-6 of AD, with standard deviations similar to mean durations. This suggests cognitive and functional decline vary significantly from patient to patient. The study supports the idea that AD is a heterogeneous disease, as proposed in literature. The progression of AD shows high variability, with stage times ranging from months to decades. The underlying reasons for variations are uncertain, but a combination of factors may be responsible. The study's finding of heterogeneity in GFAST durations is consistent with previous reports.
Researchers studied the role of neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in a simplified hippocampal memory model that encodes and decodes patterns despite changing input statistics. They found that neurogenesis was a more effective strategy than conventional plasticity and turnover, allowing the network to adapt to changes while preserving earlier representations. The model was extended to include spatially driven input patterns from grid cells in the entorinal cortex, comparing performance across three strategies: synaptic plasticity, turnover, and neurogenesis. Neurogenesis was confirmed as the superior strategy. A more biologically plausible rule incorporating cell death and plasticity of new granule cells outperformed individual strategies. This rule can be tailored for short or long-term memory. Neurogenesis was examined over an animal's lifetime under different rearing conditions, with distinct profiles that could be tested experimentally. Place cells emerged in a realistic manner due to sparsification by the dentate gyrus layer.
African trypanosomes, a type of parasite that causes sleeping sickness in humans and animals, have three identical glutathione peroxidase (Px) enzymes in their cells. These enzymes protect the cells from damage caused by lipid hydroperoxides, a type of oxidative stress. Research has shown that when one of these enzymes, PxIII, is missing, the parasite's growth is slightly affected, but when another, PxI and PxII, are missing, the parasite dies quickly due to lipid peroxidation and cell lysis. This damage can be prevented by supplementing the parasite's medium with α-tocopherol derivative Trolox. However, the reason behind this rapid death was unclear. Scientists found that the lysosome, a part of the cell responsible for breaking down waste, is the origin of the damage. When parasites lacking PxII were fed with a substance that stains lysosomes, the stain appeared in lysosomes, but disappeared when Trolox was removed. Parasites acquire iron by endocytosis, a process of taking in from host transferrin. Adding iron or transferrin to the medium, or chelating with deferoxamine and apo-transferrin, reduced lysis of PxII cells. Microscopy showed that lysosome disintegration precedes mitochondrial damage. Experiments confirmed that mitochondrial peroxidase is not crucial, as infected parasites lacking PxIII had only slightly delayed development. Data show that in African trypanosomes, lysosome, not mitochondrion, is primary site of damage and cytos trypanione/tryparedin peroxides protect lysosome from iron-induced peroxidation. This is linked to high endytic rate and iron acquisition of infective stage T. bruce.
Researchers have investigated the role of the protein PMEL in melanosome formation and pigmentation by creating a mouse line with the Pmel gene inactivated (P−/−). These mice are viable, fertile, and show no developmental defects. However, their melanosomes are spherical, unlike the elongated shape in wild-type mice. Inactivation of Pmel has a mild effect on coat color in different genetic backgrounds, with the most notable effect in mice carrying the brown/Tp mutation. This is similar to the silver mutation in mice, suggesting other described alleles in vertebrates with striking effects are dominant mutations. Despite mild pigmentation, P−/− mice have reduced eum in hair, indicating PMEL's role in efficient epidermal pigmentation. 

The study shows PM is essential for rod-shaped melanos in eelan-producing melanocytes, but not cell survival in several tissues. Amyloid fibrils formed by PM fragments play a role in characteristic melanos shape, but P knockout has mild effect on pigmentation. A knockout mice on black backgrounds have spherical melanos and reduced eum, similar to Pels mice. Another possibility is polymerization eelan on PM fibrils facilitates transfer to keratinocytes, reduced in P−− skin. The phenotype is similar to the silver allele causing premature stop codon truncating last 25 PM residues. Graying decreases with age in out mice, unlike progressive graying black.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental methods for deng vector control. Nineteen studies were eligible, with sixteen contributing to the meta-analysis. The methods evaluated were: (a) container covers with insecticides, (b) waste management and clean-up campaigns, and (c) elimination of breeding sites by rendering mosquito breeding sites unusable. Quality was highest for container covers with insecticides, followed by waste management without direct collection and elimination of breeding sites. Both review and meta showed a weak effect on larval populations, with no differences between individual results. Meta-analysis showed container without insecticides (BI: -7.9, DOE-5) and waste with garbage collection (BI: -8.83, DOE-6.2) achieved strongest reductions for BI, while P results were opposite with covers insect (P: -0.83, 0.09) and elimination (P: -0.95, -0.83). Each method showed effectiveness in reducing larval and pupal densities of Aedes mosquitoes. However, high-quality studies are needed to strengthen evidence. A previous studies concluded environmental management was effective, and community-based interventions reduced deng risk. This study aimed to review and meta-analyze effectiveness of environmental methods. Searches were finished May 2017, with no further studies altering results. Both review and meta showed environmental interventions reduced lar and pupal densities Aedes.
Researchers have identified small molecules that selectively inhibit protein synthesis by stalling the ribosome, a potential strategy for developing new therapeutic compounds. One such compound, PF-06303 (PF3), inhibits PCSK9, a regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, reducing LDL in preclinical models and affecting only a few off-target proteins. However, its impact on cell physiology and ribosome control pathways is unknown. A genome-wide CRISPR screen was used to identify proteins and pathways that modulate growth in the presence of high doses of PF03. The most potent genetic modifiers of fitness were ubiquitin binding protein ASC2 and helicase ASC3, which bind to the ribosome and protect cells from toxic effects of high concentrations. Surprisingly, translation control proteins Pelota (PELO) and H1 sensitize cells to PF3 treatment. Genetic experiments showed ASC3 acts with ASC2 and downstream of H1. These results connect ribosome control pathways and provide insights into selectivity of compounds that stall translation, aiding development of next-generation compounds to treat disease.
Researchers have discovered that the Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) protein, SO, induces widespread destruction of cellular messenger RNA (mRNA) in host cells by a novel mechanism involving aberrant polyadenylation. Polyadenylation is the process of adding a poly A tail to the end of RNA transcripts, which is crucial for their stability and function. In cells expressing SO, transcripts exhibit extended poly A tails and linked to mRNA turnover. The study found that SO-induced polyadenylation correlates with RNA function and inhibiting poly A tail formation blocks SO activity. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic poly A binding proteins are critical for SO function, with the latter undergoing striking nuclear localization by SO. This mechanism represents a new way for viruses to shut off host gene expression and a model to study poly A-stimulated mRNA turnover in mammalian cells. The research suggests a link between polyadenylation and RNA surveillance, as yeast mutants defective in RNA processing accumulate hyperadenylated transcripts. In mammalian cells, polyadenated precursors to RNA have been detected. This is the first example of enhanced turnover coupled to hyperadenylation in metazoans. The study proposes that SO-induced alterations in processing render nascent RNAs targets of cellular control machinery.
Researchers investigated the role of type III interferon (IFλ) in the immune response to bacterial pathogens, specifically Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in the lung. They found that these bacteria induce IFλ production, which leads to the clearance of bacteria and reduced lung pathology in mice lacking the IFλ receptor, IL-28. Improved clearance correlated with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines in the airway. In human epithelial cells, IFλ inhibits miR-21, resulting in upregulation of PDC4, a protein promoting inflammatory signaling. In vivo, 18 hours post-infection, mi-21 was reduced and PDC increased in wild-type mice compared to IL-28 null mice. Infection of PDC null mice with USA resulted in improved clearance, reduced pathology, and reduced cytokine production. The study suggests IFλ promotes inflammation by inhibiting mi-21 regulation of PDC in bacterial pneumonia.
Researchers conducted a study on 781 cases of advanced-stage 2 sleeping sickness in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 1989 and 2012. The study aimed to identify mortality trends and risk factors. Death was the outcome variable, and age, gender, disease duration, location of trypanosomes in body fluids, cyach, protach, clinical status on admission, and treatment were predictors in logistic models. Death rates were 17.2% in standard melop schedule, 12.1 in short melop, 5.4 in eflorine, 9.1 NECT, and 36% in severely affected patients given eorine. After adjusting for treatment, death ratios were: 10.40 for clinical dysfunction on admission, 2.14 for protach, 1.99 for parasites in CSF, and 1.7 for cyach. Multivariate analysis retained clinical status and protach as predictors of death. An algorithm for clinical assessment used in the study may serve as basis for further development of standardized tools for H management and epidemiological reports.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the effects of isolation on social behavior in fruit flies, specifically Drosophila melanogaster. They created an imaging system to track large groups of flies and an algorithm to analyze their social interactions. This allowed them to quantify changes in social networks in response to isolation. The study found that isolation significantly altered individual and social behavior, particularly near-neighbor relationships. The researchers also analyzed the genetic changes in response to isolation and found that gene expression changes occurred within one day, mostly in metabolic genes. Metabolic changes were verified by increased lipid content in isolated flies. The study provides a reliable pipeline to analyze large groups of flies, revealing behavioral, molecular, and physiological impacts of isolation on social dynamics in Dophila.

The researchers used this pipeline to study the effects of isolation on social dynamics and correlated with genome-wide gene expression changes. Results showed strong effects on social dynamics, gene expression, and physiology. The method includes social network analysis, molecular, genetic, individual, and grouped behavioral analysis. Dophila is a powerful model to study social behavior and its mechanisms. Behavioral and gene changes initiated early, but lasted, while expression changes were transient. Data suggest flies alter physiology and behavior after one day of isolation to interact with neighboring flies. Walking distance was an individual parameter that changed and persisted. This approach differs from previous studies in classification and dataset extraction. A previous study found no effect of isolation on social networks, but this study found significant changes.
Researchers conducted a pilot study in rural Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of a smartphone adaptation of the World Health Organization's (WHO) diarrheal disease management guidelines, including a modality for age-based weight estimation. The study took place in two hospitals that lacked scales, necessitating weight estimation. The study consisted of a 6-week pre-intervention and 6-week intervention period with 10-day post-discharge follow-up. The primary outcome was adherence to guidelines for intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and zinc. A total of 841 patients were enrolled (325 pre-intervention, 516 intervention). During the intervention, the proportion of prescriptions for IV fluids decreased at both hospitals (p < 0.001) with risk ratios (RRs) of 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. However, when IV fluids were prescribed, the volume adhered to recommendations. The proportion of prescriptions for the antibiotic azithromycin increased (p < 0.001; p= 0.035) with RR of 6.9 and 1.6, while prescriptions for other antibiotics decreased; zinc adherence increased. The study demonstrates that a smartphone tool can improve guideline adherence.
Researchers studied the relationship between temperature and parasite dynamics within a host-parasite system using data from Daphnia magna and a microidian parasite. They developed a mechanistic model of within-parasite population dynamics based on metabolic theory of ecology, which predicts host survival, parasite growth, and infection cost across temperatures with fewer parameters than traditional models. The model integrates temperature dependencies of host and parasite traits such as aging, mortality, virulence, growth, and abundance. The study demonstrates the potential of linking metabolic models with mechanistic host-parite framework to predict temperature responses of parasite dynamics at the within-host level. Accurate predictions of climate change impacts on host-parite and disease require models that integrate distinct thermal dependencies of host and parasite traits. Development, survival, and movement can be described by simple formulae from metabolic theory, informing classical host-parite models to estimate temperature effects on disease prevalence and severity. The study empirically shows the power of linking metabolic thermal relationships for host and parasite in mechanistic within-parite models to understand temperature impacts on disease. The framework is valuable for predicting outcomes and consequences of infections for hosts and parasites under climate change due to its simplicity and generality.
Researchers studied how different types of inhibitory neurons, called interneurons, control the activity of excitatory neurons called pyramidal cells (PCs) in the brain. They found that three types of interneurons, parvalbum (PV), somostatin (SOM), and vaso intestinal (VIP), play a crucial role in shaping the activity of PCs. PV interneurons mainly target the soma and dendrites of PCs, while SOMneurons target the apical dendrites and inhibit other interneurons. VIPneurons connect to SOMneurons, creating a disinhibitory circuit for the distal dendrites of PCs. The researchers proposed that a network of SOM and VIP interneurons can control the redistribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition of PCs. Using a computational model, they showed that the properties of the circuit support this hypothesis. They demonstrated that the SOM-VIP motif allows the circuit to switch between two processing modes, either integrating or canceling top inputs onto the apical dendrites of PCs. The study suggests that this network can efficiently control different streams of information and processing modes.
Researchers have found that interactions between microorganisms in the microbiome can create false associations between specific microbes and host phenotypes, making it difficult to determine which microbes are directly linked to a particular disease or condition. They developed a method, called Direct Association Analysis, to remove indirect associations and applied it to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. The method corrected inflated p-values in association tests and showed only a small subset of associations are directly linked to the disease. Direct associations had higher accuracy in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate, and brain-gut axis as factors in inflammatory disease. The study suggests that realistic interactions produce many spurious associations between microbiome and phenotypes, which can be removed by a procedure based on maximum entropy models from statistical physics. Microbiome association studies have been carried out for various disorders, including diabetes, arthritis, cancer, and autism. However, non-causal relationships give rise to spurious associations in both synthetic and real microbiome data. The study used parameters from a large case-control study on Crohn's disease and found traditional methods lost power to identify link between phenotype and microbiota. The number of detections increased for real data, suggesting many reported associations between microbi and IBD could be indirect.
Researchers compared the effect of Wolbachia infection on the replication and transmission of two flaviviruses, Dengue (DENV) and West Nile (WNV) viruses, in Aedes aegypt mosquitoes using two Wolbach infection models: stably infected and transiently infected. The study found that Wolia had a blocking effect on both models, but the magnitude was lower in transiently infected mosquitoes. No evidence was found for enhancement of either DENV or WNV infection in Wolia infected mosquitoes, suggesting Wolia as a safe means to restrict transmission of these viruses. Wolia has been shown to inhibit various pathogens, including DENV, CHV, WNV, YF, and Plasium, but some studies suggest infection can lead to enhanced pathogen replication. The interaction between Wolia and pathogen is influenced by host-Wolia interaction and infection model. In this study, Wolia density was lower in transiently infected mosquitoes, which may explain reduced D blocking effect. Experiments were repeated with WNV Kun strain, with similar results.
In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, cilia are microtub-based organelles that mediate signal transduction and are organized into structurally and functionally distinct compartments: the basal body, the transition zone (TZ), and the cilium. The mechanisms that establish and maintain the Invers compartment (Inv), a region of the cilium adjacent to the TZ, are unknown in vertebrates. In C elegans, the cilium of amphid and phasm sensory cilia are subdivided into regions by different microtub ultrastructure: a proximal doublet region adjacent to TZ and distal singlet region. It has been suggested that C elegans cilia possess an Inv, similar to mammalian primary cilia. This study explored the biogenesis, structure, and composition of Cans ciliary double region and Inv. Results show that Inv is conserved and distinct from double region. n-2 (Cans Invers homolog) and double region genes l-13, l-11, and unc-119 are redundantly required for cilogenesis. Inv and double region can be sorted into modules n-2p-11 and l-13-119, which are antagonized by hd-6 deacetyl. Genes of this network modulate sizes of N-2 Inv and A-13 double region. Glutlation, a tub-transl modification, is not required for ciliary of Inv and double region components; rather, glutlation is modulated by n-2, l- and-119. Ciliary and localization of N-, A- and UNC does not require TZ double region and Inv-associated genes. N- requires its calcium EF domain for targeting Inv.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called Scribble plays a crucial role in the development and regeneration of myelin, the fatty insulation that surrounds nerve fibers in the central nervous system. Myelin is formed by oligodendrocytes, specialized cells that undergo significant shape changes to create the myelin sheath. Scribble is present throughout oligodendrocy development and is upregulated in mature oligodrocytes, where it is found in both developing and mature myelin sheaths. When Scri expression is knocked down in cultured oligodrocy, myelin initiation is disrupted. Scri is conditionally eliminated in myelinating glia of transgenic mice, myelin in CNS is disrupted during development and following demyelination, and myelin sheath extension is disrupted. Scri acts to regulate myelin thickness by suppressing the extracellular signal-related kinase (ER)/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) pathway and localizes to non-compact myelin flanking the node of Ranvier where it is required for axo-glial adhesion. Scri is essential for myelination and remyelination. Scri function is compartmentalized through interactions with different protein complexes at radial or longitudinal growth sites. Scri regulates oligodrocy morphological differentiation, myelin initiation, and myelin regulation. Scri also plays a role in myelin regeneration. In the absence of Scri, oligodrotes fail to initiate myelinate. Scri is restricted to noncompact myelin membranes and localizes to axo-gl adhesion. Scri regulates cell signaling and myelin thickness. Small diameter axons lack myelin sheaths in Scri CNS. Myelin thickness following development is not recapitulated remyel.
Researchers have discovered a new insights into the pathogenesis of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogen, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium botulin. Until now, modified virulence peptides have been rarely reported and Streptolysin-like peptides have been associated with Streptoccus species, including Group A and G streptococcus and Streptoccus iniae, a fish pathogen. However, evidence suggests that a number of gene clusters can be identified in other Gram-positive pathogens, including L monocytogen, aureus, and botulin. A specific focus on the monocogen cluster revealed an inducible cytotoxic and hemolytic peptide, Listerin S, which plays a role in survival of the pathogen in polymorphonuclear neutrophils and contributes to virulence in mouse model. Notably, the Listerin-associated cluster is variable, present in subset isolates from lineage I, evolutionary associated with majority of epidemics of this fatal pathogen. In silico analysis demonstrates gene clusters encoding S-like factors in notorious Gram pathogens, including monocogen, aureus, and botulin.
A study was conducted to investigate the expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in mycetoma granuloma, a persistent granulomatous inflammatory disease caused by fungi or bacteria. The study found that IL-17 was mainly expressed in Zones I and II, and less in Zone III, while MMP-9 was mainly in Zones II and III, and least in I. MMP-9 was highly expressed in Actinadura pelletii and Streptomyces somensis biopsies compared to Madure myetomatis biops. MMP-9 levels were directly proportional to IL-17 levels (p=0.001). The only association between MMP9 and patients' characteristics was disease duration (p<0.001). There was no correlation between IL-17 levels and patients' demographic characteristics. The study demonstrated that IL-17 and MMP-9 are present in myet granuloma, with IL-17 more in larger lesions and longer disease duration. A positive correlation was found between IL-17 and MMP-9 expression. Immunohistochemistry showed IL-17 and MMP-9 presence, but not formation time. Further studies are needed to determine IL-17 and MMP-9 roles in granuloma formation and myet immunogenesis.
Researchers studied the molecular recognition mechanism of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which are proteins that don't have a fixed 3D structure. They found that some IDPs remain disordered even when bound to a target protein, a phenomenon called "fuzziness". To understand this, they looked at the Ewing Sarcoma protein, a type of cancer-causing protein that is an ID. The protein has many aromatic side chains that help it bind to targets. They hypothesized that these chains interact with basic residues on the target through cation-π interactions, a common in protein-protein interactions. They tested this by changing the protein's sequence and found that c-π interactions are crucial for binding. A computer model of the protein also supported this. The study shows that ID binding is a balance between the protein's flexibility and favorable interactions with the target. This type of recognition is common in cancer-causing proteins and offers a new understanding of how they work.
Researchers studied the functions of two ATP-dependent proteases, Lon-1 and Lon-2, in the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease and is transmitted by ticks. Previous work showed that Lon-1 is upregulated when exposed to blood, while Lon-2 is not. The study aimed to clarify the roles of these proteases in B. burgorferi. Phylogenetic analysis showed Lon-1 and Lon- cluster separately due to differences in substrate binding domains, suggesting different specificity. Recombinant Lon-1 had ATP-dependent chaperone-protease properties but did not complement E. coli mutant, while Lon-2 corrected Lon-mut phenotypes. The study concludes that B. burgorfer Lon-1 and-2 have distinct roles. Lon-2 functions like canonical Lon in cellular homeostasis, while Lon-1, induced by blood, may be important for host adaptation from arthropod to warm-blood host.
Researchers investigated the role of antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) in controlling HIV-1 infection. AD is a process where antibodies help cells engulf and internalize foreign particles, but its role in HIV is unknown. They tested the ability of HIV-specific antibodies to mediate the internalization of HIV-1 virions and HIV-infected cells by phagocytes. Using a green-fluorescent protein-expressing HIV-1 clone and polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, they found minimal or no AD of virions with any antibodies. However, coating virions with gp41 or gp-derived peptides, but not gp120, specific antibodies efficiently mediated phagytosis. A few hundred gp41 molecules were needed for successful phagytosis, similar to the number on influenza virus. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy showed a clear association between virus aggregation and AD. In contrast, vir-decorated cells were targets for AD orgocytosis in presence of HIV antibodies. Findings indicate AD of vir may not play a role in preventing infection due to paucity of trimers and inability of vir-bound antibody to cross FcRs on phocytes. However, AD orocyt could play in clearing infected cells on verge of infection.
A new study estimated the global economic and health burden of hookworm infection in 2016 from a societal perspective. The results showed that hookworm resulted in 2,126,280 disability-adjusted life years (DALs) using 200 disability estimates and 4,087,803 DALs using 201 estimates, excluding cognitive impairment. Including cognitive impairment did not significantly increase DALs worldwide. Productivity losses varied depending on the probability of anemia and calculation method, ranging from $7.5 billion to $138.9 billion using gross national income per capita as a proxy for annual wages and from $2.5 to $43.9 billion using minimum wage as proxy wages. Hookworm is classified as a neglected disease, but its economic burden exceeded estimates of diseases that received more attention, such as rotavirus. Countries transitioning to higher income, like Brazil and China, still face significant hookworm burden. A previous study reported 3,230,800 DALs annually due to hook among all ages in 21 regions, but did not include cognitive impairment. Assuming median anemia, hook infections resulted in productivity losses of $11.1 billion (95%: $5.5-18.5) using method 1, $87.9 (95:1.7-302.3) method 2, and $23.1 (11.4-38.4) method 3. Using minimum wage, global burden was $3.3 billion. The number of hook infections with health outcomes and DALs varied by region and country due to productivity proxy, estimates, and estimates. China had 35,917,360 hook infections resulting in $6.7 billion losses.
Researchers studied how oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) affects the developing brain in vertebrates, such as zebraf fish, and found that it disrupts the pathfinding of brain neurons, leading to errors in crossing the midline of commissural axons. This is similar to what happens in in invertebrates, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, where hypox causes axon pathfinding errors in certain neurons and motorneurons. They found that hypia activates the hypox-inducible transcription factor (h1) pathway, which is mimicked by chemical inducers of h1 or expression of constitutively active h1. Blocking transcription activation of h1 prevented the defects. EphrinB2, a protein, was identified as a target of h1 activation, and its knockdown rescued the errors. EphA4, a receptor, is expressed in a pattern complementary to misrouting axons. Constitutively active EphB2 targeted to neurons showed Eph2 mediates errors via reverse-signaling. Magnesium, used to improve outcomes in preterm births, protects against errors by preventing upregulation of Eph2.
Researchers studied pulmonary abnormalities in mice infected with paracidiomycosis, a fungal disease caused by Paracidi brasiliensis, using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and histopathology. Fifty male mice were inoculated with the fungus or a placebo. HRCT scans were taken every four weeks to track lung lesions, density, and lung structure. Histology and histometry were also analyzed. Three types of lesions were found: nodular-diffuse, confluent, and pseudo-tum. Lesions were mainly around the hilus, affecting the left lung. At four weeks post-infection, 80% of infected mice had peri-bronial consolidations with increased lung density compared to controls. After eight and twelve weeks, consolidation spread to middle regions. Histology showed consolidation as confl granulomatous reaction, nodules as compact granomas. At sixteen weeks, confl granomas formed pseudooral masses obstructing bronchi. Discrete fibrosis was visible around granomas, only by histology. This study showed HRCT is useful for evaluating and quantifying damage in experimental paridiomycosis.
Researchers investigated the use of an interferon-gamma release assay (IFN-γ) as a marker for latent Leishmania donovani infection in areas where visceral leishmaniasis is endemic. They modified a commercial kit, QuFERON, with five Leishmania antigens to detect cell-mediated immune response. The study included 13 active VL patients, 15 cured patients, 11 non-endemic controls, and 19 endemic controls. The assay based on soluble Leish antigen (SL) had 80% sensitivity and 100 specificity. The results suggest a whole-blood SL-based QuFER assay can measure cell-mediated response to Leish infection. A surprising finding was IF-γ production in active VL patients upon Leish antigen stimulation, contradicting previous non-proliferative antigen response in peripheral mononuclear cells. All groups showed positive IF- responses to PH, a non-specific T-cell activator, indicating immunocompetence. Antigens H2, H-PS2, H-Le12, CSA, and SL were positive in 0, 9, 18, and 63 of subjects respectively. Antigen-specific IF- levels were determined by subtracting non-stimulated levels. The highest response was with SL (84.6). CSA, containing the promastigote part, showed positive responses in non-endemic controls, while Le12, a nuclear protein, showed low sensitivity and specificity.
Researchers have discovered that a toxin called CNFY plays a crucial role in making Yersinia pseudotuberculosis persistent in the body. This bacterium causes gastrointestinal infections that can lead to complications such as relapsing enteritis and autoimmune disorders. To establish a persistent infection, the bacteria must navigate through the intestinal lining and colonize the underlying lymphatic tissues, evading the host's immune response. The study found that CNFY toxin enhances the transfer of anti-phagocytic effectors, leading to inflammatory responses and tissue destruction of the intestinal microbiota and bacterial clearance. However, suppressing CNFY function increases interferon-mediated responses, non-inflammatory antimicrobial activities, and tolerogenesis, allowing the pathogen to reprogram its transcription towards persistence. This adaptation gives the bacteria an advantage against host responses and facilitates a commensal lifestyle.

The study shows that removing a single virulence factor, CNFY, is sufficient to dampen inflammation and evade the host's defense, favoring Yers persistence. The mechanisms behind this process are unclear, but the impact of CNFY suggests a set of immune responses, such as IL-6 levels, modulators, bactericidal activities, and anti-inflammatory factors, contributing to this process. The study also found that CN-promoted tissue damage accelerates pathogen access to deeper tissues and facilitates systemic infections, beneficial to strains with reduced invasion properties. CN toxin constitutively activates Rho GTPases deidation and Y translocation into host, enhancing inflammation and damage. Suppressing CN function shifts the balance towards immune suppression, promoting asymptomatic persistent infection.
Researchers have identified a novel gene, DES1, in the fungus Magnaporthe oryza, that plays a crucial role in its ability to colonize and reproduce in plants. To do this, the fungus must overcome the plant's innate defenses. DES1 was found by screening for mutants that had reduced pathogenicity in a library of T-DNA insertions. Bioinformatics analysis showed it encodes a serine-rich protein with unknown function, and its homologs are conserved in filamentous Ascomycetes. Deleting DES1 had no effect on growth, conidial germination, appressium formation, and penetration, but conid size was smaller. The mutant was hypersensitive to oxidative stress and had decreased extracellular enzyme activity, including peroxidases and laccases, and ferrous ion leakage. In interaction with rice, cells inoculated with the mutant showed strong defense responses, including brown granules, ROS, autofluorescent materials, and PR gene induction. The mutant had reduced infectious hyph extension and pathity. Suppressing ROS with DPI, an inhibitor of NAD oxidases, reduced defense responses and allowed the mutant to grow normally. This suggests DES functions as a pathogenic gene that regulates ROS-mediated plant defense.
Researchers in Ghana evaluated the accuracy of a mathematical model used to predict the prevalence of Schistosoma haematium infection, a type of schistosomiasis, in schools across the country. They compared the model's predictions to actual infection rates found in 79 schools surveyed in 2010. The study found that using the model alone, 21 schools with high infection rates would have been undertreated and 20% would have been treated unnecessarily. This would have meant 28% of children in those schools were undertreated and 12% received treatment without need. The researchers suggest the model should not be used as a one-time tool, but rather an iterative process that incorporates testing and refining to create updated versions for disease control managers. 

The study used school-based data from 2010 surveys in previously and newly sampled districts to evaluate the 2008 model predictions. Schosoma haemat is Ghana's most common schistome infection. The model's predictions were compared to empiric results from the 201 survey. Extrapolating to Ghana's endemic area, many people would have been undertreated and praziquel used inappropriately in other areas. The approach tested a geospatial model for schosiasis in Ghana based on treating areas by examining school children and basing treatment on findings. WHO does not recommend treating at district level as done in Ghana. The model aggregating estimates to district level was not accurate enough for the program. Certain areas predicted to be endemic had no infection when empirically evaluated.
Researchers have investigated the mechanisms that guide sperm through the female reproductive tract to the egg in Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that the worm's oocytes synthesize a mixture of prostaglandins from polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUA) precursors in yolk protein complexes. Using genetics and mass spectrometry, they identified prostland metabolism pathways and showed that omega-6 and omega-3 PAs, including arachid and eicosapentaic acids, are converted into more than 10 structurally related prostagins. These prostins collectively and redundantly promote sperm guidance. Disrupting omega-3 PU synthesis triggers compensatory upregulation of prostins from omega-6 PAs. C elegans prostin synthesis involves mechanisms distinct from mammalian cycxygen pathways, yet PG2 stereomers are still synthesized. A conserved cytochrome P enzyme, whose human homolog is implicated in Biet's Crystine dystrophy, regulates prostin synthesis. Results support the model that multiple cycxygen-independent prostins function to promote sperm motility for fertilization.
Researchers have developed a new method to design biotherapeutic proteins that are less likely to trigger an immune response while maintaining their function. This approach, called Pareto optimal design, optimizes for both reduced T cell epitope content and high-level function. In silico analysis showed that there is no single best design, but rather a spectrum of designs that trade off between immunogenic potential and function. The Pareto frontier is the set of designs that are not dominated by any other design in both criteria.

Eight Pareto optimal variants were produced and experimentally analyzed, showing a correlation between computational and experimental results. This work outlines a design-based approach to functional deimmization of biotherapeutic candidates. Next-generation protein design tools integrate immunoinform epitope prediction and in silico analysis of functional consequences of deimmizing mutations, enabling global design on a compressed time scale. Predictions correlated with experimental function, with incremental T epitope deletion leading to loss of function.

Inspection of Pareto designs reveals an inverse relationship: greater deimmization at expense of reduced function. To assess tradeoffs, 18 enzymes were recombinantly produced and characterized for stability, activity, and immunactivity with human MHC proteins.
Researchers studied how temperature affects the process of meiosis in Arabidopsis thalian, a type of plant. Meiosis is a critical for sexual reproduction and involves the exchange of genetic material between chromosomes to ensure proper segregation. The frequency and distribution of these exchanges, called crossovers (CO), are regulated by internal and external factors, but more is known about the internal mechanisms than external. The study found that increased temperature leads to more crossovers in Arabidopsis and used genetic analysis to show that these are from the Type I pathway, sensitive to interference, not the insensitive Type II pathway. They also found that increased crosso are not due to more DNA breaks and the hyper-recombination is specific to heat stress, not a general response. This provides insight into how environmental cues affect meiotic recombination and may have practical applications.
Researchers have developed a novel computational approach to navigate the vast and rapidly evolving landscape of biomedical literature, particularly in molecular medicine. The system, called Hanalyzer, combines reading, reasoning, and reporting methods to facilitate analysis of experimental data. It extracts information from external resources, structured or unstructured data, and tracks provenance. Reasoning enriches the results by noting genes annotated to the same term or database, and combines sources into a network representing relationships between genes, calculating a reliability score. Reporting combines the network with congruent constructed from data and visualizes in a tool for knowledge-based analysis. Hanalyzer was demonstrated on a large gene array dataset relevant to craniofacial development, identifying roles of four previously uncharacterized genes, validated by further work.

The system includes a plugin, Coscape, tracing provenance links and accessing sources (Figure 2). It identified explanations by exploiting inferences not in individual sources. To present knowledge relevant to a dataset, sub-networks are selected and presented in a comprehensible way. A simple approach visualizes fidials, a list generating sub-network including them. A more effective method creates a data network from experimental results and combines in various ways. Here, a data is constructed from gene expression experiment.

Biomedical knowledge is expanding exponentially, with over 10 million PubMed indexed in 20 years, 4.8% annual growth. Combining knowledge with data highlights supported linkages, facilitating explanation, or unsupported linkages generating hypotheses. Both can be together, demonstrated.
Researchers have studied the molecules on the surface of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by the parasite Fasciola hepatica, a liver fluke that infects humans and animals. These EVs can be internalized by host cells, modulating the immune response. While the cargo of EVs has been characterized in many parasites, little is known about the surface molecules that interact with host cells to initiate internalization. The study used a membrane-impermeable biotin reagent to capture proteins on the outer surface of two EV populations (15k and 120) released by adult F. hepatica, identifying 380 proteins including virulence factors, transport and molecules involved in EV biogenesis. Proteomics and immunohistochemical analysis showed 120 EVs have an endosomal origin and are released via the protonephial excretory system, while larger 15 EVs are from gastrodermal cells lining the gut. Lectin microarray profiled surface oligosaccharides of intact EVs displayed to the host, showing identical profiles for 15 and 120 EV but distinct from parasite tegument, with high mannose sugars. EV were resistant to exo and endoglycosidases, but glycosidase remodelled surface and blocked uptake by macrophages. Pre-treatment with host antibodies or purified against EV surface proteins enhanced internalization.
Researchers have identified a protein called Arabidopsis CDF2 that plays a crucial role in regulating microRNA (miRNA) production in plants. miRNAs are small molecules that help control gene expression and are essential for plant development. CDF2 interacts with an enzyme called Dicer 1 (D1) that cuts miRNA precursors into mature miRNAs. C2 binds to the promoters of some miRNA genes, acting as an activator or repressor to control their expression. It also binds to miRNA precursors (pri-miRNAs) regulated by itself and affects D1 processing. C2 works in the same pathway as mi156 and mi172 to control flowering. C2 regulates a group of pri-miRNAs at both transcription and post-transcription levels to maintain proper miRNA levels for plant development. This regulation involves coordination of transcription and processing of pri-mRNAs. C2 also affects expressions of components involved in miRNA biogenesis, potentially affecting biogenesis. Some C2-regulated miRNAs are involved in flowering, including mi156,160,167,172,165/166, and319. The study focused on mi156 and172, two well-studied miRNAs. Results suggest C2 may regulate biogenesis by regulating mi processing proteins in addition to direct transcription and postcription regulations of pri-mRN. The study supports a role of C2 in mi regulation.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GG) plays a crucial role in the communication between the oocyte and granulosa cells in the ovary. This communication is essential for the development of follicles, which provide eggs for reproduction. The study found that GG levels increase in oocytes during early follicular development. Depletion of GG in oocytes impaired granosa cell proliferation, primary follicle transition, and female fertility. Mechanistically, GG inhibited Rho GTPase gergeranylation and GTP activity, leading to accumulation of cell proteins in the oocyte cytoplasm and loss of connection between oocyte and granosa. GG also blocked Rab27 geranylation, affecting secretion of o materials such as G9. Administration of GG restored defects in o-granosa contact, granosa proliferation, and primary transition in Gpps mice. The study shows GG-mediated geranylation contributes to o-granosa communication and regulates primary follicle transition, a key phase of follicogenesis for female function.
Researchers have created a detailed model of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) enzyme, which is responsible for synthesizing messenger RNA from DNA, to understand how nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) enters the enzyme's active site during transcription. Despite previous studies, it was unclear whether the secondary channel or main channel was the primary route for NTP entry. The researchers built a structural model of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble using existing data and molecular dynamics simulations to shed light on NTP pathways. They found that both channels have enough space for NTP, but the secondary channel has a higher percentage of conformations with enough space for N loading. Simulations showed that NTP diffusion through the main channel is disfavored by electrostatic repulsion with the negatively charged backbone of non-template DNA. The study suggests the secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry during Pol transcription.
In Thailand and Cambodia, deng is a reportable disease, but the reported incidence underestimates the true burden. Researchers used laboratory-confirmed outpatient and inpatient cases from prospective studies to estimate the magnitude of underrecognition and establish accurate disease estimates. Two cohort studies were conducted among children under 15 in deng field sites over two seasons. Age-specific multiplication factors (MF) were calculated by comparing cohort data to national surveillance in the same province and year. In Thailand, 14,627 person-years of cohort data were obtained in two provinces and 14,493 from one in Cambodia. Annual incidence of laboratory-confirmed deng was 23/1,000 and 25/1,000 in Thailand, and 41/1,000 in Cambodia. Calculated MF varied by age and year (0.4-29). Average age-specific MF applied to country data indicated in Thailand 229,886 (210,612-331,236) deng cases annually 2003-2007 and 111,178 (80,452,357,135) in Cambodia. Underrecognition total inpatient deng cases was 8.7 and 2.6 in Thailand, and 9.1 and 1.4 in Cambodia. During high incidence 2007, over 95,000 in Thailand and 58,000 in Cambodia were estimated hospitalized due to deng. Calculating MF by cohort to surveillance is one approach to assess burden. Data indicate deng reported in many countries underestimates true burden.
Researchers investigated how natural killer (NK) cells contribute to the immune response against cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. They found that NK cells accelerate the development of CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that fights infection, by controlling the production of immunosuppressive cytokines, which can dampen the immune response. This is achieved by limiting the activation of plasmacyoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and preserving conventional dendritic cells (DC), allowing for optimal CD8 cell activation. In contrast, administering exogenous interferon-alpha (IFN) ablated DCs and delayed CD8 cell activation when NK cells controlled viral replication. The study demonstrates that NK cells' ability to respond early to CMV infection is crucial for balancing innate responses, preventing immunopathology, and promoting adaptive immunity.
Researchers studied the regulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in Arabidopsis thalian plants, a small flowering plant commonly used in scientific research. r genes are organized in arrays of hundreds to thousands of copies, but not all are transcribed under normal conditions. They found four rRNA variants in Arabid thalian, with one induced and others repressed or unchanged in plants with a disrupted nucleolin-like gene (At-L). Notably, the most represented rRNA variant, inactive in normal plants, was reactivated in mutants. They showed pre-rNAs originate from RNA I transcription and are processed. Disrupting theNU-L gene caused loss of DNA methylation without affecting histone marks on r genes. The study reveals a mechanism for r gene regulation, with nucleolin controlling active and repressed r variants.
Researchers have identified a protein from the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) called UL29 that interacts with a cellular complex called NuRD, which is involved in histone deacetylation. Histone deetylation is a process that regulates gene expression by adding or removing acetyl groups to histone proteins. The interaction between UL29 and Nu was confirmed using a technique called immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. The researchers found that UL29 and another viral protein, UL38, also interact with HD1, a component of the Nu complex. Knocking down two other components of Nu, RBP and CH4, inhibited CMV immediateearly RNA and DNA accumulation, suggesting that multiple Nu components are needed for efficient CM replication. Inhibiting histone deety with a drug, trichatin A, did not rescue UL29 or UL38 deficient viruses, indicating a positive role for Nu in CM replication. Expressing UL29 alone enhanced the CM major early promoter in a reporter assay, and required Nu components to do so. The researchers propose that UL29 modifies Nu to stimulate early RNA accumulation.
Researchers studied the immune response to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in children to understand how the body's immune system reacts to the virus and how it changes over time. They used a technique called whole-genome-fragment display libraries to analyze the antibodies in the blood of infants before and after they got infected with RSV. The results showed that the antibodies to the fusion protein (F) didn't change much, but the antibodies to the attachment protein (G) increased 100 times after infection. The antibodies to G targeted different parts of the G protein, including the central conserved domain. The researchers made synthetic peptides and proteins to test the antibodies in children, adolescents, and adults. They found that the antibodies to F increased over time and identified new sites on the protein. Importantly, antibodies to the pre-fusion form of F were 2-3 times stronger than to the post-fusion form. Antibodies to G were high in children after infection but decreased in adults. This study shows that the immune response to F and G are linked and supports the idea that the virus evolves to evade the immune system. These findings can help develop effective countermeasures like vaccines.
Emodeide, a veterinary drug used to treat nematode infections in cats and dogs, has been shown to have macrofidal effects on adult Brug mal, a parasite that causes lymphatic filariasis. Researchers studied how emide works on Brug mal and found it potently inhibits motility by activating voltage-gated potassium channels, with males being more sensitive than females. They discovered that emide targets S-1 channels, a type of potassium channel, and found that a specific isoform of S-1 found in males is more sensitive to emide than the isoform found in females. They also found that knocking down the isoform in females increased emide potency. Onchercavolus, another parasite that causes blindness, has two isoforms of S-1 with similar to Brug mal. Modeling showed that emide binds to a pocket in the R1 region of S-1, which is affected by splicing variations. This suggests that emide has potent macroidal effects and splicing in the R1 pocket affects potency. The study highlights the importance of evaluating sex-dependent effects of anthelmint compounds to prevent underdosing one gender of nematodes in patients.
Researchers have identified Loa antigens responsible for cross-reacting with rapid diagnostic tests for lymphatic filariasis. These tests are used to determine where mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis is required and when it can be stopped. The tests detect Wuchereria bancrofti glycoprotein in the blood of infected persons via a carbohydrate moiety recognized by monoclonal antibodies AD12 and DH.5. However, Loa cross-reactivity with these tests has hindered lymphatic filariasis elimination in Loa-endemic areas. To understand this cross-reactivity, researchers used the DH.5 antibody to immunoaffinity purify Loa antigens from sera of individuals with positive tests due to Loa. Immunlot analysis revealed many AD/DH.5-reactive antigens and proteomic analysis identified multiple Lo proteins in Lo-positive sera. These included secreted and somatic proteins, suggesting they may be released by dying Lo adult worms and microfilar. Unlike the single molecular W. bancft circulating antigen, Lo antigens appeared transiently present in blood of a subset persons with Lo. Differences between antigens of W. bancft and Lo can be used to differentiate results generated by species and lead to improved tests for lymphatic and Lo.
Researchers used the nematode C. elegans to identify new genes associated with cilia, specialized sensory and signaling devices on cell surfaces. Defects in cilia cause human disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Bied syndrome (BBS), affecting multiple physiological and developmental processes across organs. Whole-organ RNA-Seq libraries revealed a signature profile highly enriched for known ciliary transcripts, including FAM161, CC104, and RP1. From a list of 185 candidates, orthologs of MAP, YAP, CC149, and R28 were conserved ciliary components. C. elegans R-28, associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, is a small GTPase exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons, dynamically associating with intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains. Inactive R-28 displays no IFT and diffuse localization, while GTP-bound R-28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane in BBS-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional IFT. Functional analyses show normal cilium, sensory, and I in a-28 null, but overexpression of GDP or GTP locked R-28 perturbs cil and sensory morphogenesis.
Researchers investigated how the brain represents the outside world using neural responses from the brain, without direct access to external stimuli. They used hippocampal place cells as a model and found that knowing which groups of cells fire together reveals structure in the stimulus space, enabling the brain to construct its own representations. This is different from previous approaches that required knowing place fields or functions relating to position. The study showed that knowing which groups of hippocal cells fire is enough to extract global features of the environment and reconstruct an accurate geometric representation of space, including the animal's position. This was done without assuming place fields have a stereotypical form or knowing actual fields or prior measurements of position. In contrast, previous approaches to reconstructing position from place activity required knowing place fields. The study found that coarse features of population spiking activity yield a great deal of information about the environment, making it possible to track the animal's position.
Researchers investigated the role of the NLRP inflamome and IL-1β in viral fulminant hepatitis (FH), a severe liver disease caused by excessive inflammation. Mice infected with the murine hepatitis virus-3 (MH-3), a model for FH, showed severe disease and high mortality associated with increased IL-1β in the liver and serum. Mice lacking IL-1 receptor (IL-1-) or treated with IL-1 antagonist (IL-Ra) had reduced virus replication, disease, and mortality.IL-1 deficiency debilitated virus-induced fibrinogen-like protein-2 (F2) production in macrophages and CD45+Gr1 neutrophil infiltration in the liver. The release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by infected macrophages suggested plausible initiation of NLR3 inflamome activation. Experiments showed mice deficient in p47ph, a nicotin adenine dinucleotide (NAD) oxidase subunit controlling ROS production, had reduced NLR inflamome activation and IL-β secretion during viral infection, responsible for resilience to FH. Viral animals deficient in NLR and Casp-1, inflamome components, had reduced IL-β and ameliorated hepatitis. Results demonstrate the ROS/NLR/IL-β axis essential pathway, activated causing severe liver disease during infection, shedding light on treatments for human FH and inflammatory diseases.
Researchers conducted a study in Malawi to investigate the role of hookworm infections in severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children. They used multiplex real-time PCR to assess hook species-specific prevalence, load, and their contribution to anemia and iron deficiency. The study found 34.1% of severely anemic children and 27.0% non-severely anemic controls had hookworm infections, with 5.6% detected by microscopy. Ancylostoma duale and Necator american DNA were present in 26.1% and 4.9% of children, respectively. Moderate to high A. duale infections were associated with severe anemia (adjusted odds ratio 2.49, 95%CI 1.16-5.33 and 9.04, 95CI 2.52-32.47) and iron deficiency (odds ratio 3.63, 95CI 1.18-11.20, 16.98 95CI 3.88.74.35 and 44.91 95 5.23-385.77 for low, moderate, and high load). This is the first study to assess hook load and species with anemia and bone iron deficiency. The results show a higher than expected prevalence of A duale and significant association with anemia and iron in pre-school children in Malawi, highlighting the need for species-specific screening. Multiplex real PCR is a powerful tool for public health to combat anemia and iron deficiency in resource settings.
Researchers have identified a protein called COM-1 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that plays a crucial role in the process of meiosis, a type of cell division that occurs in reproductive cells. Meiosis requires the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA, which can be done through two ways: homologous recombination (HR) or non-homous joining (NJ). HR is necessary for the formation of interchromosomal crossovers (COs) that allow for proper chromosome segregation. Without COM-1, cells repair DS via the error-prone NJ pathway, resulting in lack of CO, chromosomal abnormalities, and near-complete embryonic lethality. COM1 is not required for the initiation of meiotic DS repair, but promotes HR by counteracting the NJ complex Ku. In fact, animals lacking both COM1 and Ku are viable and proficient in CO formation. COM acts parallel to the nuclease EX-1 to promote interolog HR at the early pachytene stage of meiotic prophase, safeguarding CO formation. Both nucleases are dispensable for RAD-51 recruitment at late pachene, when hom-independent pathways predominate, suggesting redundancy and regulation of DNA resection during meiotic pro. The study reveals the lethal properties of NJ during meiosis and a critical role for COM1 in NJ inhibition and CO in germ cells.
Researchers studied the immune response of goats to Burkholderia pseudallei, a bacterium that causes meloidosis, a severe pneumonia and sepsis in Southeast Asia and Australia. They used an aerosol infection model to mimic the disease in goats, which is more similar to human infection than previous mouse models. The study aimed to identify proteins that trigger an immune response, which could lead to new diagnostics and vaccines. The researchers found that goats developed a strong immune response to the bacterium, with more IgG antibodies than IgM antibodies. Before infection, goats already had some immune proteins reactive to the bacterium, and after infection, the number of Ig reactive proteins increased. Early in the disease, goats reacted to proteins GroEL, EF-T, and Dna, which were detected in all samples. Six antigens were selected for further analysis, and heat shock protein Gro1 elicited the strongest immune response. Most antigens showed peak IgM reactivity at day 14, while IgG increased as disease progressed. Comparison with human sera showed many reactive proteins common between goats and humans with meloidosis. The study found a diverse and increasing antibody response over disease in goats, with Ig and IgM responses in individual serum samples. The researchers used ELISA, 2D electrophores, and western blots to analyze the immune response. They also developed ELISA to quantify antibodies to whole lysate and individual antigens. Total IgM was stable with most antigens throughout 7-14 days. The study compared goat response with human antigens in meloid patients and found similar responses in goats and humans.
Cyclin B–cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) plays a crucial role in initiating mitosis by triggering a positive feedback loop at the end of the G2 phase. However, its activation during mitosis has been poorly understood. Researchers used a novel approach to study the temporal development of cyclin B–C1dk activity in single cells by quantifying dephosphorylation of C1 and phosphorylation of its target anaphase-promoting complex/cycome 3. They found that cyclin B–C1 continues to be activated after centros separation and can be maintained in the cytoplasm even when cyclin B translocates to the nucleus in prophase. This suggests that increasing cyclin B–1C1 activity after centros separation is critical for mitotic progression. 

The study indicates that mitotic cyclin B–1C1 activity needs to increase after entry and pass a threshold before metaphase to allow mitotic progression and exit. Distinct thresholds for cyclin B–1C1 activity control successive mitotic events. Cyclin B–1C1 is activated in late G2 and increases between centros separation and prometaph. Reducing C1 levels affects mitotic progression, with a threshold that autocatalyzes cyclin B–1C1 activation and entry into mitosis. Cyclin B–1C1 contributes to centros separation in G. In human cells, active cyclin–1C1 is detected on centros before they start to migrate at end G or pro.
Researchers studied the immune responses of 21 Kenyan women who were infected with HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and D after being exposed to different partners, a median of 1.07 years after initial infection. The women's plasma samples were collected 2.72 years post-infection. The study focused on 4 main HIV-1 envelope epitopes: the CD4 binding site, V1/V glycan, N332 site in V3, and gp41 membrane proximal region. Epitope mapping and computational analysis showed no dominant response to these epitopes in any of the women's plasma. This suggests that superinfection with diverse subtypes promotes a broad polyclonal response, supporting vaccine designs using multivalent immunogens to elicit diverse Nabs. 

Previous studies on singly infected individuals with broad and potent responses showed 72-94% targeting 4 main epitopes. This study is the first to examine specificities in a superinfected cohort. Exposure to diverse HIV antigens after superfection may drive broad and potent response mediated by polycl antibodies targeting multiple epitopes.
Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is a leading cause of neurological disabilities in children worldwide, but the underlying mechanisms are not well-defined. Research has shown that CMV dysregulates the Notch signaling pathway in human neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Hairy Enhancer of Split 1 (Hes) is essential for NPC fate and brain development as an important downstream effector of Notch signaling. This study reports that CMV downregulates Hes protein levels in NPCs. The CMV 72Da immediate-early 1 protein (IE1) is involved in Hes degradation by assembling a ubiquitination complex and promoting Hes ubiquination as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase, followed by proteasomal degradation of Hes. SpA, a component of PML bodies, is another target of IE-mediated ubiquination. The C-terminal region of IE, amino acids 451-475, is required for IE/Hes interaction and IE-mediated Hes ubiquination, but dispensable for IE/SpA interaction and ubiquination. This study suggests a novel mechanism linking downregulation of Hes protein to neurodevelopment disorders caused by CMV infection, complementing knowledge of herpesviruses by identifying IE as the first CM-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase.
Researchers studied how changes in the binding of transcription factors to DNA affect gene expression in embryos of four Drosophila species: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis. They compared the binding of four transcription factors involved in early anterior-posterior patterning using ChIP-seq and measured gene expression using mRNA-seq. The study found that gene expression levels are more conserved than individual transcription factor binding events, and changes in gene expression are not well explained by changes in transcription factor binding. However, highly bound sites in regions bound by multiple factors and near genes are conserved more than other binding sites, suggesting weak or non-functional transcription factor binding not subject to purifying selection.

The study found that the extent of conservation for each factor decreased with increasing phylogenetic distance between species. Few regions were bound by factors in all four species. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons showed transcription factor binding diverged within Dophila genus. The study compared divergence to binding divergence and found only 3-7% of variance in TF binding between species, 21% if phylogenetic inertia not considered.

mRNA-seq from embryos at end of cellularization showed mRNA levels highly correlated between species, decaying with phylogenetic distance. Divergence of mRNA was lower than TF binding, measured by variance along Doph tree. On a gene-by-gene basis, matched each gene to closest bound by highest TFs, focusing on 4,846 annotated in all species and expressed at least one.
A large-scale epidemiological study was conducted in two primary health centers in Thanjav district, India, which is endemic for bancroftian filariasis, to assess the effectiveness of eight rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) and identify potential transmission "hotspots". The study covered 70% of the 50,363 population and found a microfilaria (M) prevalence of 0.2% and intensity 0.004 per 60µl blood, and antigena (Ag) prevalence 2.3% and 17.3 units. The Ag prevalence ranged from 0.7 to 0.9% in children 2-10 years and 2.7 to 3.0 in adults. Despite M levels <1% and Ag <2 in sentinel sites, "residual" M prevalence ≥1 was found in 7% of children and "transmission" at least one Ag-positive child during M period hotspots were identified. Antigenemic persons were clustered at household and site levels. An Ag prevalence of 1% in children (0.4 community M prevalence) was suggested as a threshold for stopping MDA. The study indicates the need for developing surveillance strategies to detect hotspots, adopting evidence-based sampling, and evaluation size for transmission assessment surveys.
A systematic review was conducted to assess the effectiveness of temeph, an organophosphate laricide, in controlling deng vectors and deng transmission when used as a single intervention or in combination with other methods. A comprehensive search of six databases and grey literature was performed, and 27 studies were included. Single intervention studies showed temeph reduced entomological indices, while 11 of 16 combined studies showed tem with other chemical methods reduced entom indices, but this was not sustained or failed to reduce immature stages in five. Effectiveness depended on factors such as delivery quality, water rate, type, debris, temperature, and sunlight. Timing, reapplication, reluctance, cost, supplies, time, and labour were limitations. As a single intervention, tem was effective in suppressing entom indices, but not when combined with other interventions. No evidence suggests tem use reduces deng transmission. The review highlights effectiveness of tem varies greatly, and lack of data on entom indices to d transmission remains a gap in deng epidemiology and control.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Ctf19 kinetore complex and the replication factor C3 in establishing cohesion at the pericentere, the region surrounding the centrom. They found that these two components act through distinct mechanisms, with the C19 complex directing the association of cohes with the pericere and C3 ensuring its functionality in holding sister centrom together. The C19 complex consists of proteins I3 and Ch4, which increase cohes binding to the pericere during mitosis and meiosis, and are essential for sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation. In contrast, C3 is crucial for the integrity of the replisome and its association with cohesion factors as it traverses the protein-DNA barrier surrounding the centrom. The researchers propose that the C19 complex loads cohes at the centrom prior to replication fork passage, ensuring its incorporation through a process requiring C3. Delaying replication rescues the defect in cells lacking C19 components, but not C3. Cells lacking both C19 and C3 show additive cohesion defects.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a widespread arbovirus that infects approximately 100 million people annually, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. Dengue fever (DF) and deng hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are major public health concerns. To understand the underlying mechanisms of deng pathogenesis, researchers analyzed the serum metabolome and lipidome of adult patients at three stages of infection: early fever, defervescence, and convalescence. Using liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, they identified 60 differential metabolites in a large sample size (n=44) across stages. The main metabolite classes were fatty acids, acylcarnines, phospholids, and amino acids. Perturbed pathways included fatty biosynthesis, β-oxidation, phosphid catabolism, and steroid. Analysis of phospholids and sphingolids showed temporal trends and association with lymphocytes and platelets. These metabolites were perturbed early and normalized to control levels at convales stage, suggesting potential as prognostic markers. DENV causes distinct serumome and lipidome changes, with many metabolites involved in inflammatory responses. The study revealed anti-inflammatory responses modulating early-inflammatory processes, preventing excessive or prolonged inflammation. This is the first example of omic approach divulging concurrent, dynamic host responses to DENV, offering physiological insights into why DF is self-limiting.
Research on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) has increased in recent years, with significant gaps in diagnostic and treatment remaining. Analyzing bibliometric data from research is a powerful method to reveal research efforts, partnerships, and expertise. This study aimed to map NTD research in Germany and its partners to enable informed and transparent evaluation of German contributions to NTD. A SCOPUS database search for articles with German affiliations published between 2002-2012 was conducted for kinoplast and helminth diseases. From 26,833 publications worldwide, 1,187 (4.4%) had at least one German affiliation, and 972 were processed for five most-published diseases. 4,007 authors and 863 institutions were extracted to construct co-author networks. Most co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries, Brazil. Collaborations with Africa remain scattered. NTD research in Germany was distributed among 220 institutions. Strong performers were identified on individual level using parameters (publications, h-index) and social analysis (between centrality). Network varied between diseases. Share of N publications with German affiliations is half of other medical fields. This underlines need to identify and expand Germany's strong research towards NTD. Spatial analysis of collaborations abroad can support decisions to strengthen capacity, particularly low-middle countries involved less than high. Identifying knowledge within researcher complements traditional indicators opportunities for collaboration.
In Haiti, a mass drug administration (MDA) program targeting lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) has been implemented since 2000 by the Ministry of Health and its international partners. By 2012, the program had reached national scale with high epidemiological coverage, allowing treatment to be stopped in most of the country. Key to this success were program elements: community awareness through multi-channel education, voluntary distributors, community trust through training and supervision, directly observed treatment, easy access, and data-driven strategies. High coverage (100% in 2012) and significant reduction in infection (45 communes reached LF threshold) show these strategies were effective. Haiti's campaign, with international support, resulted in progress toward LF elimination and strong STH control foundation. 

The likelihood of taking treatment was associated with knowledge, disease understanding, transmission, strategy, risk, and side effects in other studies. In Haiti, knowledge was low and not associated with MDA participation. In Grand'An department, with 72% prevalence in 2001, decline was less than others, remaining at 55. Results show progress addressing STH, but question how to continue after MDA ceases. A successful campaign was launched in 200 with high rates, progress toward LF elimination (more rounds in high prevalence, fewer low). A foundation for STH control was established. Factors determining treatment were knowing M place and ease of access. Direct observation increased participation in other settings. M activities now stopping, Haiti turned to morbidity efforts, building on hydro surgery and lymphema support.
Researchers studied the role of the master regulator Ctr in the cell cycle of Sinorhizob meli, an alphrotebacter that forms a symbiotic relationship with legume hosts. In this symbiosis, S. meli undergoes cellular differentiation, resulting in genome amplification, cell elongation, and loss of reproductive capacity. The researchers found that depletion of Ctr causes cell elongation and genome amplification, similar to nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. They also showed that cell cycle-regulated proteolytic degradation of Ctr is essential in S. meli, suggesting a mechanism of Ctr depletion in differentiated bacteroids. Using ChIP-Seq and gene microarray analysis, they found that S. mel Ctr regulates similar processes as C cresus Ctr, but through different genes. For example, Ctr does not control the expression of the F complex to control timing cell division, but negatively regulates the septum-inhibiting Min system. This study provides insight into how conserved networks evolve to fit diverse lifestyles of bacteria. The model of Ctr cell regulation in S mel will help elucidate how bacterial cycle is modulated by plant during symbiosis.
Francisella tularens is a highly infectious bacterium that causes tularemia, a zoonotic disease. Its ability to multiply and survive in macrophages is crucial for its virulence. Researchers screened a library of Himar transposon mutants of the F. tularens vaccine strain L to isolate intracellular growth-deficient mutants and found a mutant in a gene encoding a putative glutamyl transpeptase (GT). The mutant showed impaired intracellular multiplication and was attenuated virulence in mice. The GT activity of F. tulns allows the utilization of glutathione (GSH, γ-glutyl-cystyl-glycine) and γ-glutyl-cystine dipeptide as cystine to ensure intracellular growth. This is the first demonstration of the role of a nutrient system in intracellular multiplication of F. tulns. SH is the most abundant source of cystine in host cytos. The capacity of this intracellular pathogen to utilize G as source cystine in host cytos constitutes a paradigm of bacteria-host adaptation.
Researchers studied the interaction between two types of Leishmania parasites, Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania major, which infect humans and animals. These parasites have different forms: flagellated promastigotes in insects and round amastigotes in mammalian cells. Leish amazonensis amastotes occupy large vacuoles, while Leish major amastotes are in small, tight vacuoles that divide as they multiply. To see if these vacoles can fuse, researchers infected mouse cells with non-fluorescent Leish amazon amastotes and 48 hours later added fluorescent Leish major amast or promastigotes. They used time-lapse imaging to see if parasites of both species were in the same vacoles. Survival and multiplication of parasites not in same vacoles were also studied. Leish amazon and major vacoles did not fuse, but Le major promastotes fused with established Leish amazon vacoles. In these mixed vacoles, majorast remained motile and multiplied but did not turn into amastotes. In contrast, in separate vacoles, Le major promastotes multiplied but did not turn into amotes. This shows that Leish vacoles, made by majorast or promast, differ in ability to fuse with Leish amazon vacoles. Also, species-specific vac is required for Le major differentiation, a mechanism unknown. This study helps understand interactions between vacoles of different Leish parasites and how they recognize and fuse.
Researchers have been working to develop a vaccine that can elicit broad neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against HIV-1, a type of antibody that can block the virus from infecting cells. To achieve this, they investigated the ability of native, membrane-expressed Env trimers (a part of the HIV virus) to elicit nAbs. In a study, 8 rabbits were immunized with virus-like particles (VLP) expressing trimers and 20 with DNA expressing Env trimer followed by a protein boost. The results showed that potent nAb titers developed in 2 of the rabbits immunized with VLP and 1 of those immunized with DNA trimer. These nAb neutralized quatern epitopes, exploiting gaps in the glycan shield of the conserved region of JRFL gp120. Specifically, VLP sera took advantage of the absence of a glycan residue at 197, present in 98.7% of Envs. Removing this glycan made 50% of clade 2 isolates sensitive to VLP sera, showing neutralization masked by the glycan. The nAb targeted epitopes overlap with the CD binding site, suggesting the gly acts as a "fence" limiting access to this region. Bioinformatics analysis showed features of VLP sera and monoclonal antibody PG, consistent with trimer dependency. The trimer serum took advantage of absence of gly at 230, also proximal to CD site, suggesting epitope similar to monoclonal 8, albeit lacking breadth. The study shows strain-specific holes in glycan allow nAb to native spikes and cross-neutralization can occur without gly. This provides insights for future nAb vaccine development.
Researchers investigated the use of immunohistochemistry to monitor wound healing in patients with Buruli ulcers (BU) treated with antibiotics. Traditionally, surgery has been the primary treatment for BU, but a combination of oral rifampicin and intramus streptomycin has improved treatment and reduced recurrence rates. However, managing extensive lesions after successful therapy remains a challenge, particularly in rural areas with high disease burden. The study aimed to identify markers to monitor wound progression. Specimens from eight patients with plaque lesions before and after chemotherapy were analyzed for markers of connective tissue formation, remodeling, and epidermal activation. Several proteins were found suitable to monitor healing. α-smooth muscle actin positive myofiblasts were not present in untreated lesions but emerged during healing, producing extracellular matrix proteins like pro-collagen and tenascin. After treatment, cells including myoflasts showed activated phenotype with ribosomal S6 phosphorylation, a translation marker. Wounds also showed dermal remodeling by apoptosis and increased cytokeratin 16 in epidermis. A set of markers was identified to monitor healing in treated BU lesions by immunohchemistry. Studies with this panel may help understand delays in wound healing in some patients.
Researchers studied how mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells, move along axons, the long extensions of nerve cells in the body, in response to electrical activity. They used confocal imaging to observe saphous nerve axons in anesthetized mice and stimulated electrically and pharmacologically. They found that low-frequency electrical activity increased anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial traffic in both myelinated and unmyinated axons. Higher frequency, within a physiological range of 50 Hz, increased anterog but not retrograde traffic, by increasing mobile mitochondria number and velocity. Capsaicin, a substance applied to skin innervated by saphous nerve, increased traffic in both myinated and uninated axons. Mitochondria in axons conducting higher frequency became shorter, supplying more to trafficking, presumably through fission. Recruited mitochondria did not accumulate at Nodes of Ranvier but continued anterly. This pattern suggests peripheral sensory ax terminals have high metabolic demand during high frequency conduction. Most biogenesis occurs at cell body, antograde traffic may ensure uniform density along ax during high load.
Researchers studied a genetic disorder called spondylocarparsal synostosis (SCT), which causes progressive vertebral fusions due to mutations in the Filamin B (FLNB) gene. Filamin acts as a scaffold linking the actin cytoskeleton to signaling systems, but the disease mechanisms are unclear. They used a Filamin knockout mouse model and found that intervertebral discs (IVDs) of Filamin-deficient mice undergo rapid degeneration during development due to abnormal cell changes in the annulus fibros (AF). AF cells lose their fibroblast characteristics and acquire hypertrophic chondrocy features, including collagen changes, apoptosis, and ossification. This conversion coincides with upregulated TGF signaling via Smad/3 and BMP, and sustained activation of canonical and non-canonical genes p21 and Ctg. The study shows Filamin is involved in attenuating TGF/BMP signaling and AF fate. Disruptions in Filamin-deficient mice resemble degenerative discs, providing insights into vertebral fusions and degeneration.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which the orthomyxovirus Thog virus (TH) uses to evade the immune system. The virus targets a general transcription factor called TFI, which is essential for the recruitment of the polymerase II enzyme to gene promoters. This enzyme is necessary for the expression of many immune-related genes, such as cytokines and antiviral effector molecules. By depleting TFI, THOV creates an environment where these genes cannot be expressed, impairing the immune response. However, other genes not dependent on TFI for expression remain unaffected. This allows the virus to evade the immune response while keeping other cellular processes intact. The study suggests targeting TFI could be a therapeutic strategy to control inflammation. 

The immune system is a network of cytokines and antiral effector molecules that defends against viruses. THOV targets a single transcription factor, TFI, disrupting the immune at a broad scale with minimal impact on other processes. Mimicking TH with its inhibitory domain, one can modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines and effector molecules requiring polymerase recruitment without affecting general expression. This is beneficial for infection: pro-inflammatory cytokines are inhibited, while negative regulators and tissue factors are expressed. If TFI is dissociated or depleted, genes with polymerase can still be transcribed, but those dependent on novo recruitment are not. Many inflammatory cytokines and antiral molecules are dependent on novo recruitment. TH also targets polymer through its protein with TFI, but unlike RVV, it does not inhibit general expression. Instead, it impairs interferon genes through IRF.
Human parvovirus B19 (B19) infection of primary erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) causes cell cycle arrest at both late S-phase and G2, containing 4 DNA. The virus induces a DNA damage response (DDR) that facilitates viral replication but is not necessary for G2 arrest. A putative terminal activation domain (TAD) within NS1 is responsible for G arrest. To understand the mechanism of NS-induced G arrest, doxycine-inducible B-permissive UT/E-S cell lines were established that express NS or NSmAD. Results confirm the TAD plays a role in G arrest. Mechanistically, NS activates gene expression through T, which activates ATR, phosphorylates CDC25 at serine, inactivating cyclin/CDK without affecting nuclear import. The ATR-CHK-CDC25-CD1 pathway is activated during B infection, with A playing a role in G arrest. B19 infection induces DDR for replication, but not G arrest. The TAD domain of NS is crucial for dysregulation of the cycle. B19-infected cells at S and G contain 4 DNA. ATR plays a role in G arrest of EPCs expressing NS, mediated by T. The ATR-CHK-CDC25-CD1 pathway is activated in cells at G during B infection.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes a range of diseases from mild to life-threatening, characterized by endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage. The virus's non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has been shown to induce endothelial hyperperability in mice and human endothelial cells by disrupting the endothelial glycocal layer. This study investigated the role of inflammatory mediators and endothelial-intrinsic pathways in NS-induced vascular leak. In vivo, DENV NS triggered vascular leak in the dermis of wild-type C57/6 mice, but not West Nile virus NS. In vitro, human dermal endothelial cells exposed to DENV NS did not produce inflammatory cytokines (TN-α, IL-6, IL-8) and blocking these cytokines did not affect D NS-induced endothelial hyperability. Further, DENV induced leak in TLR- or TN-receptor-deficient mice similar to wild-type animals. Blocking D NS-induced leak in vivo using glycocal inhibitors showed that NS-induced endothelial leak is independent of cytokines but dependent on glycocal components. This suggests potential targets for therapeutics that inhibit glyc components degradation for severe deng treatment.
In budding yeast, the formation of a septin ring at the site of bud emergence is crucial for proper cytokinesis, spindle positioning, and the spindle position (SPO) checkpoint. The PO checkpoint delays mitotic exit and cytokinesis until the anaphase spindle is properly aligned with the division axis. The PO requires Kin4 protein and the Kin-regulating Elm kinase, which also controls septin dynamics. This study shows that the ubiquitin-lases Dma1 and D2 control septin dynamics and PO by promoting the recruitment of Elm to the bud. Dma1 D2 mutant cells have reduced Elm at the bud and Elm-dependent Kin4 activation. Artificially recruiting Elm to the bud of cells restores normal septin, spindle, and PO in Dma D2 cells. The data indicate that septin and PO function are linked and that the integrity of the bud is crucial for PO signalling. The study also implicates the ubiquitin-lases in septin ring, spindle, cytokinesis, and PO regulation. Constitutive recruitment of Elm at the bud through a chimera rescues septin and PO defects in Dma D cells, indicating the defect is due to Elm association with the bud.
Humans have adapted to live in a wide range of environments, and natural selection has likely played a key role in their ability to survive and thrive in extreme climates. Unlike previous studies that only used genetic data to search for evidence of selection, this study scanned the human genome for signals of selection by identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the strongest correlations with climate across 61 worldwide populations. The study found an enrichment of genetic and non-synonymous SNPs relative to non-genic SNPs among those strongly correlated with climate variables. Among the strongest signals, several overlapped with those from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), including SNPs associated with pigmentation and autoimmune diseases. The study also found an enrichment of signals in genes related to UV radiation, infection, and cancer. The results suggest that adaptations to climate shaped the distribution of human variation.

The study presented a genome-wide scan for evidence of positive selection in response to climate variation. Climate influences the distribution of human pathogens, and many signals coincided with SNPs associated with immune response in GW studies. It is likely that the analysis detected selective pressures due to climate are broadly mediated by climate. The study found evidence for selection at individual SNPs identified by GW, sets of genes in cardiovascular and immune diseases, and differentially genes in response to chemical perturbations. Common themes were genes and variants in pigmentation, response to UV, immune, autoimmune, and cancer with strongest signals.

A subset of SN with large effect sizes for climate were associated with traits based on GW results. SN strongly correlated with climate were implicated in pigmentation and autoimmune. The study used allele data to test adaptations to climate at genome level and identified loci under adaptations. Several genome scans have been conducted in humans, but only two used environment to detect signatures on scale.
Researchers studied the genetic condition known as short QT syndrome (SQTS), which is characterized by a shortened QT interval in the heart's electrical cycle and increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms and sudden death. They focused on the SQ1 variant linked to the N588 mutation in the ERG gene, which codes for a potassium channel in the heart cells. Using computer models, they found that this mutation shortens the time it takes for the heart cells to repolarize, or return to a resting state, and increases the difference in repolarization time between different parts of the heart, which can lead to abnormal heart rhythms. However, in a more detailed model of the heart tissue, they found that the mutation also increases the risk of reentrant excitation, a type of abnormal heart rhythm, due to uneven distribution of potassium channels in the heart tissue. The study suggests that the N588 mutation in the ERG gene increases the risk of reentrant excitation and abnormal heart rhythms in SQ1. This is the first study to show how the N mutation affects reentrant excitation in the heart tissue. Previous studies have looked at how other mutations in the ERG gene affect the heart's electrical activity, but not this specific mutation. The findings support the link between the N588 mutation and shortened QT interval and increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms.
Researchers have developed a new model using deep networks to understand the collective behavior of zebraf, a type of fish, in groups. The model is both predictive and insightful, meaning it can accurately describe the motion of individual fish in the group and the interactions between them. The model uses two parts: a pair-interaction network, which describes the interaction between a fish and its closest neighbors, and an aggregation network which combines the outputs of the pair-interaction network. The pair network takes 6 inputs and outputs 128 values, while the aggregation network takes 128 values and outputs a single number. The model was tested on simulated and real trajectories of 60-100 zebraf and found that interactions can be described as repulsive, attractive, or alignment, but only when moving slowly. At high speeds, interactions are alignment or repulsion at close distances. The model also found that each fish decides where to move by aggregating information from the group, with higher weights for neighbors close, in collision, or moving in frontal and lateral locations. The number of interacting individuals is dynamic, typically 8-22, with 1-10 important ones. The results suggest each fish decides by selecting information from the collective.
Researchers have developed a new method to measure the impact of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations on the virus's ability to spread from person to person. This is a concern for long-term effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment, as around 10% of new HIV-1 patients in Europe have drug-resistant strains. The study used data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and drug resistance database to create a "family tree" of viral lineages and model the spread of resistant and sensitive strains. They found that one mutation in the protease gene made the virus more transmissible, while six reverse transcriptase mutations made it less transmissible. The remaining mutations had no significant effect on transmission. This method can help assess risk of drug resistance in resource-limited settings where testing is possible but demographic data is missing.
Researchers have found that a protein complex called Elong, which includes histone acetylase Sin3/El3, plays a crucial role in modifying transfer RNAs (tRNAs) to regulate translation efficiency. They discovered that in yeast cells lacking Elong subunits, there are transcription defects. However, Elong also mediates the modification of some tRNAs, modulating translation efficiency. The study found that fission yeast Sin/3El3 is important for oxidative stress survival. The transcription program governed by Sty1-Atf1-P1 pathway is affected in mutant cells, but not severely. Cells lacking Sin3/3 cannot modify uridine wobble nucleotide of tRNAs and other tRNA activities such as Ctu-C2 are essential for normal tolerance to H2O. A plasm overexpressing tRNALUU complements stress-related phenotypes of Sin3El3 mutant. Determined that H2O-dependent genes, including transcription factors At1 and P1, are highly expressed mRNAs with biased lysine codons. Their mRNAs are poorly translated in stress cells lacking Sin3 or C2, whereas mutated At1 with AAG codons is efficiently translated in all backgrounds. The study shows that lack of functional Elong results in stress phenotypes due to tRNA modification and translation inefficiency of stress-induced mRN.
Researchers have discovered a new function of the HIV-1 protein Nef, which makes the virus resistant to certain antibodies that target the membrane-proxternal region of the Env protein gp41. This region is crucial for the virus to infect cells and cause AIDS. They found that Nef makes the virus 50 times more resistant to two potent antibodies, 2F and 4, but not to other antibodies that target different parts of Env. This effect was seen in various HIV-1 and SIV isolates, including different types of viruses and primary isolates. Analysis of N mutants showed that this activity requires Nef to be myristoylated, but is separate from its other functions like enhancing infectivity and downregulating CD4. Glycosylatedag, a protein from a different virus, substituted Nef in conferring resistance to 2 and 4, indicating this activity is conserved in retroviruses without N. N and Glycosylag decreased virion capture by 2 and 4, but not other antibodies. This study shows N protects lentiviruses from one of the most broadly-acting neutralizing antibodies, with implications for anti-HIV immunity and AIDS pathogenesis.
Researchers studied the genetic changes that occur in the snail host, Bithia siam gomphos, when infected with the liver fluke parasite, Opisthoris vivini, which causes cholangiocarcinoma in the Mekong region of Thailand. They used high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to compare gene expression in infected and uninfected snails, identifying 7,655 differentially expressed genes associated with 43 biological pathways, including immune responses to parasites. Genes encoding proteases were downregulated in infected snails, while heat shock proteins and actins were upregulated. This study lays groundwork for understanding genes involved in parasite colonization of snail host and provides a resource for studying susceptibility and resistance mechanisms.
A study investigated the role of complement receptor 1 (CR1, also known as CD35) in the susceptibility to leprosy, a public health issue in Brazil. Researchers analyzed CR polymorphisms, gene expression, and soluble CR levels in a case-control study with 213 lepro patients (47% multibillary) and 297 controls. They found that individuals with the most common recombinant haplotype harboring rs926*T in intron 21 and rs700*T in exon 26 presented twice higher susceptibility to lepro (OR=2.43, p=0.017). Paibillary patients with these variants had lower CR levels, reducing anti-inflammatory response (p=0.040 and p=0.046). The most haplotype increased susceptibility to multib clinical form (OR=3.04, p=0.01) and presented intronic rs343*G allele, associated higher gene expression (p=0.043), probably increasing parasite internalization. There was an inverse correlation between CR and mannose lectin-binding molecule (initiator of lectin pathway, recognized by CR) (R=-0.52, p=0.007). The study suggests a regulatory role for CR polymorph on mRNA and CR levels, haplotype effects increasing lepro, probably enhancing phagocytosis and inflammation.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate sex-specific differences in serum metabolite concentrations and their genetic determinants. They analyzed data from over 3,300 individuals with measurements of 131 metabolites, including amino acids, phospholipids, sphingolines, acylcarnines, and C-sugars. Linear regression revealed significant differences between males and females for 102 out of 131 metabolites. Genome-wide association studies showed significant differences in beta-estimates for SNPs in the CPS1 locus for glycine. The study found that metabolite profiles of males and females are different, and genetic variants in metabolism-related genes depict sexual dimorphism. This provides new insights into sex-specific regulatory processes and underscores the importance of considering sex-specific effects in studies. 

The study assessed the effect of sex on serum metabolites in a large cohort and investigated sex-specific genetic determination of metabotypes. Findings shed light on sex architecture of the human metabolome and provide clues on biochemical mechanisms explaining differences in disease susceptibility and development between males and females. A meta-analysis of two cohorts revealed 113 metabolites with significant sex effect. The study calculated partial correlation between metabolites, age, and sex, and BMI, and identified differences in genetically determined metabotypes in a subpopulation. Replication was done in independent samples. Genome-wide analysis adjusted for age and BMI showed significant effects of sex in 102 of 131 metabolites.
Researchers have been using genome-scale metabolic networks to model the relationship between a cell's genetic makeup (genotype) and its function (phenotype) through simulations. However, the large number of possible metabolic states makes it difficult to predict the cell's active state under specific conditions, leading to the use of optimization algorithms. The objective function used in these algorithms is linked to the biological model's underlying hypothesis, making it a crucial parameter for successful modeling. Current methods use a combination of selected fluxes to formulate the objective, but show sensitivity to stoichiometry representation of the network, leading to different results when using numerically equivalent but biochemically different representations, making interpretation ambiguous. A new method, Minimization of Metabolites (MiBl), decouples stoichiometry from objective formulation by using metabolite turnovers instead of flux. Simulations demonstrate stoichi representation independence is key to unambiguously linking results with biological interpretation. MiBl allowed expanding metabolic modeling to elucidate genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the distribution of plague, a highly virulent and re-emerging disease, and the genetic structure of the black rat population, Rattus rattus, the main reservoir of plague in Madagascar. They conducted a comparative study of seroprevalence and genetic (microsatellite markers) in rat populations from four geographic areas differing in topology, covering 150-200 km within the Madagas plague focus. The results showed that serreval levels in rat populations mimicked those reported for humans, and populations displayed more genetic structure with increasing relief. However, the relationship between serval data and genetic differed between areas, suggesting plague distribution not solely related to rat dispersal. Genetic estimates suggested plague epizotics had weak impact on population sizes. In highlands Madagascar, plague cannot be accounted for solely by dispersal of reservoir. Human activities may be involved in spreading disease in rat and human populations.
Researchers investigated the Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 (Sm6) family, a group of proteins on the parasite's surface that helps it stay inside the host for a long time. They found 11 members of this family, including 3 new ones, and confirmed that one of the previously known proteins, Sm29, has a unique structure. These proteins are likely attached to the parasite's surface. To see if they trigger an immune response in humans, the researchers looked at IgG, IgA, and IgE antibodies in a group of infected Ugandan men before and after treatment with praziquel. Before treatment, 7.4% and 25.3% of the group had IgG against Sm6A and SmB, respectively, higher than 2.7% against another surface antigen SmAL. After treatment, IgG against SmA and SmB dropped, while Ig against SmAL rose. This study expands the number of Sm6 proteins and shows that SmA and SmB trigger an immune response in infected communities.
Researchers have developed a computer simulation model to understand how cells in the Drosila retina develop their shape during tissue formation. The model focuses on the role of cadherin, a protein that helps cells stick together, and how it changes over time. They tested the model with data from normal and mutant cells that don't have or have too much cadin. The results show that the model can explain the shapes of normal and mutant cells and how cadin works. The simulations also highlight the importance of cadin's timing and how it affects cell connections between cells. Additionally, the model shows that cadin is moved from inactive to active areas, changing the strength of cell connections.

 The study builds on previous knowledge that cell adhesion is key in tissue formation and morphogenesis. It uses a new approach to simulate tissues like the Drosila retina, showing cadin's role goes beyond sorting cells to shape details of their geometry. The model demonstrates three key points: it describes shape changes in mutants, distinguishes how cadin levels are controlled, and includes dynamic features like timing of cad expression and cell contact. These features are established without extra parameters.

 The model considers cadin's distribution and dynamics to understand its control of cell shape. It applies this to a mechanical model and tests with data from mutants with altered cadin levels. Cells in the retina have two adhesion molecules, Eadher and Nadin. All have Ead, but only cones have Nadin. Cadin is localized in a thin area of cell membrane, the adherens junction, where cells stick together.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the role of a protein called MT-MT-M in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in cancer cells. MT-M is a protein that helps cancer cells invade by breaking down the surrounding tissue. The study found that MT-M is quickly turned over, or replaced, in the cells' membrane protrusions called invadodia, where it plays a key role in breaking down the ECM. They used a technique called FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) to track the movement of tagged-MT-M in invodia and found that it recovers quickly, with a time constants of 26 and 259 seconds. The recovery was mainly due to vesicle transport, not diffusion. A computational model was built based on these findings and simulated the FRAP results. When vesicle transport was blocked, both experimentally and in simulation, ECM degradation was also blocked. The degree of ECM degradation depended on the rate of MT-M turnover. The study suggests that both proteolytic activity and MT-M turnover contribute to ECM degradation, with a non-linear reduction when both are reduced. This model can be used to design strategies to intervene in cancer invasion.
Researchers studied how the spread of drug-resistant HIV-1 within an infected individual by examining viral sequences from four macaques with a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) containing HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The macques were treated with inhibitors, and viral DNA and RNA were isolated from blood, lymph nodes, gut, and vagina at four time points. Single-genome sequencing revealed a dynamic process where RNA rapidly acquires resistance across compartments through multiple mutations, with similar genotypes present across compartments but not equally distributed. Blood and lymph nodes were compartmentalized, while blood and lymph were different from mucosal tissues. The study suggests that sampled blood does not capture viral dynamics in other parts of the body, especially gut, where RNA turnover was faster and DNA retained fewer wild-type viruses. This compartmentalization may explain previous conflicting results in HIV-1 studies. 

The researchers obtained single-genome data from four compartments in four macques with SIV containing HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, treated with monotherapy to induce drug-resistant mutations. Viral RNA was sampled from blood, lymph, nodes, vagina, and gut before, during, and after detection of resistant variants in blood. Observations suggest intra-host SIV population mimics intra-patient HIV undergoing monotherapy. Similarities between SIV macques and HIV make S a good model for HIV. S can be sampled more intensively, including tissue biops, than HIV. Estimate of effective population size is similar to HIV, showing S and HIV have dynamics.
Researchers have investigated the role of feedback regulation in tissue morphogenesis, or the process by which tissues develop their shape and form. They used mathematical modeling to show that a specific type of feedback, where both positive and negative signals act on stem and progenitor cells, can lead to unique behaviors such as bistable growth, ultrasensitivity to external cues, growth-driven budding, and self-organization in the form of lamellar fingers. These behaviors arise not through cell cycle regulation, but through control of stem and progenitor self-renewal. The patterns that emerge are a result of interactions between diffusible factors with opposing effects, but morphogenesis is not due to Turing instabilities.

The study found that regulation of stem and progenitor selfnew can lead to bistability and ultras, with switching between high and low or zero growth states. A necessary condition for this behavior is the presence of both positive and negative feedback. In vivo examples of these phenomena include growth bistability, ultras, and feedback-regulated morph.

The researchers showed that simultaneous positive and negative regulation of renewal by diffus signals leads to emergence of spatial dynamic behaviors, manifesting as localized growth differences. They mathematically defined conditions for phenomena such as bistability, ultras and selforganization to arise in systems, and how they drive formation of induced or spontaneous bulges and fingers. These are basic blocks of many morphogenesis. Although patterns arise from opposing diffible interactions, they are not Turing patterns.

Tissue morph often occurs quickly, relative to cell lifespan, final models may represent lineage dynamics during morph, even in selfnew tissues. The study explored effects of feedback in final systems.
Researchers conducted the largest genome-wide study to date on myopia (nearsightedness) in Europeans, analyzing data from 45,771 participants. They found 22 significant associations with the age of onset of myopia, 10 of which were previously unknown. These associations explain 2.9% of the variation in age of myopia onset and suggest multiple mechanisms behind its development. One association is in the PRSS56 gene, linked to abnormally small eyes, one in LAMA, part of the extracellular matrix, two in regeneration of 11-cis-ret (RGR and RD5), two in growth of retinal ganglion cells (ZIC and SP1), and five in neuronal development. The study points to complex interactions between extracellular remodeling, neuronal, and visual signals from the retina in myopia in humans.
A study investigated the role of curvature feedback in the energetics and dynamics of lamprey swimming using a closed-loop model. The lamprey, like other animals, have a central pattern generator (CPG) circuit that activates locomotion and adjusts to sensory inputs from the environment. Feedback is crucial for responding to perturbations, but also active during unperturbed swimming, influencing the baseline pattern. The study evaluated different forms of body-based feedback and their effects on steady swimming energetics and kinematics. The CP was modeled as coupled oscillators, pairs representing left and right segments along the lamprey body, activating muscles to move through a simulated fluid using a Navier-Stokes model. Emergent curvature served as input to the oscillators, closing the loop. Two forms of feedback were considered, consistent with experimental results on lamp proprioceptive receptors. Directional feedback excites or inhibits oscillators on the same side, opposite on the other. It did not affect frequency, but changed duration of activity. Magnitude feedback provided a symmetric effect on both sides, increasing frequency and reducing energetic cost when gain was high. Both types had similar curvature magnitude. Results indicate magnitude-based feedback with different forms can cause distinct swimming performance.
A study investigated the dynamics of HIV epidemics in populations, focusing on the competition between different strains of the virus. It was found that the strain that first to colonize a population has an advantage over others, slowing down the spread of new strains and diversification of the epidemic. A stochastic modeling framework was developed to simulate HIV epidemics over contact networks, where a second strain was introduced into a population where the first strain had established a steady state. Simulations showed the second strain spread occurred on a slower scale than the first, and needed a 25% advantage in transmission efficiency to become dominant over decades. The effect was weaker if the second was introduced during the first's growth phase. Interference mechanisms such as inhibition, superinfection, depletion of highly connected nodes, and one-time peak infectiousness were also tested, confirming a strong first advantage in HIV competition at the population level. This may explain the global geography of the virus and influence the evolution of the pandemic. In sexually transmitted epidemics, strains with higher transmission potential replace less efficient ones, and the pace of this process needs to be characterized. A model was developed to monitor competition of strains with varying transmission rates, showing the strain with highest potential drives others extinct in the long term. However, mechanisms can slow invasion and the pandemic is not static, with shifts between lineages occurring. The expansion of HIV-1 at the expense of D in Eastern Africa was used to estimate the required transmission advantage. A stochastic individual-based model tracked HIV spread over a dynamic network of heterosexual contacts, consisting of males, females, and sex workers.
Researchers studied how muscle cells organize their internal structure and function at different scales, from the smallest units called sarcomeres to the entire muscle. They found that the environment outside space around the cells, called the extracellular space, plays a crucial role in organizing the cell's internal structure, specifically the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is a network of proteins that gives cells their shape and allows them to move and contract. The researchers developed a model to understand how the cytoskeleton of heart muscle cells, called myocytes, organizes in response to cues from the extracellular space. They found that the cytoskeleton forms through a series of steps: actin fibers, myofibrils, and focal adhesions interact, and then myofils align and bundle together. The study suggests a hierarchy of mechanisms regulates the cytoskeleton's organization and a feedback loop from the extracellular space is necessary for the cytos to become polarized, or have direction. This is important for the muscle to contract.

The researchers also created a computational model to mimic the process of sarere assembly, where proteins assemble along actin fibers. They compared their model to other models of cytoskeleton assembly and found differences. Myofils mature in a force-dependent manner, meaning the muscle's ability to contract may influence their organization. This has been seen in non-muscle cells where cytos architecture becomes polarized with increasing forces. They developed a model of myofillar patterning to see how intracellular architecture responds to extracellular space. The goal was to understand global organization of contractile apparatus in myocytes during development.
Researchers investigated the potential of Wolbachia, a symbiotic bacterium being trialed as a biocontrol agent to reduce dengue transmission, to invade and spread in wild mosquito populations. To do so, it requires high maternal transmission rates, strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, and low fitness costs in the host. However, differences in climate, field protocols, urbanization, and human density amongst deployment sites have limited comparison of Wolia's invasive potential. The study examined phenotypic effects of the Wolia strain in Aedes aegypt mosquitoes with Brazilian background to characterize its invasive potential. Results showed strong cytoplasm incompatibility, high maternal transmission rates, and no detrimental effects on host fecundity or fertility. To understand urban landscape effects on mosquito survival, mark-release experiments were performed using Wolia-infected mosquitoes in two areas of Rio de Janeiro where Wolia will be deployed. Mosquito populations were characterized in relation to socio-demographic conditions at sites and three future release areas. Mathematical models were constructed using laboratory and field data to describe influence of environmental conditions on likelihood of Wolia infection reaching 100% following release. Predicted successful invasion at five sites, conditions varying greatly between sites and influenced by local mosquito population size. Laboratory and field data showed Melia strain Wolia possesses characteristics to spread in urban-demographic environments in Rio Janeiro, including Eliminate Program release sites.
Researchers have identified a protein called JMJ703 that is responsible for removing a specific type of epigenetic modification called histone lysine methylation from histone H3 (H3) in rice plants. Histone lysine methylation is an important for regulating chromatin structure and gene expression, and histone H3 lysine methylation (H3Kme) has been shown to play a role in plant development and stress response. JMJ703 is a histone demethylase that specifically removes all three forms of H3me: mono, di, and trimethyl. Loss of JMJ function affects plant stem elongation and growth, possibly due to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase genes. The researchers analyzed the structure of JMJ's catalytic core and found similarities with mammalian and yeast JM2 proteins, but also unique features that interact with cofactors and methylated H3 substrate. Key residues are conserved in known H4 demethylases, suggesting specificity for H4 demylation. J703 is essential for plant cell division and stem elongation, and demethylates H3me in vivo and in vitro. Demethylation of Hme implies J is important for gene expression. Phenotype caused by T-DNA and RNAi and increased CK genes suggest J may regulate growth hormone metabolism.
Researchers have found that the HIV-1 capsid, a crucial for the virus's life cycle from reverse transcription to integration, interacts with multiple host and pharmacologic ligands. However, previous studies have focused on individual capsid monomers, leaving unclear how these ligands influence infection. This study shows that a multi-unit interface within hexamers mediates binding to cellular cofactors NUP and CPS6 and antiviral compounds PF and BI-2. Each ligand anchors to a phenylalanine-glyine motif in the N-terminal domain of one monomer, with BI-2 also interacting across the N-terminal: C-terminal interface of a second monomer. Disassembly of hexamer into monomers prevents high affinity with CPS6 and PF, and abolishes NUP binding. The interface is conformationally dynamic, but NUP or CPS6 binding is accommodated by one conformation. NUP and CPS6 have overlapping sites, but unique interactions when mutated, perturb cofactor dependency. This reveals multiple ligands share an interface in HIV-1 caps lost upon disassembly.
Researchers have improved the assembly of the genome of the mosquito Aedes aegypt, which transmits diseases such as dengue and yellow fever and chikunya viruses. The mosquito has a large and complex genome with many repetitive sequences, resulting in a poorly assembled genome with 4,758 scaffolds, few of which were assigned to chromosomes. To map genes affecting disease transmission, they scored many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in recombinant progeny from a cross between two strains of Ae. aegypt and generated a genetic map. This revealed a high rate of misassemblies in the current genome, where sequences from different chromosomes were on the same scaffold. Once corrected, 60% of the genome was assigned to chromosomes and scaffolds ordered along chromosomes. Large regions of suppressed recombination around centromeres were found, extending up to 47% of chromosome. A gene making Ae.egi resistant to the parasite Brugia mal was mapped, and a list of candidate genes affecting the trait was generated.
Researchers conducted a study to compare the effectiveness of different methods for monitoring the mosquito Aedes aegypt, a vector of diseases such as dengue chikung and yellow fever, in five cities with varying climates. They used four types of traps (BG-Sent, Adultrap, MosquiAP, and ovitrap) in addition to traditional larval surveys to measure mosquito density and seasonality. The study found that larval surveys were less effective in detecting the presence of Ae. aegypt, especially in areas with low mosquito populations. Traps, however, were more sensitive in detecting the presence of Ae. aegpt, but tended to plateau at high densities. Despite this, both methods agreed on the seasonality of mosquito abundance in all cities, which was associated with temperature rather than precipitation, even in areas with small temperature variation. All traps performed better than larval surveys in measuring seasonal variation in abundance and should be considered as complements or alternatives. The study supports the use of trap-based surveillance programs in deng endemic countries and suggests traps could be used in combination with control strategies to improve response to deng and other diseases transmitted by Ae. aegypt.
Researchers have studied the protein APOBECG3, a potent inhibitor of retroviruses and transposable elements, to understand its mechanism of action. APOECG3 contains two cytidine deaminase domains, only one of which is known to mediate cytidine deamination. By analyzing the structure of a related protein APOEC2, they identified residues in APOG that facilitate oligomerization. Using yeast two-hybrid, coimmunprecipitation, and crosslinking assays, they found tyrosine and tryptan in the enzymatically inactive N-terminal domain mediate APOG oligomer and its packaging into HIV-1 virions. Oligomerization is also shown to be RNA-dependent. Modeling APO onto the A2 structure indicates a positive charge accumulation in a putative dimer interface. Substituting arginine at positions 24, 30, and 136 in this pocket reduced virus inhibition, virion, and oligomer. Consistent with RNA's central role, oligomer-deficient APO proteins associated less with cellular molecules. They propose occupation of the charged pocket by RNA promotes A oligomer, packaging into virions, and antiviral function.
Researchers have identified the genetic variations that contribute to a major-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL) in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The QTL is responsible for cuticular pigmentation, which is the color and pattern of the fly's outer layer. The researchers found that multiple polymorphisms, or variations in the DNA sequence, near regulatory elements of the bric-br gene contribute to the effect. These elements include a promoter, a tissue-specific enhancer, and a Polycomb response element. Analysis of gene expression at the br-br locus shows that these polymorphisms modulate transcription at the regulatory level, meaning they affect how the gene is turned on or off. This study shows that a single QTL can act through a combination of mechanisms and that variation in regions flanking functional elements can have significant effects on transcription and phenotype. This has implications for understanding genetics and genomics in both basic and medical research. 

The researchers sequenced the 148 kilobase region of the brac gene in 94 inbred lines of D. melanogaster to identify the polymorphisms. They found that multiple polymorph in a single regulatory element of the ebony gene contribute to pigmentation differences between populations. Other studies have shown that multiple polym contribute to variation in protein function. This suggests accumulation of mutations at a locus may be a common mechanism of micro and macroevolutionary change. The br locus is composed of two duplicated genes, bab1 and bab, which are involved in patterning the abdomen, legs, and ovaries. Bab expression in pupal epidermis is responsible for sex-specific pigmentation and changes have played a role in macroevolution of D melanaster color patterns. This is different from cases where Qs are due to single or regulatory mutations with major effects.
Streptococcus pneumonia (pneumococcus) is a persistent cause of invasive and mucosal disease in humans, despite widespread use of antibiotics and vaccines. Its resilience is due to its ability to adapt through uptake and incorporation of new genetic material from surrounding microbial community. DNA uptake and recombination is controlled by tightly regulated quorum sensing system triggered by extracellular accumulation of competence peptide (CSP). This study demonstrates CSP stimulates production of diverse bacteriocins through increased production and secretion of bacteriophage BlC and requires functional competence system. A conserved motif in promoter of operon encoding BlC and its transporter mediates upregulation by CSP. Accumulation BlC following CSP results in activation of Bl locus. Using biofilm organisms as model for competition and genetic exchange on mucosal surface, DNA exchange is enhanced by bacterin secretion, suggesting co-stimulation of bacterins with competence provides adaptive advantage. Bl and regulatory pathways are believed to have diverged in remote pneumoccus ancestor, yet maintained connection promotes competition and adaptation by targeting lysis wide potential competitors while providing incorporation DNA.
Researchers investigated the role of cellular protein SR20 (SRp20) in poliovirus infection, a virus that causes poliomyelitis. They found that SR20 localizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of infected cells, where it interacts with protein PC2 (PC2), a known to be involved in viral translation. The two proteins co-localize in the cytoplasm and are present in viral translation complexes. SR20 is associated with PC2 bound to polirus RNA, suggesting interaction occurs on the RNA. A mutated version of SR20 lacking its RNA recognition motif (SR20ΔM) localizes similarly, but expression results in a 100-fold decrease in virus yield, indicating a dominant negative effect. The study suggests SR20 interacts with PC2 on viral RNA to recruit ribosomes for translation initiation.
Researchers used a genetic screen to identify genes involved in the development of the neural crest (NC), a group of embryonic cells that gives rise to various cell types, including nerve cells and melanocytes. They used a mouse model with a mutation in the Sox10 gene, which is important for NC development, and exposed it to a chemical mutagen to induce random mutations. Out of 71 lines analyzed, four mutations were found that altered NC patterning. One mutation, called m1, resulted in the absence of Sox10 expression in certain cells, but not others were unaffected. Analysis showed that m1 was a new mutation in the ErbB3 gene, a receptor tyrosine kinase, with a single amino acid change in its extracellular region. The mutation did not affect protein expression but impaired signaling, causing defects similar to Erb3 null alleles. Biochemical analysis showed the protein was on the cell surface but ligand-induced phosphorylation was reduced. This highlights the importance of the mutated residue for Erb3 function.
Researchers conducted a study in a Ugandan community to investigate factors influencing Schistosoma mansoni infection, a parasitic flatworm causing schistosomiasis. They examined how age, sex, ethnicity, and IgE (a type of immune response) affect susceptibility to reinfection after anti-parasite treatment. The study used a multidisciplinary approach to account for environmental and behavioral variations in exposure to the parasite. They found that ethnic and sex-related variations in reinfection were due to differences in parasite exposure, not biological susceptibility. Age-related differences in reinfection were not explained by exposure, but linked to IgE and IgG responses to a specific antigen. This study highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in complex settings to understand population ecology and draw robust conclusions. 

The study used data from a longitudinal study in a Ugandan fishing community highly endemic for schosomiasis to investigate variations in S. mansoni reinfection. To account for complex, ethnically-influenced exposure patterns, they used individual parasite exposure scores to adjust for variations. This is supported by other studies on exposure and reinfection in schosias-endemic communities, identifying individuals resistant or predisposed to infection. Genetic studies also identified genes associated with susceptibility or immunity. Small studies on risk factors for Schos infection are limited by lack of individual parasite exposure data, using proxy markers like distance to infective water can be misleading. 

The study found age-infection profiles typical of schos-endemic communities: infection greatest in children, lower in adults. Exposure scores investigated roles of age and sex in susceptibility, and whether Alur ethnic group is more susceptible. Schosome Ig or Ig4 responses could account for remaining susceptibility variation.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the number of eggs per gram of feces (EPG) and the actual worm burden of Clonorchis sinensis in humans. A total of 60 residents, 50 egg-positive and 10-negative, in Sanche-gun, Korea, participated in the study from 2006-2009. They were diagnosed by egg positivity in feces using the Kato-K method. After administration of prazantel, they were purged with cathartics the next day, and adult worms were collected from feces. EP ranged from 0 to 65,544. Adult C. sin were collected from 17-positive, and number ranged from 1 to 114 each. A correlation between EP and number of worms was demonstrated (r= 0.681, P<0.001). Recovery rates were 9.7% in EP 1-1,000 and 73.7% in EP over 1,000. No worms detected from egg-negative. Maximum count per worm per day estimated 3,770 in subject EP 2,664 and collected. Numbers of worms significantly correlated with egg in Cloniasis. Estimated at least 110 worms in body EP around 3,000 and productivity per day around 4,000.
Researchers have developed a new approach to combat the growing problem of antifungal drug resistance by identifying genetic interactions that can be targeted to prevent the emergence of resistance. They used an unbiased genome-wide screen in yeast cells expressing a gene that makes them resistant to a common antifungal drug, fluconazole. This gene is a major cause of resistance in the human fungal pathogen Candida glabrata. Eighteen genetic mutations in yeast were found to be lethal when combined with the resistant gene. One of these, a histone acetylase G5, was further studied. Deleting or inhibiting G5 made the resistant Candida cells die and prevented the emergence of resistant strains. This shows that targeting G5, a partner of the resistant gene, is a new way to treat drug-resistant infections. Candida cells lacking G5 and the resistant gene were unable to grow. Chemical inhibition of G5 also prevented the emergence of resistant strains. This study demonstrates that identifying genetic interactions that cause resistance can be targeted to prevent it. Candida strains with the resistant gene are more virulent, implying adaptation to antifungals makes them more disease-causing. An unbiased screen was used to identify lethal interactions with the resistant gene. A chemical inhibition of G5 prevented growth of yeast and resistant Candida strains.
Researchers studied how the poliovirus (PV) infection affects cell membranes and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4) levels. They found that PV induces PI4 as early as 30 minutes post-infection, even in the presence of a replication inhibitor, and forms membrane tubules throughout the cytoplasm. Vesicular clusters appear in the perinuclear region at 3 hours post-infection, too late to be responsible for replication delays. Two mutants, EG and GG, with aberrant proteolytic processing of the P3 precursor, delay genome replication and assembly, similar to PI4 remodeling delays. GG fails to convert tubules into vesicles, resulting in nearly 5-log reduction in infectious virus production. The study suggests PV induces distinct membrous structures for replication (tubules) and assembly (vesicles). The pace, spatiemporal dynamics, and efficiency of replication-to-assembly conversion may be set by P3 processing rate and capacity to yield 3 and 3 proteins.
Researchers developed a multi-step strategy to identify new compounds with trypanocidal activity against Chagas disease. They used virtual screening and in vitro assays to select 23 compounds from the ZINC database, and found 12 non-peptide cruzain inhibitors with low micromolar affinity (3-60µM) through competitive inhibition. X-ray crystallography confirmed the binding mode of cruzain inhibitor Neimed176. Cruzain is a validated target for Chagas chemotherapy and shares similarity with mammalian cathepsin L. Increased catheps L activity is linked to invasive properties and metastatic cancer, so cruz inhibitors were assayed against it, showing similar affinity (4-80µM) and poor selectivity towards cruz. To select the most potent inhibitors, structure-activity (SAR) studies were done against T cruz-infected cells. Two compounds showed trypanidal activity. Compound Neimed42 was used to establish SAR, identifying the 2-acamidothiophene-3-carbox group essential for enzyme and parasite inhibition. The IC50 for Neimed against the trypastote form of TuluenZ was 10.6±0.1µM, tenfold lower than benidazole, a positive control. Employing simplification, a smaller compound (Neimed) was highlighted as a non-peptide, nonvalent cruzain trypanidal candidate for optimization.
Researchers have developed a new DNA-based vaccine against yellow fever (YF) virus, which is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical areas worldwide. The current attenuated YF vaccine generates long-lasting antibodies and T-cell responses, but can have rare fatal side effects. The new vaccine consists of two DNA formulations encoding the full-length envelope protein (pFE) or full-length protein fused to lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1 (LFE), aiming to divert antigen presentation through major histocompatibility complex compartments. The formulations were tested in C57/6 and BAL/c mice, corresponding to C57/6 and BAL/c strains. Both induced strong T-cell responses against all epitopes generated by Y17 vaccine, with LFE performing best. Additionally, LFE stimulated high anti-Y neutralizing antibodies comparable to 17 vaccine levels, and provided 100% protection against intracereally challenged mice. These results indicate LFE is an excellent candidate for further studies.
Researchers have identified a new role for the nucleoid protein SlmA in Vibrio cholera, a pathogen that causes cholera. SlmA is a transcription activator of the chb operon, which encodes genes for chitin utilization. Chitin is essential for Vibrio cholera's persistence and horizontal gene transfer in the marine environment. The sensor kinase ChiS regulates the ch operon, but its downstream mechanisms were unclear. An unbiased transposon screen revealed SlmA as a regulator of chb. SlmA is a TetR family protein, typically transcriptional repressors. In vitro, SlmA binds to the ch oper promoter, and in vivo, this interaction is required for transcription and chitin utilization. Mutations show DNA binding, not nucleoidation, is critical for activation. This study shows SlmA's novel role as a transcription regulator in Vibrio cholera, in addition to its cell division licensing function.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework for solving complex problems that arise in modeling biological systems. These problems are challenging due to highly nonlinear and stiff differential equations and large amounts of experimental data and parameters. The proposed framework uses cutting-edge tools that are efficient, robust, and easy to use. It employs a time-discretization approach that avoids repetitive model simulations, enables algebraic computation of derivatives, and uses efficient nonlinear solvers that exploit sparse linear techniques. The framework was tested on a human gut microbiome model with 156 parameters, 144 equations, and 1,704 data points, solving it in under 3 minutes, while an off-the-shelf solution took 7 hours. Large instances showed the framework can solve up to 2,352 parameters, 2,304 equations, and 20,352 points in 15 minutes. The framework is flexible and can be applied to various biological models, enabling tasks such as uncertainty quantification, observability analysis, model selection, and outlier handling.
Researchers used a high-throughput gene expression system called nCounter to study the inflammatory response in mice infected with West Nile virus (WNV) in the Swiss Webster (SW) mouse model. They analyzed gene expression in multiple tissues over nine days following intraperitoneal injection with NV. A kit containing 179 inflammation-related genes was used to identify changes in spleen, lung, liver, and brain of infected mice. Results showed Ccl and Ilb were differentially expressed in all tested tissues except kidney. Stratification of infected (W+) versus non-infected (-) tissues allowed differentiation of systemic gene response from tissue-specific responses. Significant decrease in C1 was found in (-) spleen, while Il was upregulated, Il was downregulated in (-) lung, and M2 were downregulated in (-) liver. In (+) liver, Stat, T2, chemines Ccl, C, C, C, C, cytokine, Il, cytokine, and agonist were upregulated. In (-) tissues, C and C were upregulated. Gene and protein kinetics for C, C, C, C, and C correlated with presence of virus. The study demonstrated utility of nCounter for rapid identification of gene changes in mice with NV infection.
An outbreak of rabies occurred in Maputo and Matola cities, Mozambique in 2014, prompting an investigation into the epidemiology, clinical features, and risk factors of human rabies and animal bites in the two cities. Between April and August 2014, 14 cases of human rabies were detected in Maputo (n=10), Matola (n=3), and neighboring Bo district (n=1), all with a history of recent dog bites. Of the 14 rabid dogs, only one was immunized. A total of 819 animal bites were registered, with 64.6% (529/819) from Maputo City, with dogs responsible for 97.8% (801/819) of bites, but only 27.0% (126/467) were immunized. Factors associated with human rabies were age <15 years, bite by stray dog, deep wound, bite to head, by unimmun dog, no soap use, and post-exposure prophylaxis.

The study aimed to determine clinical and epidemiological features of human rab cases, risk for developing rab, and animal bites in Map and Matola. The findings will contribute to formulating recommendations for rab control in Mozambique. This is the first attempt to investigate rab outbreak and epidemiology of bites in Mozambique. In Mozambique, procedures are irregular, resulting in frequent rabies outbreaks. Maputo City health authorities alerted a possible outbreak in July 2014 when Maputo Hospital admitted patients with rab in short time. Reliable data on rab burden and risk is a challenge for policies and strategies, a major cause for underinvestment in control. Mozambique has high burden of rab in sub-Saharan Africa.

Demographic and risk factors were compared between animal bites and human rab cases to determine predictive associated with rab after bite. Age <15 (OR:4.8, p=0.05), bite stray (OR:13.6,=0.002), deep (OR:0.02), head (0.001), unimmun (0.01), no (0.001), and (0.01) were associated.
Researchers identified a new gene, SCN9, encoding the Nav1.7 sodium channel, as a cause of febrile seizures (FS) in a large family with significant linkage to chromosome 2q. A mutation in a highly conserved amino acid, p.N641, in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains I and II, was found in 21 affected members but not in ethnically matched controls. To confirm the role of SCN9 in seizure susceptibility, the mutation was introduced into the murine Sc9 ortholog using homologous recombination. Compared to wild-type mice, homozygous Sc9N641/N641 knock mice showed reduced thresholds to electrically induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures and increased kindling rates. This supports SCN9 as a disease-causing gene in the family. SCN9 was also analyzed in 92 unrelated FS patients, finding highly conserved Nav.7 missense variants in 5%. One child with FS later developed Drav syndrome, a severe myoclonic epilepsy, and SCN1 was sequenced, revealing a heterozygous frameshift mutation. Analysis of 109 Drav patients found 9 Nav.7 missense variants, 8% of patients, in conserved amino acids. Six Drav patients with SCN9 missense had either miss or splice SCN1 mutations or no SCN1 mutations. This study shows SCN9's role in human epileps, both as a cause and partner with SCN1 mutations.
Researchers have long sought to understand how complex tissue shapes arise through growth, particularly when growth occurs preferentially along certain orientations, raising the question of how these orientations are specified. Two possibilities exist: orientations are specified through stresses in the tissue (axiality system) or independently through molecular (polarity system). The axial system has been explored through computational modeling, while the polarity system is less understood. This study develops a polarity-based framework, called Growing Polarised Tissue (GPT), treating tissue as a continuous material where regionally expressed factors interact and propagate polarity is established by signals anchored in tissue organisers. Growth rates parallel or perpendicular to polarity are specified through a regulatory network, resulting in complex shapes emerging from simple rules. Asymmetries emerge through interactions between polarity fields. The PT framework is applied to a growing Snapdragon, illustrating how hypotheses can be tested computationally. Combinatorial interactions between orientations and growth, a feature of polarity systems, have been exploited to generate observed shapes.
Researchers investigated how multiple CD8+ T cell responses in early HIV infection affect the emergence of mutations that help the virus escape from the immune system. These responses put pressure on different parts of the virus's genome, leading to mutations that are beneficial for the virus. Some studies found that as these mutations emerge, they spread more slowly, a pattern known as the "escape rate decrease" (ER). This pattern can arise from different mechanisms, including interference between mutations in large populations with high mutation rates, which can delay the spread of beneficial mutations compared to sexual reproduction. The study examined how interference between concurrent mutations affects escape rates in multiple epitopes and if it's a source of ER. They developed a multi-locus Wright-Fisher model of HIV dynamics with selection, mutation, and recombination as a null model for interference, and an interference-free model assuming initial neutral evolution before immune response. Interference between equally advantageous mutations generated the ER pattern. The number of loci and recombination rates affected ER, explained by exponential decline of escape rates over time. ER in HIV individuals is consistent with both interference-free and interference effects. Interference should be considered when analyzing escape mutations. Estimating rates and selective coefficients is challenging due to interference effects, not overcome by sampling sizes or frequencies.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict the effectiveness of chemotherapy treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCL) patients. The model takes into account various factors such as cancer cell proliferation, heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance. It uses data from two points in time, before and during treatment, to estimate the effect of the tumor microenvironment and cell repopulation on treatment outcome. A sensitivity analysis found that growth rate and fraction at diagnosis are key features for accurate estimates. The model was applied to 13 patients with NSCL who received cisplatin with gemcitab, vinlb, or docetax in neoadjuvant context. Input values were guided by literature on cancer-specific kinetics. Latin hyper sampling was used to compensate for patient uncertainties. The model provides a framework for estimating in-vivo cell killing of chemotherapies. Correlation with molecular profiles could lead to personalized predictions.
Researchers studied how bacteria in biofilms develop resistance to antibiotics, specifically the antibiotic fluoroquinolofloxacin. Biofilms are communities of bacteria that adhere to surfaces and can be resistant to antibiotics due to their complex structure and heterogeneity. The study used random mutagenesis to identify mutants in Escherichia coli that formed biofilms with high tolerance to fluoroquinoloxacin. They found that amino acid-starved biofilms were more tolerant to the antibiotic than planktonic bacteria. The tolerance was dependent on the SOS response to amino acid and carbon starvation, and partially on the stringent response to leucine starvation. However, it did not involve toxin-antitoxin systems associated with highly tolerant persisters. Biofilm tolerance increased with age and was dependent on the SOS response. The study shows that SOS response in nutrient-deprived biofilm environments leads to high tolerance to fluoroquinoloxacin.
Researchers have identified a key role for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in regulating the invasion of human red blood cells by Plasium falcumeroites, the parasite responsible for malaria. Invasion of red blood cells by P. falcumeroites requires specific interactions between host cell receptors and parasite ligands located in apical organelles called micronemes. The study found that exposure to low potassium levels, similar to those found in blood, activates a specific enzyme that raises c levels and activates protein kinase, which regulates micron secretion. They also discovered that c regulates calcium levels in the parasite through a separate pathway and that both are necessary for micron secretion. This discovery provides new targets to prevent parasite growth and malaria.
Strongyloides stercis, a soil-transmitted threadworm, is one of the most neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). A review of 20 years of studies on S. stercis global prevalence in populations and risk groups was conducted. A literature search was performed on PubMed articles from 1989 to 2011, including studies with information on infection prevalence. A Bayesian analysis was done to get country-specific estimates and compare odds ratios in risk groups, accounting for diagnostic sensitivities. 354 studies from 78 countries were included, 62.4% community-based, 34.2% hospital, and 11% refugee/immigrant. World maps with data are provided. Many African, Asian, and South American poor countries lack S.ercis information. Meta-analysis showed association with HIV/alcoholism and Sercis (OR 2.17, CI 1.18-4.01, OR 6.69 CI 1.47-3.8). High prevalence in selected countries and regions. Sercis prominent in risk groups. Adequate information lacking from many countries, but shows Serc must not be neglected. Further socio-economic and ecological assessments and integration into global health warranted.

The study aimed to get country-wide Sercis risk and assess association with risk groups. High rates in South Asia, refugees, and immigrants reported. In developed countries, strongyias an issue for immigrants, tourists, and military returning from endemic areas. This has implications for services and may call for screening before immunosuppressive treatment. Serc information patchy, incidence non-existent. Strongloides stercis a soil-trans nematode, one of most helth NTDs, world-wide, excluding north and south, estimates often guesses. More data needed for countries, socio-cultural settings. Large surveys and sensitive methods would narrow gap.
Researchers have found that stochastic noise at the cellular level plays a crucial role in circadian oscillations, influencing how groups of cells synchronize with external cues and generating cell-autonomous rhythms. However, few studies have investigated how perturbations affect stochastic noise, mainly due to the difficulty in measuring cell-autonomous noise directly. This study shows that the damping of population-level bioluminescence can serve as an accurate measure of stochastic noise, applicable to high-throughput circadian screens. Using fibroblast data, they demonstrate that higher single-cell noise results in faster population damping, and that damping can be changed by small molecule modulators in a dose-dependent fashion. A mathematical model explains the change by single-cell noise. The method is applied to a genome-wide siRNA screen, revealing stochastic altered independently from period and phase. The study hypothesizes the unperturbed clock is optimized for robust rhythms, with few perturbations capable of increasing amplitude and lowering noise.
Researchers have identified the bacterial protein Fts as a promising target for developing new antibiotics to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The protein FZ is essential for bacterial cell division, and an allosteric inhibitor, PC723, has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against Staphylococcus aureus. However, its mechanism of action and effect on other bacterial species is unclear. This study examined the structure of the PC723 binding pocket using Pocket, a method that scores similarity between small molecule binding sites based on 3D structure and molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that species and nucleotide state significantly impact the binding site's properties, with disparate environments for non-Staphlococcus species. PC723 strongly binds Staphlocus FZ in the nucleotide state, and simulations suggest polymerization enhances binding. These findings demonstrate that the binding pocket can vary across species, genetic variations, and polymer states, informing the development of FZ inhibitors.
Researchers have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal and catalytic core domains of HIV-1 integrase (IN) in complex with the binding domain of lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF), a protein essential for lentiviral replication. The structure reveals charge interactions between the N-terminal domain of IN and the binding domain of LEDGF, highlighting a constellation of acidic residues on IN and positively charged residues on LED. These interactions are critical for lentiviral DNA integration in vitro and during early steps of HIV-1 replication. A mutant HIV-1 IN was engineered to function only with a complementary LEDGF mutant. The findings provide a basis for lentiviral IN-LED interaction and pave the way for LED-based gene therapy targeting. The N-terminal domain of HIV-1 IN is crucial for interaction with LEDGF, with mutations destabilizing this domain reducing interaction. A homolog of LED, hepatoma-derived growth-related protein 2 (HRP2), interacts with HIV-1 IN but its role in lentiral integration is unclear. Lentiv IN is a tetramer, with a tetramer model proposed for apoenzyme. Lentiral integration depends on LEDGF, which associates with chromatin and regulates gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and apoptosis. LED binds lentiviral IN, stimulating strand transfer and directing PIC to active genes during integration.
Researchers studied how cancer cells from different organs at various ages behave and how they transform into cancer cells. They found that the initial behavior of these cells determines the progression of the tumor. Genetic and epigenetic changes can alter cell behavior, making it more likely for the tumor to grow. They created a model to track the evolution of cancer stem cells, which are the only cells that can start and sustain tumors. They looked at traits such as cell migration, death, division, and telomere length to see how they affect tumor growth. The study found that cell proliferation is the strongest factor in tumor growth. Early increase in proliferation leads to more non-stem cancer cells that compete with stem cells, while decrease in proliferation allows stem cells to divide more. The stem cell population becomes heterogeneous, leading to varying dynamics from dormancy to progression. The diversity in a single tumor sample is only a small part of the total phenotypes.
Researchers have studied the emergence of novel infectious diseases in humans, focusing on the role of adaptation and spatial heterogeneity in the human population. They used mathematical models to describe different scenarios of adaptation and its impact on the probability of emergence and outbreak size. The study found that for typical connections between communities, spatial heterogeneity has a weak effect on outbreak distribution and risk. For example, a village connected to a city by 10 commuters a day is effectively part of the city in terms of emergence and outbreak distribution. Data on commuting patterns show most communities are at least this interconnected. For plausible ranges, effects of heterogeneity are likely dominated by host biology adaptation. The study suggests only remote communities may be subject to epidemiological isolation. Factors like human patterns and host heterogeneity also shape risk and speed of emergence. The research focused on spatial structure of the host population, which has received little attention in adapting pathogens. The model separated communities with varying connections, such as a village and city. The biology of the pathogen determines emergence and outbreak sizes according to reproductive number. The effective village size is due to absent commuters. A threshold exists where heterogeneity does not matter. Previous research showed effect depends on interconnectivity allowing spread between communities. The approach provides new insights without specifying infectious hosts migrating. The study calculates epidemiological parameters of a disease adapting to humans, exploring host structure and validating with simulations of village-city models.
Researchers analyzed data from 287 avian influenza A virus (AIV) samples collected over a 34-year period from migratory birds in North America. They used a statistical framework to test hypotheses on viral migration, population structure, and genetic reassortment patterns. The study found that Charadriiform birds in Delaware do not significantly contribute to North American IV diversity, but Anseriform birds in Alberta are representative of IV circulating in North Anseres. IV may be restricted to short-term migratory flyways, but long-term persistence is independent of flyways between populations. Analysis of long-term data provides insights for predictive models for pandemic preparedness and livestock protection. Avian viruses were isolated annually in Alberta and Delaware, and 287 genomes were sequenced to characterize reassment dynamics, spatial patterns, and evolutionary genomics. The study identified 20 regions in North America where viruses were collected from wild birds to determine population structure according to migratory fly and rates of gene flow between populations. The goal was to understand virus migration and diffusion in natural hosts using 30 years of surveillance. Results show that Alberta, with convergence of four migratory flyways, captures majority of North genetic diversity. Breeding birds in this region facilitate spread and generation of virus diversity, indicating importance of Anseres behavior in persistence. Delaware is a hotspot for avian A viruses, where thousands of Charri stop to feed. Long-term persistence of IV in wild may be independent of migratory fly.
Researchers have developed a novel monoclonal antibody, MAb S/1391, that targets a specific site on the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza A viruses. This antibody shows cross-reactivity to multiple subtypes of HA, including H1, H2, H3, H5, H9, and H13, and neutralizes infectivity in vitro and in vivo by blocking viral attachment to cells. The study demonstrates that MAb/1391 binds to a common antigenic site shared among various HA subtypes, supporting the idea that cross-reactive antibodies play a role in heterosubtic immunity against influenza virus infection. Passive immunization of mice with MAb/1391 provided heterosubic protection. Mutant viruses that escaped neutralization by MAb/1391 showed amino acid substitutions at positions 156, 158, and 193, located on the globular head of HA, forming a conformational epitope adjacent to the receptor-binding domain. MAb S/139 likely neutralizes viral infectivity by blocking receptor binding of the virus, as hemagglutination of viruses was also inhibited by the antibody.
Researchers conducted a three-year study to assess the effectiveness of ivermectin treatment in controlling Strongyloides steralis infection in an Australian Aboriginal population. The study involved 259 adults living in a remote community in northern Australia, where the initial prevalence of the infection was 35.3%. After treatment with iverectin, the prevalence fell to 5.8% within six months and remained low at 1.4% three years later. The study also evaluated the use of a lower ELISA threshold for diagnosis, which was found to be valid in this setting. A small group of individuals had persistent positive ELISA results despite treatment. The results suggest that control of S. steralis infection can be achieved through pharmacological treatment alone. The study was conducted in three Aboriginal communities in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, where the infection prevalence is high, with rates of 30-40% reported. Prior to the study, systematic testing and treatment had not taken place. Diagnosis was based on serological means due to logistical difficulties with parasitological studies. ELISA testing was done at a reference lab using a commercial kit. The study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a "find and treat" approach, without characterizing symptoms or health improvements.
Researchers investigated how different strains of prion diseases, caused by misfolded protein PrP, interact with each other when co-infected in animals. Prion strains are thought to be encoded by specific conformations of PrP and can interfere with each other when one strain blocks the conversion of another. However, it's unknown if long-incubation strains can interfere with each other. The study found that co-infecting animals with long-incation strains did not show evidence of interference. To rule out the possibility that this was due to failure to target the same cells, protein misfolding cyclic amplification strain (PMCA) was used, which showed both strains amplified independently. This suggests lack of interference is not due to failure to target same cells but an inherent property of strains. Importantly, PM reactions seeded with longation strains had higher levels of Pr compared to seeded with shortation strain. Mechanistically, it's hypothesized that abundance of Pr is limiting, resulting in strains with low conversion efficiency to amplify independently. This changes the paradigm of prion interactions and implications for interspecies transmission and emergence of strains from mixture.
Researchers have proposed a comprehensive model to compare the roles of ordered and disordered proteins in alloster regulation. It was previously thought that intrinsic disorder is favorable for alloster coupling. However, the new model reveals that the order transition has a higher probability than disorder transition in alloster, suggesting a complicated role of disordered proteins in regulation. An analytic formula for maximal alloster coupling shows that stable or unstable states are unfavorable for alloster, aiding drug design. The Ensemble Allost Model (EAM) previously explained why disordered proteins are prevalent in alloster, but lacks order transition. The new model considers both order-disorder and order transitions, showing order transition is less competitive in alloster, especially strong alloster. The prevalence of disordered proteins in alloster is more complicated than thought. A new view of alloster based on protein structure landscape shows ligand stabilizes specific states and shifts conformation. The EAM model used this view to explain disordered alloster. Disordered proteins' prevalence in alloster is not only due to alloster capacity but also other factors. Combining data and bioinformatics would compare ordered and disordered importance in alloster. It is unclear if disordered proteins are more or less prevalent in alloster than ordered.
Researchers have investigated the role of β-caten in prostate development and cancer using genetic studies in mice. They found that β-caten is essential for embryonic prostate growth and branching, but not necessary in the adult organ. During development, βaten controls the number of progenitor cells in the epithelial buds and regulates a network of genes, including c-Myc and Nk3.1. Deletion of βaten in a model of castration-resistant prostate cancer showed it is dispensable for disease progression in this setting. Complementary overexpression, in vivo, protein stabilization showed βaten promotes formation of squamous epith during prostate development, even in absence of androgens. βaten overexpression with Pten loss drove progression to invasive carcinoma with squamous metaplas. These studies demonstrate βaten is essential for prostate development and high levels of this protein in epithelia drive squamous differentiation. They also show βaten overexpression can promote prostate cancer in a clinically relevant model.
Researchers conducted a study to understand the factors influencing informed consent in a biomedical study in a low-income setting, specifically in southern Ethiopia. They used a qualitative approach, involving focus groups and in-depth interviews with patients with podoiosis, non-patients, community workers, researchers, and local NGO staff. The study found that the use of everyday language, addressing participants' expectations, and information presentation techniques significantly impacted comprehension. Approaching patients via trusted individuals and preceding community sensitization were optimal communication methods. Poverty, absence of treatment facilities, and trust in the NGO were barriers to obtaining genuine consent. Researchers should evaluate consent processes to provide information in a comprehensible manner and support decision-making on a study-by-study basis.

The community believed podoiosis is genetic, using terms like "passed from parents and grandparents" and "blood" to express disease occurrence. Most participants did not favor written consent forms. Fieldworkers suggested monetary compensation might induce patients to participate due to poverty, stressing "true voluntiness" should be part of the process. Researchers should approach patients through reputable intermediaries like MPA fieldworkers, as they are respected. Local gatherings, group discussions are common for information exchange. Important ethical guidelines like purpose, researchers, affiliations, sample use, confidentiality, and findings were considered in the consent process.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the dynamics of T cell proliferation in the immune system, specifically in the thymus and spleen of mice. They used single-cell flow cytometry to analyze the incorporation of a thymidine analogue during pulse-chase-pulse experiments in vivo and DNA content. The model, based on ordinary differential equations, simulates the evolution of single cell behavior over various durations of labelling, allowing data fitting and estimation of proliferation rates and cell cycle durations in subpopulations. The model is simple, flexible, and validated with other pulse-chase experiments. Results show that T cell proliferation is highly heterogeneous, with specific signatures depending on genetic origins, cell stages in thym and sple, and altered with age. The model infers rates and cycle durations from EdU data, revealing cell heterogeneity and signatures. 

The model allows estimation of proliferation and intermitotic time with parameters and confidence intervals for G1 and G2 cell phase durations. It compares the effect of age and genetics on lymphocyte dynamics from early thym to maturation sple. Fitting was done by simulating progression through cell cycle and labelling parameters constrained by biological hypotheses. Proliferation rates were compared for thym and sple, abstracting phenotypic heterogeneity T in young and old B6 F mice. The study assesses proliferation and quantification subpop T cells along differentiation thym to sple, and aging. It shows genetic and age drive particular proliferation and cycle durations according T stage and lineage. FVB have lower rates than C57/6 in thym and sple.
Researchers have identified a new mitochondrial tRNA mutation in mice that mimics a human disease-causing mutation. The mutation, a G>A at position 373 in the mt-T gene, causes abnormal folding of the tRNA that cannot be charged with isoleucine, leading to increased ROS production and compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis. This mechanism is similar to a human mutation, m429T>C, affecting the same gene. The study shows that cells with the mutation have higher ROS levels, leading to increased biogenesis as a response to respiration deficiency. This response partially compensates for the deficiency. The study demonstrates the role of ROS-mediated biogenesis in expression of tRNA mutations found in patients. Unlike protein-coding gene mutations, tRNA mutations can have different effects on disease patterns. This highlights the unique nature of tRNA mutations and their impact on understanding pathology and evolution. The study proposes an epistatic effect, where partial suppression of deleterious tRNA mutations can occur in two steps, not requiring simultaneous mutation of both alleles.
Researchers studied how the expression of genes on the X chromosome in human cells with three sets of chromosomes (triploid) compared to cells with two sets (diploid). They found that the ratio of X chromosome to autosomal gene expression was lower in triploid cells with one active X and higher in triploid with two active X's. This suggests that X-linked expression is not strictly regulated by autosomal factors, but rather by epigenetic mechanisms that sense the ratio of X to autosomal sets. In triploid cells with two active X's, X-linked expression was doubled, but in cells with one active X, it was further increased, indicating an epigenetic adjustment to the X/autosome ratio. Gene expression per autosomal copy was similar in triploid and diploid cells, indicating no global effect on autosomal expression. A subset of genes had expression proportional to autosomal levels, and a range of X-linked expression was observed in relation to ploidy.
Researchers have re-examined the dN/d ratio, a measure used to quantify evolutionary pressures on proteins by comparing substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous sites. Traditionally, d/d is applied to distantly diverged sequences, where differences represent fixed substitutions along lineages. However, it is often used for sequences from a single population, where differences are segregating polymorphisms. The study found that in this context, d/d is relatively insensitive to selection and the hallmark of positive selection, d/d>1, is violated within a population. The relationship between selection and d/d does not follow a monotonic function, making it impossible to infer pressures from d. This has implications for interpreting d measurements among population-genetic samples. 

The relationship between selection and d/d is different for samples from a population compared to divergent lineages. As a result, tests based on d are sensitive to divergent line assumptions. In cases, differences do not represent fixation along line, but polymorphisms in a population. The study analyzed the population genetics of d/d. Simulations confirmed theoretical analysis d/d. The relationship between selection and d/d is described when comparing divergent line. However, within a population, the relationship is different. Negative selection has a relatively insensitive d/d ratio to changes. Selective constraints induce low d/d when divergent line produce extreme d when conspecific. The results have implications for inferences based on d among conspecific. Even independently evolving populations, the power of d to detect selection is low when majority under purifying.
Scientists have long sought to understand how natural selection influences genetic variation within and between species. Research has shown that genetic diversity within species is reduced at sites under selection, but its effect on divergence between species is unclear. Studies have reported correlations between divergence and recombination, suggesting selection reduces divergence, but theory argues otherwise, especially for distant species. This study investigates whether selection affects divergence between closely and distantly related species. It finds that divergence between closely related species, such as humans and primates, is negatively correlated with functional content and positively with recombination. Divergence between distant species, such as humans and rodents, is also negatively correlated with functional and positively with background selection. These patterns persist after accounting for confounding factors. Coalescent models show that even small ancestral polymorphism can explain large variance in divergence, generating correlations. The study reveals that selection indirectly affects divergence between closely and distantly related species, contrary to previous intuition. While direct purifying selection cannot be excluded, it would require more of the genome under selection than believed. This work has implications for understanding genomes and interpreting variation.
Researchers have discovered that the CK2 kinase plays a crucial role in regulating the stability and activity of the CLOCK (CLK) protein in the Drosila circadian oscillator. CLK is a key component of the transcriptional feedback loop that governs the circadian rhythms in Dila. The study found that CK phosphorylates and stabilizes CLK, reducing its activity. This is unexpected as CK is known to phosphorylate and destabilize other proteins involved in the circadian clock, such as PER and TIM. The researchers also found that downregulating CK activity decreases CLK phosphorylation and increases PER and TIM transcription. This suggests that CK inhibits CLK degradation while reducing its activity. Since CK promotes CLK degradation, the study suggests that CLK stability and transcriptional activity result from opposing effects of CK and CK2.
Researchers investigated the role of cruzain, a cysteine peptase, in the interaction between Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, and its invertebrate host Rhodnius prolix. They found that cruzain contributes to the parasite's adhesion to the insect's midgut. Treatment with anti-cruzain antibodies or cystine peid inhibitors reduced adhesion, except for one inhibitor, CA-074-OM. Cystatin, a natural inhibitor of cruzain, reduced adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. Transgenic parasites with low cruzain levels adhered less than those with high levels. Overexpression of a cruzain inhibitor, chag, in parasites reduced adhesion by 73%. Exogenous cruzain restored adhesion in chag parasites. In vivo, ch parasites had lower adhesion than wild-type after insect passage, with increased cruzain expression. This is the first study to show cruzain's role in parasite-insect interaction.
Researchers have identified 20 genes in Caenorhabditis elegans that, when reduced in function, can suppress the effects of a cytoplasmic dyin heavy chain mutant. Cytoplasm dyin is a microtubule motor protein that plays a crucial role in mitotic processes such as centrosome separation, chromosome congression, anaphase elongation, and segregation. It also functions during interphase for vesicle transport and organel positioning. The 12 of the 20 suppressor genes do not exhibit sterile or lethal phenotypes when their function is reduced in wild-type worms. Many of the suppress proteins, including dyin light chains, localize to subcellular sites that overlap with those reported for the dyin heavy chain. Knocking down one of four putative dyin accessory chains suppresses the heavy mutants, suggesting some chains regulate heavy function. The researchers also found 29 genes that, when reduced, suppress not only dyin but also loci for unrelated processes.
Researchers studied the process of programmed genome rearrangements (PGR) in the ciliate Paramecium tetra, a unicellular eukaryotic model. During somatic differentiation, the germline nucleus is transmitted to the progeny, but the somatic nucleus, essential for gene expression, is destroyed and a new somatic differentiates from a copy of the gerline. In Paramecium tetra, the development of the somatic nucleus involves massive GR, including the elimination of at least 45,000 gerline sequences (Internal Eliminated Sequences, IES). The excision of IES proceeds through a cut-and-close mechanism: domestic transposase PigMac is essential for DNAavage and DSB at excision involves Ligase IV, a component of nonhomolog endjoining (NHE) pathway. To understand DNAavage and DSB coordination during GR, researchers focused on Ku, the actor of NHE-mediated repair. Two Ku70 and Ku80 paralogs are encoded in the genome of P. tetra: Ku70 and Ku80 are produced during sexual processes and localize in developing somatic nucleus. RNA interference showed that development-specific Ku/Ku80 heterodimer is essential for recovery of functional somatic nucleus. Strikingly, PigMac-dependent DNAavage is abolished at IES in cells depleted Ku80, resulting IES retention in somatic genome.
Researchers studied the early stages of prion disease in the brain by analyzing gene expression in hippocampal CA1 neurons of infected mice. They found that gene expression in these neurons is dynamic and characterized by distinct phases, with a major cluster of genes altered preclinically returning to basal levels or reversing during clinical disease. This cluster contains genes related to N-methyl-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor signaling and neuroprotective pathways. Genes involved in neuronal projection and dendrite development were also altered, leading to a decline in synaptic protein expression. Deregulated miRNAs like mi-132p, mi-124, mi-16, mi-26, mi-29, and mi-140 followed similar expression patterns. This study is the first to describe preclinical response of hippocal neurons to prion replication. Findings suggest prion stimulates a programmed response, at least part by NMD receptor, promoting survival and neurite remodeling, but terminated before clinical symptoms in hippocampus, indicating a critical juncture.
Researchers have developed a computer model, called a Petri net, to simulate the formation of granulomas in mice infected with the parasite Leishmania donani. A granulomas are clusters of inflammatory cells that form in the liver to eliminate the parasite. The model was tested and validated with data from mouse studies and showed it accurately represented the progression of the disease and changes in granoma composition over time. The model revealed a previously unknown level of diversity in granoma development and function. It also showed that IL-10 produced by Kupffer cells at the center of the granoma plays a key role in controlling the parasite load. The model does not account for IL-10's effects outside the granoma, such as on T cell differentiation in other tissues, which could affect the quality and quantity of T cells entering the granoma environment. Data from mouse studies and human leishmaniasis point to a role of T cell cytokines in maintaining immunity and granulomatous inflammation as a correlate of protective immunity. In the model, T cells are main mediators of immunity against Leish and their depletion led to high parasite burden and non-healing infection, as seen in T-deficient mice.
Researchers have viewed the transcriptional machinery of genes as a computational device with transcription factors as inputs and expression levels as output. They investigated what kinds of computations are possible and found that different parameterizations of a simple kinetic model of transcription regulation can approximate arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as equality and inequality operations. This contrasts with previous studies that emphasized logical or digital notions of computation in biological networks. The accuracy and precision of these approximations depend on different sets of parameters and are independently tunable. Networks of "arithmetic" genes can be combined to accomplish more complicated computations by designing and simulating a network that detects significant elevations in a time-vary signal. Approximating analytic functions can be achieved by allowing multiple factor binding sites on the promoter. These findings are important for interpreting naturally occurring networks and designing synthetic ones. The study shows that transcriptional regulatory networks can perform computations beyond simple logical operations already documented experimentally. An example is an eight-gene network that tracks mean and standard deviation of a time-vary signal and detects when the signal is significantly elevated. A model of gene regulated by a single factor with multiple sites on promoter is also considered. Simple models demonstrate possibility of arithmetic at transcriptional regulation. Other functions such as exponentiation, logarithms, and trigonometric functions can be computed by combinations of arithmetic. However, this would be energetically wasteful and require many genes. A more efficient approach is approximating directly using complicated machinery.
Researchers in Brazil sequenced the genomes of the Chikungunya virus (CHV) from a recent outbreak in the Northeast region and found that two genotypes, Asian/Caribbean and ECSA, are cocirculating in the area. This is the first time these genotypes have been detected in the region. The study also found evidence of simultaneous infection with both genotypes in at least six clinical samples, suggesting coinfection may be more common than previously thought in endemic areas. Chikunya virus is an RNA virus from the Togaviridae family transmitted by mosquitoes and causes a febrile illness, Chikunya fever, associated with severe outcomes. It arrived in Brazil in 2014 through two introductions, the Asian/ibbean genotype in the North and ECS in the Northeast. Following introduction, both genotypes established an urban cycle among naive populations, causing outbreaks in the Americas.
Researchers have investigated how bacteria regulate horizontally acquired DNA, which increases genetic diversity and allows them to colonize various niches, including the human host. They found that the modulator HNS targets both core and horizontally acquired (HGT) genes and silences expression in response to external stimuli such as osmolarity and temperature. HNS discriminates and differentially modulates core and H DNA. For example, plasmid R27-encoded HNS has evolved to silence HGT genes without interfering with core regulation. In contrast, chromosomal H requires a helper protein, Hha, to silence H DNA, while core genes are modulated by H homodimers. The presence of H-like proteins is restricted to Enterobacteraceae, and conjugative plids encoding HNS variants have been isolated only from this family. The HNS system in Enterobacteria presents unique features, selectively discriminating between core and H DNA. This may help maintain horizontally transmitted DNA silent and give bacteria a competitive advantage adapting to new environments, including host colonization.
Researchers compared the gene expression of three Leishmania species (L. major, L. infant, and L. braziliensis) to understand how they cause disease in hosts. They found that most genes are conserved across species, but a few are differentially distributed. They used microarrays to confirm that these different genes are expressed in the parasite's intracellular amastigote stage, with few regulated at the RNA level. In a large-scale study of L. brazili, about 9% of genes were regulated during its life cycle, consistent with other Leish species. Comparing amigote expression between species confirmed little regulation, but identified conserved genes differently regulated in hosts. They investigated host influence on parasite expression by comparing L major amigotes in wild-type and immunocompromised mice. Dissemination was enhanced in immunocompromised mice, but RNA profiles were unchanged. This suggests Leish amigotes are adapted for intracellular survival with little RNA regulation. Species-specific virulence may be due to few different genes or regulated conserved genes, subject to translation or post-translational controls.
Researchers have developed a new diagnostic tool, called LPhimer, to detect Amphimeris, a parasitic disease caused by the liver fluke Amphimer, in humans and animals. The current method of diagnosis, examining stool for parasite eggs, is not sensitive and can be confused with other parasites. No molecular or immunological methods have been developed. A sequence of the internal transcribed 2 region of Amphimer was designed and optimized using DNA from adult worms. Conventional PCR was performed with primers to verify amplification of the target sequence. LAMP was optimized and set up as Limer. The sensitivity and specificity of PCR and L were evaluated, with a detection limit of 1 pg genomic DNA. Field testing was done on 44 human samples from endemic areas, with 25 positive for eggs. L was ineffective with DNA from fecal samples. The parameters for Limer assay were 76.67% and 80.77%, respectively. A specific and sensitive LAMP for Amphimer in stool has been developed, named Limer, with potential for field diagnosis and surveillance in endemic areas.
Researchers have discovered a new role for the SNARE protein Ykt in autophagosome-lysosome fusion, a process by which autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form autolys. They found that loss of Ykt leads to large accumulation of autagosomes unable to fuse with lysosomes. Ykt localizes to lysosomes and autagosomes and forms a SNARE complex with Sy17 and Snap, but can be outcompeted by Vamp. Overexpression of Vamp rescues fusion defect in Ykt loss cells. A mutant Y6 with R amino acid change in zeroionic layer retains normal autagic activity and restores viability. Y6 and V7 are mutually exclusive subunits in Sy17-Snap complex, suggesting V7 is involved in membrane fusion and Y6 acts as non-conventional SNARE. Y6 is essential for autag clearance in Drosila larval cells and not functionally non-redundant with V7.
Researchers have studied how the bacterium Haemophilus influenza (NTH) resists the effects of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by the human body to fight infection. AMPs are a key part of the body's first line of defense against bacterial infections. TH is a common inhabitant of the nasal passages but can cause opportunistic infections in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. TH's ability to evade AMPs is a key to its virulence. The researchers found that a protein called Sap on the surface of TH binds to AMP and is necessary for the bacterium's virulence. They discovered that Sap delivers AMP to the inner membrane for transport into the cytoplasm where they are broken down by enzymes. Without Sap, AMP accumulate in the outer layer of the bacteria. This is a new mechanism for TH to resist AMPs.

Researchers studied how the protein MarA, a key regulator of antibiotic resistance in E. coli, coordinates its downstream targets. They found that its short half-life affects both the rate and maximum coordination of downstream gene expression. By modifying Mar's half-life, either by knocking out the protease or engineering it to be protected from degradation, they observed changes in gene regulation. In E. coli, several regulators are subject to degradation, and Mar's short half-life influences its behavior and ability to coordinate genes. This coordination develops over time, with both rate and value. The study focused on how new bacterial populations quickly establish a spectrum of phenotypes. Mar regulates 60 targets in antibiotic resistance, including efflux pumps and stress proteins. Its short half-life is due to Lonase activity. The researchers used the CRISPR system to alter Mar's dynamics, increasing its half-life and maximum coordination between genes, but not rate. Degradation may allow for responsive and agile signaling or rapid phenotypic diversity.
Researchers investigated the role of MAP kinase phosphatase 2 (MK-2) in the immune response to Leishmania major infection in mice. In a previous study, MK-2 deficient mice were more susceptible to Leishmania mexicana infection due to increased Arginase-1 and reduced NO activity in macrophages and a diminished TH1 response. However, in this study, MK-2 deficient mice showed a similar healing response to Leish major infection as wild-type mice, with similar lesion size and parasite numbers. Analysis of immune responses showed reduced TH1 response in MK- mice with lower specific IgG2 levels, lower IF-γ and TN-α producing CD4 and CD8 T cells and lower stimulated spleen IFγ production. Despite this, MK- mice had reduced antigen spleen and lymph node IL-4 production and specific IgG1 in serum, indicating a general hypo-responsiveness. The TH1/TH balance was unaltered in MK mice compared to wild-type. Although MK- macrophages were more permissive to L growth than wild-type macrophages, LPS/IF-γ was equally effective in controlling growth in both. The absence of TH/TH switch in MK mice, no change in disease phenotype was observed.
Researchers have studied the development of the ductal network in the pancreas, a branched organ that doesn't follow typical branching patterns like most glands. They found that despite individual differences in branch patterns, the network has stereotypic traits at each stage and changes as it matures to optimize delivery of digestive products into the duodenum. Using computer modeling, they broke down development into simple rules likely conserved in other glands. Early network formation is explained by noisy, redundant connections as microlens form, while later transition is due to pruning based on fluid flow into the duod. The pancreas has stereic properties at stages E12.5 and E18.5, with transition from mesh to treelike structure reflected in changing properties. Network remodeling can be quantified using standard measures. In silico modeling deconstructed main steps into simple rules, showing creation from E10.5 to E.12.5 explained by noisy duct formation. However, how micens form duct network is unclear, and mechanisms for remodeling from plex to treel are less understood. Villenor and colleagues provided insight into remodeling process with anatomical description, revealing pancreas might be more stereic than believed and identifying trends in branches. This study reveals new features of development, relevant to glands with micumen like saliv and glands that secrete fluid. Proposed rules differ from deterministic branching or random in mammary gland.
Researchers have mapped the structural and dynamical features of kines motor proteins, which drive intracellular transport by coupling ATP hydrolysis to conformation changes that mediate movement along microtubules. A comprehensive analysis of 114 experimental structures and molecular dynamics simulations revealed three distinct conformation clusters: ATP-like, ADP-like, and Eg5-inhibitor-bound. These groups differ in the orientation of key elements, notably microtub binding α-α5, loop subdomain and α2-β-4β-β-7 motor tip. Group membership did not correlate with the bound nucleotide, but was coincident with necker orientations. Simulations of ATP, AD, and nucleotide Eg5 showed all states sample majorlogically observed conformations, with differences in distal site dynamics. In ATP bound simulations, necker, loop, and α-5 sub displayed motions absent in AD bound. Dissection of these couplings showed a network between active, microub interface, and necker loop via loop7 and loop13. Mutations G325 and G326 in loop reduced flexibility and disrupted couplings. Results indicate ATP and AD conformations are intrinsically accessible regardless of nucleotide, supporting a model where necker docking tightens microub and nucleotide regions. Simulations highlighted sites for large conformation changes and alloster coupling between dist sites.
Researchers have developed a new approach to interpret bioluminescent data from the Lux system, a gene reporter used to measure gene expression. The Lux system is fast, sensitive, and non-destructive, allowing for high-frequency measurements, and has been adapted for use in eukaryotic cells and whole biosensors, and live animals without euthanasia. However, interpreting biolumines data is limited as biolumcence is different from gene expression due to nonlinear and molecular dynamics of the Lux system. A computational approach was created to infer gene levels from light output, based on a new model of Lux activity, including LuxAB, LuxC, and Fre, with improved mechanisms for reactions and protein synthesis and turnover. The model was calibrated with data from Photorhabus lumcens, the source of modern Lux reporters, and literature data for LuxC. Importantly, evidence was found for previously unreported inhibition of the Lux reaction. Simulations showed biolumcent profiles can differ from gene expression, with peaks of light output similar to some experimental data. The model was incorporated into a Bayesian scheme to reverse engineer promoter activity from biolumcence. Examples showed a decrease in biolum would be interpreted as promoter off, and increase as longer gene expression. This approach benefits Lux technology users.
Researchers have determined the crystal structure of Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA) in complex with a capsid binder G3 (G3), which is a potent inhibitor of enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsievirus A16 (CVA), the main causes of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. The study clarifies the role of key residues involved in interactions with the inhibitor. Using this model, in silico docking was performed to investigate interactions with two next-generation capsid binders NLD and AL, which show potent inhibition of a panel of enteroviruses with potential pharmacological properties. A meta-analysis was performed using available information to gain insight into structural features required for capsid binders to interact and those that confer broad-spectrum enterirus activity.

The researchers used in silico protocol to dock two designed capsid binders into CVA structure, demonstrating similar binding mode. Structural in silico results were analyzed in context of antiviral activity against a range of enteriruses, showing potency and broad-spectrum antiral activity. The inhibitors were tested against a panel of enteriruses, and structural comparisons were used in meta-analysis to correlate features with antiral activity, reinforcing NLD as a candidate for HFMD drug.

The study found that canyon depressions around the 5-fold axis are sites for receptor attachment, and the process of capsid opening to release viral genome into host cytos to initiate replication is key to enterirus infection. Analysis revealed each VP proteins in enterirus capsid contain hydrophobic pocket, expulsion of which is required for infection. A molecule replacing factor with higher affinity can serve as antiral acting before virus replicate. The structure of CVA in complex with capsid binder 3-4-pyridyl-2-imazolidone (G3) was determined, and energy of compound-protein interaction calculated using in sil docking.

Good antiovirus activity was observed for three capsid bind, highest for PV with Leu at bottom of pocket, reducing energy compared to PV and PV with Phe. The hydrophobic pocket below canyon in VP remains target for novel inhibitors targeting early enterirus infection.
Researchers have identified the cells and receptor responsible for removing the Necrot serpin from the hemolymph of Drosophila melanogaster. Necrot is a serpin that regulates the immune response to fungal and Gram-positive bacterial infections by inhibiting a proteolytic cascades. After infection, a proteolytic cascade is activated through the Toll receptor, resulting in the synthesis of antibiotic peptides in the fat body and export to the hemolymph. Necrot is synthesized in the fat body, but its site of degradation was unclear. Using a temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutation, researchers froze endocytosis and found that Necrot is removed from the hemolymph in two types of cells: glial and pericardial macrophages. Necrot uptake increases rapidly after 30 minutes and peaks at 6-8 hours. Co-localization of Nec with anti-AP, Rab5, and Rab7 antibodies shows the serpin is processed through multivesicular bodies and delivered to lysosomes, where it co-localizes with ubiquitin-binding protein H. Nec does not co-local with Rab11, indicating the serpin is not re-exported from macrophages. Mutations blocking late endosome/lysosome fusion (dor, car) cause accumulation of Nec-positive endosomes even without infection. Knockdown of Drosila ortholog of mammalian LDL receptor with dsRNA identifies LR1 as enhancer of immune uptake of Nec. Chromosomal deletion of LR1 blocks uptake of Nec from hemolymph.
In sea urchins, two signaling pathways, Nodal and BMP, play crucial roles in establishing left-right (LR) asymmetry. Nodal signaling prevents the formation of the rudiment on the right side, but the opposing pathway to Nodal during LR establishment was unclear. Researchers found that BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch, specifically in the veg2 lineage, but not in small micromeres. By perturbing BMP activities, they demonstrated that BMP signaling is required for the expression of left-sided genes and formation of left-sided structures. On the other hand, Nodal on the right inhibits BMP signaling and controls asymmetric apoptosis of small miceres. The study shows BMP is a positive signal for left-sided development in seaurchs, suggesting the opposing roles of Nodal and BMP in LR asymmetry are conserved in deuteromes.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is tightly linked to the host cell cycle, with infected G0/G cells supporting immediate early (IE) gene expression and progressing to the G1/S phase, where they arrest. In contrast, S/G cells can be infected but block IE expression, and this inhibition is relieved when cells divide and re-enter G1. During latent infection, IE expression is also inhibited, and reactivation requires overcoming this block. Researchers found that the S/G block can be overcome by genotoxic stress and DNA replication inhibitors, indicating checkpoint-dependent pathways control of IE repression. Checkpoint rescue of IE requires p53, and its absence mimicked by proteasomal inhibition in a p53-dependent manner. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CD) inhibitor p21 is downstream of p53, suggesting CD's role in IE repression in S/G and S cells. CD inhibition alleviates repression independently of p53, and also overcomes block in quiescent NT2 cells. Timely CD activity secures phase specificity of cell-dependent HCV gene program and prevents latent state establishment. CMV is a widespread human pathogen causing disease in immunocompromised and neonates. Lytic replication starts with IE expression. Inhibition of cyclin kinase by checkpoint or roscine restores virus permissiveness in S. CD inhibition also antagonizes silencing in quies latent NT2 cells, suggesting cell cycle-latency repression link. Data suggest major obstacle to CM replication is removed in S cells and proceeds from G1. p53 governs long-term response to genotoxic by inducing p21 cell arrest or apoptosis.
Researchers studied how the immune system of people who naturally control HIV without treatment, known as elite controllers, fights the virus. They found that a type of immune cell called dendritic cells plays a key role in recognizing and fighting HIV. Dendritic cells from elite controllers produced high levels of interferon, a protein that helps fight viruses, when exposed to HIV. This response was linked to reduced viral replication and improved ability to stimulate HIV-specific T cells, a type of immune cell that kills infected cells. The study suggests that innate immune response in dendritic cells is crucial for effective HIV-specific T cell response and may be useful for developing treatments or vaccines.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify genes that regulate fat storage in Drosophila larvae using a buoy-based screen. They found 66 genes that increase fat levels, including Sir2, a sirt family member. Sir regulates carbohydrate and lipid metabolism by deacetylating key proteins. However, mammalian sirtins function differently, making it hard to define their role in energy homeostasis under normal conditions. Knocking down Sir in larval fat increases fat, and genetic studies show it restricts fat accumulation in cells autonomously. Changes in metabolic enzymes in Sir mutants point to a shift from catabism. Surprisingly, Sir is upregulated under starvation, but mutants survive better than wild type under amino-acid starvation as long as sugars are provided. Findings implicate a Sir pathway that activates catabolic response to amino-ac starvation regardless of sugar content. Sir regulates fat storage in Dophila autonomously, at least via regulation of metabolic enzymes. This mode of regulation may be evolutionarily ancient, with more complex organisms regulating fat in tissues or linking environmental cues to storage. In larvae, a switch from dietary to stored energy occurs in response to amino starvation, and Sir mediates this switch.
Researchers studied the first embryonic division of 42 species of nematodes, closely related to Caenorhabditis elegans, to understand the evolution of asymmetric cell division. Asymmetric cell division is essential for generating cellular diversity in animals, and the cleavage plane of the cell often lies perpendicular to the mitotic spindle, which dictates the size of the daughter cells. Although some properties of spindle positioning are conserved between distantly related species and cell types, little is known about the robustness of the underlying mechanisms. The researchers recorded the first division of 128 strains from 27 Caenorhabitis and 15 non-Caenorhabitis species, creating a collection of subcellular phenotypes to study the evolution of cellular processes across species. They analyzed the collection to study asymmetric spindle positioning and found large intra and inter-species variations in degree of cell asymmetry and spindle parameters, including oscillation, elongation, and displacement. Notably, these parameters changed during evolution with no direction in species phylogeny, except spindle transverse oscillations, which were an innovation at the base of Caenorhabitis genus. These changes were unrelated to evolutionary in embryo size. Importantly, spindle elongation, displacement, and oscill each evolved independently. This contrasts with expectations based on C elegans studies and reveals unrecognized changes in spindle mechanics. The essential process of asymmetric division has been conserved over nemode evolution, but spindle parameters combine in various ways.
Researchers studied how two closely related bacteria, Salmonella Typhimurium and Escheria coli, respond to acid stress. They found that despite having identical outer membrane protein (Omp) genes, the bacteria have different triggers for Omp expression and regulons. In S. Typhurium, Omp mRNA and protein levels increase at low pH, but not in E. coli. This difference is due to variations in the promoter regions of the omp genes. The E. coli omp orthologue can be made acid-inducible by introducing sequences from S. Tyurium. The S. Tyur Omp regulon overlaps with E. coli's at 15 genes, including horizontally acquired virulence genes. Omp binds its targets more when DNA is relaxed, which occurs in S. Tyur at low pH, a requirement for optimal virulence gene expression. Targets do not share a strong nucleotide consensus, suggesting O's ability to recruit genes arises from modest specificity and preference for relaxed DNA.
Researchers have identified a novel effector protein, N, secreted by the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis, that targets mammalian histones in the host cell nucleus. The protein, named Nuclear Effector (N), contains a SET domain characteristic of histone methyltransferases and is translocated to the host cell via a type III secretion mechanism. In vitro assays confirmed N's enzymatic activity as a histone methyltransfer, modifying histones H2, H3, and H4, as well as itself through automethylation. Automethylation appears to enhance N's enzymatic activity, increasing its affinity for substrates. This is the first description of a bacterial effector directly targeting mammalian histones. N is secreted by Chydia, translocates to the host nucleus, and has enzymatic activity towards eukaryotic substrates.
A recent study of 35,000 people from 21 different populations found a significant association between genome-wide homozygosity and height, equivalent to a 3cm reduction in height in offspring of first cousins compared to unrelated individuals. This effect remained after controlling for socio-economic status. However, the effect size varied among populations, possibly due to differences in homozygosity and inheritance of recessive genotypes. The study suggests multiple rare, recessive variants influence human height. The methodology can be applied to other heritable traits, paving the way for investigation of inbreeding effects and genetic architecture on various biomedical traits.
Researchers studied the blood cells called monocytes (MO) in people with and without malaria to understand how they respond to the infection. They found that MO in people with malaria had different types of MO that were not seen in healthy individuals. The MO in people with malaria had high levels of certain markers called CD16, CCR2, and CXCR1. These MO were able to limit the growth of the malaria parasite in the blood. People with high levels of these MO had lower levels of the parasite in their blood compared to those with low levels. This suggests that MO with these markers can help fight malaria. The study also found that MO in people with malaria had higher levels of inflammatory markers, such as TNF-alpha and IF-gamma, and lower levels of others, such as CD56 and IF-gamma. The MO in people with malaria also had higher levels of TREM-1, a marker of inflammation. This indicates that MO in people with malaria are more inflammatory. The study found two groups of people with different MO, one with high and one low levels of CDhi CCR+CXCR+ MO. The group with high levels had lower parasite levels in their blood. This is the first study to show differences in MO in people with and without malaria. It suggests that MO with certain markers can help fight malaria.
A study of 34 HIV-uninfected Ugandan men found that Schistosoma mansoni infection was associated with an increased abundance and function of HIV-susceptible CD4 T cells in the blood, but not the foreskin. Men with S. mansoni infection had higher frequencies of Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells in their blood compared to those without the infection. Th17 cells in the blood of S mansoni-infected men also demonstrated enhanced function, producing multiple cytokines. However, these immune alterations were not observed in foreskin tissue. The study suggests that S. mansoni infection may increase HIV susceptibility through the common mucosal immune system, but this effect does not extend to the foreskin, which is the primary site of HIV acquisition in heterosexual men.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between Wolbachia, a symbiotic bacteria, and filarial nematodes, which cause diseases such as river blindness and elephantiasis. They found that depleting Wolia causes defects in nemat development, fertility, and viability, making it a promising approach for treating filarial diseases. The study used whole mount confocal microscopy to observe the effects of Wolia depletion on nemat cells. They found extensive apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in adult germl cells, embryos, and somatic cells of microfilar and fourth-stage larvae. Surprisingly, apoptosis occurred in most embryonic cells not infected with Wolia before treatment. Additionally, apoptosis did not occur in hypermal cells, which have many Wolia, but the hypermal cytoskeleton was disrupted after depletion. The apoptosis was non-autonomous, suggesting factors from Wolia in the hypermal were involved. The pattern of apoptosis correlated with nemat tissues and processes affected by Wolia depletion, such as embryogenesis and long-term sterilization, lasting months after worm death. The study provides a cellular explanation for reduced microilar loads and interrupted transmission after antibiotic therapy in fil nematodes.
Researchers studied how the malaria-causing parasite Plasium falcum requires a nutrient called pantoate to grow and multiply. They found that the parasite converts pantoate into a molecule called coenzyme A (CoA) using an enzyme called panto kinase (Pan). Some anti-malarial pantoate analogs, such as panto and CJ-801, kill the parasite by targeting CoA production. However, the exact mechanism of action was unknown. The researchers created parasite lines resistant to these analogs by exposing them to panto or CJ-801 and found mutations in a gene called Pfpan1, which codes for the Pan enzyme. These mutations altered Pan activity, making the parasite more resistant to some analogs but sensitive to others. The study suggests that different pate analogs have different mechanisms of action: some inhibit Co production while others inhibit Co-using enzymes.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with the PR interval, a measure of atrial and atrioventricular conduction time, in African Americans. They analyzed data from four cohorts totaling 6,247 individuals and used a microarray to genotype 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A strong signal was observed in the SCN5A gene, which encodes a cardiac sodium channel, with a genome-wide association p-value of 2.5×10^-8 in two cohorts and meta-analysis. This variant explained 2% of PR variability in African Americans, with a 5.1 millisecond increase per minor allele. The same variant was associated with PR in Europeans, but with a smaller effect size and less variability. Further analysis identified associations in SCN5, ME1, and TBX genes that correlated with European and Asian studies. African ancestry was associated with increased PR duration in one cohort, but not others. The study demonstrates relevance of common variants in African at loci previously associated with PR in European and Asian samples and identifies a signal more strongly associated with PR in Africans than Europeans.
Researchers have identified a small GTP-binding protein called ARL8 that plays a crucial role in the replication of Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), a type of virus that infects plants. To replicate its genetic material, the virus forms complexes on cellular membranes within plant cells. A previous studies showed that a seven-transmembrane protein TOM is necessary for efficient virus multiplication. This study found that ARL, along with TOM, is co-pur with a tagged To180 replication protein from membranes of infected tobacco cells. When membranes of infected cells expressed tagged ARL, TOM and 180 replication proteins were co-pur and the fraction showed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity transcribing To RNA. In contrast, uninfected cells TOM co-pur with tagged ARL less, suggesting a complex of To replication proteins, TOM, and ARL form on membranes in infected cells. In Arabidopsis, ARL has four members simultaneous mutations in two A8 genes completely inhibited tobamovirus multiplication. In vitro To RNA-replication system, lack of TOM or A8 inhibited replicative RNA production, indicating TOM and A8 required for negative-strand synthesis. When To130 protein co-expressed with TOM and A8 in yeast, 5-capping activity detected in membrane. This was undetect or weak when 130 expressed alone or with TOM or A8. Results suggest TOM and A8 components of To replication and crucial in process activation of synthesizing and capping functions.
Researchers studied the role of inhibitory neurons in the locust's olfactory system to understand how they shape the firing patterns of principal neurons. Two types of inhibitory motifs emerged: feed-forward (FF) and feedback (FB) inhibition. In the locust, a subset of lateral interneurons (LHNs) provided feed-forward inhibition to Kenyon cells (KCs) to maintain sparse firing, crucial for olfactory learning and memory. However, a single inhibitory cell, the GABAergic neuron (GN), was found to be the main source of inhibition in the mushroom body, mediated by a feedback loop including KCs and GN. A model of the locust olfactory system was used to compare the effects of FF and FB inhibition. Both motifs maintained KC responses and provided optimal odor discrimination, but only FB created a response consistent with in vivo data. This suggests that GN is potentially the primary source of inhibition to KCs. Understanding how inhibitory motifs impact post-synaptic activity could reveal unknown inhibitory structures in biological networks. In the locust, FF inhibition was previously thought to be mediated by a population of inhibitory cells in the lateral horn, providing input to KCs in the mushroom. However, anatomical evidence suggests GN inhibits both KCs in the mushroom and LNs in the horn, yet KCs fire sparsely while LNs respond to odors with dense spiking. A model of the locust olfactory system was developed to compare FB and FF inhibition. The FF model responded to stimuli with fewer cells firing action potentials compared to the inhibitory motif, but GGN was sufficient to create sparse olfactory responses in both models.
Researchers have developed a new method for diagnosing lyssavirus infection, including rabies, in animals and humans using a combined real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technique. This method, called combo-q, uses two technologies: a probe-based TaMan RT-qPCR to detect the rabies virus (RV) and an intercalating dye SYBR Green to detect other lyss species. The combo-q was tested on a large panel of animal samples covering all genetic variability of the virus and all lyss species characterized to date. It was also evaluated on 211 human samples, 76 positive and 135, including saliva and skin biops, and detected 41 cases of rabies with sensitivity of 91.5% in skin and 54% in saliva samples. This method was implemented in two rab reference laboratories in Cambodia and Morocco. The combo-q is a useful tool for diagnosing rab in humans and animals and a promising for lyavirus surveillance.
In the Eastern Region of Ghana, an outbreak of tset-transmitted trypanosomias resulted in over 50% losses of domestic pigs in 2007. To control the disease, a trial was conducted from May to October 2007 to assess the efficacy of insecticide-treated mosquito nets in controlling tse. Two villages were selected, one as control with 14 pigs and one experimental with 24 pigs protected by insecticide-treated fences. The 100cm high, 150den polyester fences with 100mg/m deltamethrin and UV were attached to timber poles and planks. Bi-monthly monitoring with geo-referenced traps showed a 90% reduction in the protected village within two months, exceeding 95% in subsequent months. The control village tse population remained unaffected, displaying seasonal variations. Fifty pigs from each village were ear-tagged and given curative treatment after blood samples taken. Initial trypan prevalence was 76% and 72 in protected and control, decreasing to 16 and 84 after three months. After six, 8% protected were infected, 60 in control.
A recent survey of 441 biomedical articles published between 2000-2014 found low levels of reproducibility and transparency. Only one study provided a full protocol and none made raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare (n=4) and only 16 had data included in a systematic review or meta-analysis. Most studies did not mention funding or conflicts of interest. Between 2000-201, the percentage of articles with no funding statement decreased (94.4% to 34.6%) and those reporting conflicts (0% to 15.4%) or no conflicts (5.6 to 50%) increased. Articles in clinical medicine journals were more likely to lack funding information and have private funding. The study provides baseline data for future progress in reproducibility indicators.
Researchers have studied how the bacteria Yersinia pestis causes primary pneumonic plague, a highly lethal disease with a 100% mortality rate. They found that the disease progression is biphasic, with an initial pre-inflammatory phase where the bacteria grow without causing inflammation, followed by a pro-inflammatory phase with a massive influx of neutrophils, inflammation, and tissue destruction. Using a special probe to track proteins injected by the bacteria, they discovered that Yers pest targets alveolar macrophages early in the infection, then switches to neutils. They also found that neutil influx does not limit bacterial growth in the lung and is responsible for severe inflammation in the pro-inflammatory phase.
Researchers conducted a study in Brazil to evaluate the accuracy of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using soluble recombinant antigens to detect asymptomatic Leishmaniasis infection in a cohort of 136 participants with a two-year follow-up period. Blood samples were collected from 136 participants, 97 positive and 39 negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) hybridization, and none progressed to disease from asymptomatic state. Controls included 22 healthy individuals and 8 patients with kala-azar. Molecular techniques confirmed Leishmania presence in all kalaazar patients and 117 (86%) of cohort. Kala patients showed high reactivity in ELISA, whereas asymptomatic individuals low reactivity against antigens tested. Compared to molecular methods, L. amazon and L. infant antigens showed higher sensitivity (49.6% and 41%) than r39 (26.5%), however, specificity of r39 was higher (73.7%) than L. amazon (52.6) and L. infant (36.8). Low agreement among antigens used (kappa0.10). Serological tests were inaccurate diagnosing asymptomatic compared molecular methods, leading to misclassification in population studies. Studies using serological estimate prevalence, evaluate intervention or identify Leish infection risk factors may have compromised results.
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze the expression of retrotransposons in mouse embryonic stem cells using Illumina and Affymetrix gene microarray platforms. This approach allowed them to identify histone deacetylase Hd1 as a component of the retrotranson silencing machinery in mouse embryonic cells and determine retrotranson targets of Hd1 in these cells. They also found that retrotransons are targeted by other silencing mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and RingB/E-containing polycomb repressive complexes in mouse embryonic cells. The study suggests that multiple silencing mechanisms are independently targeted to retroons in embryonic cells, and different copies of the same retroon can be differentially sensitive to silencing, and define retroon sequence elements targeted by silencing machineries. The researchers used repeat-annotation of microarray data to investigate established retroon silencing mechanisms and found a complex interplay between DNA methylation and histone regulating expression of repetitive elements in the mouse genome. They identified retroons silenced by methylation and hist modifications in mouse embryonic cells and hist deacetylase Hd1 as a regulator of retroons in mouse cells. This approach identified Hd1 as a component of retroon silencing machinery in mouse cells.
Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (CRY) plays a crucial role in regulating flowering time by controlling the expression of the Flowering Locus T (FT) gene. CRY-interacting bHL1 (C1) interacts with CRY in response to blue light to activate FT transcription. In vitro, C1 binds to the canonical-box (ACGT) with higher affinity than non-canonical-box (NT) DNA sequences. However, in vivo, C1 binds the chromatin region of FT, which contains non-canonical sequences. This study shows CRY also interacts with at least C5 in response to blue, but not darkness or other wavelengths. Genetic analysis demonstrates C1, C2, C4, and C5 act redundantly activate FT and are positive regulators of C2-mediated flowering. Importantly, C1 and other C proteins form heterodimers, with some having higher affinity to non-canonical-box in vitro assays. This explains why C1 and C bind canonical-box in vitro, but are associated with non-canonical at FT promoter vivo. Consistent with C similar roles in C2-mediated blue signaling, C expression is regulated by light. The study shows C redundantly regulate C2-dependent and different C form heterodimers interact non-can DNA vivo.
An economic analysis of the impact of overseas and domestic treatment options for intestinal infections among US-bound refugees from Asia was conducted. Intestinal parasites such as hookworm, Trichuris, Ascaris, and Strongloides are rare in the US and may be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, leading to serious consequences. The study evaluated the costs and benefits of overseas presumptive treatment of parasitic diseases vs domestic screening/treating vs no program. An economic model was developed to estimate the cost and health impacts of four interventions on an annual cohort of 27,700 US-bound Asian refugees: 1) No program, 2) US domestic screening and treatment, 3) overseas albendazole and ivermect presumptive treatment, and 4) overseas albazole and domestic for Stronglo. The model estimated long-term effects of parasitic infections and health measures included outpatient cases, hospitalizations, deaths, life years, and quality-adjusted years (QY). The No option was the least expensive ($165,923 per cohort) and least effective (145 cases, 4 hospitalizations, and 0.67 deaths over 60-year for one-year). Overseas albazole and iverect option ($418,824) was less expensive than domestic treatment ($3,832,572) or overseas alb and domestic for Stronglo ($2,182,483). Overse presum treatment for US-bound refugees is a cost-effective intervention that is less expensive and least as effective as domestic treatment. Addition of iverect to alb reduces prevalence of Stronglo and probability rare fatal disseminated.
Researchers have discovered a new species of microsporidian parasite, Nematida displere, that infects the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and exhibits a unique tissue tropism compared to previously described parasites of this host. Nemat displere can invade and replicate in multiple tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine of C elegans, with most replication occurring in the muscle and epider. This distinguishes it from closely related microidian pathogens Nematii and N sp1, which exclusively invade and replicate in the intestine. The Nemat displere genome is the earliest diverging species of the Nematida genus, with over 10% of its proteins belonging to a species-specific family of R-domain proteins of unknown function that may mediate interactions with the host. The study provides a whole-animal model to investigate factors responsible for pathogen growth in different niches.
Researchers have studied the role of the Cockayne syndrome B (CS) protein in transcription-coupled DNA repair, a process that fixes DNA damage caused by ultraviolet light. CS is essential for this process, but mutations lead to Cockayne syndrome, a disease with premature aging, sun sensitivity, and developmental issues. CS is part of the SW2/SNF family of chromatin remodelers, but how it remodels chromatin and if this is used in repair was unknown. The study found CS repositions nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner and this is enhanced by N1-like histone chaper, a new CS partner. Mapping CS domains and derivatives showed chromatin remodeling by CS and N1-like chaper is required for efficient transcription-cou repair. Additionally, chrom remodeling and repair mediated by CS are separable activities. This collaboration between CS and N1-like chaper adds to understanding of how ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and histone chaper regulate chromatin structure. The study reveals histone chaper can cooperate with chromatin remodelers to increase efficiency of nucleosome repositioning.
Researchers have created a detailed map of epigenetic variation in the human genome by identifying clusters of CpG sites with high inter-individual variation, called Variably Methyl Regions (VMRs), in five purified cell types. VMRs are found at enhancers and 3' UTRs, and most have high heritability, but a subset show low herit and form co-regulated networks, enriched for transcription factor sites and biological pathways relevant to each tissue. For example, in T cells, a network of 95 VMRs regulates genes in T-cell activation, in fibroblasts a network of 34 VMRs controls growth, and in neurons a network of 18 VMRs regulates synaptic signaling. Experimentally, VM networks were shown to be responsive to environment, with methylation levels changing in a coordinated fashion dependent on growth conditions. These environmentally-responsive VMRs are enriched for imprinted loci, suggesting they are sensitive to environmental conditions. The study provides a map of epigenetic variation, showing both genetic and environmental causes underlie this variation. VMRs co-localize with functional features, are enriched CpGs that influence expression, and epetic variability at some loci is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. VMRs form cis and co-reg networks enriched for transcription sites and cell-type functions. Unexpectedly, many VMRs co-regulate both in cis and trans, with methylation levels varying in a coordinated fashion across different chromosomes. These co-reg networks are specific, have low herit, and enriched for cell-type functions. The study surveyed DNA methylation patterns in five cell types, identifying hundreds of loci with high epetic polymorphism, termed VM. VMs are enriched for functional features, notably enhancers, suggesting a role in regulating expression.
Researchers have developed a new rapid test for diagnosing dengue, called the Panbio Dengue Early, which detects the virus's non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen. This protein is present in the early stages of infection, typically within 1-9 days after symptoms appear. The test was evaluated in two studies in Vietnam and Malaysia with 198 and 263 laboratory-confirmed samples. The test's sensitivity and specificity were 69.2% and 96% respectively in Vietnam, and 68.9 and 96.7% in Malaysia, compared to RT-PCR. When combined with a commercial IgM/Ig rapid test, the sensitivity increased to 93%. The study found that using NS1 detection with IgM and Ig serology can significantly improve deng diagnosis and extend the detection window to early samples. The Panbio Deng Early is a sensitive and specific test for NS1, and when used with IgM/Ig rapid, increases sensitivity for acute deng and extends the detection window. In a clinical setting, the test's performance was comparable to other NS rapid tests in the same region. The optimal sensitivity for acuteeng was achieved with NS testing combined with Ig and Ig detection, increasing sensitivity compared to individual markers.
Researchers have developed a new computational method called Trans to predict the conserved helices of functional RNA structures, including transient, pseudo-knotted and alternative structures. Traditional RNA prediction methods assume a unique functional structure and do not account for features required for folding in vivo. To understand how RNA structures form in vivo, a reliable and sophisticated method is needed. Currently, few experimentally validated RNA structures exist, and computational programs predicting co-transcription folding in vivo make simplifying assumptions. Trans detects conserved helices of high statistical significance and predicts structural features of reference structures, including pseudo-kotted and alternative configurations. It also identifies unstructured subsequences bound by molecules and provides evidence for new helices defining folding pathways, supporting that homolog RNA folds similarly. Unlike existing methods, Trans works in a comparative way, highlighting conserved features and not requiring cellular environment knowledge. 

The co-transcription folding differs from re-folding in terms of time and features, and computational methods take kinetics into account. However, experimental methods await testing to explore RNA folding in vivo. A new approach for studying folding in vivo is proposed, considering errors in early stages are magnified as folding progresses. Precise transcription site knowledge is crucial, and existing methods' performance evaluated on small sets. Studying folding experimentally is challenging. Trans predicts novel helices of statistical significance, corresponding to conserved cocription features, supporting homolog RNA folds similarly.
Plants have a complex immune system that protects them from harmful microbes. This system, called Pattern-Triggered-Immunity (PTI), is made up of many parts that work together to keep the plant safe. When one part of this system is targeted by a pathogen, the others can compensate for its loss, making the plant resilient. Researchers used a strategy called network reconstitution to break down and rebuild the PTI in Arabidopsis to understand how it works. They found that the system is made of four main parts: salicylate, jasmonate, ethylene, phytoalex-deficient 4, and salicylate signaling. These parts interact with each other to control the plant's response to the immune stimulant flagellin-22 (fl22). Some interactions result in buffering, where one part can compensate for another's loss. Traditional genetic analysis couldn't detect some of these mechanisms. Similar to pathogenic perturbations, single-gene null-mut effects can be buffered by the network. The PT in Arabidopsis is controlled by a network of four sub-networks: salicy, jasate, ethylene, and phyalex-deficient 4. These sub-networks, or sectors, are key to plant immunity as they respond to fl22 and are buffered from pathogenic perturbations. A systems biology approach, network reconstitution, was used to understand the plant immune network. High-order perturbation and transcriptional profiling helped decipher the regulation of the immune network. Network reconstitution is a powerful tool to reveal mechanisms of complex networks, especially those resilient to perturbations. Plants with adaptive immunity have a buffered network that makes them resilient to perturbations, as pathogens target and disable immune proteins. Buffering conceals network components: when one is disabled, the network compensates for loss.
During embryonic development, the Drosila nervous system forms from a single-layered neuroepithelial sheets, which are then patterned into distinct domains to increase neuronal diversity in a controlled spatial and temporal manner. In Drosila, neuroepith patterning of the embryonic placode gives rise to the larval eye primord, consisting of two photoreceptor (PR) types: primary and secondary, as well as the opticlobe primord, which develops into prominent ganglia during larval and pupal stages. A genetic network regulates the balance between lar eye and optic precursors, and between primary and secondary precursors. Proneural factor A (A) specifies lar precursors, while orphan receptor Tailless (T) is crucial for optic precursor specification. Hedgehog and Notch signaling act upstream of A and T to coordinate specification in a timely manner. The boundary between A and T controls the number of primary and secondary precursors. Notch also controls binary fate, acting in a cascade of transcription interactions to define PR identity.
Human beta-defensin 1 (hBD1) is a ubiquitous endogenous antimicrobial peptide that exhibits distinct activities in its oxidized and reduced forms. Researchers explored its antimicrobial mechanisms and found that the reduced form of hBD forms a net-like structures around bacteria, capturing and inhibiting bacterial transmigration, independent of killing. This mechanism prevents migration of resistant pathogens and is stable in the presence of human duodenal secretions with high proteases. In contrast, cysteines are necessary for net formation. The redox-dependent function serves as an additional mechanism for h1, differing from net formation by other defensins like human-defin 6 (HD). The reduced form of h1 provides additional protection by entrapping bacteria in extracellular structures, preventing invasion. 

Electron microscopy revealed a net-like structure surrounding bacteria treated with reduced but not oxidized h1. A transmigration assay demonstrated h1-derived nets capture and inhibit bacterial transmigration independent of killing. The presence of nets could prevent migration of h1 resistant pathogens and are stable in presence human duoden secretion with high amount of prote.
Researchers have investigated the role of the OCRL protein in endocytosis in the zebraf pronephric tub, a model of the mammalian renal tubule. Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 are caused by mutations in the OCRL gene, but the underlying cause of the renal tubulopathy, characterized by low molecular weight proteinuria, is unknown. The study found that OCRL deficiency causes a defect in endocyt in the zraf pronephric tub, coinciding with reduced levels of the scavenger megal and accumulation in endytic compartments. Early endytic compartments and vacuolar endosomes were also reduced in the subapical region of proneph cells. Cell polarity in the proneph tub was unaffected in mutant embryos. OCRL-deficient embryos had mild ciliogenesis, but this did not account for the endytic defect. Catalytic activity of OCRL was required for renal endytic and the defect could be rescued by suppression of PIPK. The results indicate that OCRL is required for endytic in vivo and support the hypothesis that endytic defects cause the renalulopathy in Lowe and Dent disease. PIPK is a potential therapeutic target for Lowe and Dent disease.
Researchers conducted a study in the Kilbero Valley, Tanzania to investigate the presence and determinants of Rift Valley Fever (RV) transmission during interepidemic periods in livestock. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in cattle and sheep from May to August 2011, approximately four years after the 2007 RV outbreak in Tanzania. Seroprevalence of 11.3% was recorded, with 5.5% in animals born after the 2007 outbreak and 22.7 in present during the outbreak. There was a linear increase in prevalence in postepid annual cohorts. Nine ELISA positive samples were also positive for RVF IgM antibodies indicating recent infection. Spatial distribution of serreval exhibited hotspots. Sex difference in serreval in born after epidemic was not significant, whereas it was in present during outbreak. Animals living >15km from flood plain were more likely to have antibodies than those <5km. Species, breed, herd composition, grazing, and altitude were not associated with serositivity. Findings indicate postepid transmission of RVV in the area. Increase in serval in postid cohorts implies constant exposure and active transmission preceding survey.
Trypanosoma cruz, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, has a contractile vacuole complex (CVC) to regulate its osmolarity, despite being an obligate intracellular pathogen. Researchers used genetic and biochemical approaches to study the VC's role in trafficking glycosphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins to the parasite's plasma membrane and host invasion. T. cruzi Rab11 (GFP-TR11) localized to the VC, while a dominant negative mutant (DN) tagged with GFP (FPTRDN) localized to the cytosol, and epimastotes expressing this mutant were less responsive to hyposotic and hyperosmotic stress. Mutant parasites still differentiated into metacyc forms and infected host cells. GPI-anch transialase (TTS), mucins of 60-200K family, and trypastigote surface antigen (TSS II) co-localized with FPTR to VC during intramastigotes transformation into trypastigotes. Muc of gp/50 family co-localized VC during metacgenesis. Parasites expressing FPTRDN prevented TS, but not other proteins, from reaching the plasma, and were less infective compared to wild type. Incubation mutants with exogenous recombinant active, but inactive TS, and sialic acid, before infecting host, partially rescued infectivity trypastigotes. These results reveal TR's role in osmoregulation and trafficking transialase to plasma, transialase's role in infection, and a novel GPIanch protein secretion mechanism.
Researchers conducted a phase III clinical trial to compare the effectiveness and safety of a shortened rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen using a purified chick-embryo rabies vaccine (PCV) administered intradermally in 4 sites over 1 week, versus the standard 2-site regimen. The study included 443 participants aged 1 year or older, who were randomly assigned to receive intradermal PCV with or without human rabies immunoglobulin (HR) at the first visit. Rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RV) concentrations were measured up to day 365 post-vaccination. The 4-site/1 regimen was noninferior to the 2-site regimen at day 49, with a lower percentage of participants with RV concentrations 0.5 IU/mL. All participants achieved adequate RV concentrations by day 14. At day 49, the difference in RV concentrations between the 4/1 and 2-site groups was 1, indicating noninferiority. Geometric mean concentrations were 18 IU in the 4/1 group and 12 in the 2-site group at 14, and declined in both. RV concentrations were lower with HR administration than without. Both regimens had similar safety profiles, with no vaccination-related serious events. The study suggests the 4/1 regimen may be an alternative to current recommendations, offering improved efficiency and compliance.
Researchers studied the brain's ability to detect and respond to important events, focusing on the salience network (SN), which includes the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex. They used high-resolution MRI data from the Human Connectome Project and graph-theoretical techniques to investigate the SN's dynamic organization. The study found that the SN has high flexibility in connectivity with other brain networks, such as the frontoparietal, cingulateopular, and ventral dorsal attention networks, and has the most varied interactions in the brain. The SN is a central hub that facilitates interactions between networks, and its connectivity is distinct from other control systems. The study also found that the SN's flexibility predicts individual differences in cognitive flexibility. These results were consistent in a second dataset, showing the findings' robustness. The study provides new insights into the SN's dynamic architecture and its role in facilitating interactions with multiple systems and supporting various cognitive processes in the brain.
Researchers have identified a protein called VP4 from the Simian Virus 40 (SV40) that plays a crucial role in the release of the virus from host cells. SV40 is a non-enveloped virus, meaning it does not have a lipid envelope, and must be released from the cell without one. The process of release is not well understood, but involves the insertion of viral proteins into cellular membranes making them permeable to large molecules. VP4 is a protein expressed late in the viral life cycle, around the time of cell lysis. To investigate its role, VP was expressed and purified as a fusion protein from bacteria and found to bind and disrupt membranes. It interacts with the membrane bilayer, demonstrated by release of fluorescent markers into liposomes. The hydrophobic domain of VP is essential for binding and disruption. It prefers membranes with lipid composition similar to plasma and not nuclear membranes. Phosphatylethanol, a lipid in bacterial membranes, inhibits VP's activity. Disruption of membranes by VP involves formation of ∼3 nm pores in mammalian cells, including SV host cells. These results suggest VP acts as a viropin, perforating membranes to trigger viral release.
Researchers have developed a DNA vaccine, pcANS, that protects against deng by using the NS1 antigen. The vaccine induces both humoral and cellular immunity, with high levels of anti-NS antibodies and T cells. Passive immunization with anti-NS antibodies provided partial protection in mice with low virus load, but not with high load. The vaccine also activated CD4 and CD8 T cells, with IF-γ production and cytotoxic activity by CD8 T cells, but CD4 cells were crucial for protection. Depletion of CD4 cells in immunized mice abolished protection. Transfer of CD4 cells with anti-NS serum from immunized mice showed similar survival rates to pcANS-immunized mice. The study shows cooperation between CD4 cells and humoral immunity is critical for protection against deng mediated by NS antigen. This provides new insights into DENV immunity and vaccine development.
Researchers have studied how the cell-to-cell communication system in Gram-positive bacteria, specifically in Streptococcus, which relies on extracellular peptides to trigger responses. They focused on the RNPP family of proteins, which regulate important processes like sporulation, conjugation, and virulence, and are considered targets for new antibacterial agents. The study elucidated the structure-function of ComR, a member of the RNPP family, which controls natural transformation in Streptoccus. Com is activated by binding to its pheromone X, a mature form of the ComS-inducing peptide. Crystal analysis and mutational analysis revealed a mechanism: XIP induces release of the sequestered HTH domain and Com dimerization to DNA binding. This mechanism is conserved and specific to Com orthologs, showing Com is not an R protein but a new RNPP member. Identifying X and Com residues for activation is crucial for designing antagonistic strategies to control gene exchanges in Streptoccus. This is the first reported peptide-mediated control of a transcription regulator by sequestration of its DNA domain. The study proposes a molecular mechanism of Com activation and offers opportunities for controlled peptide-based systems in Strept and Gram bacteria.
Researchers have studied the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel EL, a type of neurotransmitter receptor found in animals, to understand how it works. They discovered that a class of molecules called primary amines, including the neurotransmitter GABA, can activate the channel at high to millimolar concentrations. These molecules bind to a specific site on the protein and cause the channel to open, but the effect decreases over time. The channel allows positively charged ions to pass through, similar to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The channel's simple behavior makes it a good model to study how ion conduction and gating works in this family of receptors. 

A library of molecules was used to find the amines that fit the binding site, and one was located in a crystal structure. The channel's properties were characterized using electrophysiology. EL is activated by amines, alkamines, aminothols, aminocoh, bromamines, and diamines, and the neurotransmitter GABA. The pentam ligated ion channels are a large family of receptors found in animals, including serotonin, nicot acetylcholine, GABA, and glycine receptors. They share a similar structure and function. With an activators, EL can be studied in detail. A key question is how binding ligands activate the channel across the protein. The binding site is large enough for different ligands, but interaction with the protein is strong, necessary for activation. EL is similar to nicot acetylcholine, serotonin, and glycine receptors, a cation selective and impermeable to anions. The crystal structure of EL shows a non-conducting channel, but it's unclear if it's the resting or desitized state.
Researchers investigated the progression from eczema/atopic dermatitis (AD) to asthma, also known as the "atopic march". They found that mice with skin-barrier defects developed AD-like inflammation and were susceptible to asthma. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSL) overexpressed by skin keratinocytes was identified as the driver of bronial hyperresponsiveness. Mice with keratin-specific deletion of RBP showed high levels of TSL and developed a severe asthm phenotype after allergen challenge. Elimination of TSL signaling blocked the atopic march, indicating high TSL levels were required for lung sensitization to inflammation. Outbred K-TSLg mice maintained high TSL without skin pathology. Epidermal TSL triggered the atopic, sensitizing lung to allergens without epicutaneous sensitization. The study suggests treating skin-bar defects and inhibiting systemic TSL may prevent asthma in AD patients.
Researchers analyzed the genome of Thermotoga marima, a hyperthermophilic bacterium, using a multi-omics approach that integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data with bioinformatics tools. This analysis revealed distinctive features of its genome organization compared to other bacteria, including a high number of genes per transcription unit (3.3), few putative non-coding RNAs (12), and few transcription units with multiple transcription start sites (3.7%). Quantitative analysis of promoters and ribosome sites showed increased conservation relative to other bacteria. The 5' untranslated regions had an atypical distribution with short (11-17 nt) and common (26-32) lengths. Transcription regulation was limited by lack of intergenic space for most transcription units. A high fraction of annotated genes were expressed independently of growth state and a correlation between mRNA and protein was observed (Pearson r=0.63, p<2.2×10-16-test). These properties are hypothesized to reflect its hypermophilic lifestyle and provide insights into microbial evolution on earth.
Researchers investigated how visual perception is influenced by context in a study where observers judged whether a target bar was present at the center of a display given weak or missing contrast at the target location with or without context of other bars. Observers were more likely to perceive a target when context had weaker contrast rather than stronger. When context perceptually grouped with the target, weak contextual bars biased observers to perceive target relative to without context, as if filling in the target. High-contrast bars, regardless of grouping with target, biased observers to perceive no target. A Bayesian model of visual inference accounted for data, illustrating context influences perception in two ways: biasing observers' prior that target should be present according to grouping principles and biasing internal model of likely contrasts caused by target. This suggests context does not influence perceived contrast despite bias to perceive target presence, suggesting areas beyond primary cortex are responsible for inferences.

The study used visual stimuli of bars in psychophysical and physiological studies to investigate how context biases perception of inputs. Perception of target presence or absence at central location with low or zero contrast, in context of other stimuli was assessed. Filling bias was stronger when contextual had weaker contrasts and target grouped with context as straight. Findings differed from previous facilitation sensitivities can be accounted by Bayesian decision model. Whether target or noise caused luminance at target location in image was not issue, but whether perceived or inferred bar even contrast missing. Yes-no task assessed bias to respond inferring target. Study revealed bias depends on contextual contrast, Bayesian can explain data, and showed no facilitation or suppression contrast in inference. Model parameters reflect brain's internal world and encoding.
Researchers have found that the presence of "defectors" (individuals that exploit a common resource without contributing to its production) in a population can sometimes lead to the survival of cooperation, rather than its destruction. This is counterintuitive because cooperation is vulnerable to exploitation by defectors, which can lead to the depletion of the common resource and population collapse of cooperation. However, in a structured population with small size, defectors can increase variability in cooperator frequency across locations, allowing cooperators to outgrow defectors globally despite defectors outcompeting cooperators in each location. This raises the possibility that defectors can create conditions that rescue cooperation from def-induced destruction. The study demonstrates three mechanisms through which this can occur using an individual-based model of birth, death, migration, and mutation. Firstly, during defector-induced population collapse, defectors occasionally go extinct before cooperators by chance, allowing cooperators to grow. Secondly, empty locations created by defector population extinction favor cooperation as they allow cooperator but not def migrants to grow. This leads to the result that initial presence of defectors can improve survival of cooperators compared to when defectors are absent. Additionally, resource limitation induced by defectors can select for adaptive mutations to limitation, which can favor cooperation by reducing population size. In a structured population, small sizes precipitated by defectors provide a "built-in" mechanism for persistence of cooperation.
Researchers have found that the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that causes infections in patients with compromised epithelial barriers, interacts with the mucosal barrier by adhering to multicellular junctions and binding to extruded apoptotic cells. This binding is independent of the type of cell death, as P aeruginosa also attaches to necrotic cells. The bacteria are then internalized through efferocytosis, a process where epithelial cells engulf and dispose of extruded apoptotic cells. Intracellularly, P aerugin inhabits an eocytic phagosome that acquires lysosomal features and is killed. The study suggests that elimination of P aerugin through eocytosis is a host defense mechanism. In healthy individuals, apoptotic cells are quickly removed, but in contexts favoring dead cells, P aerugin can colonize. The findings could be relevant to cystic fibrosis, characterized by excessive apoptotic cells and ineffective eocytosis.
During embryonic development in Drosophila, the gonad is formed from two distinct cell types: Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) and Somatic Gonadal Precursor (SG) cells. PGs form at the posterior of the blastoderm stage and are carried inside the embryo during gastrulation. To reach SGs, PGs must traverse the midgut and migrate through the meserm. A combination of repulsive and attractive signals from SG guide migration. The hedgehog (hh) pathway, specifically the shifted (sh) gene, plays a crucial role in directing PG migration. sh encodes a secreted protein that facilitates long-distance transmission of H through the proteogly matrix after released from basolateral membranes of H-expressing cells in the wing disc. sh is expressed in the gonadal meserm, and loss and gain-of-function experiments show it is required for PG migration. The hmg-dependent isopoid biosynthetic pathway generates the PG attractant by SGs and other tissues when hmg is ectically expressed. Production of this attract depends on sh and another hh gene, g1. Ectopic expression of hmg in the nervous system promotes release of H from cells into the mesermal layer, where H contacts migrating PGs. Potentiation of H by hmg depends on cholesterol modification.
Researchers studied the immune response of individuals who received a vaccine against HIV using a weakened adenovirus type 5 virus. The vaccine did not prevent HIV infection or reduce virus levels in newly infected people in previous studies. The researchers looked at how well the immune cells called CD8+ T-cells killed HIV-infected cells in people who received the vaccine, compared to those who were not infected and those who controlled the virus long-term. They found that the CD8 T-cells in vaccine recipients could kill HIV-infected cells, but not as well as those who controlled the virus long-term. However, those with certain HLA class I alleles, B27, B57, or B58, associated with controlling HIV, had stronger CD8 T-cell responses. This suggests these alleles may lead to better outcomes in both infection and vaccination due to more efficient priming of CD8 T-cells.
Researchers have found that the ability to share intentions, or work together towards a common goal, played a crucial role in the evolution of humans' unique cognitive abilities. They modeled the co-evolution of intentional behavior and culture, showing that rapid technological advancements go hand-in-hand with the ability to participate in joint behavior. Without opportunities for significant technological improvement, the ability to work together is selected against. This provides a mechanism for the emergence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans, as well as a reason for species diversity in prevalence of such behavior. 

The development of modern human cognition was catalyzed by high levels of collaborative behavior in early humans compared to great apes, known as the shared intention hypothesis or Vygotsian intelligence. Emergence of intentions at time of technological advance is consistent with tool manufacture evolving around 300,000 years ago with grammatical language, which facilitates joint behavior. The cultural hypothesis suggests socially learned culture affected evolution of traits. This is the first paper to formally model the ability to work together, although Bachar's work makes steps in this direction. Collaborative sharing alters strategies chosen, but depends on circumstances. The question of why humans' ability to work together emerged is open, but environment with coordination problems would be conducive. 

Individuals with ability to share can adjust strategy with neighbors for mutual benefit. The results show effects of joint behavior on technological convergence speed. The link between technology and collaboration is derived by modeling techno-cultural advance.
Researchers have identified two microRNAs, miR-34 and mi-449, that play a crucial role in male fertility by regulating the production of high-quality sperm. These microRNAs are highly expressed in post-meiotic germ cells and their reduction has been linked to reduced fertility in humans. A study in mice found that deletion of both miR-34 and mi-449 resulted in oligoasthenatozoospermia, a condition characterized by low sperm count and abnormal motility. This is a common cause of male infertility in humans. The study found that mi-34/449 deficiency impairs meiosis and final stages of sperm maturation. Analysis of pachene spermatocytes revealed deregulated genes, many of which are mi-34 targets. This suggests mi-34 is important for spermatogenesis and its deregulation leads to oligoasthenatoospermia. The loss of mi-34/449 did not block spermatogenesis but impairs developmental transitions, resulting in low sperm count and abnormal motility, hallmarks of oligasthenatoospermia. The study establishes loss of specific microRNAs as a causal event in oligastatoospermia.
Escherichia coli Nle 191 (Ec) has been used therapeutically for over a century, but the determinants of its probiotic properties remain elusive. Ec produces two siderophore-microins (Mcc) responsible for antagonistic activity against other Enterobacteraceae and synthesizes genotoxin colactin encoded by the p island. Colactin is a virulence and putative pro-cinogenic compound. Researchers aimed to decouple antagonistic activity of Ec from genotoxicity. They demonstrated that p-encoded ClP, peptase that activates colact, is required for antagonistic activity of Ec. Analysis of ClP mutants revealed activity linked to transmembrane helices of ClP and periplasm peptase domain, indicating transmembrane involved in aspect M biosynthesis or secretion. Single amino substitution in ClP inactivates genotoxic but maintains antagon activity. In vivo salmonelis model, this mutant reduced clinical signs and fecal shedding of Salmonella similarly to wild strain, while ClP deletion neither protected nor competed pathogen. ClP-dependent antibacterial effect observed with other E coli strains carrying truncated M gene and p island. This interplay between colact, salochelin, and siderore biosynthetic suggests genomic islands co-selected role in evolution E coli from phyroup 2.
Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus that causes meningitis and kills hundreds of thousands annually, relies on glycans for survival and pathogenesis. Glycans are made in the secretory pathway, but their precursors, nucleotide sugars, are made in the cytosol. Nucle sugar transporters solve this problem by exchanging nucleotides for nucleotides. The major virulence factor of C. neoans is its polysacchar capsule, which is also shed to impede the host response. Xylose, a monosacide absent in yeast, is a capsule component. We found two transporters, U1 and U2, specific for xylose donor UDPxy, with distinct localization and kinetic. Both also transport galactose UDPgal. U1 and U2 are required for xy incorporation into capsule and necessary for C.ans to cause disease in mice, but not for viability in infection. These findings provide a starting point for deciphering specificity of transporters, a pathway for therapy, and understanding glycology.
Researchers have developed an open-access global database for mapping and surveillance of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) to aid in control and elimination efforts. Disease risk estimates are crucial for targeted interventions and monitoring. However, a georeferenced global database for NTDs was missing, providing constantly updated data for researchers and control managers. The database was developed with an emphasis on schistosiasis in Africa, searching literature and contacting Ministries for location-specific data. Data were extracted, geferenced, and stored in a MySQL with a web interface for access. The database contained over 12,000 schosiasis locations from 35 African countries. It expanded to a global repository for other NTDs, such as soil-transmitted helthias and lemanias. The database offers opportunities for disease modeling, targeting, monitoring, and surveillance, and geostatistical analysis. A proof-of-concept was demonstrated with schias in Africa, showing the feasibility of a global NTD database.
A study investigated whether chronic helminth infections exacerbate Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) infection in cotton rats, which are a natural host for the filarial nematode Litomoides sigmodis and a model for human tuberculosis. Contrary to the hypothesis, the results showed that chronic filarial infection does not worsen MT infection in the rat model. Immunological and histological studies, as well as mycobacterial cultures, were conducted two months after MT challenge in rats with and without chronic L sigmodis infection. Sple cell proliferation and interferon production in response to purified derivative were similar between coinfected and MT-only animals. In contrast, MT loads and lung granuloma size were not increased in coinf animals. These findings suggest that filarial infections do not exacerbate MT in the rat model. The results indicate that filariation programs may not facilitate MT control, but suggest it may be possible to develop worm-derived therapies for autoimmune diseases without increasing infection risk.
Researchers studied the role of a specific ion channel, pp23, in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and its contribution to courtship behavior. They found that pp23 is expressed in sensory neurons associated with chemosensory bristles on the fly's legs, which are distinct from those related to feeding. Disrupting pp23 or inhibiting its activity did not affect feeding responses, but blocking pp23 neurons or mutating the gene delayed and reduced male courtship initiation and intensity. Mutations in pp23 also altered the male response to a female pheromone, 7,11-HD. These results indicate that pp23 and its cells play a role in the sensory system that determines sexual behavior in Dophila. The study suggests that pp23 is a potential pherone receptor or part of the pheronal cascade, and that DE/ENa signaling contributes to sensory functions underlying sex-related behaviors.
Researchers studied the relationship between mitochondrial tRNA import and codon usage in the unicellular green alga Chlamdomonas. They found a correlation between codon usage and the amount of imported tRNAs, suggesting that tRNA import might adapt to the mitochondrial genome. To test this, they modified Chlamdomonas' mitochondrial genome by changing cod usage, which reduced translation levels and respiratory complex activities, linked to limited tRNA pool. This indicates tRNA import is not dynamic, but rather a co-evolved process between import mechanism and translation machinery. The fine-tuning between tRNA import and cod usage in Chdomonas appears to be a co-evolutionary process, not a dynamic adaptation of cytosolic tRNA into mitochondria. The study shows tRNA import cannot rapidly adapt in Chdomonas and cod bias affects translation efficiency, demonstrating that mitochondrial DNA information does not regulate tRNA import. Steady-state tRNA levels correlate with cod usage, suggesting imported tRN are defined by mitochondrial DNA for optimal translation.
Researchers have identified new patterns of glucose regulation in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes using continuous glucose monitoring (CG). Current methods for measuring glucose regulation rely on single-point measurements or average levels, neglecting dynamics. The study used CG to evaluate frequency, types, and patterns of glucose elevations in individuals given a nutrient challenge. Measurement of insulin resistance highlights variability in physiology between individuals. An analytical framework was developed to group individuals by specific glycemic responses, called "glucotypes", revealing heterogeneity within traditional categories. Individuals considered normoglyc by standard measures exhibited high variability, with glucose levels reaching prediabetic and diabetic ranges 15% and 2% of the time, respectively. Glucose regulation, characterized by CG, is more prevalent and heterogeneous than thought, affecting normly individuals. Patterns reflect variable physiology. Interindividual responses to meals highlight regulation's personal nature. Through phenotyping, a model was built for identifying mechanisms of dysregulation and a tool for visualizing user-uploaded profiles and classifying patterns glucotypes.

The study suggests increased variability may precede abnormal levels, representing an earlier "predabetes" stage. Longer studies are needed to determine CG's predictive value for type 2 diabetes compared to traditional tests. Insulin, resistance, secretion, and concentrations were compared to glucotypes. Heterogeneity in metabolism, insulin, and glucose profiles are shown. Detailed measurements developed models for dysregulation and related to glucose intolerance, diabetes, and clinical measures. A study characterized glycemic patterns in environments using standardized meals and dysulation CG, and analysis defined glucotypes. 25% of normlyemic individuals exhibited severe variability, with glucose reaching predabetic or diabetic levels 15 and 2% of the time, respectively.
A study investigated the role of the Raf-like MAP kinase kinase (MAPK) EDR1 in regulating plant defense responses and cell death in Arabidopsis. EDR1 negatively regulates the MK4/MKK-MP3/MP6 kinase cascade by physically interacting with MK4 and MK5, and this interaction requires the N-terminal domain of E1. The study found that ed1 mutants have highly activated MP3/MP6 kinase activity and higher levels of MP3/6 proteins than wild-type. E1 also affects MK4/MK5 protein levels. Overexpression of MK4 or MK5 causes ed1-like resistance and mildew-induced cell death. Mutations in mp3, m4, and m5 suppress ed1-mediated resistance. The study suggests that E1 associates with MK4/M5 and negatively regulates the MAP cascade to fine-tune plant immunity.
Researchers have developed a computational framework to predict the spread of infectious diseases, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, using Gaussian processes. This framework can help policymakers make informed decisions to control and prevent the spread of diseases, which cause millions of deaths annually. The framework combines spatial and temporal data to make accurate predictions. It outperformed standard machine learning algorithms, random forests and boosted trees, in temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal predictions. The framework uses Gaussian processes to capture complex dependencies and make reliable predictions. It combines spatial and temporal data into a larger matrix, then trains a regression model to make predictions in three scenarios: temporal, spatial, and spatiemporal. The researchers tested the framework on Turkey's Crimean-Congoagic fever data from 2004-2015, a widespread disease in Africa, Balkans, Middle East, and Asia with 5-40% fatality rate.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the impact of seasonality and socioeconomic factors on the transmission of Rift Valley Fever (RV), a mosquito-borne viral disease affecting humans and livestock in Africa and the Middle East. They found that in northeastern Africa, human activities such as the Eid al-Adha festival, combined with climate factors like rainfall and hydrological variations, contribute to the spread of the disease. Sporadic outbreaks occur when livestock are brought into areas at risk due to the festival demand and abundant mosquitoes emerge. These factors affect the severity of outbreaks. The model shows disease dynamics over short and long periods, particularly during the festival time. It also investigates the impact of festival and seasonal factors like number of livestock imported, transportation speed from patch to patch, and death rate by sacrifices. When the festival starts earlier than usual, the risk of massive outbreaks increases, especially in the location of the ceremony. 

The model did not consider humans directly but human activities like import and transportation affect disease patterns at different locations. Temporal superposition of risk can be predicted in advance in some cases. A simple model for RVV, a vector-borne path in Africa and Middle East, was used. Implementing strategies and stochastic events like festival preparations change outbreak patterns. The model can be extended to consider disease in hosts and vectors, and import of RVV during latency. Due to lack of data, mosquito baseline values were not obtained. The study aims to evaluate seasonal and festival impacts on RV and dispersal. An outbreak in 2010 was attributed to camels in Mauritania and heavy rainfall. The findings provide information for governments to predict and control the disease.
Researchers studied the occurrence of anthrax in Azerbaijan from 1984 to 2010, analyzing data on livestock outbreaks, vaccination efforts, and human cases during Soviet and post-Sov governance. They found a significant increase in incidence from 1984 to 1995, followed by a decline of 35.24% after livestock vaccination started in 1996. The distribution of cases shifted from the west to east over time. After the Soviet Union dissolved, anthrax incidence decreased, but control measures are still needed to prevent its occurrence. The study identified two patterns: an increase during Soviet governance and decline after vaccination, with a geographic shift in distribution. The disease was more common in the west and south initially, then shifted to the east and north. A series of outbreaks in 1996 led to a comprehensive vaccination program. Anthrax has re-emerged in the Caucasus, raising concerns of spread. The study found spatial and temporal changes in anthrax in Azerbaijan over 27 years, consistent with previous research on zoonotic diseases after the Soviet dissolution.
Researchers studied how polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) interact with the Shaker voltage-gated potassium (KV) channel, a protein that controls potassium ion flow across cell membranes. PUFAs can make the channel open by changing its sensitivity to voltage, which may help treat epilepsy through a ketogenic diet. The study used computer simulations to see how PUs interact with the channel in open and closed states. They found a possible binding site on the channel's surface near the S3 and S4 helices of the voltage sensor domain. The fatty acid's tail interacted with the protein's hydrophobic core, while its head group interacted with charged residues on the S and S helices. Comparing with saturated fatty acids, the study found that polyunsaturated tails are more flexible, which may explain their specific effect on channels. PUs are essential in cell membranes and neurons and have been shown to change the Shaker channel's voltage sensitivity. However, how they do this is unclear. The channel has six transmembrane helices, with the first four making the voltage sensor and last two the pore. PUs have been shown to affect many voltage-gated channels, but how they work is unknown. PUs have a carboxyl head and lipophil tail with double bonds. Direct interactions have been seen in some channels, but not the Shaker. PUs have been shown to modulate Shaker by partitioning into the bilayer and interacting with the voltage sensor's S and S helices.
Researchers have developed a pipeline to screen for anti-parasitic agents targeting Cryptosporidium parv's inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme crucial for the parasite's survival. Cryptosporidiosis causes significant disease in children in developing countries and severe enteritis in AIDS patients, but current treatments are ineffective. The pipeline uses a genetically engineered Toxoplas gondii parasite model that mirrors Cryptporium's purine pathway and depends on IMH for survival. This allows for rapid assessment of anti-parasitic potential and target specificity. A fluorescence-based host cell growth assay and Cryptporum growth assay with automated imaging were also developed to evaluate compounds. The pipeline was used to test emerging IMH inhibitors, identifying 1,2,3-triazole ethers with excellent selectivity in the T. gond model and anti-paras activity. A T. gondii was engineered to mirror Cryptpor's purine metabolism, lacking xanthine and guanine salvage via HGP. The IM gene was introduced under the T. gond promoter, creating a T. gii reporter that depends on IM for survival. The pipeline was used to identify promising candidates A103 and A110, >100 times more potent than paromycin, the current standard treatment.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to investigate the genetic factors influencing tooth development in infancy. They analyzed data from 4,564 individuals from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort and 1,518 from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. The study identified five genetic loci associated with tooth eruption time and number at one year of age. These loci included genes linked to tooth and organ development, such as KCNJ, DA, HOXB, RADL, IGF1, HMGA, and MSRB. Four of the identified genes are also implicated in cancer development. A variant in the HO gene cluster was associated with orthodontic treatment by age 31.

The study found that genes at these loci have roles in organogenesis, growth, and developmental processes, and cancer. Mutations in three of these genes lead to altered organ development, such as KC (teeth, jaws, palates, ears, fingers, toes), DA (teeth, hair, sweat, salivary glands), and IGF1 (intestines). The study suggests genetic determinants of early tooth eruption may associate with dental occlusion later in life. The research provides insight into the genetic architecture of primary dentition and has implications for the study of developmental and organogenic processes.
Researchers created two new mouse models, TsY and MsY, to study the effects of trisomy and monomy of the Hspa-App region on chromosome 21. This region is associated with Down syndrome (DS) and is the most common human aneuploidy, while complete monomy is lethal and partial or mosaic monomy is seen. Both conditions lead to intellectual disability, locomotor deficits, and altered muscle tone. The study found that trisomy and monomy of this region alter locomotion, strength, muscle mass, and balance. Gene expression in skeletal muscles revealed changes in metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. Genes downregulated in TsY mice and upregulated in MsY. Shift in muscle metabolism correlates with change in mitochondrial proliferation without alteration in function. However, reactive oxygen species (ROS) from complex I decreased in MsY mice, while membrane permeability of TsY mitochondria increased. The Hspa-App interval controls metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes in muscles due to change in Gabpa, N1, and Atp5. Results indicate copy variation in this region impacts locomotor by altering function.
Researchers have developed a quantitative model of the GIRK1/2 channel, a type of potassium channel that regulates heartbeat and neuronal excitability, to understand how its basal and evoked activities are controlled. They found that basal and evoked activities are interrelated, with the extent of activation by neurotransmitter activation inversely related to basal activity. The model accurately recapitulates basal and evoked currents in Xenopus oocytes, HEK cells, and hippocampal neurons, and predicts dose-dependent activation of GIRK/2 by coexpressed Gγ and accounts for the inverse basal-evoked correlation. The model indicates that 3-4 Gγ dimers are available for each GIR1 channel, while Gα decreases from 2 to less than 1 per channel as GIR1 density increases. The persistent Gγ/channel ratio suggests a strong association of GIR1 with Gγ, consistent with recruitment to the surface of Gγ but not α by GIR1. Analysis suggests a stoichiometry of 4γ but 2α per GIR1 channel. The unequal association of GIR1 with subunits and cooperative gating by Gγ underlie the pattern of basal and agon-evoked activities, allowing GIR1 to act as a bidirectional detector of Gγ and α.
Researchers have developed a new computational model called PredTA to predict the targets of a specific type of bacterial protein called transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) that are secreted by plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria. These proteins act as transcription activators on plant genes to support bacterial virulence. The model accounts for recent findings that TALEs can bind to DNA with varying repeat lengths and orientations, and considers dependencies between amino acid positions. PredTA was trained on a wealth of quantitative data and benchmarked using RNA-seq data from Xanthas infection in rice, showing improved performance compared to previous approaches. It predicted novel putative virulence targets, but also identified "orphan TALEs" with no predicted targets, possibly due to incomplete gene annotations. Promoter-wide scans using PredTA recovered known targets, and combined with RNA-seq data detected putative targets independent of existing annotations. Genome-wide scans using PredTA enabled identification of novel targets, including non-coding RNAs. Accurate predictions are crucial for elucidating virulence of TALEs in plant infection.
Researchers have identified 24,189 possible non-synonymous amino acid changes in human mitochondrial DNA, but only a small subset has been functionally evaluated, while the majority's pathogenicity was assessed in-sil by software. These tools proved incongruent, so a machine-learning algorithm APOEE was designed to outperform existing methods in estimating mitochondrial non-syn genome harmfulness. APOEE was built on 864 known variants, with 100 sets drawn randomly with replacement for training and testing. Performance metrics were calculated for individual and aggregated predictors, reported in Table 1. Co-evolving amino acids and mean Z-scores were computed for all 24,189 non-syn changes, available as a flat file. Variants were grouped for training and testing, used to build and verify AEE. Predictions from other tools were fed into AEE (Pathogenic Prediction through Logistic Model). AEE's logic is based on Logistic Tree Model, chosen for transparency, reproducibility, and easy-to-understand results. It uses three milestones: third-party features related to 13 mitochondrial proteins, multi-alignments, and amino conservation; reasoning on curated, non-overlapping sets; decision tree learning for investigable rules. Assessing pathogenicity is challenging in-vitro, inivo, due to paucity of funds or facilities, particularly in mitochondrial DNA, smaller than nuclear.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection, the most mosquito-transmitted viral infection, causes a range of diseases from self-limiting deng fever to life-threatening deng hemorrhagic fever and shock. Thrombocytopenia is a major observed in both mild and severe deng disease and correlated with disease progression. Previous studies have shown that DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), secreted into patients' blood, stimulates immune cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and causes endothelial leakage. This study demonstrates that DENV, but not Zika virus culture supernatant, induces P-selectin expression and phosphatylser (PS) in human platelets, abolished when NS is depleted from D supernant. Results using recombinant NS from four D serotypes show similar effects, blocked by anti-NS F(ab)2, anti-TL4, TLR antagonist (Rhobacteroid lipopolyscharide, LPS), and TLR inhibitor (AK), but not polymyx B (LPS inhibitor). Activation by DNS promotes adenos diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation and adhesion to endothelial and phagocyt by macrophages. D-induced thrombocytia and hemorrhage are attenuated in TLR knockout and wild-type mice when NS is depleted from D supernant.
Researchers analyzed the dynamic loops that regulate blood pressure and volume homeostasis, focusing on the arginine vasopressin (AV), atrial natriuretic peptide (AN), and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RA) systems. They found that these systems work together to control blood pressure and volume through two mechanisms: vasoconstriction and volume regulation. Both systems are oscillators with a single equilibrium point that can be stable or lead to oscillatory instability. A subsystem involving AN and AV stimulation of vascular muscle cells is also an oscillator with multiple feedback loops, showing oscillatory potential when delays are comparable. The study provides insight into long-term blood homeostasis mechanisms based on dynamic interactions. A model was built to describe the control of vasomotor tone, smooth muscle, blood, and mean pressure, with key players and interactions shown in a diagram. The system is closed, with interplay among AV, AN, and RA systems through effects on smooth muscle, blood, and pressure. Analysis suggests long-term homeostasis mechanisms are complex loops of oscillators with a single point. AV-AN-RA endocrine control of fluids and pressure was analyzed to highlight loop and function. The system can be split into two dynamic systems with VSM and D agents as nodes, exerting effects on pressure and volume. A subset was analyzed, including AN and AV stimulation of smooth, complex between AV and AN-dependent pathways in muscle, and stretch loops onto AV and AN systems. The system is a negative loop of input monotone subsystem, with three loops due to: AN released by heart, AV by stretch; AV by SP, by stretch; and AV by SP, by aortic carot.
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism that regulates thrombus growth, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. They studied protein transport through a fibrin network, a component of thrombus, using experiments and simulations. Permeability and diffusivity were key factors in protein transport through the fibr network. In vivo studies in mice showed stabilized thrombi were covered by a fibrin network (fibrin cap). Simulations, accounting for fibr cap permeability, showed thrombin inside throm was washed through the network, limiting platelet exposure to throm on the surface. The fibr cap also restricted platelet approach to high thrombin regions, necessary for plate activation and throm growth. Fibr cap prevents small throm from developing into life-threatening events in 60% of vessels without injury.
Researchers investigated how invariant natural killer T (iKT) cells control the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a bacterium that causes tuberculosis. They found that iKT cells are activated during infection, but their ability to limit bacterial growth was not well understood. iKT cells were co-cultured with infected macrophages, and their activation was measured by CD25 upregulation and IFγ production, primarily driven by IL-12 and IL-18. However, iKT control of M growth was CD1-dependent and did not require IL-12, IL-18, or IFγ. This showed that conventional markers of activation did not correlate with iKT effector function during M infection. iKT control of M replication was also independent of TN and cytotoxicity. A novel mediator of iKT antimicrobial activity was discovered: granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMF). i cells produced GMF in vitro and in vivo in a CD1-dependent manner during M infection, and GMF was necessary and sufficient to control M growth. GMF is a new iKT antimicrobial effector function and may play a role in cell immunity against M.
Researchers studied how the fungus Candida albicans, a common component of human gut flora, regulates its population size during colonization in the intestinal tract. They found that the EF1 gene, which encodes a transcription factor, is highly expressed during growth in the intestinal tract. Surprisingly, a mutant lacking EF1 showed increased colonization in the intestinal tract, while overexpressing EF1 showed reduced colonization in the intestinal and oral cavity of immunodeficient mice. When injected into the bloodstream, both strains caused lethal infections, but mutants attenuated in virulence showed normal colonization levels. Expression of several genes dependent on EF1 was observed in lab growth, but not in the intestinal tract. These results show EF1 regulates colonizing levels, favoring commensalism over candidiasis. Different genes are required in different niches and pathways regulating expression during colonization differ from lab growth. 

Mutants lacking EF1 colonized the intestinal higher than wild-type organisms. Strains overexpressing EF1 reduced intestinal and oral colonization in immunodef mice. EF1 is important for determining C. alb population size during colonization. Expression may affect interactions between C and intestinal cells, altering adherence or immune signaling. Reducing EF1 may reduce C infection, favoring commal over candidias. Despite importance in intestinal, EF did not affect virulence or lab conditions. High EF1 attenuated colonization, deletion resulted in enhanced, demonstrating EF1 regulates colonization in murine tract. In oral, EF1 expression was low compared to intestinal.
Immunization with irradiated malaria sporozoites is the most effective strategy against liver stages of malaria, but the mechanisms behind its success are unknown. Researchers found that complete CD8 T cell responses require prolonged antigen presentation. They used T cells specific for the malaria sporozoite protein, a vaccine candidate, and found that sporite antigen persists for 8 weeks after immunization, a remarkable since irradiated sporites can't replicate and don't differentiate beyond liver stages. Antigen persists in lymphoid organs depends on CD11+ cells. Prolong antigen enhances CD8 cell response in several ways: reducing primed cells' exposure in vivo reduces final memory size, fully developed cells expand in immunized mice but not in naïve, and persists primes naïve cells, including thymic emigrants, to eliminate parasites in liver. Data show protective CD8 immunity against malaria stages depends on prolonged sporite antigen presentation.
Researchers investigated the potential of polymyxin B (pol) as a treatment for leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites, by encapsulating it in biodegradable nanoparticles (PBCPs) to improve delivery and reduce side effects. PBCPs were fabricated using anionic polymerization and characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering, Nanoparticle Analysis, and cell viability tests. PPs coated with pol (PBCp-pol) had a stable size of 261.5 ± 25.9 nm and released 50% of the drug 6-7 times slower than free pol, favoring a prolonged release. In vitro tests, pol alone reduced amastigote infection in macrophages at 10 μg/mL, but higher concentrations were needed for complete elimination. PPs also showed lemanidal activity, surpassing pol, but no antimicrobial activity was detected. However, pol maintained activity against E. coli, Pseudomonas, and Klei, adding antimicrobial properties. This delivery system demonstrated antishial and antimicrobial properties, helping prevent secondary infections in cutaneous ulcers caused by L. amazon, ending disfiguring or disabling lesions.
A study was conducted in Belo Horizont, Brazil to investigate prognostic factors for death from visceral leishmanias (VL). The analysis was based on data from the Reportable Disease System-SAN (Brazilian Ministry of Health) from 2002-2009. Two models were created: Model 1 (2002-2009, 111 deaths and 777 patients) and Model 2 (2007-2009, 49 deaths and 327). Variables associated with death in Model 1 were weakness (OR 2.9, CI 1.3-6.4), Leishmaniasis-HIV co-infection (2.4, CI 1.2-4.8), and age ≥60 (2.5, CI 1.5-4.3). In Model 2, variables associated with death were bleeding (3.5, CI 1.2-10.3), other infections (3.2, CI1.3-7.8), jaundice (10.1, CI3.7-27.2), and age ≥60 (3.1, CI1.4-7.1). A prognostic score was developed using variables from Model 2, with sensitivity 71.4%, specificity 73.7%, positive predictive values 28.9% and 94.5, and area under the curve 75.6. Factors associated with death from VL were weakness, Leishiasis-H co-infection, other infections, bleeding, jaund, and age ≥60. These findings agree with the Brazilian Ministry of Health, which considered age <6 or >65, jaund, and co-morbidities including infections as factors associated with death.
Researchers studied the regulatory receptor-like kinase B1 (RLK) BAK in plants, which plays a crucial role in hormone responses, immunity, and cell death. They found that a new allele of BAK, called bak-5, differentially regulates three BAK-dependent pathways. Specifically, bak-5 mutants are severely impaired in innate immunity mediated by BAK-dependent receptors FLS and EFR, but not in BR signaling or cell control. Unlike the kinase BRI, the non-kinases F2 and E have low activity and cannot phosphorylate BAK in vitro. However, kinase activity is not required for ligand-induced heteromerization of F2 or E with BAK in planta. The suppression of F2 and E-dependent signaling in bak-5 is due to BAK-5's interaction with the ligand-binding receptor, not its kinase activity. The results show phosphorylation-dependent control of plant growth, immunity, and death by BAK, revealing differences in mechanisms of ligand-binding and non-kinase regulation. The interaction of EFR and F with BAK is not due to phosphorylation, unlike BRI's requirement for kinase activity. BAK dictates specificity, as bak-5 blocks F2 and E-mediated PTI signaling but not cell control or BR signaling. The importance of BAK in innate immunity is shown by targeting the lig-induced B-FL2 interaction by the bacterial effector Avr to block PT signaling. B's function in death and immunity is independent of BR signaling.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how cancer cells respond to treatment using a combination of time-lapse cell microscopy and flow cytometry data. They created a computational model that shows how cells progress through the cell cycle and subsequent generations after treatment. The model includes modules that describe the activity of main pathways causing arrest, repair, and death in each phase. A framework was created to apply different types of modules in each phase and test the complexity justified by data. The method was tested with time-course measures in parallel with flow cytometry and time-lapse cell microscopy in X-ray treated human cancer cells, spanning a range of doses. The best model, including dose-response effect, was built combining modules with a strategy fitting all data different doses and platforms. The model gave the first complete in-silico rendering of the process following X exposure, providing quantitative measures of dose-dependence G1, S, and G2 checkpoint activities in generations, reconciling known radiation effects and new insights in a unique scenario.
Researchers have identified a link between a genetic mutation in the Pd2 gene and kidney disease in mice. This gene is involved in the production of coenzyme Q, an essential for energy production in cells. Mice with the mutation, called Pd2kd, have lower levels of coenzyme Q in their kidneys and develop kidney disease. The disease starts in the glomerular podocytes, cells that filter waste from the blood. Mice without these cells, the kidneys fail to function properly. In contrast, mice with the mutation only in liver cells that produce coenzyme have no disease, despite low levels of the enzyme. This suggests that glomer podocytes are most sensitive to coenzyme deficiency. The disease is not caused by inflammation, but by the body's attempt to clean up damaged cells. The study provides a model to investigate coenzyme deficiency in other tissues, such as the nervous system and muscles, which are affected in human disease. Coenzyme deficiency has been linked to nine genes, including Pd2, Pd1, and Pd. Mutations in P2 have caused nephrotic syndrome in humans.
Researchers have discovered that certain developmental cell lineages in organisms, such as protostomes and deuterostomes, are surprisingly resilient to cell death and division failures, which can be caused by environmental or genetic disturbances. This robustness is a key characteristic of life, but its underlying mechanisms and evolutionary origins were unclear. The study found that the cellular composition of these organisms is only modestly affected by cell deaths due to several features of the lineages, including their shallowness, topology, early appearance of cells, and non-clonality of cell types. Simulations demonstrated that this robustness arose as an adaptation to random cell deaths during development. This reveals general principles of determinative developmental lineages and a new concept of phenotypic robustness, with implications for development and evolution. 

Phenotypic robustness is crucial for life, but its mechanisms and origins are not well understood. The study showed that determinative developmental lineages are robust to necrosis and cell program failure, representing environmental or genetic disturbances. Analysis of three lineages provides testable hypotheses on organizing principles of lineages and opens door to characterizing complex line properties, an area with theoretical and applied values in evolution, development, and carcinogenesis. Findings reveal a new mechanism of phenotypic robust and its origin, different from previously studied mechanisms acting at subcell or cellular levels. Lineage robust manifests at supracellular level, a feature of multicellular organisms, and explains contribution of ontogenesis to robust. This is important for species with determinative development, where cell fate is largely fixed. Lineage robust with regulative development complements subcell and cellular mechanisms against environmental and genetic disturbances common in nature.
Researchers have developed an open-source, high-throughput platform called EmbryoPhomics to study the development of aquatic embryos. This platform consists of an Open Video Microscope (OpenIM) that captures high-resolution videos of multiple embryos under controlled conditions, and a Python package called Embryo Vision (EmbCV) that analyzes the videos to extract phenomic data on morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits during embryonic development. The platform was tested on two species, the pond snail Radix bica and the marine amphipod Orchestia gammellus, to assess their responses to environmental changes in temperature and salinity. The results showed that EmbryoPhomics can acquire and process data on functional, temporal, and spatial responses in the earliest life stages of development, which is crucial for understanding organismal responses to environmental changes. The platform demonstrated its ability to quantify phen-level responses of large numbers of developing embryos in various experimental designs, from 2-week to 24-hour exposures. EmbryoCV extracted data from 95% of the 30 million images acquired, producing high-dimensional data describing morphological, physiological, and behavioral responses. The results showed high concordance with manual measures of spatial and temporal characteristics. Embryoomics can generate whole-organism responses with scale and quality required to study embryonic development, comparing to molecular technologies.
Malaria parasites (Plasium spp.) undergo significant changes in metabolism as they transition between their life stages in mosquitoes and human hosts. In the mosquito stage, they rely heavily on glycolytic metabolism, whereas in the blood stage, they depend on tricarboxylic acid (T) metabolism. Researchers used stable isotope labeling, metabolomics, and genetics to study stage-specific changes in Plasium berghei carbon metabolism and its impact on survival in blood and mosquito stages. They found glutamine serves as the primary input for T metabolism in both stages and is crucial for gametogenesis. Glutamine catabolysis and key reactions in intermediary metabolism and CoA synthesis are essential for ookin toocyst transition in mosquito. This study expands knowledge on Plium metabolism and suggests potential targets for transmission-blocking strategies. It also highlights differences between Plium species not anticipated by genomics or transcriptomics, emphasizing the importance of integrating metabolomics with other platforms for drug discovery.
Researchers have identified a common motif in biological signaling pathways called inherent feedforward loops (ILFs) that can differentiate between pulsatile and sustained signals in regulating gene expression. These loops simultaneously activate an output and an inhibitor of the output, allowing the system to adapt to sustained inputs and distinguish between signals with varying temporal profiles. A new study examined the ability of IFLs to process oscillatory signals, finding that their capacity to translate pulsatile dynamics is limited by two constraints: the kinetics of the loop components and a match between network parameters and signal characteristics. With proper parameters, IFLs can respond to transient but not sustained signals due to temporal adaptation to sustained inputs. This property is ideal for decoding oscillatory signals, as it reacts to changes in input rather than absolute concentration. IFLs are a major topology driving temporal adaptation, generating a pulse response to sustained inputs. They are found downstream of divergent signals in amoeba and mammalian cell differentiation, despite differences in dynamics. The study analyzed the constraints of signals and parameters for counting to occur, providing insights into natural decoding systems and network perturbations.
Researchers have developed improved methods for quantifying, propagating, and storing the obligate intracellular pathogen Orientia tsutsamushi, which causes scrub typhus, a serious illness in rural Southeast Asia. The bacterium is transmitted by a tick bite and can only be cultured in mammalian cells, making research challenging. A clinical isolate of O. tsamushi was grown in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and bacterial growth measured using a specific PCR assay. Conditions for improved viability and growth were monitored. A standardized method for comparing O. tsushi viability after purification and propagation under various conditions was established. This data supports improved techniques for propagation, purification, and storage of the organism, useful for clinical isolation and in vitro experiments. 

Orientia tsam is a leading cause of CNS infections in Laos and associated with miscarriage and poor neonatal rates in pregnancy. It is an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium, member of the Ricketiaceae family, differing from Ricketia in genome, morphology, and phenotyp properties. The study aimed to develop an experimental toolkit for research on the neglected pathogen. A simplified growth assay was used to compare growth across conditions, useful for comparing antibiotic sensitivity of isolates. Optimized assay showed growth of O. tsushi was quantified by extracting DNA and measuring genome copy number using a specific primer/probe set. This is a concern as bacterial culture cannot be used for clinical diagnosis, reducing isolates for research diversity and resistance. Methods for quantification, propagation, and long-term storage of O tsushi were improved.
Researchers investigated the safety and effectiveness of the antiparasitic drug praziquel (PQ) in treating schistosomiasis in children aged 1-5 years. Currently, children in this age group are excluded from schistosom control programs due to lack of P data on P's safety in this age. The study involved 104 Zimbabwean children aged 1-5 who received P tablets and their caregivers reported side effects within 24 hours of treatment. Efficacy was determined 6 weeks later through schosom counts in urine. Compared to 6-10 year olds, pre-treatment S haobium infection in 1-5 olds was 14.6 eggs/10ml and prevalence 21%. 3.8% reported side effects, including stomach ache, loss of appetite, lethargy, and inflammation. P treatment reduced schos levels in 1-5 olds by 99% and cured 92%, comparable to 6-10 olds 96 and 67%. P is safe and efficacious in 1-5 olds as in 6-10 olds.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide screen in Drosila to identify genes involved in Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis, a process that contributes to 30% of human cancers. They found multiple evolutionarily conserved pathways controlling tumenesis and human orthologs of hits were significantly downregulated in thousands of primary tumors, revealing novel prognostic markers for epithelial tumors. Of the top 100 candidate suppressor genes, 80 were validated in secondary Drosila assays, including known and novel genes that cooperate with Ras-driven tumenesis. Low expression of confirmed hits correlated with KRAS mutation and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. The top hit, Tetrasin family member T29b, regulates EGFR signaling, epithelial architecture, and restrains tumor growth and invasion. The screen uncovered novel conserved epithelial genes and experimentally confirmed T29 as a key regulator of EG/Ras induced epithelial growth and invasion.
Researchers have identified a gene, wtf13, in the fungus Schizosaccharomyces pombe, that acts as a meiotic driver, meaning it increases its own transmission into offspring by killing spores that do not inherit it. This driver imposes a cost on the genome, leading to the evolution of suppressors. They found that w13 in lab stocks is a meiotic and kills spores that do not inherit it by generating a diffusible poison and sp-specific antidote. Another gene, wtf-2, arose in the lab and makes an antidote that rescues spores that inherit it, selfishly gaining its own transmission advantage while dampening w13 drive. This establishes a novel paradigm for meiotic suppressors and insight into drive systems. Four w genes were previously identified as meiotic in different S. pombe isolates, all killing spores that do not inherit them. One, w4, from S. kucha, causes drive by poison and antidote mechanism. Wtf-2 encodes a protein that suppresses w13 by molecularly mimicking its antidote. Results show w13 is a poison-antote meiotic driver and w-2 encodes a protein that suppresses w13. This is a departure from prevailing hypothesis that suppressors rescue all gametes indiscriminately.
Researchers have developed an algorithm that can predict gene expression levels in individuals based solely on their genetic information. The algorithm uses data from a set of individuals to predict expression of unseen individuals given their genotype in the vicinity of the gene. Notably, the predictions are robust and consistent between training and test sets, even when the sets consist of individuals from different populations. The number of genes that can be predicted is relatively small due to ignoring factors like environmental and sequence variation, but the robustness means the degree to which genes can be predicted in advance is known. An extension incorporates different types of genomic annotations to weigh the importance of variants, and assigning higher weights to those near genes and high GC content improves predictions. Predicted genes have higher expression and variability across individuals, providing insight into characteristics of genes that can be predicted from genetic variation.

The algorithm can predict genes with remarkable robustness even when trained on data from different populations than the individuals. However, it also uses expression of other genes, making it hard to know which part of predictive power comes from SNPs and which from correlated genes. Two multi-SNP algorithms predict gene variation among individuals using genotype, using information from SNPs in the vicinity and a combination that incorporates heterogeneous annotations. A subset of genes are better predicted with information from populations other than the individuals, suggesting shared sequence variation across populations may be hard to distill from same population.

Variation in expression among individuals plays a role in disease susceptibility and phenotypes, linked to genetic variation among individuals. A goal is to predict changes based on genetic variation.
Researchers investigated the competitive interactions between two strains of the malaria parasite Plasmodium chaudi, one virulent (AJ) and avirulent (AS), in mice. They used a mathematical model-based approach to determine the cause of suppression of the avirulent clone by the virulent clone in immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. The study found that the ratio of background loss of meroites to invasion of red blood cells was the only parameter that needed to be clone-specific to predict the data. This ratio was the same for both clones in single infections but different in mixed infections. The size of this difference was largest in immunocompet mice and smallest in immunodef. This explains why suppression was alleviated in immunodef mice. Suppression occurred early in infection, even before peak parasitemia. The results suggest that innate immune clearance of meroites is the most likely mediator of competitive interactions between virulent and avir clones. In mixed infections, an interaction between clones and immune response was found to change the strength of clearance of meroites. This interaction is unknown, but refinement of model with other datasets may lead to its discovery.
Researchers have proposed a new model, called Origin-Dependent Inverted-Repeat Amplification (ODIR), to explain how genetic errors during DNA replication can lead to the formation of interstitial inverted duplications, a type of copy number variation (CNV) in the genome. This model suggests that replication errors at existing short, interrupted, inverted repeats in genomic sequences create an extrachromosomal, autonomously replicating intermediate, which integrates into the genome as a CNV without losing distal chromosomal sequences. To test this model, scientists used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They found that the proposed replication error, where leading and lagging strands are ligated to create a closed fork, can occur in vitro at short, interrupted repeats. This results in a hairpin-linear duplex that replicates in vivo to create an inverted dimer plasmid, which integrates into the genome by homologous recombination, creating an inverted triplication. This model can also explain the generation of human, de novo, inverted amplicons with a 2:1 mixture of sequences from homologues of a single parent, a feature explained by a plasm intermediate from one homologue integrating into the other prior meiosis.
Researchers investigated how the process of translation, or protein production, in cells infected with the influenza virus. They found that the virus can initiate translation at non-canonical, or non-standard, start sites in response to stressful conditions in mammalian cells. This can lead to the production of novel, or new, immune targets for the immune system to recognize. The study systematically examined the extent and impact of alternate initiation in cells infected with influenza. They analyzed data suggesting selection against non-canonical initiation at C codons in virus lineages adapted to mammalian hosts. Using ribosome profiling with the inhibitor lactomycin, they experimentally mapped initiation sites in human epithelial cells infected with influenza. Identified several alternate initiation sites in viral mRNAs, all at AUG codons downstream of canonical codons. One of these sites truncates 14 amino acids from the N-terminus of the N neuraminidase protein, resulting in loss of cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain. This truncated neuraminase is expressed on surface during infection, enzymatically active, and conserved in N1 lineages. No globally higher levels of alternate initiation on host transcripts upon infection or antiviral response, but subset induced by response enriched alternate sites.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHE) is a bacterial pathogen that causes severe diarrhea and potentially life-threatening kidney disease, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), with no effective treatment or prophylaxis. HE and other enteric pathogens, such as enterogenic E. coli (EPEC), Salmonella, and Shigella, use a type III secretion system (TSS) to inject virulence effectors into host cells. These effectors subvert host function to promote disease and transmission, but mechanisms of binding to host proteins and disrupting normal intestinal cell function are not fully understood. This study found that E. coli O157:H7 nH and nH2 genes encode TSS effectors that bind human ribosomal protein 3 (R3), a subunit of nuclear factor kappa-light-enhancer of activated B (NF) transcription complexes. nH and n2 localized with R in cytoplasm, not nuclei. The N-terminal of n and n was required for binding to N-terminus of R. and n and n are autophosphorylated Ser/Thr kinases, but binding R is independent of kinase activity. n reduced nuclear abundance of R without altering p or p65 NF subunits or phosphorylation state of inhibitory NF chaper I. n repressed transcription of R/NF-dependent reporter, but not R-independent reporters. In contrast, n stimulated R and AP-dependent transcription. A region of n (40-45) is responsible for inhibitory activity toward R. Deleting n from E. O:H produced hypervulent phenotype in gnotic pig model Shiga toxin E infection. This suggests n disrupts host immune responses by binding cofactor host transcription complexes.
Researchers have developed a new method called feature models (FMs) to study how transcription factors (TFs) bind to DNA. The current method, position scoring matrix (PM), assumes each position is independent, but this doesn't always hold true. FMs represent TF specificities using features, which can span multiple positions. A mathematical formulation and algorithm were created to learn these features from binding data. A discriminative finder was also developed to discover new FMs enriched in target sequences. The approach was tested on synthetic data and a widely used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) dataset. It was then applied to high-throughput TF data from mouse and human, revealing features present in binding specificities of mouse and human TFs. FMs explained TF binding better than PMs. The learning and finding software are available online.
Researchers studied the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system in humans and chimpanzees, focusing on the adrenergic α2 receptor (AD2) gene, which is an inhibitory modulator of the sympathetic nervous system. They found that knockout mice lacking this gene exhibit physiological and behavioral changes associated with the fight-or-flight response, suggesting its importance in regulating stress response. The gene's expression is lower in humans and chimpanzees compared to other primates. Using 3D chromatin structure, they identified a regulatory region with accelerated DNA sequences in humans and chimpanze, with active histone marks in rhes macaque but repressive marks in humans. This region contains neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRS) motifs, with polymorphisms, one of which is fixed in humans and chimpanze but not bonob, while the other is present in macques. CRISPR/Cas editing and reporter assays showed the derived nucleotides repress AD2 by increasing NRS binding. Signatures of recent selection for lower AD2 expression in humans were also detected. The study used transcriptomic, epigenomic, and genomic data to identify regulatory variants responsible for human-chimpanzee repression of inhibitory modulator of sympathetic activity. One variant may have arisen recently and fixed in humans and chimpanze, while the other is present in macques. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing data showed active marks in macques but absent in chimpanze. Different mechanisms of repression, H3me versus methylation, were found in humans and chimpanze. Two segregating variants in humans reflect positive selection for lower AD2 expression. The study pinpointed cis-regulatory regions contributing to human-chimpanzee repression of AD2, including a topologically associating domain harboring AD2, with 12 DHS connected to the promoter. Derived sequences are fixed in humans and chimpan, with acceleration in lineage.
Researchers have studied the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, a complex trait that allows plants to increase productivity by 50% in tropical and subtropical areas. This trait has evolved independently in at least 60 lineages of monocots and dicots. To understand how these lineages use the same genetic networks for C4 photosynthesis, scientists developed a new framework to compare gene expression in species lacking reference genomes. They compared gene expression in two independent C lineages, Cleomeandra and Zea mays, which diverged 140 million years ago. A cohort of 3,335 genes represent conserved in leaf and photosynthetic development in these species. Genes encoding C cycle are recruited into networks related to photosynthesis. Despite wide separation and independent origins of C phenotype, species use homolog transcription factors to induce C photosynthesis and maintain specific expression for pathway. A molecular signature is shared by angiosperms derived from common ancestor of monocots and dicots. Deep comparisons reveal insight into convergence of complex phenotypes and parallel evolution of transactors underpinning C photosynthesis. Exploiting natural variation can identify regulators and shared by C lineages, targets for engineering C pathway in C crops like rice.
During the 2013-2016 Ebola virus (EBO) epidemic in West Africa, the virus spread to Europe and North America, infecting several healthcare workers. To understand how the virus behaves in the body and how it's transmitted between people, researchers studied a healthcare worker infected with EBO in Sierra Leone who was hospitalized in Italy. They collected samples from the worker's upper and lower respiratory tract and plasma over time to see if the virus was still present. The study found that the virus RNA, a sign of the virus, was still present in the lower respiratory tract even after it was cleared from the blood, suggesting it might be replicating. This study aims to understand how EBO spreads and develop ways to stop it. 

The researchers compared levels of EBO RNA in the worker's respiratory and blood samples to see if the virus was replicating. They found the virus RNA levels decreased over time in blood, but not in respiratory samples. This suggests the virus might be stable in the respiratory tract, not just lingering. The presence of RNA in respiratory samples until day 9 and 10 supports replication, not just stability. The virus was detected in respiratory but not blood from day 5, with RNA still in respiratory until day 10, indicating replication in lung tissue. A previous study showed EBO replicates in human airways, with virus in lung tissues and macrophages.
Researchers studied the Machupo virus (MAC), a New Worldnavirus that causes Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, and its relative Jun virus (JUN), which causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever. They created a recombinant chimeric virus (rMAC/Cd1-G) that expresses the glycoprotein from the Candid1 (Cd1) strain of JUN and found it to be attenuated in a murine model, protecting animals from lethal challenge with MAC. However, a single mutation in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the glycoprotein, equivalent to the attenuating mutation in Cd1, was not sufficient to fully attenuate JUN. To investigate the role of different domains of Cd1 glycoprotein in attenuation, they created several rMACs expressing the ectomain glyprotein from Cd1 alone (MC1), with the TMD substitution (MC2), or the T of Cd1 (3). All rMAC exhibited similar growth in cultured cells. In mice, MC1 showed significant reduction in lethality compared to rMAC. MC was detected in brains and spleens of MC-infected mice, associated with tissue inflammation. On the other hand, animals survived MC and MC3 infection without detectable virus in organs, producing neutralizing antibodies against Cd. The study suggests the indispensable role of each glycoprotein domain in full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMAC/C1-G.
Researchers studied a protein called centromere histone 3 (CH3) that plays a crucial role in separating chromosomes during cell division in plants. To understand how CH3 works, they created mutant versions of the protein with single amino acid changes in its structure. Some of these mutant plants looked normal and fertile when self-poll, but produced abnormal offspring when crossed with normal plants. This is similar to what happens when CH3 from different species are combined. They found that a single mutation can create a "haploid inducer", a plant that produces offspring with only one set of chromosomes. This can be used to identify haploid inducers in crop species. They tested this by finding a mutation in CH3 in a plant and found it produced haploids when crossed with normal plants.
Researchers have investigated the role of alternative splicing in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into cardiac precursors. They modified the H9 hESC line to allow for the selection of pluripotent ESCs by neomycin resistance and cardiac progenitors by puromycin resistance. Exon microarray expression data from undifferentiated ESCs and cardiac and neural precursors were used to identify isoforms with cardiac-restricted or common/neural differentiation patterns. Splice events corresponded to pathways of cytoskeletal remodeling, RNA splicing, muscle specification, and cell cycle control as well as genes with ser/threon kinase and helase activity. A new program, AltAnalyze, was used to identify changes in protein and microRNA site architecture that affect function and expression. Enriched isoforms oppose cell arrest in ESCs and promote signaling and development in cardiac precursors. Genome-wide predictions combined with new annotations suggest mechanisms that influence commitment and maintenance at the level of isoforms and micro regulation.
Researchers have identified trehal-6-phosphate (TP) as a potential target for developing antimicrobials against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. They created a mutant of M. tuberculosis that allows for the regulated silencing of the TP phosphatase gene oB, which is involved in trehal biosynthesis. The study found that oB is essential for the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro and during the acute phase of infection in mice, but not during the chronic phase. This suggests that trehal metabolism is remodeled during infection. Blocking oB led to the accumulation of TP, which is toxic to cells, causing self-poison. Blocking TP production in a mutant abrogated oB essentiality. TP accumulation upregulated over 800 genes, possibly due to increased RNA stability and ribonuclease activity. A genome screen for synthetic interactions with oA identified potential targets for combination therapies to minimize resistance to oB inhibitors.
Researchers have identified Trypanosoma cruzi proline racemase (TPR) as a potential target for new treatments for Chagas disease, a life-threatening illness affecting 11-18 million people. Current treatments have poor efficacy and safety profiles. Studies suggest TPR's conformation changes when binding to a substrate expose residues that trigger a host immune response, contributing to parasite persistence. To understand these changes, researchers used accelerated molecular dynamics to simulate long-time motions, inaccessible by standard simulations. They found potential conformation epitopes near newly identified binding pockets and open TPR conformations. This study advances understanding of TPR function and provides insights for structure-based drug discovery. 

A crystal structure of TPR with pyr-carboxylic acid was used to build a model. Initial coordinates were obtained by removing inhibitors. Residues like Arg and Lys were protonated, acidic like Asp and Glu deprotonated. This suggests TPR is a promising target for therapies. Ligand-induced conformation changes in TPR expose critical residues for host response. Two TPR structures are available. Accelerated dynamics extended simulation time, combined with sequence and fragment analysis, indicate mitogenic properties of TPR are associated with conformation epitopes around unidentified pockets. This study shows a model of open TPR through molecular simulation. Results suggest mitogenic of TPR may be associated with conformation epitopes around newly identified pockets.
Researchers have developed a new method to turn genes on and off at will in mice, called the inducible knockout (iKO) system. This system uses two genetically modified mouse lines: a knockout (KO) line with a tetracycline-dependent transactivator replacing the target gene, and a line with tetrcline-inducible cDNA of the gene inserted into a tightly regulated (TRE) genomic locus, providing low expression and high inducibility. The KO and TRE lines have been engineered for high-throughput, large-scale and cost-effective production of iKO mice. As a proof of concept, the system was applied to the apolipoprotein (Apo) gene, allowing sensitive and quantitative phenotypic analyses. Results showed reversible switching of Apo transcription, cholesterol levels, and atherosclerosis progression and regression. The i system demonstrates stringent regulation and versatility, easily incorporating other techniques and adapting to a wide range of applications.

The iKO system is a binary approach based on Tet-dependent technology, complementing existing inducible expression methods. It provides advantages over tamoxifen-dependent CreERT recombination, which is irreversible and tamoxifen inducibility throughout the body has not been demonstrated, and Cre/lox recombination efficiency. The design enables streamlined production of KO and TRE mice, generating iKOs for multiple genes in a cost-effective manner. KO and TRE lines can be engineered independently combined, making various applications possible. Two genetically modified strains are created: a KO line with Tet transactivator inserted into target gene, inactivating it, and a line with Tet-inducible cDNA of gene inserted into TRE locus, providing low expression and inducibility. The KO can be generated via homologous recombination or insertional mutagenesis.
Researchers studied the genetic response of the placenta to Trypanosoma cruzi infection in mice, a parasite that can be transmitted from mother to fetus during pregnancy. They infected mice with two different strains of the parasite, K and V, and analyzed the genetic changes in the placenta using a technique called microarray. The results showed that the placenta responded differently to each strain, with some genes related to immune response and inflammation increased in V, but decreased in K. The study also found that the V strain was more likely to infect the placenta, with parasite DNA and RNA detected. This is the first study to describe the genetic response of the placenta to Tryosoma cruzi in mice and suggests that the immune response to the parasite depends on the type of parasite, which may help prevent congenital transmission. The placenta is a complex environment where mother and fetus interact, and infection adds complexity by altering immune circuits. The study used a combination of transcriptomics and network analysis to highlight differences between responses to the two parasite strains, K and V, a non-lethalotropic and V, isolated from a human case of congenital infection. The goal was to understand the role of Tryosoma cruz genotypes in pregnancy and congenital infection, as little is known about the placental response to the parasite. The study found that the placenta responded differently to each strain, with some genes related to immune response and inflammation increased in V, but decreased in K, and that V was more likely to infect the placenta, with parasite DNA and RNA detected.
Sindbis virus (SINV) polyarthritis, also known as Ockbo disease in Sweden and Pog disease in Finland, has been recognized in northern Europe for about 50 years. The virus is mainly found in tropical and subtropical countries, but causes recurring outbreaks in northern Europe. A seven-year cycle of SINV outbreaks has been reported, but only based on human cases. To find a more objective signal, mosquito and SINV prevalence in vectors were evaluated in an endemic area in Sweden. Mosquitoes were collected in the Riveräl floodplains in 2000, 2001, and 2002, and assayed for virus on cell culture. Obtained isolates were sequenced and nucleotide sequences analyzed using Bayesian clade and joining analysis. One SINV strain was found in 2001, four in 200, and 15 in 200, with increased rates in both enzoot and bridge vectors in 200. Maximum likelihood infection rates were 1.0/1000 in enz Cx torrentipiens and 0.62/100 in bridge A cinus in 200, compared to 0.9/100 and 0/100 in 1 and 0/100 and 0.32 in 200. Sequence analysis showed all isolates belonged to SINV I (S-I). Genetic analysis revealed four S-I clades in Riveräl floodplains over years. Increased S-I in vectors constitutes a valuable marker for scrutinizing hypothesized seven-year S-I outbreaks and mechanisms.
Researchers studied how the locust's olfactory system, which transforms dense, synchronized signals from the antennal lobe (AL) into a sparse representation in the mushroom body (MB), a region associated with memory. They recorded from Kenyon cells (KC) in the MB and found that only a few KCs responded reliably to specific odors, with different odors inducing different responses in different KCs. The study explored a biologically plausible model that synaptic plasticity controls weights to ensure KC's specificity to familiar odors. They found that plasticity at AL-MB synapses efficiently regulated tuning, filtering AL's oscillatory output to a sparse in MB representation. Activity-dependent plasticity drove specificity, reliability, and persistence of odor representations, suggesting a role in processing and making testable predictions about plasticity at AL-MB synapses.

The locust's olfactory system is a favorable model for studying neural codes and plasticity due to its simplicity and well-characterized spatio-temporal input to the MB. PNs of the AL are the only source of olfactory information to the MB. The study focused on effects of plasticity at synapses PNs to KC in the calyx. This is consistent with recent results supporting pre-synaptic plasticity between KC and MB neurons as critical in olfactory memory. Intracellular recordings revealed synapses from KC onto targets undergo STDP on a/−25 timescale.

The locust is ideal to study the interaction of coding strategies with plasticity and learning due to known circuitry, architecture, properties of ensembles, and their role in perception. In the AL, oscillatory synchronization is a feature of population coding during odor presentation, transient ensembles are formed and participate in encoding.
Researchers conducted the Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene (ST) study to identify genes associated with the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). They analyzed transcription profiles of liver, skeletal muscle, and fat tissues from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, and found 60 clusters of genes related to atherosclerosis. Two clusters, one from atherosclerotic arterial wall and visceral fat, differed in the extent of coronary stenosis. These associations were validated by analyzing carotid atheros expression profiles. One cluster related to carot stenosis and 27 genes to coronary stenosis were confirmed. Genes in the transendothelial migration of leukocytes (TE) pathway were overrepresented in all clusters, referred to as the atherosclerosis module (A). The A-module was found to be enriched with CAD risk 1.8-fold. Transcription-factor LIM binding 2 (L2) was identified as a potential regulator of A, supported by subnetwork analysis and expression of 13 TE genes in L2-deficient arterial. The A-module appears to be important for atherosclerosis and L2 merits attention in CAD research.
Researchers studied the molecular mechanisms of the circadian clock in the cyanobacterium Synechoccus, focusing on the KaiC protein, a central component of the clock. They found that KaiC is involved in both activating and repressing its own transcription. Over 24 hours, KaiC undergoes different phosphorylation states, but it was unclear which state promotes transcription activation and which repression. The researchers analyzed various combinations of positive and negative transcriptional regulation using a model that considers four phosphorylation states of Kai and transcriptional/translational feedback. They found a two-loop mechanism that reproduces experimental observations, including effects of knocking out or overexpressing Kai genes. Phosphorylated KaiC activates and unphosphorylated Kai suppresses Kai transcription. The model suggests the ratio of positive and negative components of Kai expression determines how the two-loop responds to removal or overexpression of Kai genes. This model and future experiments could reveal how the circadian pathways allow Kai to control rhythmically regulate genes in the cyanobacterial genome.
Researchers investigated the characteristics of HIV-2 reservoirs in individuals with non-progressing HIV-2 infection. They found that HIV-2 was undetectable in monocytes and quantifiable in transitional-memory CD4 T cells (TCM) in some individuals, but not in central-memory CD4 T cells (TCM). HIV-2 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) correlated with those in TCM, but not TC. HIV reactivation was observed in cells from only 3 individuals. The CCR5 co-receptor was similarly distributed in cell populations from individuals and donors, but TC had lower expression of CXCR transcripts and higher of TRIM transcripts. These findings suggest HIV-2 reservoirs differ from HIV-1 by lack of monocytic infection and limited TC infection associated with lower CXCR expression and higher TRIM. This sheds light on the low pathogenicity of HIV-2 infection, similar to other attenuated HIV/SIV models. The study characterized HIV-2 peripheral cell reservoirs in individuals with poorly productive HIV-2 infection and slow disease progression. HIV-2 was undetect in monocytes and quantifiable in TCM from some individuals, but not TC. HIV- levels in PBMC correlated with TCM, not TC. HIV reactivation was observed in cells from 3. CCR coceptor was similarly distributed, but TC had lower CXCR and higher TR transcripts.
Researchers have developed a new model called the Attention Routing Circuit (ARC) that explains how selective attention affects the activity of neurons in the brain's visual cortex. This model is unique because it can reproduce a wide range of attention effects and is based on individual spiking neurons, which are the basic building blocks of the brain's neural networks. The model shows that attention only affects how neurons respond to spatial information, not other features like color or shape. It also suggests that different attention effects are caused by a single mechanism, not separate processes. This is supported by data from studies on macaque monkeys and makes specific predictions that can be tested. 

The ARC model overcomes past limitations by providing a unified explanation of attention effects, being implemented in spiking neurons, and comparing to physiological data, and making testable predictions. It describes attention as a process that routes information in the brain's hierarchy. The model predicts that more neurons in higher areas are affected by attention, as they switch from default to selective states during demanding tasks.
Researchers investigated the genetic factors contributing to atrial fibrillation (AF), a common and debilitating heart rhythm disorder, using whole-exome sequencing data from a large community-based sample of 1,734 individuals with AF and 9,423 without AF from the Framingham Study, Cardiovascular Health Study, Atherosclerosis in Communities, and NHLBI-G Exome Sequencing Project. They analyzed results and examined genetic variation in 37 suspected AF genes in cases versus controls. The study found no significant associations between common or rare coding variants and AF, suggesting that large-effect coding variation is not the predominant mechanism underlying AF. A common missense variant in SYN2 was significantly associated with AF, but its causal relationship requires further evaluation. The study highlights the need for larger sample sizes or populations with large genetic effects to identify biologically meaningful variation underlying AF. AF is heritable, with one in four individuals having a first-degree relative with the condition, and current treatments have limited efficacy and adverse effects. Genome-wide studies have identified associated variants near channels, cardiac transcription factors, and other genes in AF, but causal genes remain unknown. Whole-exome sequencing may clarify genetic contributions to AF.
Between 1990 and 2011, a total of 121 cases of alveolar echoccosis (AE) were diagnosed in Poland, with 83.6% classified as confirmed, 16 as probable, and 22 as possible. The number of cases increased over the two decades, with a mean age at diagnosis of 47.7 years and a male to female ratio of 0.86:1. The disease was fatal in 19% of patients, with a mean age at death of 54.1 years. Aggregation of AE was found in 4 foci involving 9 patients, with 76 cases diagnosed in an advanced stage. The liver was the primary location in all cases, with 24.8% showing spread to other organs. 94 patients were treated with albendazole and 73 underwent surgery, including 15 liver transplants. The study confirms AE as an emerging disease in Poland, the 4th in Europe with over 120 cases, indicating a need for a national screening program in high-risk areas (northern Poland) and public awareness of E. multular and training of primary physicians for early detection.
Researchers studied how the zinc-sensing protein Zur in E. coli responds to changes in zinc availability at the molecular level. They solved the structure of zinc-loaded Zur bound to the PnuABC promoter and found that it represses gene expression by cooperative binding to adjacent dimers around the core of regulated promoters. Cooperativity requires a pair of salt bridges between Arg and Asp that connect independent dimers. Analysis revealed a new member of the regulon, plG, which is directly regulated by Zur in a zinc-dependent manner. The plG promoter forms complexes with one or two dimers with less cooperativity than other regulon promoters. In vitro binding affinity varies 10,000-fold across regulon promoters, and repression in vivo parallels this trend, with a 100-fold difference in transcript copy number between wild-type and Δzur strains. This suggests that the number of Fur dimers binding varies and the thermodynamics of Zur-DNA interactions correlate with physiological response at different promoters. The study supports the idea that thermodynamics of protein-DNA interactions control gene regulation and opens understanding how zinc and metal occupancy fine-tune stress expression across promoters.
Rift Valley fever (RV) is a zoonotic disease that affects livestock, causing high morbidity and mortality. In 2008-2009, a RV outbreak occurred in Madagascar, including the Anjoabe district in the highlands. An entomological surveys found no Aedes mosquitoes, the RV virus vector, and low mosquito abundance due to unfavorable climate conditions. No serological or virological signs of infection were found in wild mammals, suggesting no RV virus reservoir. However, three serological and virological follow-up in cattle showed RV circulation. To understand this, a spatial deterministic metapulation model combined with cattle trade network was designed to reproduce local conditions. Three scenarios were analyzed: (i) RV overwintering due to direct transmission between vemic cows, vectors absent during winter, (ii) low vector circulation due to residual population, no direct transmission, (iii) combination. Multi-inference resulted in model incorporating low vector transmission and direct between animals. Predictions reproduced observations, 84% attributed to vector, 16 to direct. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis. Interactions between agriculture, vector seasonality, and cattle practices are key to understanding RV circulation in Madagascar highlands.
Aedes albopictus, a highly invasive and aggressive daytime-biting mosquito, has been expanding its range and posing a major public health threat in the Indo-Pacific region. To understand its historical and contemporary movements, researchers analyzed 13 microsatellite loci from 911 individuals and mitochondrial COI sequences. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) was used to test competing invasion routes of Ae. albict in the Southeast Asian-Australian region. The results show Ae. albict was introduced to New Guinea via mainland Asia, colonizing the Solomon Islands via Papua New Guinea or Asia, and the recent incursion into northern Australia's Torres Strait was seeded from Indonesia. A colonized population in the Torres Islands has undergone rapid genetic changes, possibly due to genetic drift or a secondary invasion from an unknown source. High genetic structure and gene flow exist between geographically distant populations, driven by human dispersal. This study provides a broader distribution of the species' range, revealing more spatial structure than previously shown. The invasion history of Ae. albict in the Australasian region was analyzed using ABC. Populations from the Indian Ocean, Fiji, Naur, and USA were not included due to insufficient sampling. COI and microsatellite loci were analyzed together using ABC in DIY 2.1.0. Populations from Naur, Torres Islands, Australia, and USA, and Asia were included to fit into a broader analysis. Previously developed microsat markers and COI were used to investigate Ae. albict's population in the Indo region. ABC was used to compare invasion scenarios in the Austral region and explore genetic structure of populations. Temporal structure was found in introduced Torres Island populations, demonstrating drastic changes in a short period. Established Ae. albict populations in the Indo region were also found.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Mwan Region, North-West Tanzania to investigate the effect of Schistosoma mansoni (S. mans) infection on morbidity in 572 school-aged children. The prevalence of S. mans infection was 58.7% with a mean intensity of 207.3 eggs per gram of feces. Most infections were light (56.5%), while 16.4% had heavy infections. Girls had higher mean intensities than boys (247.4 vs 153.2, p=0.004). 30.1% were anemic with no sex difference. Stunting and wasting were less than 10% of the population. No association was found between S mans prevalence or intensities and anthropometry, anemia, or spleen pathology. However, infected children had lower emotional quality of life scores (77.3 vs 82.7, p=0.033) and higher VO2 max (51.4 vs 50.8, p=0.042) than uninfected. In multivar regression, age, S mans infection, hemoglobin, and VO max were predictors of emotional quality of life, while predictors of VO max were physical quality, height, age, and hemoglobin. S mans was not retained in multivar regression on VO max. Only the emotional dimension of quality of life was associated with S mans infection.
Researchers compared the effectiveness of three routes of Leptira infection in rats: intraperitoneal, mucosal, and subcutaneous. Leptira is a zoonotic disease caused by a spirochete, with wild rodents, including brown rats, as reservoirs. Previous studies used intraperitoneal inoculation, but this is not a natural route. The study found that all three routes resulted in asymptomatic infection and similar antibody production. However, colonization rates differed: 8/8 for intraper, 5/8 for mucosal, and 1/8 for subaneous. Mucosal inoculation was more efficient for renal colonization and urinary excretion, while subaneous induced slower infection than intraper. This study helps understand infection modalities in rats, unlike epidemiological studies in wild rats. Future studies on natural routes will increase knowledge of rat-rat transmission and infection kinetics.
Researchers have identified a new role for Annexin A2 (An2) in regulating the body's response to sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by excessive inflammation, tissue damage, and organ dysfunction. In seps models, mice lacking An2 showed increased inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil infiltration, and decreased bacterial clearance, and survival. An2 deficiency also led to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) levels. Further investigation revealed that cysteine 9 of An2 is crucial for regulating ROS levels, which in turn affects IL-17 and inflammation. Depleting IL-17 via CRISPR/C9 strategy reduced inflammation and protected An2- mice from seps. This study reveals An2's previously unknown function in regulating seps through the An2-ROS-IL-17 axis, providing insights into the disease's pathophysiology. An2 acts as a putative ROS inhibitor in seps progression, with cystine 9 being key for oxidation, helping the body cope with the disease. An2 may mitigate seps severity by modulating ROS and IL-17 levels. Targeting neutils in seps may be a therapeutic approach, as An2-induced neutil infiltration contributes to severe and distant organ injury and mortality in seps mice. Additionally, IL-17 is regulated by ROS, with reduced inflammation after IL-17 knockdown.
Researchers investigated the role of microRNA-155 (miR-155) in the anti-HIV effects of Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation in macrophages. Macrophages play a key role in HIV pathogenesis and progression to AIDS. Polyinos-polycidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthetic analog of dsRNA, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), ligands for TLR3 and TLR4, respectively, decrease HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). However, the mechanisms are incompletely understood. The study found that poly I:C and L-stimulation of MDs abrogated infection by CCR-using, macroageotropic HIV-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudyped HIV-1 virions, while TLR, TLR or T9 agonists partially reduced infection to varying extent. Suppression of infection or lack did not correlate with differential effects on CD or CCR expression, type interferon induction, or pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Integrated viruses were detected in unstimulated TLR and T9-stimulated cells but not T3 or T4-stim MDs, suggesting alteration post-entry preintegration events. Microarray analysis and reverse transcription PCR found increased mi-155 levels in MDs upon T3 but not T-stimulation, and mi-155 inhibitor partially restored infectivity in poly I-stimulated MDs. Ectopic mi-155 diminished HIV-1 in primary MDs and cell lines. Poly I-stimulation and ectopic mi-155 resulted in accumulation late products and undetectable or low integrated viruses 2TR circles. Reduced mRNA and protein levels several HIV-1 factors involved trafficking/import preintegration (AD10, TN3, N153, LED/p75) found poly I-stim and mi-transfected MDs, reporter suggested authentic mi- targets.
Plants use daily light-dark cycles to control various physiological processes, including growth. In Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, hypocotyl growth rates are highest at different times of the day depending on external light and internal circadian rhythms. However, the interactions between light, circadian clock, and growth-promoting hormone pathways in growth are not well understood. Researchers analyzed the Arabidopsis seedling transcriptome under multiple growth conditions and mutant backgrounds using microarrays to determine the transcriptional component associated with rhythmic growth. A group of hormone-associated genes are co-expressed when hypocotyl growth is maximal, correlating with overrepresentation of a cis-element (CAT) in hormone promoters, sufficient to confer diurnal and circadian patterns in vivo. Circadian and light mutants show both internal hormone signaling and external coincidence with darkness are required for wild-type growth. The circadian clock controls growth by permissive of hormone levels at proper time, integrating pathways for seasonal growth regulation.
Researchers have explored a new approach to control Chagas disease vectors, such as Rhodnius prolix, by modifying the insect's gut microbiota to deliver molecules that induce RNA interference. They used Escheria coli to express dsRNA for the Rhodni heme-binding protein (RH) and catalase (CAT), which are essential for the insect's development and fecundity. The bacteria were fed to nymph and adult stages, and the results showed systemic and temporal RNA interference effects. Concentrations of E coli above 3.35 × 10^7 CF/mL produced significant RH and CAT gene knockdown in nymphs and adults. RH expression in the body was reduced by 99% three days after feeding, returning to normal levels 10 days later. CAT expression was reduced by 99% and 96 in the ovary and posteriorgut, respectively, five days after ingestion. Mortality increased 24-30% in first instars fed RH and CAT bacteria. Molting rates were reduced 100% in first and 80 in third instars fed RH or CATRNA. Oviposition was reduced 43% RH and 84 CAT. Embogenesis was arrested 16 RH and 20 of eggs. Feeding 105 CF/mL of natural symbion Rhodoccus rhodii expressing RH-specific RNA reduced RH by 89 and oviposition. Modifying the microbiota to induce RNA in R prolix may result in a paratgenic strategy for vector control.
A study was conducted to identify the causes of fever in pregnant women on the Thai-Burm border, where malaria was previously the leading cause of death in pregnant women in refugee camps in the 1980s. Artemisinin therapy reduced malaria incidence, but remaining causes of fever are not well-documented. Pregnant women attending antenatal care with routine malaria screening were invited for comprehensive clinical and laboratory screening if they had fever. Women were hospitalized and followed until delivery, with convalescent serum collected on day 21. Outcomes were recorded. Fever episodes occurred in 5.0% (409/8,117) of pregnant women from Jan-2004 to May-2006. Malaria was the main cause in 55.5% (227/409). A cohort of 203 (49.6%409) had fever investigations and follow-up. Arthrop-borne (malaria, ricketial infections, dengue and zoon disease leptpirosis) accounted for nearly half all febr illnesses 47.3 (96). Coinfection was observed 3.9 (8) mostly malaria ricketia. Pyonephritis 19.7 (40) was also common. Once malaria pyoneph and respiratory excluded, one-third febr infections were ricketia or leptpi. Scr and murine typhus were associated with poor outcomes including stillbirth and low birth. One died with no lab tests. Malaria remains leading cause fever in Thaiurm border. Scr and murine typh important causes poor outcomes. Fever pregnant Thaiurm not malaria pyone or respiratory should be treated with azithrom typh and leptpi.
Researchers investigated the relationship between maternal age and recombination in humans by analyzing over 600,000 genetic markers in 69 French-Canadian families. They found a significant decrease in recombination rates with advancing maternal age, driven by chromosome-specific effects, particularly in the middle sections of chromosomal arms and subtelomeric regions. This suggests that recombination may become less efficient in protecting against non-disjunction with age, contributing to higher aneuploidy rates in older women. The study proposes a model reconciling findings with associations between maternal age and recombination in trisomies. To further investigate, researchers genotyped individuals from 68 French-Canadian families and localized recombination events at high resolution. A genome-wide decrease in recombination rate was observed with advancing maternal age, consistent with previous studies. Chromosome-specific effects may determine the complex relationship between maternal and recombination, varying among populations due to genetic differences in regulating recombination machinery. Results support this hypothesis, with significant decay on nine chromosomes in the French-Canadian cohort and two in Hutter. Maternal age is a major factor in chromosomal aneupidy, but little is known about age-related non-disjunction causes. Recombination initiated during fetal development can still influence age. Not all trisomies are affected equally by maternal age, and mechanisms may not apply to anup conceptions. Data highlight distinct selective constraints on chromosomes influencing recombination over generations.
Researchers have developed a new approach to fight opportunistic infections in people with weakened immune systems by training their macrophages, a type of immune cell, to remember specific pathogens. Unlike traditional vaccines that rely on the adaptive immune system, this method induces an innate memory in macrophage that lasts for at least 70 days and provides complete protection against secondary infection without the need for adaptive cells. This was achieved by priming macroages with interferon-gamma (IF-γ) in vivo, a protein that activates the STAT1 pathway. RNA analysis showed rapid upregulation of IF-γ and STAT pathways following secondary challenge. The response was specific to the pathogen and correlated with changes in histone methylation and acetylation, and increased STAT binding to genes associated with anti-fungal immunity. The study demonstrates an alternative method to induce macroage memory in vivo that facilitates pathogen-specific vaccine responses.
Researchers studied how a group of proteins called Polycomb repressive complexes (PCs) regulate gene expression and development in plants. They found that different combinations of PC proteins work together to control different developmental programs, such as flower and embryo development, by modifying histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) tri-methylation. A key protein called CURLY LEAF (CL) plays a crucial role in repressing flower development in seedlings by associating with LIKE HETCHROMIN PROTEIN1 (LHP). In contrast, embryo development is repressed by PC-catalytic subunits AtBMI and AtRING in common with PC-catal enzymes CL and SWINGER (SW). The researchers used a new method to compare epigenomic data and found changes in H3me3 and gene expression in mutants of PC components in Arabidopsis seedlings. They found that different PC members regulate distinct developmental programs and their specificity is modulated by transcription factors, such as MADS and ABA. This study provides insights into how PC specificity is established in plants and how they regulate gene expression.
Researchers have studied the "trigger loop" (TL) of the RNA polymerase II enzyme in yeast, which plays a crucial role in substrate selection, catalysis, and translocation. They created nearly all possible single-residue variants of the TL and found three classes of mutations linked to transcription defects or stress, with distinct residue distributions. Disrupting an intra-TL hydrophobic pocket, proposed to destabilize a catalytically inactive TL state, showed consistent with increased catalysis. Genetic interactions among TL and TL-proximal residues support the contribution of funnel and bridge helices (BH) to TL dynamics. The study provides a high-resolution dissection of transcription mechanisms and evolution, applicable to other essential yeast proteins. 

The researchers assessed the functional contributions of all TL residues to fitness in yeast under multiple conditions, indicating intra-T interactions and TL with nearby domains (e.g. BH and funnel helices) are critical for TL function. Genetic and structural studies support a multi-step folding model for catalysis. Many gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) TL variants were identified, some predicted to confer epist interactions. TL's ability to fold into multiple conformations and convert between states is critical for its functions. Previous studies show TL is delicately balanced, perturbations result in increased or decreased catalytic activity and translocation.
Researchers investigated how rabies virus (RV) enters the central nervous system (CNS) of mice after infection. Typically, RV spreads through the nervous system from the site of infection to the CNS, but it's unclear if it can also enter through the bloodstream. They infected mice intramuscularly (i.m.) or intravenously (i.v.) with dog-associated RV (DOG) or silver-haired bat-associated RV (SB) to see if it could enter the CNS through the bloodstream. After i.m. infection, both strains caused lethal encephalopathy, but only i.v. infection with SB resulted in lethal infection. Immunohistochemistry showed i.v. administered SB directly infected the brain, specifically the hypothalamic nuclei connected to the pituitary gland. This suggests hematogenous spread can lead to fatal encephalopathy through the hypothalamus-pituitary interface. This alternative mode of spread has implications for post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies, particularly for silver bat-associated RV.
Researchers studied the evolutionary history of the H1N1 subtype of the influenza A virus, which has caused significant illness and death in humans since the 1918 pandemic. They analyzed 71 complete genome sequences of the virus from 1918 to 2006 and found that segment reassortment, or the swapping of genetic material between viruses, played a key role in the virus's evolution. Specifically, they found that an H1 virus from 1947 acquired new genes through reassort, which may explain its sudden change in severity. Similarly, the 195 epidemic may have been caused by reassorted H1 viruses. The study suggests reassort is more important in H1 evolution than previously thought. Reassort between viruses from different species can create pandemic viruses, such as the 1957 and 196 pandemics. The H1 genome showed congruent patterns, but distinct reassort events affected specific segments. The researchers analyzed 71 whole-genome sequences from 191 to 200, representing 17 countries and 5 continents. Few studies have looked at reassort in H1 viruses. H1 is thought to evolve slowly compared to H2, needing less frequent vaccine updates.
Researchers investigated how nicotine affects the brain's ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key region involved in reward and motivation, by stimulating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACh) and boosting dopamine (DA) output. The study aimed to determine whether nicotine's primary action is direct stimulation of DA cells through nCh activation or inhibition through desensitization of nCh on GABA interneurons. A computational model of V circuitry and nCh function showed that α2-containing nCh on DA or GABA cells mediate acute nicotine's effects, accounting for in vitro and in vivo data. The model predicted conditions for direct stimulation or inhibition to cause DA increases. Experiments were proposed to disentangle both mechanisms. Endogenous acetylcholine's rate crucially determines DA response for both mechanisms. Results suggest acetylcholine dependence for nicotine's rewarding properties. 

The study used a novel computational approach to model V's DA and GABA neurons and nCh responses, clarifying interplay of nicotine's pharmacodynamics and dopaminergic signal. Identified endogenous cholin input's low rate for direct stimulation and high for inhibition to observe DA increase, from α2 nCh activation and desensization. Experimental results supported GABA cells' role in nicotine action. A model with nCh dynamics captured in vitro modulation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to DA neurons. In vivo studies emphasized direct activation of β-containing nCh on DA neurons. The study clarified mechanisms linking nCh activation/desitization and DA control. A network model included affer and local V connectivity and nCh location/desit properties.
Researchers conducted a two-armed, randomized, double-blinded phase II trial in Kabul, Afghanistan to study a novel treatment for cutaneous leishmanias (CL) caused by Leishmania (L) trop infection. The study aimed to prevent superinfections, accelerate wound closure, and improve cosmetic outcome of CL. From 2004 to 2008, patients with CL were treated with bipolar-frequency electrocauter (EC) followed by moist-wound-treatment (MWT) with polyacrylate hydrogel (group I) or without (group II) pharmaceutical chlorite (DAC-055). Patients under 5, with facial lesions, pregnancy, or comorbidities were excluded. The primary outcome was time for complete epithelialization. Biops for parasitological and immunopath analyses were taken before EC, after wound closure, and after 6 months. The mean for complete closure was 59.1 days in group I and 54.2 days in II (p= 0.83). Leish-positive biops DAC-055 caused rapid epithialization 37.2 vs 58.3 days (p=0.08). Superfections occurred in both groups at 8.8%. Except one, recurrences 10.2 in I, 18.5 II (p=0.158) were in cases with high parasite loads after healing. DAC-055 showed leishicidal effect on amastigotes. Compared to intraional injections, EC plus M led to rapid closure and lower relapse rate.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosila cells to identify factors impacting RAS-MAP signaling. They found 101 validated hits, most of which were previously associated with the pathway. Epist experiments revealed new factors acting at different steps, including a protein modulating RAF activation. Unexpectedly, most hits worked downstream of ME and influenced MAP expression, mainly through constitutive splicing. Two members of this group were characterized and found to regulate MAP alternative splicing. This study provides a comprehensive view of factors modulating R-MAP signaling in Dila. It suggests pathway output relies not only on classical events like RAF activation, but also MAP regulation. Additionally, splicing components can impact alternative splicing.

The screen involved three steps: primary RNAi, validation, and secondary screens to establish regulatory position relative to pathway components. G-loaded R triggers sequential activation of RAF, ME, and MAP; RAF activates ME, which phosphorylates and activates MAP. Unlike RAF and ME, MAP has cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates, such as transcription factors c-Jun, c-Fos, p53, EL1, c-Myc, c-My, STAT3, SRF, and SM1/2/4.

Validated hits were submitted to secondary assays to position regulatory with core kinases. In addition to known components mediating R-induced MAP activation, the screen discovered new factors at different steps. Notably, five act upstream of RAF. Most hits, at R-RA and RAF-M, did not change R/MK components. However, some caused fluctuations in proteins or transcripts. These also impacted non-R related assays.
A study was conducted to investigate the genetic diversity of Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptoccus gattii isolates in Thailand. A total of 498 isolates were studied, with 386 from clinical and 112 from environmental and veterinary sources. The majority of isolates (68.9%) were from males with a mean age of 37.97 years, and 88.5% of Cryptoccus neoans and 37.5 of Cryptoccus gatt were from HIV patients. Molecular typing revealed that 94.8% of isolates were Cryptoccus neoans type V, regardless of source, followed by 2.4% type II, 0.2 type IV, 0.2 type I, and 2.4 type II. Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) analysis identified 20 sequence types (ST) in Thailand, with 30 for Cryptoccus gatt and 82, 83, 137, 141, 172, and 173 for Cryptoccus neoans unique to Thailand. Most Cryptoccus gatt isolates were ST7-VGb, identical to the virulent Vancouver outbreak strain, indicating Thailand as a stepping stone for global spread. The study found greater diversity and range of molecular types amongst Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported.
Researchers studied the evolution of a specific type of transcription factor (TF) called C2-H2 zinc finger (CH-ZF) in 12 Drosoph species over 45 million years. They found that a significant fraction of CH-Z 1-1 orthologs in flies have variations that affect their DNA-binding specificities. In addition to losing or gaining CH-Z domains, they discovered diverging DNA-contact residues in 44% of domains between D melanogaster and other species. These diverging residues, found in 70% of D melanaster CH-Z genes and 26% of all melan TFs, show evidence of constraint, being conserved across phylogenetic clades and evolving slower than other residues. These variations were rarely found as polymorphisms in a D melanaster population, indicating rapid fixation. The specificities of these domains change gradually across phylogen distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence. Proteins with conserved CH domains are enriched in developmental functions, while those with varying domains show no enrichments. The study suggests a subset of dynamic and understudied TFs are a source of variation in Dophila and metazoa.
Researchers have developed a new PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay to identify and differentiate between two types of Salmonella bacteria, Typhi and Paraty A, which cause typhoid and paratyphoid fevers. These bacteria can be difficult to diagnose due to a lack of typing sera and sometimes requiring culture. The new assay uses a repeated DNA sequence called CRIS (clustered regularly interspaced palindrom repeats) as a target, which is specific to each serotype. The researchers tested the assay on 188 Typhi and 74 Paraty A strains from diverse origins and time periods, and 70 strains of other bacteria, including 29 Salmonella and 38 other species. The results showed 100% sensitivity and specificity, meaning it can accurately detect and distinguish between the two serotypes. The assay can be used with DNA from cultured isolates, and with modifications, the CRPR target can be used for clinical samples. This can facilitate rapid and accurate identification in clinical and public laboratories with PCR access.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch signaling in the differentiation of CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) cells during infection with the parasite Leishmania major. Notch receptors Not1 and Not2 are expressed on CD4 T cells, but their role in Th1 differentiation is not well understood. Mice with specific deletion of Not1 and Not2 (NNΔ4CDCre) on a C57/6 background developed unhealing lesions and uncontrolled parasitemia due to impaired IFγ secretion by CD4 T cells and increased IL-5 and IL-13 cytokines. In contrast, mice with single deletion of Not1 or Not were resistant to infection and developed a Th1 response. Notch signaling is required for IFγ secretion by Th cells, independent of CSL/RBPκ, the major effector of Notch. Mice with RBPκ deletion in T cells were able to develop IFγ-secre Th cells, kill parasites and heal lesions. The study shows a crucial role for RBP-independent Notch in Th1 differentiation following L major infection.
Researchers investigated whether infection with the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni increases susceptibility to HIV infection in rhes macaques. The study found that animals infected with the worm were more likely to become infected with the AIDS virus after exposure, even at lower doses that were not enough to infect uninfected animals. In fact, the amount of virus needed to cause infection was 17 times lower in infected animals compared to controls. Infected animals also had higher levels of the virus in their blood and increased viral replication in immune cells. This suggests that controlling parasitic infections may help reduce the spread of HIV in areas where both are common.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study how the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) affects neural activity in the brain's cortex, specifically during sleep and wakefulness. Acetylcholine is known to regulate neural excitability and is involved in sleep regulation. The model shows how changes in neural excitability and network structure create three distinct patterns: localized, asynchronous, traveling, and synchronous. These patterns match those observed in brain activity during slow wave sleep (SWS) and REM or waking states. During WS, traveling patterns occur in the cortex, while in other states, stationary patterns do. The model consists of Hodgkin-Hux type neurons with M-current regulated by ACh. ACh regulation can account for dynamical changes between regimes. Reducing the magnitude of this current recreates reduction in spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) and shift in phase response curve (RC) observed with ACh. When FA is minimal (waking or REM state, high ACh), patterns are localized and easily pinned by network inhomogeneities. When FA is present (decreasing A), traveling activity arises. Further decrease in A leads to high synchrony within waves. ACh also determines network sensitivity to synaptic heterogeneity. These regimes may have functional significance: stationary patterns may encode external input as memory, while traveling could lead to synaptic regularization.
Researchers investigated the impact of mutations in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway on the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a type of cancer that occurs in the esophagus. They found that non-synonymous mutations in the TLR pathway were present in 14.6% of 171 EAC samples, with TLR4 being the most frequently mutated gene with 5.8% of samples. These mutations were associated with more proximal and metastatic disease, indicating potential clinical significance. The study also found TLR mutations in other solid tumors exposed to microbiomes, including colorectal adenocarcin, stomach adenocarcin, uterine endrioid carcinoma, and cutaneous melanoma. TLR mutants showed impaired reactivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, suggesting a possible role in disease pathogenesis in a subset of patients.
Researchers investigated the development of taste cells in mice using a novel approach combining in silico and in vivo analyses. They found that taste receptor molecules (TRMs) colocalized in the developing circumvallate papillae (CVP) and analyzed the regulatory regions of TRMs to identify a common network. This led to the identification of Hes as a likely regulatory factor, which was further examined in vivo. Expression analyses showed decreased nuclear H1 correlated with type II taste cell markers. After E18, CVP of H1-/- mutants had 5-fold more TRM-immunactive cells than wild-type littermates. The study suggests H1 plays a role in orchestrating taste cell differentiation in developing buds.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between ethylene and auxin in rice seedling root elongation, a process crucial for plant growth and development. Unlike the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis, the interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice is not well understood. The study found that the activation of OsIL on the expression of YUC8/IN and indole-3-pyric acid (IPA)-dependent auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation. Using a YUC inhibitor, which regulates auxin biosynthesis by converting IPA to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), they showed that ethylene-inhibited primary root elong is dependent on Y-based auxin biosynthesis. A rice mutant, rein-1, insensitive to ethylene, was identified with Y8IN truncated at its C-terminus. Mutation in YIN reduced auxin biosynthesis in rice, while overexpression of YIN enhanced ethylene sensitivity in roots. YIN catalyzed the conversion of IPA to IAA, and a truncated version of YIN resulted in reduced enzymatic activity, indicating YIN is required for IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis and eth-inhibited elong in rice seedlings. Further, eth induced YIN expression and promoted auxin accumulation in roots. Low concentrations of IAA rescued the eth response in rein-1, demonstrating eth-in elong depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis. Genetic studies revealed YIN-mediated aux biosynthesis functions downstream of OsIL, which directly activates YIN expression. The findings reveal a model of interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice seedling root elong, enhancing understanding of eth signaling in rice.
A nationwide epidemiological study in Saudi Arabia investigated the trend of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NT) diseases, which are reportedly increasing globally. The study collected 527 isolates over 24 months and identified 34 NT species, including 17 rare ones, with M. simiae (22.6%), M. fortuitum (18.1%), and M. absus (17.8%) being predominant. New cases of M. riyense, a rare species, were also found. The study showed rare events like mycobacteremia, abscess, peritonitis, and ascites caused by M. woli, M. hatic, M. duii, and M. monence. Diabetes and previous tuberculosis history were risk factors associated with NT diseases. NT disease and pathogen diversity pose a challenge to the nation, including Saudi Arabia. A plan for mycobacterial control and management should be developed urgently.
Researchers studied how yeast cells enter a state of dormancy, called quiescence, in response to starvation, and how it affects their lifespan. They screened a library of yeast genes involved in signaling and found that Rim15, Mck, and Yak1 kinases, the SNF/AMP complex, cell integrity pathway, and cell cycle regulators are necessary for quies establishment and lifespan extension. Quies requires integration of signals from multiple pathways. The lifespan of mutants and single, double, and triple mutants of Rim, Yak, and Mck correlates with carbohydrate accumulation, not cell cycle status. Removing glycogen and trehalose biosynthesis genes severely reduces lifespan. Overexpressing glycogen and trehal or supplementing treose improves lifespan in mutants. Yak, Rim, and Mck kinases control reactive oxygen species and mediate TOR-regulated carbohydrate accumulation and lifespan. The study suggests that energy storage and antioxidant systems are coordinated by Yak, Rim, and Mck to ensure quies and lifespan.
Researchers have discovered that the influenza A virus's hemagglutinin (HA) protein undergoes glycosylation, or the addition of sugar molecules, to compensate for fitness defects caused by mutations that allow the virus to evade antibodies. This process, called antigenic drift, enables the virus to persist in human populations despite widespread immunity. The study used a method called primer error-correct viral sequencing to reveal this unexpected role of glycosylation in increasing the virus's ability to bind to host cells. Mutations that added N-linked glycans to the HA's globular domain allowed the virus to rapidly propagate in the absence of antibodies. This finding expands understanding of viral mechanisms that maintain fitness during antigen evolution and highlights the power of high-definition virus sequencing to reveal new adaptive mechanisms. 

Glycosylation can play a role in antigen drift, increasing the fitness of escape variants by restoring HA interactions with receptors, even without antibody pressure. This may contribute to the accumulation of glycans in the globular domain during H1 and H3 virus circulation. The study demonstrates glycos can compensate for fitness costs imposed by escape substitutions on HA, increasing viability and emergence of antibody-escape variants. The virus may have evolved to maximize compensatory pathways during antigen drift.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of ventricular myocyte models to identify targets that exhibit favorable rate dependence, a property of antiarrhythmic drugs that could overcome the problems of reverse dependence. Reverse dependence is a property of antiarrhythmic drugs that prolongs the cardiac action potential (AP) and is more pronounced at slow heart rates, leading to reduced arrhythm suppression at fast rates and increased arrhythm risk at slow rates. The opposite, forward dependence would theoretically resolve these issues, yet forward dependent (FR) antiarrhythmics remain elusive. The study simulated populations of myocytes with varying properties and analyzed results statistically, predicting rate-dependent effects on multiple parameters. Average 40 parameters were tested in each model, and AP duration assessed at slow (0.2 Hz) and fast (2 Hz) rates. The analysis identified FR ionic perturbations and specific mechanisms, such as an increase in L-type current accompanied by indirect rate-dependent changes in delayed rectifier potassium current. Inward rectifier current and sodium-potassium pump were the most likely to produce FR AP prolongation. Statistical analysis showed models with minimal rate changes in AP have little FR potential, while those with large changes have considerable FR. This explains differences between species and ventricular types. The study provides insights into determinants of AP rate dependence and a strategy for beneficial antihythmic design.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the relationship between genetic variations in a person's DNA and their response to certain medications. They applied this method to thiopurine-methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme activity in patients treated with thiopine drugs. Thiopine is a medication used to treat certain conditions such as iron-deficiency anemia and diabetes. The researchers analyzed data from 442 patients at a French hospital between 2010 and 2013. They found that patients with high TPMT activity were more likely to have iron-deficiency anemia and diabetes. This suggests that thiopine may not be effective for these patients. The study used a new approach called Phen-Wide Association Studies (PAS) that combines medical diagnosis codes and test results to identify subgroups of patients who may need personalized treatment. This is the first study to use International Classification of Diseases 10th edition (ICD-10) codes, previously studies used International Classification of Diseases 9th edition (IC-9) codes. The results were validated by comparing with biological test results. This method can help identify patients who may not respond to thiopine and need alternative treatment.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies on stem cell transplantation in spinal cord injury found that allogenic stem cells improved motor function by 27.2% (95% CI 25.0-29.4) in 5,628 animals and sensory function by 26.3% (95 CI 7.9-44.7) in 473 animals. Autologous stem cells were not used in any studies. Different facets of stem cell biology, such as differentiation and delivery route, influenced sensory outcomes, with intravenous delivery showing better results. Stem cell implantation did not improve sensory outcomes in female animals and was enhanced by isoflurane anesthesia. A dose-response relationship supported biological plausibility. For motor outcomes, facets of stem biology had little effect, while heterogeneity was explained by experimental design and outcome measures. Location, injury method, and immunosuppression impacted results. Reporting bias was higher than in neuroscience but still suboptimal, with motor studies not reporting blinded outcomes giving inflated estimates. Efficacy may be lower than reported due to internal validity and publication bias.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the patterns and dynamics of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) reinfection after treatment. The review included 154 studies, with 51 providing STH rates pre- and post-treatment, and 42 reporting determinants of predisposition to reinfection. At 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, Ascaris lumbricoid prevalence reached 26%, 68%, and 94% of pretreatment levels, respectively. Trichuris trura reinfection prevalence were 36%, 67, and 82, and hookworm 30, 55, and 57. Prevalence and intensity of reinfection were correlated with pretreatment status. STH reinfections occurred rapidly after treatment, particularly for A. lumbricoid and T. trura. Frequent anthelmint drug administrations are needed to maximize preventive chemotherapy benefit. Integrated approaches emphasizing health and sanitation are required to interrupt transmission. The review suggests using egg reduction rate (ERR) rather than cure rate (CR) for anthelmint drug evaluations and studying reinfection after treatment. Intensity of infection was not well addressed in pooled estimates. Relationships between STH rein and socioeconomic factors were not definitively assessed. Analysis was performed by helmin species and follow-up intervals. Prevalence ratio (PRR) was used to estimate reinfection risk.
Researchers investigated the deregulation of metabolic processes in nonalcoholic liver disease (NAFLD) using a new method called Minimum Enrichment Analysis (MiA) applied to mouse and human omics data. NAD is a spectrum of diseases from simple steatosis to complex nonal steatohepatitis. Traditional pathway analysis requires predefined maps, which can be biased due to different annotations and cannot capture complex interactions. MiA generates minimal networks (Mi) of reactions for a target metabolite, applied to deregulated Mi in NAD phenotypes, such as fatty liver and inflammation in humans and mice. Key deregulations were found in cholesteryl ester, cholesterol, and hexadecate synthesis, and regulators of hydrogen peroxide synthesis differed between humans and mice. MiA identified general and specific characteristics of NAD phenotypes. This method is applicable to any genome-scale metabolic network and target metabolite, making it flexible for studying metabolism in any disease or organism.
Researchers studied how the olfactory system identifies odors and found that primacy coding, where the identity is encoded by the types of receptors that respond earliest, provides a compact and informative representation that can be efficiently interpreted by the brain. They analyzed a simple model of primacy using numerical and statistical simulations and showed that the encoded information depends on the number of receptor types in the prim representation but weakly on the size of the repertoire. The representation is independent of odor intensity and the information is useful for typical olfactory tasks close to experimentally measured. Interestingly, they found situations where a smaller repertoire is advantageous for discriminating odors. The model suggests overly sensitive receptors can dominate the response and make the array useless, allowing prediction of receptor adaptation to environmental changes. Primacy is more useful than binary and normalized coding because sparsity of representations is independent of odor statistics, unlike alternatives. It provides efficient representation independent of intensity and helps identify odors in olfactory cortex.
Researchers studied the neutralization profiles of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bnMA) against HIV, specifically PG9, PG16, PGT, and P152. They found that some bnMA displayed unusual neutralization profiles with non-sigmoid slopes and plateaus at less than 100% neutralization. The study aimed to determine the extent of non-sigmoid slopes and plateaus less than 100 for bnMA generally. Using a panel of 278 pseudoviruses in a CD4-T cell assay and 117 viruses in the TZ-bl assay, they found that bnMA targeting various epitopes of the spike had neutral profiles that plateaued at less than 90. Across both panels, bnMA targeting the V apex of Env and gp41 were most likely to show neutral curves that plateaued less than 100. Conversely, bnMA targeting high-mann epitopes were less likely to show this behavior. CD4 binding Abs also showed this behavior infrequently. The phenomenon of incomplete neutralization was observed in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell-grown virus panel from patient swarms. Additionally, five bnMA were compared against 18-virus of clones produced in 293 cells and PBs and assayed in TZ-bl. Examples of plateaus less 90 were seen with both types of virus with no consistent patterns. The study suggests that incomplete neutralization and nonigmoid neutral curves are possible for all bnMA against a range of viruses produced and assayed in cell and primary cells, with implications for use in therapy and vaccine design.
Researchers developed a computational model to study how cancer cells use glucose and glutamine to produce energy and biomass. They found that when glutamine levels are high, cells produce more lactate from glutamine instead of glucose, even in the presence of oxygen. This occurs when oxygen is not enough to fully oxidize carbon from glucose and glutamine. The model showed that this pattern is optimal for biomass and ATP production, requiring a branched TCA cycle and redox-controlled reactions. Experiments in a cancer cell line confirmed these findings, validating the model's predictions. This metabolic rewiring may occur in various tumor cells, suggesting competition between glucose and glutamine plays a role in cancer growth.
Researchers investigated the interactions of the prion protein (Pr) and its mammalian paralogs, Doppel (PrPnd) and Shadoo (Spr), in a cell culture model that allows prion replication. They found that the three proteins share a similar environment in neuroblastoma cells and interact with each other. Additionally, they confirmed interactions between Pr and the cell adhesion molecule laminin, Na+/K ATPases, and protein disulfide isomerases (PDI), reconciling previous findings. Experiments showed that Pr interactions with PDIs may occur outside the endoplasmic reticulum and play a previously unknown role in PrSc accumulation. A hypothesis proposes that Pr organizes its environment by binding adhesion molecules with immunoglobulin domains, recognizing oligann-bearing membrane proteins.
During influenza virus infection, the immune system typically responds with a type 1 inflammatory cytokine response, but type 2 cytokines are also produced. Type 2 cytokines are linked to asthma exacerbation, but may also provide protection. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a type 2 cytokine essential for eosinophil maturation and egress from the bone marrow. In a mouse model of influenza infection, IL-5 was released into the airways and eosin accumulated in the lungs, particularly after virus clearance. The source of IL-5 was group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC) in the infected lungs. IL-5 production by IL2 was enhanced by interaction with NKT cells and alveolar macrophages, which produce IL-33. This interaction led to abundant IL-5 production by IL2 and eosin accumulation in the lungs during recovery phase of infection.
Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (NT) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children and HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of NT disease in Asia are not well-documented. This study retrospectively identified 102 cases of NT infections in an infectious disease hospital in Southern Vietnam between 2008 and 2013. Clinical records were accessed to evaluate demographic and clinical factors associated with NT infection and identify risk factors with death. Multi-locus typing and antimicrobial testing was performed on all organisms. 71% of NT patients were HIV-infected, 90% were adults, 71 were male, and 33 reported intravenous use. 26/92 (28) patients had known outcome; HIV was associated with death (p=0.039). Enteridis Sequence (ST) 11 (43/89) and Typhimium (ST 19, 34, 44) (23/89) were most identified serovars. Tyim was more common in HIV-infected (p=0.003). Isolates from HIV-inf patients were more likely exhibit reduced susceptibility trimethoprim-sulfamox than HIV-negative (p=0.037). NT disease is severe in Vietnam with high mortality. In sub-Saharan, HIV was risk for death with majority burden in population HIV-inf adult.
Researchers have developed a method to identify viral and phage structural proteins using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These proteins are crucial for the survival and pathogenicity of viruses, and understanding their functions can aid in disease detection, diagnosis, vaccine development, and environmental impact on microbial communities. However, most phage ORFs (open reading frames) are dissimilar to known genes, making identification challenging. Traditional methods rely on sequence similarity, but structural proteins have low conservation, few conserved sites, and limited data. The researchers trained ANNs to classify structural proteins by amino acid frequency, achieving high specificity and sensitivity. They then added isoelectric point as a feature to classify major and tail proteins, increasing accuracy. Electron microscopy validated predicted proteins with no known similarities, self-assembling into virion structures. The ANNs are a new tool for identifying phage and prophage proteins difficult to detect by bioinformatic analysis. They will be valuable when propagation is not practical or possible.
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSH) is a cancer-causing virus with a large genome that encodes over 85 proteins, including unique and conserved herpesviral proteins. SH ORF20 is a member of the herpesiral UL24 family, but its function and role in the viral life cycle are not well understood. OR20 encodes three uncharacterized isoforms localized in the nuclei and nucleoli. Quantitative purification coupled to mass spectrometry (q-APMS) identified specific partners of OR20, including ribosomal and interferon-stimulated gene (IS) oligoadylate synthase-like (OL) protein. Both endogenous and transiently transfected OL co-immoprecipitated with OR20, conserved among OR isoforms and OR20 homologs of UL family in herpesviruses. Characterization of OL partners by-MS identified a similar interactome to OR20. Both OR20 and OL copurified with 40 and 60 ribosomal subunits, when coexpressed, associated polys. OR20 did not affect translation, but enhanced R-I expression of endogenous OL in IR3 but IFN-independent manner. OL has antiviral activity against some viruses, but role in gammaherpesviruses unknown. We show OL and OR20 expression induced after reactivation latently infected HuLT-rSH.219 cells. Intriguingly, OL enhanced KSH infection with OR20 mutant, however, OL-dependent infectivity lost.
A study was conducted to determine the prevalence and presentation of Lassa virus disease (LVD) in febrile children with and without convulsions in an endemic area of Nigeria. A total of 913 feile children aged 1-15 years were admitted to a hospital over a year. 373 (40.9%) had fever, of which 108 (29%) presented with convuls. The overall prevalence of LVD was 13/373 (3.5%; 95% CI 1.9, 5.7) in feile admissions, 3/108 (2.8%) in Cases and 10/265 (3.8) in Controls. Only vomiting and bleeding were significantly associated with increased prevalence of L. L is an important cause of undifferentiated fever in children in endemic areas but not associated with convuls in feile. Its prevalence and lack of clinical differentiation underscores importance of high suspicion in diagnosis. Screening feile with undifferent fever in endemic for L could be important public health measure.
Researchers investigated the role of the karri receptor K2 (KAR2) in drought resistance in Arabidopsis thalian, a model plant species. They found that mutations in the K2 gene, which encodes the karri receptor, make plants more sensitive to water deprivation. Analyzing K2 mutants, they discovered increased water loss and cell damage, enlarged stomatal apertures, and higher cuticular permeability. Additionally, K2 plants had reduced anthocyan biosynthesis during drought and were hypersensitive to abscisic acid (ABA) in stomatal and cotyledon assays. A genome-wide transcript analysis identified genes associated with these changes. The study suggests crosstalk between ABA and K2 signaling in drought responses. Comparing the strigact receptor mutant d14 to K2, strigactones also contribute to drought adaptation, but not through cuticle development. The findings indicate chemical or genetic manipulation of K2 and 14 may improve drought resistance.
Researchers have investigated the role of insulin signaling in the growth and development of Schistosoma japonicum, a parasite that causes schistosomiasis in humans. They focused on the insulin receptors (SIR) of S. japonicum, which they had previously cloned and characterized. They found that human insulin binds to a specific part of the IR, called the L subdomain, using a technique called biolayer interferometry. They then used a method called RNA interference (RNAi) to reduce the expression of IR in adult S. japon in a lab dish and found that this reduced the transcription of other genes involved in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism. They also observed a decrease in glucose uptake in the IR-knockdown worms compared to controls. In vaccine experiments, they found that the L sub of IR reduced growth, intestinal worm density and egg production in S. japon in mice with a low infection. These results suggest that the IR could be a target for a vaccine against schistosomiasis in China and the Philippines.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a significant cause of disability in the Pacific region, affecting over 96% of the 1.7 million population at risk of infection. Mass drug administration (MDA) has reduced lymphatic filariasis prevalence, but vector biology complicates the MDA strategy in some regions. The goal of LF elimination cannot be attained via MDA alone in some areas. Obligate mosquitoes provide targets for breaking the LF cycle, but existing methods are ineffective for controlling the primary vector, Aedes aegypti, in the South Pacific. Researchers demonstrate that interspecific hybridization and introgression results in A aedes aegypt strain (CP) stably infected with endosymbiotic Wolbachia from Aedes albopictus. The CP strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory assays show CP males are equally competitive, resulting in population elimination when introduced into wild Aedes aegpt populations. The findings demonstrate feasibility and encourage field tests of the vector strategy as a supplement to ongoing MDA efforts.
A study was conducted in Uram District, Tanzania to estimate the burden of Rhodesian trypanosomiasis (HAT) in terms of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and financial costs. Data from 143 patients admitted to Kali Health Centre in 2004 for HAT treatment was used. Direct and indirect costs incurred by patients and health services were calculated. DALs were estimated using the Global Burden Project methods and previous H estimates, assuming 45% under-reporting. The estimated DALs for H in Uram District with and without weighting were 215.7 (95% CI 155.3-287.5) and 281.6 (95% CI 209.1-362.6) respectively. When 45% underreporting was included, results were 622.5 (95 CI 155.3-109.9) and 978.9 (95 CI 201.1-187.8). The cost of treating 143 patients was estimated at $15,514, with patients paying $3,673 and services $11,841. Indirect non-medical costs for 143 patients were $9,781. The study shows H imposes a significant burden on rural communities in Tanzania, highlighting the need for location-specific estimates in countries with many infectious diseases concentrated in certain areas. 

The re-emergence of H in Uram continues to burden health systems and communities. Datasets combined with underreporting of T. rhodesense H in the district. The disease is neglected and not a priority in endemic districts. This is the first assessment of H for Tanzania and second for East Africa. Studies on other neglected zoonoses have been conducted, including brucellos, showing high impact on health and communities. Previous studies estimated Tanzania loses 10 million life years annually, four months per person. Families incur costs for H treatment. Underreporting in Uganda estimated 7 unreported for every 10 H, 12 undetected for every reported. HIV may have increased H burden in Tanzania. Some develop long-term complications. Household income and disease burden associated. A study suggests majority of rural population suffers combined diseases, socio-economic activities not provide basic needs.
Researchers studied mice with a genetic mutation in the Ngly gene, which codes for a de-glycosylating enzyme, and found that they were embryonically lethal. However, deleting the Eng gene, which codes for another de-glycosylating enzyme, partially rescued the lethality. This suggests that the lethality is related to the de-glycosylation function. The study also found that changing the genetic background of the mice from C57BL/6 to ICR partially rescued the lethality. Viable Ngly-deficient mice in C57/6 and ICR background showed severe symptoms similar to humans with Ng1-deficiency. Deleting Eng in C57/6 and ICR background suppressed the defects. The study suggests that Ng1 or Ng1/Eng-deficient mice could be a model for studying Ng1-deficiency and that cytoplasmic ENG is a potential therapeutic target.
Researchers studied how the gene expression of the hunchback (hb) gene in fruit flies (Drosophila) is controlled by a maternal gradient of the Boid (B) protein. They found that gene expression is subject to noise, or variability, which must be constrained for reproducible and coordinated events of development. They identified how noise is controlled by characterizing the dependence of hb mRNA and protein output on promoter structure and transcription dynamics. A model of the hb promoter was created, where the number and strength of B and hb self-regulatory binding sites can be varied. Parameters were fit to data from wild-type, self-regulatory mutant, and lacZ reporter constructs using different portions of the promoter. Results indicate that wild-type self-regulatory hb noise is dependent on transcription and translation dynamics, not B fluctuations. Constructs lacking self-regulation show that multiple B binding sites in the promoter play a role in buffering noise. The model is robust to variation in B binding site number across fly species. This study identifies how promoter structure and dynamics reduce noise, features common in many genes, such as multiple sites, cooperativity, and self-feedback, contributing to understanding of reproducibility and determinacy in early development.
Researchers have studied the level of Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans and found that selection appears to have removed Neander alleles from the population after hybridization. They developed a method to estimate the strength and density of selection against Neander ancestry and found that East Asians had higher levels of Neander ancestry than Europeans, even after accounting for selection. The majority of purifying selection against Neander is due to weakly deleterious alleles that were neutral in Neander but became selected against in humans due to larger population size. These alleles had a heavy genetic load on early human-Neander hybrids. The study suggests effective population size plays a significant role in shaping introgression levels, more than previously thought. 

The researchers used published estimates of Neander ancestry in humans and found that selection acted against autosomal Neander alleles in anatomically modern humans. Their method estimates the strength of genome-wide selection against introgression between populations, inspired by previous studies on selective sweeps and linked variation. The results show patterns of Neander ancestry in humans are consistent with purifying selection against weakly deleterious alleles. The bulk of selection against Neander may be due to accumulation of neutral alleles in Neander that became purged in humans due to larger population size. These alleles had a profound effect on Neander introgression levels. The study suggests differences in population size and neutral dynamics determine introgression levels across species and genome.
Researchers have studied how the HIV virus controls its own gene expression after it has integrated into a host cells' genome. They found that the virus can switch between an active and inactive state, and this switching may contribute to the formation of a latent state where the virus is not actively replicating. The HIV promoter, a region that controls gene expression, has two key elements, Sp1 and NF-κ, that recruit activating and repressing factors. The team mutated these elements to see how they affect viral expression and found that Sp1 stabilizes both active and inactive states, reducing noise in gene expression and histone acetylation and deacetylation. NF-κ elements also play a role, with κ site I being more important than site II, and Sp site recruits p300 and Rel to the promoter. Mutations in Sp sites increased the frequency of clonal bifcation, meaning the virus is more likely to switch between states. Each element contributes differently to regulation, with Sp1 reducing noise and modulating latency. These findings have implications for treating HIV latency.
Researchers compared the performance of 11 orthology projects and methods, including COG, KOG, Inparan, Ortho, Ensembl, Homologene, Round, EggNO, OMA, and two standard methods, bidirectional best and reciprocal distance, using phylogenetic and functional tests. The results showed that OMA and Homene performed best in phylogen and functional analysis with high specificity, while OrthoCL outperformed Ensembl and Inan at lower specificity but higher coverage. EggG provided large coverage for broad functional grouping but was not specific for phylogen or detailed analysis. The study found that Ensembl's complex reconciliation approach was outperformed by pairwise methods in phylogen tests, and bidirectional best-hit outperformed more complex algorithms. The study provides guidance for orthology users, introduces new methodology for verification, and sets standards for future approaches. In phylogen tests, OMA and Homene showed best performance, also in functional tests with high specificity. At lower specificity, OrthoCL outperformed Ensembl and Inan. Egg provided large coverage for coarse-grained functional categories. The study compared 11 projects on both phylogen and functional definitions, allowing objective comparison. OMA uses evolutionary distances, excluding pseudoorths, while Ensembl reconciles gene and species trees. Results showed trade-off, but Inan is no longer best, with other projects having higher specificity or sensitivity. Accurate orth prediction is crucial for applications, including annotation and phylogen analysis.
Researchers have developed a new approach to find treatments for schistosomiasis, a disease caused by parasitic worms infecting humans, where current treatments are failing due to resistance. They used a computational method called drug repurposing to identify new targets and drugs. This involved analyzing the kinases, proteins that play a crucial role in parasite's biological processes, and comparing them to human kinases to find unique targets. The study focused on Schistoma japonicum, and updated the kinomes of S mansoni and haematium, and compared them to human kin. This led to the identification of potential targets and approved drugs that could inhibit them, including bosutin, dasatin, imatinib, vandatin, saratin, and others. The study also suggested primary and secondary targets of these drugs in Schosoma, allowing for new therapeutics development.
Researchers studied the binding and folding of a protein called pID, a part of the transcription factor CREB, to another protein called KIX. They found that pID is unstructured when not bound to a target, but becomes structured upon binding. Simulations using a model predicted a coupled folding and binding mechanism, with partially bound intermediates. Analysis showed the transition state resembles the unstructured state in solution, meaning CREB becomes structured after committing to bind. The change in structure is similar to an induced mechanism, where the protein changes shape after binding, unlike models where pre-structured conformations exist in the unbound state. Increasing structure in unbound pID reduced binding rate, suggesting a "fly-casting" process. Including non-native interactions formed non-specific complexes that enhanced binding rate but didn't change mechanism. This study explains how unstructured proteins can be advantageous for target recognition. Simulations agree with a recent NMR study and aid interpreting binding kinetics.
A systematic review was conducted to analyze the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection in children in Latin America and the Caribbean countries (LAC) from 1942 to 2014. The study aimed to assess the progress towards the World Health Assembly's 2012 resolution to eliminate schistosomias by 2020. The review included 132 articles with 1242 prevalence and intensity data points, mostly from Brazil (69.7%). High prevalence and intensity were found in Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname, and Saint Lucia, requiring updated epidemiological status to redesign national programs. Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, and Puerto Rico may have interrupted transmission, but follow-up is needed to verify status. Heterogeneity in methodologies made cross-national comparisons difficult. The review recommends updating schosiasis status in historically endemic countries to address public health interventions and verify elimination. Improved monitoring and evaluation methodologies are needed, using WHO guidelines. Meeting the elimination goal requires additional epidemiological data by age and sex.
Researchers studied how HIV-1 is transmitted from one person to another through heterosexual contact. They analyzed 167 full-length HIV-1 genomes and created 40 infectious clones from 6 pairs of people who transmitted the virus to each other. The goal was to understand what makes HIV-1 more likely to be transmitted. They found that the virus selected during transmission, called the "transmitted founder" (TF), did not have increased ability to replicate or resist interferon-alpha (a protein that helps fight viruses) compared to non-transmitted variants from the same pair. In lab tests, TF did not show higher infectivity or replicative capacity in immune cells. Resistance to interferon-alpha was not different between TF and nonmitted variants. This suggests that in-host evolution of HIV in response to immune system reduces transmission potential. 

The researchers amplified and sequenced full HIV-1 genomes to see genetic changes during transmission. They cloned TF and nonmitted variants to assess in vitro fitness, including infectivity, antibody resistance, replicative capacity in immune cells, and interferon resistance. Previous studies were limited as only one gene was examined or nonmitted from partner was not available. This study generated full HIV-1 with proteins from both partners and evaluated genetic and phenotypic signatures during transmission. HIV transmission was not mediated by viruses with higher interferon resistance. Factors other than interferon resistance determined fitness in these pairs. Studies found subtype B and C TF were resistant to interferon-alpha compared to chronic variants from same individual. This suggested selection during transmission for escaping innate immunity, specifically interferon-alpha. This study compared TF to nonmitted from linked partners to understand HIV-1 requirements, potentially leading to new targets.
Researchers studied how filarial parasites affect the lymphatic system in the body. They found that even without an immune system, lymphatic dilation occurs in mouse models, but severe lymphedema and elephantiasis require an immune response in humans. They exposed human lymphatic cells to filarial antigens, live parasites, or infected serum and found that both live parasites and antigens induced cell growth and tube-like structures in vitro. Serum from infected patients and those with chronic lymphatic obstruction showed increased cell growth compared to uninfected individuals. Differentiation into tube networks was associated with increased metalloproteases and TIM inhibitors. Gene expression analysis showed filarial altered genes involved in cell organization and junctions, decreasing transport. The study suggests filarial induce lymphogenesis and provide insight into lymphatic pathology in filariasis.
Researchers have developed a new method to amplify DNA from a single bacterial cell using a microfluidic device with 60-nanliter reactions, called Multiple Displacement Amplification (DA). This method eliminates the need to culture the bacteria in a lab, as only a small fraction can be grown in a controlled environment. The device isolates individual Escherichia coli cells and amplifies their DNA, reducing nonspecific synthesis from contaminant DNA and primer interactions. The quality of the amplification was assessed by qPCR and compared to standard 50-microl volumes, showing favorable results. Amplification bias was greatly reduced in naniter volumes, providing a more even representation of all sequences. Single-cell amplicons from both microl and naniter volumes provided high-quality data by high-throughput pyrosequencing, demonstrating a straightforward route to sequencing from single cells.
Researchers studied the relationship between viruses from the Orthohant genus, which can cause disease in humans, and their hosts in the Atlantic Forest of South America. They found that rodents, specifically Sigmodontinae, are the main carriers of these viruses in tropical, savannas, and wetlands of South America. These rodents shed different viruses, such as the lethal Araraquohantavirus, and factors like population variation may influence virus transmission within and between populations. The researchers tested how landscape, particularly agricultural and forest remnants, affect the proportion of virus-carrying rodents in the Atlantic rodent community using 283 capture records and geographically weighted models. They found that virus-carry rodents were more influenced by landscape diversity than habitat or agricultural type. Small mammal diversity also positively influenced pathogenic virus-carry rodents, indicating habitat quality may be more important than competition with native species. Sugarc plantations increased rodent proportion, while defaunation did not correlate with pathogenic virus genotypes. The match between hotspots and human vulnerability was 17%, while coldspots 20%. The study shows strong land change influences virus hosts at the landscape level across the Forest. Findings suggest disease surveillance in southern and southeastern regions where high host and vulnerability match.
Researchers investigated the role of BCL family proteins in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, Dengue virus, and Zika virus. They found that the survival of infected cells depends on BCL, a pro-survival B2 protein, due to suppression of the expression of another pro-surival protein M1. Treatment with BCL inhibitors or deficient BCL gene expression induced BAX/BA-dependent apoptosis upon infection with flaviruses. Flivirus attenuated protein synthesis, leading to reduction of short-lived proteins like M1. Inhibition of BXL increased phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages, suppressing viral dissemination and chemokine production. The study also examined the role of BXL in death of JEV-infected cells in vivo. Deficiency of BXL and administration of BH mimetic compounds increased survival after J infection and suppressed inflammation. The results suggest BXL plays a crucial role in survival of cells with flaviruses, and BXL may be an antiviral target to suppress Flavidae viruses.
A study estimated the economic impact of canine rabies in Vietnam from 2005-2014, using data from interviews, literature, reports, and primary data collection. The total economic burden of rabies over the 10-year period was approximately $719 million, with the largest portion (92%) being post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) costs. Canine rabies resulted in 36,560 to 45,700 disability-adjusted life years (DALs) and 914 human deaths, with a mortality rate of 0.11 deaths per 100,000 people, lower than in other Asian countries. The cost per dog vaccinated was $1.75. Results indicate that rabies in Vietnam is consistent with the burden reported in Asia, with large expenditures on P and small investments in vaccination. The most effective control of canine rabies in humans is through public health campaigns preventing rabies rather than suppressing through P administration. The study found that 400,000 PEPs were administered annually during the period, and rab is endemic in the dog population with 100 human cases annually. The largest costs in Vietnam are associated with P and minimal with vaccination. Livestock losses are insignificant, but may impact individual producers regionally. Comparing prevention and control measures, Vietnam is consistent with other rab endemic countries in Asia, spending more on P than preventing through vaccination.
Researchers have studied the Type II Secretion System (TSS), a molecular machine that helps bacteria secrete folded proteins across their outer membrane. A key component of this system is the secretin, a multi-subunit outer membrane protein that forms a pore. They found three types of TSS can be distinguished by the characteristics of their secretin pores. By comparing two types, Klebsella and Vibrio, they discovered that a protein called pilot is needed for transport and assembly into the outer membrane. The researchers determined the structure of a novel pilot protein, Asp, from Vibrio cholera, and found it is functionally equivalent but structurally unrelated to pilots in Klebsella and other bacteria. Asp binds to a specific sequence in Vib-type secretins, enhancing secretin assembly, and is found in all Vibrio species and some Escherich and Shella with Vib-type TSS.
Researchers have identified a protein called Omp37 on the surface of Leptira bacteria that binds to human skin and vascular elastin, a protein found in skin and blood vessels. This binding is a crucial step in the bacteria's ability to infect the host and cause leptospirosis. The study found that Omp37 binds to elastin with high affinity, and also binds to other proteins such as fibrinogen, fibrinogen, fibronectin, and laminin. The binding to elastin is enhanced by antibodies produced by the host, suggesting that these antibodies may aid the bacteria's attachment to elastin-rich tissues. Omp37 is also recognized by antibodies from patients with leptpi and infected hamsters. The protein is found in pathogenic Leptira but not saprophytic Leira, indicating its role in infection. The researchers propose that Omp37 facilitates the bacteria's attachment to skin through its strong binding to elastin during the initial stage of infection. Leptiral lifecycle involves multiple interactions with host tissues, including entering, evading immune response, and adhering to tissues. Identifying proteins that mediate these interactions is key to understanding pathogenesis and developing diagnostic and protective antigens for leptpi.
Researchers have identified two antibodies, 4E and 2F, that can neutralize HIV-1 by binding to a specific regions on the virus's gp41 protein. These antibodies are polyreactive, meaning they bind to multiple epitopes on the viral membrane. A model was developed to calculate the probability of these antibodies disabling gp41 during the pre-fusion intermediate stage, when the epitopes are first exposed. The model shows that for these antibodies to be effective, the time to disable an epitope must be less than the time it remains in a stable conformation, about 5 minutes or less for 4 and 2.5. The study also investigated the role of avidity in neutralization and found that 2.5 IgG is more effective than its Fab fragment. This is due to 2.5 interacting more stably with the viral membrane. The model was extended to analyze neutralization data and predicts dependencies on antibody binding rate, fusion rate of gp41, and number of gp bridges at the start of pre-fusion. Analysis indicates a small number of gp bridges must be disabled to prevent fusion, but the exact number cannot be determined from experiments alone.
Researchers conducted a study in Mali and Senegal to determine if mass treatment with ivermectin could eliminate onchercias in areas where the disease is highly prevalent. The study involved 15-17 years of annual six-monthly ivermect treatment in three highly endemic areas and monitored infection and transmission levels for 5 years after the last treatment. Skin surveys were conducted in 131 villages, examining 29,753 people and analyzing 49,600 blackflies for Onchocerca volulus larvae. Results showed a decline in infection and transmission levels after treatment, with two areas reaching zero microfilar and vector infectivity within 3-4 years. In the third area with high pre-treatment levels, infection and transmission decreased to low levels 3-5 years post-treatment. All indicators met elimination thresholds. The study proved that onchercias elimination with iverectin is feasible in some African endemic areas, informing current efforts to eliminate onchias in Africa.
Researchers have studied the protein VP4 of the rhinovirus, a virus that causes the common cold, to understand how it helps the virus enter cells. Rhinirus is part of the picornavirus family, which includes poliovirus and foot-and-mouth disease virus. The study found that VP4, a small protein on the virus, interacts with the cell membrane and helps deliver the viral genome into the cell to start replication. They made a version of VP with a tag and showed it can make holes in liposome membranes, small enough for single-stranded RNA to pass through. This was similar to how the real virus works and was affected by pH. The study shows how VP4 helps the virus enter cells and suggests it could be a target for antiviral treatment for the picavirus family.
Francisella tularens (Ft) is a highly infectious, gram-negative bacterium that causes tularemia, a disease classified as a class A select agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Human isolates of F. tularens produce lipid A similar to Francisella novicida (Fn), a pathogen of mice. Researchers identified three enzymes required for lipid carbohydrate modifications: mannose (m1), galactamine (m2), or both (mK). Mutants lacking galactamine (m2) or galos/mannose (m) were attenuated in mice by both pulmonary and subcutaneous routes of infection. Aerosolization of mutants (m2 and mK) provided protection against wild-type (WT) Fn, while subcut administration of mK provided protection from WT Fn. Infection of alveolar macrophage cell by mK induced higher levels of tumor necrosis-α (TN-α) and macrophage inhibitory-2 (M-2) compared to WT Fn. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) from Toll receptor (TLR) and TLR2 knockout mice infected mK produced higher amounts of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and M-2 than MM infected WT. However, production IL-6 and M-2 was undetectable in MM from MyD- mice infected either. MyD mice were susceptible to mK infection. Researchers hypothesize that m's ability to activate pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemine production and innate responses mediated by MyD signaling may be responsible for attenuation, leading to induction of immunity by this mutant.

Due to genetic similarity in lipid structure among Francisella subspecies, inactivating m in other subspecies may result in attenuation and activation of immunity. Protection against WT challenge was obtained after priming mutants, especially mK. Lipid of Francisella is different from enteric bacteria in structure and biological activities. Francis lipid has tetra-acyl chains 16-18 carbons length and phosphate at 4 position removed by L phosphatase. This can be modified by addition galosamine onto 1-phosphate. Activation of innate system and induction pro-inflammatory via My-mediated were essential for clearance m and possibly protection.
Researchers studied the role of Era, a protein involved in ribosome assembly, in Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Era is a GTPase that acts as a switch in ribosome assembly and is conserved across all domains of life. However, its function in ribosome assembly is unclear. The study found that Era is not essential for S. aureus growth but important for 30 ribosomal subunit assembly. Era interacts with 16 rRNA enduclease Y and DEAD RNA helicase C. Both Era and C are required for rRNA processing and growth at low temperatures. Era and C also interact with ppG synthase Rel, which impacts Era Gase activity and C helic activity. Era acts as a hub on the ribosome directing enzymes to their site of action. The stringent response, triggered by ppG, inhibits Era activity, contributing to slowed growth. 

The study identified Era as a target for ppG and its impact on 70 assembly. Here, Era's role in ribogenesis was examined. Unlike E. coli, Era is not essential for S. aureus growth, but mutant cells are defective in 30 subunit maturation. Era interacts with S aureonuclease Y and DEAD RNA helic C. Era and C are crucial for rRNA homeostasis and growth at low temperatures. Era and C interact with pp synthase/hydrolase Rel, affecting RNA processing in a response-dependent manner.
Researchers investigated the effects of anthrax lethal toxin (LT) on mice and found that the heart is an early target of the toxin. Mice lacking neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) were more sensitive to LT, while mice lacking other NOS enzymes had no effect on LT-mediated mortality. The increased sensitivity of NOS- mice was independent of macrophage sensitivity or cytokine responses and could be replicated in wild-type mice through pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme with 7-nitindazole. Histological analyses showed LT-induced changes in heart morphology of N- mice with rapid appearance of inter-fiber spaces but no apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Electron microscopic analyses of LT-treated mice revealed pathological changes in hearts of both N- and wild-type mice varying in severity and timing. Biomarkers of cardiac injury myoglobin, cardiac troponin, and fatty acid protein were elevated in LT mice rapidly by 6 hours after injection. Cardiac protective therapy and allopurin had no beneficial effects on LT mice. Surprisingly, nitric oxide scavenger carbox-PT showed some protection against LT. Echocardiography on LT mice indicated reduction in ejection fraction following treatment in both N and wild-type mice, indicative of decreased heart contractile function. The study suggests a protective role for N against LT-mediated cardiac damage.
Scientists have developed a new method to edit the genes of parasitic nematodes, which infect over 1 billion people worldwide and cause neglected diseases. They used a tool called CRISPR-C9 to disrupt a gene in the human-paritic worm Strongyloides steralis, resulting in worms with severe motility defects. The gene, unc-22, was targeted and mutations were heritable, meaning they were passed to offspring. A similar method was used to disrupt the same gene in another parasitic nemode, Strongloides ratti. The study shows CRPR-C9 can be used in parasitic nematodes, making it possible to study gene function in previously intractable parasites.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the effects of ribosome drop on translation efficiency and ribosome density along mRNA. Ribosome drop occurs when cells are under stress, such as amino acid starvation or high recombinant protein expression, affecting protein synthesis. The model shows ribosome premature termination leads to non-intuitive ribosome profiles, such as increased density from 5' to 3' end. Importantly, it predicts rib drop effects on translation are mRNA-specific and quantifies resilience to drop, showing mRNAs with ribosomes are less affected than those without. Among mRN without ribosomes, resilience to drop correlates with elongation rate, fast codons are less affected. Genome-wide analysis in S. cerevisiae reveals mRN coding proteins involved in translation, using fast codons, are resilient to drop. In physiological conditions, mRN coding regulatory stress proteins are less resilient to drop. The model explains variations in translational efficiency accounting for ribosome behaviors and mRNA density from profiling studies. 

The model predicts mRN sustaining ribosomes for initiation are less affected by drop than those without. It also shows mRN without ribosomes with higher translation rates are more resilient to drop. Ribosome drop increases under stress, such as amino starvation. Accounting for drop in translation is crucial for interpreting ribosome data and estimating rates. Ribosome profiling shows drop is significant under physiological, especially under stress. The model reveals drop effects are mRNA-specific, codon composition and configuration affecting loss due to drop. Resilience to drop might change under stress due to redistribution affecting initiation.
The World Health Organization's strategy to control soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in children is based on routine deworming of school-aged children, but transmission persists due to reservoirs in untreated individuals and the environment. To accelerate interruption, mass drug administration (MDA) is being considered, but its feasibility is uncertain due to sustaining high coverage across communities. The DeW3 trial tests this, with three years of treatment followed by two years of surveillance. Given reinfection rates, two years may not be enough to assess interruption. This study investigates criteria to define interruption earlier. A stochastic model simulates De3's community-randomized trial, comparing control (annual treatment of children with MDA) to intervention (community-wide biannual with M). Simulations were run for Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm (Necator american). Prevalences at six months after last M and MDA coverage were evaluated to assess likelihood of bounce or elimination. Results suggest clusters should be assessed after two years unless interruption is ruled out by low coverage. Models show a range of homogenous prevalence following high MDA clusters, not allowing discrimination between bounce or interruption within 24 months of M cessation. If interruption is not achieved, infections quickly bounce back to pre-treatment levels. Determining a breakpoint early will reduce continuous monitoring in settings where interruption is unlikely. For De3, futility may be due to low M coverage, but safety and efficacy are also monitored. Statistical confidence in interruption is greatest 18-24 months post-treatment.
Researchers have developed a conjugate vaccine for cholera made from Vibrio cholera O1 O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) and recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy fragment (Tc). The vaccine, called OSP:Tc, was tested in mice to evaluate its ability to induce immunity against cholera. Mice were immunized intramuscularly on days 0, 21, and 42 with OSPc alone or with or without adjuvant, a non-toxic immunoadju derived from heat labile toxin Escheria coli. Results showed significant IgG antibody responses to OSP following single immunization in mice receiving OSPc with or without adju. Anti-PS responses were detected after second immunization in these cohorts. No OSP or anti-PS responses were detected in animals receiving unjugated OSP or without adju, or receiving adju alone. Responses were highest in immunization with adju. Serum-OSP responses were detected in mice OSPc with or without adju, and unconjug OSP. Serum-PS and vibriodal responses were detected all cohorts except receiving adju alone. No IgA-OSP or antiPS developed any group. Administration OSPc and adju induced memory cell responses OSP and 95% efficacy in mouse lethality cholera model. The study demonstrates a protectively immunogenic cholera conjugate in mice. A cholera conjugate vaccine could induce long-term immunity, especially in children who poorly respond polysac antigens.
Researchers studied the interaction between the fungus Candida albicans and the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a mouse model of gastrointestinal colonization and dissemination. They found that Candida albicans inhibits the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by suppressing the expression of its pyelin and pyoverine genes, which play a critical role in iron acquisition and virulence. Deletion of these genes in Pseudas aeruginosa attenuates its virulence. Heat-killed Candida albicans had no effect on Pseud aeruginosa, but Candida secreted proteins directly suppressed Pseud aerugin pydine and pyelin expression and inhibited P aerugin virulence in mice. Interestingly, suppression or deletion of pyelin and pyd genes had no effect on P aerugin's ability to colonize the GI tract but decreased aerugin's cytotoxic effect on colonocytes. Iron supplementation restored aerugin virulence in aerugin and Candida colonized mice. The study provides insight into how fungal-bacterial interactions can modulate bacterial virulence in the intestine.
Researchers studied how the rate of reversion to wild-type (WT) virus from escape mutant (EM) virus affects the outcome of SIV and HIV infection. EM virus evades CD8+ T cell recognition and is often less replicatively fit than WT, but reverts to WT upon transmission to a naive host and is associated with lower viral load in vivo. However, the rate of reversion is highly variable. They quantified reversion to WT of SIV and SHIV viruses containing minor amounts of WT in pig macaques using PCR. Infection with mixes of EM and WT containing ≥10% WT results in rapid outgrowth of WT virus at SIVag CD8 cell epitopes within 7 days. In contrast, infection with biopassaged SHIV229 with smaller proportions of WT or pure EM SIV239 showed delayed or slow reversion. Delayed re was associated with lower viral loads. The diversity of infecting inoculum determines reversion timing, which predicts infection outcome. Delayed re of fitness-reducing CD8 cell escape suggests opportunities to reduce pathogenicity during early infection.
Researchers studied yeast populations from the Evolution Canyon in Israel and found that some strains are highly resistant to the heavy metal cadmium. They discovered that this resistance is primarily due to an enhanced function of a metal pump called PCA1, which helps remove cadmium from the cell. Analysis showed that mutations in the promoter region of the PCA gene, not the coding region, are responsible for this enhancement. Experiments demonstrated that three specific nucleotide substitutions in the PCA promoter increase its activity and enhance resistance to cadmium. These nucleotides are conserved in other yeast species and important for cadmium resistance, suggesting they are an ancestral trait. However, they diverged in Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations where cadmium is low or absent. This is an example of a selective sweep in yeast driven by a trade-off between metal resistance and fitness.
Researchers identified three major oncogenic pathways in gastric cancer (GC) that are associated with patient survival: proliferation/stem cell, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-caten. These pathways were deregulated in over 70% of gastric cancers. The researchers used gene expression signatures to map patterns of oncogenic activation in 301 primary gastric cancers. They functionally validated these predictions in a panel of gastric cancer cell lines. Patient stratification by oncogenic pathway showed reproducible and significant differences in survival in multiple cohorts, suggesting pathway interactions play a role in disease behavior. Gastric cancers can be taxonomized by oncogenic activity into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups. Predicting pathway activity by expression allows study of multiple pathways simultaneously in cancers at scale not achievable by other platforms.

The study used an in silico method to map pathway activation levels in tumor profiles and validated pathway classification using breast cancer examples. They applied this method to 11 oncogenic pathways implicated in gastric carcinogenesis, including RAS, p53, BRCA, W/βaten, E, SRC, MYC, NF-κ, histone deacetylation, and stem cell signatures. The strategy involves four steps: defining pathway signatures, mapping onto gene profiles, validating predictions, and applying to primary GC. Gastric cancer is the second cause of global mortality, prevalent in Asia, most patients diagnosed with advanced disease. Deregulation of oncogenic pathways such as E, K-R, p, and W/βaten signaling occur in GC, indicating molecular heterogeneity.
Researchers used a method called stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) to analyze the Escherichia coli genome and found that sites susceptible to strand separation under negative superhelical stress are preferentially located in intergenic regions known or inferred to contain promoters, but rarely in coding regions. They investigated whether genes in different functional categories have characteristic S properties in their upstream regions and found that strong S sites in the E coli genome are statistically overrepresented in the upstream of genes encoding transcription regulators. Specifically, regions of genes directly responding to physiological and environmental stimuli are more destabilized than those not involved in these responses. If a pathway is controlled by a transcription regulator whose gene has a destabilized 5' flank, the genes (operons) in that pathway usually contain strongly destabilized S sites in 5' flanks. This association was observed in 38 of 43 free-living bacteria genomes but only 4 of 18 endosymbion or obligate parasitic bacteria. The results suggest S sites 5' to genes may be involved in transcription responses to environmental changes known to alter superelicity. The authors propose S sites are active participants in superically mediated mechanisms governing gene expression in proary in response to physiological or environmental changes.
Researchers studied the role of high-mob group (HMG) transcription factors in the fungus Podospora anserina, a type of filamentous ascomycete. HMG proteins are DNA-binding proteins involved in various cellular processes, including gene regulation and development. P anina has 12 HMG genes, 4 of which were previously characterized, controlling mating and fruit-body development. Systematic analysis of the remaining 8 uncharacterized HMG genes showed none were essential for viability, but 7 involved in the sexual cycle. Two HMG genes, PaMG5 and Pa9, displayed unique features. Pa5, an ortholog of Schizosacomyces pombe's Ste11, activates mating-type genes in anina, while Pa9 represses several genes specific to stationary phase. Transcription analysis of HMG genes in deletion strains indicated Pa5 is central to a network regulating mating-type and mating target genes. Genetic analysis revealed this network also controls fertility genes not regulated by mating factors. This study highlights HMG's role in sexual reproduction, with 11 of 12 members involved in anina's cycle. Pa5 and Ste are conserved regulators of mating genes, despite diverging 550 million years ago. Two H genes, SO9 and its regulator S, play a role in sex determination in mammals. The an and pom mating genes and regulator form a module analogous to the SRY/SOX module, revealing common sex regulation in animals and fungi.
During the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus epidemic, there was a lack of data on the persistence of the Ebola virus in survivors' body fluids and the risk of transmission, including sexual transmission. To address this, an observational study was conducted in Sierra Leone to determine the persistence of the virus in survivors' fluids. The study was implemented in two phases: the first phase assessed the persistence of the virus in semen of 100 men within five months of the initial discussions, and the second phase assessed the persistence in multiple fluids (semenstrual, blood, breast milk, urine, rectal fluid, sweat, saliva, tears) of 120 men and 120 women. The study informed national and global guidelines in real-time and demonstrated the need for semen testing among Ebola survivors. The study accelerated the implementation of such programs in Ebola-affected countries and informed persistence of Zika virus studies. Research is crucial in responding to an epidemic of a poorly characterized disease.
Researchers studied how bacteria, specifically Escherichia coli, sense and respond to chemical gradients in their environment. They used a technique called fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) to measure how bacteria respond to different concentrations of chemicals. By analyzing these responses, they predicted the types of gradients bacteria typically encounter in their natural environment. They also used information theory and simulations to understand how bacteria transmit and process this information, accounting for both internal and external noise. The results showed that bacteria tend to swim up gradients with maximum velocity when information is maximized. This suggests that bacteria have evolved to detect exponential gradients, which are common in their habitat. The Weber-Fech law explains how cells perceive changes in concentration, but not the distribution of gradients. To fully understand the environment, researchers matched statistical properties of stimuli to cellular responses, assuming optimization criteria. The chemotaxis system allows bacteria to detect and move towards nutrients or toxins. This system is relatively simple with few components and well understood at a molecular level. It shares design principles with other sensory systems, including Weber's law, Weber-Fech law, and fold detection. The study connected these laws to information at a molecular level, unlike previous research.
Researchers studied the lifespan of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which are responsible for producing blood cells, and found that they differ in lifespan despite being exposed to the same environment. This raises the question of what controls their lifespan. A new model based on reliability theory explains the diversity of lifespans of HSC. Using experiments and computational modeling, small-scale molecular failures at H population level were tested. The best fit of data was provided by a model where repulation failure of H are largely anti-persistent or mean-reverting processes. Failure rates increase during population division events are counteracted by repair processes, leading to a crossover from anti-persistent to persistent behavior. This is due to increased failure rate of self-renew leading to clonal extinction, suggesting repair capacity of H is self-limit. Lifespan of each H depends on amplitudes and frequencies of fluctuations in failure kinetics. Short and longer-lived Hs differ in pre-programmed ability to dissipate perturbations. This suggests lifespan is determined by pre-programmed differences in repair capacity.
Researchers have discovered a new way that the immune system fights off parasitic worms, called helminths, which affect one-third of the world's population. They found that antibodies, proteins produced by the immune system, trap and immobilize the worms, preventing tissue damage. This is done through a previously unknown mechanism that doesn't involve the IL-4 receptor, a key player in immune responses. The study used mice infected with the parasite Heligomosomoides polygyrus bakeri and found that mice lacking antibodies or activating receptors for antibodies had highly mobile worms and tissue damage. Antibodies with the worms reprogrammed macrophages, a type of immune cell, to express wound-healing genes, making the worms immobile. This occurred independently of IL-4 signaling. The researchers call this new type of activated macroage helmin-antibody activated macroage. Antibodies are known to provide immunity against helths, but how they work was unclear. This study shows antibodies activate macroph to modulate expression of genes associated with the alternative phenotype. Antibody-activated macroph upregulate Arginase and immobilize infective and dwelling larvae. The study demonstrates antibodies mediate activation of macro resulting in Arg expression and immobilization of invasive helmin larvae.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the early stages of DNA repair in living cells without interfering with the process. DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are a major threat to genome integrity, and cells repair them through homologous recombination (HR) with an intact copy of the broken locus. The broken DNA mobility increases during the search for a donor copy, but observing chromosome dynamics during the early steps of HR requires a non-invasive method. Current tools, based on fluorescent proteins binding to specific sites, obstruct chromatin function. The new method uses oligomerization to form visible foci and was applied to HO cleavage of the MAT locus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III, providing real-time analysis of resection in living cells. The dynamics of chromatin next to DSB revealed transient confinement of the damaged region during early resection, consistent with keeping ends in contact. Resection in y70 mutant began 10 minutes earlier than wild type, defining the period of commitment to homology-dependent repair. The new method will be applicable to fine-scale analysis of genome organization and function in normal and pathological contexts.
Researchers studied the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, in humans living in areas where the disease is common. They used computer models to estimate how often people get re-infected with the parasite and when this happens in the course of the disease. The models were based on data from villages in Argentina where many people have mixed infections with different types of the parasite. The results showed that about 3.2% of people get reinfected each year, mostly during the chronic stage of the disease. In most of these re-infections, the parasite evades the immune system. This means the body's defense against the parasite is not strong enough. The researchers found that people are likely to get reinfected 1-3 times over 5-30 years. This is because the way the parasite is transmitted is not very efficient, not because the immune system is weak. These findings are important for developing a vaccine and understanding the risk of chronic disease in people living in areas where Chagas is common.
Researchers studied blood samples from a group of Thai children who were infected with the deng virus (DENV) to understand why some people develop severe symptoms while others do not. They found that immune cells from children who later developed symptoms produced more of certain cytokines, such as IL-15 and MCP-1, and less of others, like IL-12, IL-2, MIP-α, RANT, GM-CSF, and TNα, compared to those who had no symptoms. Higher levels of IL-6 were also found in children who developed symptoms. This suggests that there are different immune responses to DENV depending on the outcome of the infection. The study supports the idea of both protective and pathologic immune profiles in DENV infection, which could be useful for evaluating responses to deng vaccines.
In the Drosila wing imaginal disc, the Hedgehog (H) protein forms an extracellular gradient that organizes patterning along the anterior-posterior axis and specifies at least three different domains of gene expression. However, a direct correspondence between the borders of these patterns and H concentrations has not been demonstrated. This study provides evidence that interpretation of H signaling depends on the history of exposure to H and that a single concentration is sufficient to support multiple outputs. Mathematical modeling predicts that at steady state, only two domains can be in response to H, suggesting the boundaries of two or more gene patterns cannot be specified by a static H gradient. Computer simulations suggest a "overshoot" of the H gradient, a transient in which H is expanded compared to the H-state. In vivo examination of H target expression shows patterns expand initially and then refine, providing evidence for the overshoot. The H gene architecture suggests overshoot results from H-dependent upregulation of the receptor Patched (Ptc). Altering the network such that P is no longer upregulated in response to H-signaling, patterns of expression, which distinct in wild-type discs, now overlap. Results support a model where H gradient dynamics, from P upregulation, play an instructional role in establishing patterns of expression.
Researchers identified a genetic mutation in mice that affects their response to ethanol and anesthetics. The mutation, called Lightweight (Lwt), disrupts a gene similar to the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. eleg) unc-79 gene. Mice with one copy of the mutation (heterozygotes) are more sensitive to ethanol and anesthetics, while those with two copies (homozygotes) are lethal. Experiments with C. elegans show a similar sensitivity to ethanol in unc-79 mutants and related genes unc-80 and nca-1;n-2. Heterozygotes also respond differently to anesthetic isoflurane, similar to C elegans mutant phenotypes. Heterozygotes are more active in new environments and smaller than wild-type mice. They consume more food, but are leaner, and voluntarily consume more ethanol than wild-type littermates. This suggests a conserved pathway may influence alcohol behaviors in humans.
Researchers have identified the Anopheles gambiae's immune response to Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for malaria, as a potential source of anti-malaria mechanisms. One such mechanism is the Imd pathway, a conserved signaling pathway with anti-P. falcum activity. Silencing Cas, a negative regulator of Imd, or overexpressing REL2, an I-controlled NF-kappa transcription factor, confers a resistant phenotype on A. gambiae that involves immune effector genes. However, unexplored features of this mechanism are essential for malaria control. Using RNA interference to silence Cas and Imd components, genes participating in anti-Plmod signaling regulated by Cas were identified, representing targets for pathway overactivation. Imd is most potent against ookin stage, yet has activity against early oocysts and lesser against lateocysts. Cas silencing alone induces anti-P response in absence of gut microbiota. I pathway components TEP, APL, and LR1 in infection-dependent defense were established, shedding light on laboratory versus natural intensity models. Results highlight considerations for I pathway manipulation in A. gambia to limit transmission and reveal nuances in I-directed response P. falcum.
Researchers investigated the anti-fibrotic potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BSCs) in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis caused by the fungus Paroccidiococcus brasiliensis. BSCs were isolated from mice and administered to mice infected with the fungus, either alone or in combination with the antifungal medication itraconazole (TC). The results showed that BSC therapy did not have an anti-frotic effect, but instead exacerbated the fibrosis. Histological analysis revealed increased granulomatous inflammation and fibrocy counts in BSC-treated mice, and increased expression of collagen, TGF-β, MMP-8, and MMP-15 genes. The combination of BSC and TC reduced TIMP-1 and MMP-13 expression. Human fibroblasts stimulated with lung supernatants from infected and BSC-transplanted mice showed higher collagen expression. Soluble collagen levels were increased in lungs of infected and BSC-treated mice compared to infected or TC-treated mice. Supernatants from infected and BSC-treated mice induced higher collagen expression in humanroblasts compared to non-treated mice.
Researchers investigated the seasonal dynamics of phlebotine sand fly species that transmit Leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infant in the Mediterranean region. They collected over 99,000 specimens from 2011-2013 in eight countries where the disease was reported, using light traps and sticky traps. The study aimed to understand how climate change affects the spread of the disease. Sand fly activity is typically seasonal and sensitive to climate variations. The study found 56,000 flies belonged to six species: P. periciosus, P. aasi, P. neglect, P. tobi, P. balicus, and P. kandeli. The time of fly appearance and disappearance differed between sites, and densities varied at each location. Correlations were found between latitude and annual temperature and the first fly appearance (April-June) and density (July-August-September). A 3-modal trend was recorded for P. tobi in Cyprus, a new finding for L. infant. Adult activity ended in September-November without temperature correlation. The period of exposure to L. infant in the region was a bell-shaped curve with a peak in July-September and May-October for 99% of values. No transmission risk occurred December-March. Nocturnal activity peaked 11pm-2am, with annual variations. Consecutive collections showed homogeneous behavior patterns, proposing sentinel sites for monitoring. Higher risk L. infant transmission was June-October (97% density), but not equally distributed, with earlier and more frequent in southern territories.
Orientia tsutsamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, has been found to replicate in monocytes from healthy donors and alter the expression of over 4,500 genes. Type I interferon and interferon-stimulated genes and genes associated with M1 macrophage polarization were significantly upregulated. Otsamushi also induced apoptosis-related genes and promoted cell death in a small percentage of monocytes. The type I interferon response and M-associated cytokines were indispensable to the transcription changes in mononuclear cells from patients with scrubus. Microarray analysis revealed upregulation of 613 genes, including interfer-related and M polarization features in patients, similar to Otsamushi-stimulated monocytes in vitro. This is the first demonstration that monocytes are polarized in vitro and ex vivo following Otsamushi exposure. The study improves understanding of scrubus pathogenesis, where interferon activation of monocytes and subsequent M1 polarization are critical. 

Otsamushi induced a specific M1 phenotype and type I IF response in monocytes. Type I and II IF and M signatures were found in PBs from patients with scrubus, suggesting association with inflammatory complications. Activated monocytes play a major role in pathogens dissemination, such as murine listeriosis or cytomegalovirus infection. Oam upregulated expression genes in polarized responses, including IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, GM-CSF, and CCL20. Monocytes with Oam produced 16 pg IF-β, while heat-killed bacteria unable to produce IF-β. Live Oam induced sustained I response in human monocytes. Approximately 15% of upregulated genes were cytokines or chemokines. Oam upregulated type IF pathway and apoptosis genes. In vitro results related to IF response in patients scrubus. Study highlights IF-mediated monocyte role in scrubus pathogenesis.
Researchers have explored how ants navigate complex environments using visual memory, but the neural mechanisms behind this ability are not well understood. The insect brain's mushroom body, a crucial for memory, has been studied mainly for simple tasks like smell recognition. A computer model of this circuit, developed for fruit flies, can also explain how desert ants quickly learn routes in natural environments. The model's key principles, including one-shot learning and sparse codes, allow the mushroom body to store hundreds of images. 

A team used this model to see if it could apply to ants' visual route learning, using real-world stimuli from experiments. They focused on visual cues, not smell, and found the circuit can learn routes in complex environments. This suggests the ant's brain architecture could be the basis for a familiar algorithm. The mushroom body has been studied mainly for smell, but this study shows it can also handle navigation. A previous model of the fruit fly's mushroom learning was used, which has three stages: smell inputs create a pattern in the antennal lobe, consistent with flies and ants. The model learned 80 routes from real ant viewpoints and distinguished from similar off-route images. The network, originally for simple smell, needed little change to handle complex navigation. Ants and bees have larger mushroom bodies than flies.
Plants have an innate immune system to protect themselves from disease, which shares some similarities with animal immunity but also has unique mechanisms, such as the ability to produce new organs to replace damaged ones. Researchers studied pathogen-triggered leaf shedding in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves infected with Pseudomonas syringae, a bacterial pathogen lacking a type III secretion system, which failed to elicit shedding response, suggesting it's a novel form of immunity triggered by effectors. Genes HAESA/HA2, INFRESC, and NED are required for pathogen-triggered shedding to occur. Plants with mutations in genes for bacterial defense and salicylic acid signaling, such as phytoalexin deficient 4, disease susceptibility 1, sallic induction 2, and senescence 101, fail to shed leaves normally. Bacteria contacting shedding zones trigger strong response, but long-distance signals from infected tissue alert the shedding zone of danger. A model proposes regulating leaf defense where minor infections are handled but when out of control, leaves are shed. Salicy acid regulates both pathogen and drought-triggered shedding. 

A system was developed to study Pseudas syring pv tomato DC0 triggered Arabidopsis to understand defense in leaves that can be shed. This builds on a well-studied pathosystem where roset leaves from non-flowering Arabid are infected Pseudas syringe. A new system for pathogen-trigger shedding in Arabid was defined, explaining genetics governing pathogen shedding. The abission pathway regulates floral shedding required for all forms of inducible shedding in Arabid. This builds on previous work that Arabid leaves can be shed in response to drought, showing Arab uses shedding as a defense against bacterial infection. The response is robust and triggered by disease or ET. Disparate pathways regulating defense and shedding are connected, components necessary for pathogen shedding. Salicy is necessary for full pathogen and drought shedding.
Researchers studied how starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in the retina detect motion direction. They found that these cells generate larger calcium signals when motion is towards their dendrites than away from them. To understand how this direction selectivity (DS) works, they measured responses to expanding and contracting circular visual stimuli. The results showed larger fundamental and harmonic frequency components for expanding stimuli, indicating nonlinearity. This suggests the relationship between harmonic amplitudes and potential is due to voltage-gated channels. Calcium changes in dendrites caused by voltage steps were monitored using two-photon microscopy, showing the distal dendrite is depolarized relative to the soma due to tonic glutamgic input and high-voltage Ca+ channels. Compartment modeling suggests DS in SACs can be computed by dendrites relying on voltageated channels and a dendritic gradient, providing spatial asymmetry for direction discrimination.

The study used circular stimuli to evoke DS somatic and dendritic calcium responses. Dendritic calcium responses were seen in a minority of cells while electrical responses were present in all. Blocking GABA and glycine receptors showed DS can be generated by a dend-intrinsic mechanism, independent of lateral interactions. Blocking GABA receptors between SACs did not affect DS when stimuli were confined to the dendritic field. Persistence of DS in the presence of GABA and glycine antagonists suggests SAC dendrites generate signals without lateral inhibition. Voltage-gated Ca channels and a dendritic gradient are likely involved. Optical recordings showed strongest calcium increases in distal dendrites near synapses. Dend sectors can be activated independently due to their morphology and low impedance at the soma.
Researchers studied the mechanisms of infection and virulence in 43 different human pathogens from various taxonomic groups. They found that pathogens using locally acting molecules require a lower infective dose than those using distantly acting molecules. Contrary to the prediction, pathogens with distantly acting immune modulators were not more virulent. Instead, virulence was negatively correlated with infect dose and higher in pathogens infecting skin compared to ingested or inhaled. The study also found that pathogens with distantly acting immune mod have higher infect doses than locally acting ones. However, virulence was not related to the mechanism of pathogenesis. The researchers also tested the influence of transmission mode and route of infection on infect and virulence. They found that pathogens infecting through skin resulted in higher case rates than ingested or inhaled.
Researchers studied the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the development of Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic worm that causes schistosomiasis, a disease affecting 200 million people worldwide. They analyzed the 3' untranslated regions (3-UTR) of transcripts in juvenile and adult worms and found that the miR-277/498 family was significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult stage. They identified a novel miRNA, sm-mi-498, located proximal to smi-277, suggesting a miRNA cluster, and proposed hairpin structures for both miRNAs. Expression of smi-277/498 was upregulated in adults, while their targets were downregulated in adults but not in immature females. smi-498 was expressed in tegument cells near the oesophagus and throughout the male body. The study suggests mi-277/498 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation during development and sexual maturation of schistosomes.
Researchers conducted a 5-year surveillance of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARS-Co) in a cave inhabited by horseshoe bats in Yunn Province, China. They discovered 11 new SARS-Co strains and analyzed their full genomes together with previous findings, revealing high diversity in the S, OR3, and OR8 genes. Importantly, strains with high similarity to SARS-Co in the hypervar N-terminal (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1, OR3, and OR8 regions were found. They also discovered S-CoVs similar to human S-Co in OR3 and split OR8a,8. Additionally, S-Co from this cave were more related to S-Co in non-structural genes OR1,1 compared to those elsewhere. Recombination analysis showed frequent recombination events within S and around OR8 between S-Co. The researchers hypothesize the direct progenitor S-Co may have originated from sequential recombination between precursors S-Co. Cell studies demonstrated three identified S-Co with different protein sequences can use human ACE as receptor, showing close relationship to S-Co. This study provides insights into S-Co origin and highlights preparedness for future S-like diseases.
Researchers are examining the effectiveness of the faecal egg reduction test (FECRT) in detecting drug resistance in human hookworms. The test measures faecal egg output before and after treatment to determine drug efficacy, but may be impacted by density-dependent fecundity, where worms increase egg production after treatment due to relaxation of constraints. This can lead to underestimation of drug efficacy, particularly in cases with heavy infections. The degree of underestimation depends on the worms' ability to increase egg output, which varies among individuals. To improve measurements, cases with heaviest infections may be omitted from the test, as they have greatest potential to increase egg output. Density-dependent fecundity affects the utility of FEC as a resistance tool, highlighting the need for new methods, such as in vitro assays or genotypic changes, to monitor drug effects directly on worms. In humans, anthelmint efficacy may not meet livestock criteria, suggesting suboptimal dosing, and constraints may be removed as worm density decreases. A study on canine hookworms showed increased egg output after treatment, and a human dataset showed relationship between output and infection levels. The phenomenon likely applies to human hookworms, making it difficult to identify drug changes amidst dynamic worm biology. The FEC test, comparing egg output before and after treatment, is currently the best for detecting resistance, but may be distorted by density fecundity.
Researchers investigated the role of heparan sulfate (HS) in regulating Sonic Hedgehog (SH) signaling during lung development. They found that deleting HS synthase1, an enzyme responsible for producing HS, in epithelial cells led to expanded branching tips and reduced branching, along with mesenchymal defects. This was associated with increased fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) expression and activity, suggesting a non-autonomous mechanism. SH signaling, responsible for suppressing F10, was reduced in mutant lungs. Reactivating SH in mutant lungs rescued the tip phenotype and attenuated F signaling. Importantly, biologically active SH proteins were reduced in both mutant epithelial and wild-type mesenchym cells. The study highlights HS as a key player in dictating SH signaling for lung morphogenesis. Decreased SH activity in mutant embryos led to expanded F10 expression, contributing to dilated tips. Production of biologically active SH was reduced after HS loss in epithelial. HS is crucial in SH-producing epithelial cells to maintain SH activity and lung morphogenesis. Epithelial deletion caused similar defects, including enlarged tips, decreased branching, and F10. SH signaling was reduced in mutant, essential for HS dictating SH-F10 cascade. Prior studies examined HS function in lung morph. Ablation of synthase in epith resulted in reduced biologically SH particles on epith and mesyme, and reduced activity, causing F expression, leading to expanded tips and branching.
Paired-end sequencing is a technique used to detect genome rearrangements and structural variations on a genome-wide scale, particularly for copy-neutral rearrangements such as inversions and translocations that are common in cancer and produce novel genes. Researchers investigated how much sequencing is required to detect rearrangement breakpoints and localize them precisely using theoretical models and simulations. They derived a formula to calculate the probability of a fusion gene existing in a genome given paired sequences and applied it to breast cancer samples, finding accurate predictions with a small number of large fragments. The ability to detect genes depends on gene distribution and sequencing parameters, and errors can lead to false rearrangements. These results will help calibrate future sequencing efforts, especially large-scale cancer studies enabled by next-generation technologies.

Paired-end sequencing detects rearrangement breakpoints, where non-adjacent coordinates in the genome are adjacent in cancer. The authors extended this to fusion detection and examined the ability to detect genes. Next-generation technologies will provide reliable and precise fusion detection, enabling systematic analysis of genomic events leading to cancer and shedding light on cancer's genetic basis. Maximizing fusion detection probability with least sequencing depends on factors including number and length of sequenced clones, fused genes, and localization errors. Theoretical and empirical formulae elucidate trade-offs in experimental design for current and next-generation technologies, making studies more reliable across samples with limited reads. Paired sequencing has errors including artifacts, assembly errors, and sequence mis-mapping, leading to incorrect predictions or false positives.

Whole-genome paired sequencing allows a-wide survey of fusion and rearrangements in tumors, advantages over transcript or protein profiling in cancer studies.
Chemotaxis, the ability of cells to sense and move towards chemical gradients, is a complex process involving motility, gradient sensing, and polarization. Researchers have proposed that these processes are mediated by separate modules that, which, when combined, recreate the behaviors of chemotactic cells. A mathematical model using reaction-diffusion equations and a mechanical model of the cell's cortex demonstrates these modules. The model consists of an excitable network for random migration, a local excitation-inhibition module for gradient response, and a polarization module linked to the cytoskeleton for persistent movement. Varying the strengths of feedback loops in the model produces behaviors similar to genetically altered cell lines.

Cells without adaptation to spatial stimuli cannot recreate complex responses and perform less efficient chemaxis. However, simulations show adaptation is not necessary for chemaxis. Cells can sense direction and respond to gradients by polarizing and migrating towards attractants, a fundamental property of single and multicellular organisms. Experiments suggest chemaxis involves motility, sensing, and polarization.

A previously described excitation-inhibition network (LEG-B) captures some features of chemotaxis, and two modules are added. A viscoelastic model simulates cytoskeleton deformations and movements. Polarized and unpolar cells coexist, and cells acquire polarity during migration. The LEG-B simulates movement under various scenarios, illustrating chemaxis complexity. Experiments show pathways have redundancy at the biochemical level.
Tudor domain-containing protein 6 (TD6) plays a crucial role in the development of elongated spermatids and male fertility. Research has shown that TD6 interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) in meiotic prophase spermatocytes, supporting the splicing process. TD6 also associates with spliceosomal protein Sm in the absence of RNA and arginine methylation. In TD-deficient spermatocytes, PR5 association with Sm and arginine methylation of Sm are reduced. This impairs the assembly of spliceosomes, resulting in 3.5-fold increased levels of U snRNPs in the nucleus. Deficiencies in spliceosome maturation correlate with decreased numbers of SM-positive bodies and Cajal bodies involved in snRNA maturation. Transcript analysis of TD-deficient spermatocytes reveals high numbers of splicing defects, including aberrant intron and exon usage as well as aberrant splice junctions. This study demonstrates a novel function of TD in spliceosome maturation and mRNA splicing in prophase spermatocytes.
A new Bayesian model has been developed to study the acquisition and clearance of bacterial colonization within a host. This is important because colonizing bacteria can play a role in health, serving as a reservoir for transmission to other hosts and emergence of invasive strains, highlighting the need to understand acquisition and clearance rates of colonizing populations. Previous studies of colonization dynamics have been based on whether samples represent a single or distinct colonization events. A common approach has been to use whole genome sequencing to determine genetic distance between isolates, assuming a fixed threshold below which isolates are the same. However, this does not account for within-host population diversity, time intervals between measurements, and uncertainty in estimated rates. The new model provides probabilities whether strains should be considered same, determining clearance and acquisition from genomes over time. It models within-host variation using genetic simulation and uses Approximate Bayesian Computation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for inference. The method was validated with simulations and a collection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates from a longitudinal study. An R implementation is available. The model improves on previous strategies using a fixed distance threshold, providing a robust and accurate method for determining relationship between isolates. It defines a strain as a population of closely related isolates. The study of colonization is based on inferring whether samples over time represent same or distinct events, permitting calculation of rates and clearance. Whole genome sequencing provides genetic distance between isolates, used to infer relationship. The new model provides uncertainty for relevant quantities, unlike previous approaches.
Plants generate new organs through the activity of stem cells called meristems. The shoot apical meristem initiates leaves and flowers, and lateral merist in highly ordered, spiralled or whorled patterns via a process called phyllaxis. It is accepted that the transport of the hormone auxin plays a major role in this process. Current hypotheses propose that hormone transporters of the PIN family create auxin maxima at precise positions, which would lead to organ initiation. To explain how transporters could create flux to distinct regions within the plant, concepts have been proposed. A hypothesis, canalization, proposes transporters amplify and stabilize existing flux, which could be initiated, for example, by diffusion. This explains organized auxin flux during vein formation, but shoot apical meristem a second hypothesis proposed, hormone would be transported to areas with highest concentrations. This implies two different mechanisms for allocation in membrane, based on sensing and concentration. Patterning processes require interaction of hundreds cells, making it impossible to estimate a scenario plausible. Therefore, modelling provides a means to test hypothesis. Using a computer tool, a flux-based hypothesis explains auxin at meristem, providing unifying concept for control in plant. Experiments required to distinguish flux-based and other hypotheses.
Researchers have been working to develop a new diagnostic test for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani. They used a combination of lab experiments and computer searches to identify potential biomarkers. Previous studies showed that IgG, a part of the immune system, could be used to monitor the disease in rapid tests. However, these tests used a crude antigen from the parasite, which may not be reliable. The researchers replaced this with specific antigens and found that it improved the tests. They used mass spectrometry to identify proteins that reacted with IgG from VL patients and looked for those that were present in the parasite and accessible to the immune system. They mapped the parts of these proteins that reacted with IgG using computer algorithms and tested peptides from these proteins in arrays. One peptide showed high sensitivity and specificity in tests with VL patient and healthy control sera. The team used computer searches to reduce the number of lab experiments, focusing on proteins with desired features and predicted epitopes. They screened peptides from these proteins and found the most reactive one, which had 84% sensitivity and 95% specificity with VL sera. This approach can be used to develop more reliable IgG tests for monitoring VL.
A study of 317 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) from six countries, including Syria, Pakistan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Iran, and others, found that 61.5% of cases had granulomas, with 25.2% being caseating, 4.6 suppurative, and 70.2 tuberculoid without necrosis. Caseating and tuboid granuloma groups differed significantly in geographical distribution, with more cases in Saudi Arabia, and histologically in distribution of Ridley's pattern, with doubling 3 in caseating and 5 in tuboid. Time to healing was shorter in tuboid vs case group. Parasitic index, species, and other variables did not differ between granuloma groups. An 18.2% of CL cases had caseating granulomas, suggesting it should be considered in differential diagnosis in endemic regions. Cases with caseating granulomas showed slower healing, no association with species, possibly due to worse immune response or aggressive leishmania strains. Microscopic evaluation showed Leishmania tropica in majority, Leish major in rest, all negative for TB.
Researchers have identified a gene called Zfp69, a zinc finger transcription factor, as a candidate for the genetic cause of obesity-associated diabetes in mice. This gene is linked to a specific region on chromosome 4 in mice that contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes. The study used a combination of genetic techniques to narrow down the location of the gene to a 2.1 megabases and identified Zfp as the most likely candidate. Analysis of the gene in different mouse strains showed that a retrotransposon, a type of genetic element, disrupted the gene in some mice but not others. The disrupted version of the gene was associated with diabetes, while the normal version was not. The researchers also found that the human version of the gene, ZNF642, was increased in fat tissue of people with type 2 diabetes. The study suggests that Zfp plays a role in the development of type 2 diabetes and that the retrotranson contributes to genetic variation in mice.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive model to predict cell differentiation in the vertebrate hematopoietic system, a complex system with many branching pathways and cell types. The model integrates regulatory and signalling pathways controlling cell differentiation, using a logical formalism for dynamical analysis due to qualitative data availability. To handle the network's size and complexity, an original reduction approach and state identification algorithm were used. Simulations were performed in various environments to assess effects on cell differentiation, revealing stable states corresponding to Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg subtypes. However, transient hybrid cells co-expressing combinations of Th, Th, Th, and Treg markers were also found in environment-dependent. The model highlights the nature of these types and their relationships with canonical subtypes. It can be used to explore novel pathways in silico.
Researchers have developed a computational model to predict where and how transcription factors bind to the genome during early Drosila development. Transcription factors drive patterns of gene expression by binding to thousands of genomic regions, but the forces that determine where, when, and to what they bind are not well understood. The model uses thermodynamics to evaluate the contribution of biophysical forces to the binding of five regulators of embryonic-posterior patterning in Dila melanogaster. Predictions based on DNA and protein affinities alone achieved a correlation of 0.4 with experimental measurements in vivo. Incorporating cooperativity and competition among factors and spatial patterning in the nucleus had little effect on accuracy. A major source of error was predicting events that do not occur in vivo, attributed to reduced chromatin accessibility. Experimental measurements of genome-wide DNA accessibility improved predictions to 0.6-0.9 for various factors across target genes. The model was used to quantify the roles of sequence, accessibility, and cooperativity. Results show that in open chromatin binding can be predicted by sequence of individual factors with minimal interactions. A combination of experimentally determined chrom accessibility and computational models may predict binding of any transcription factor with precision.
In Drosophila, the proteins Daughterless (Da) and Extramacchaetea (Em) are the only members of the basic helix-loop helix (bHL) transcription factor family, which regulate cell proliferation. These factors are involved in controlling the G2/M transition and cell cycle progression in epithelial cells of the imaginal discs. Genetic analysis shows that Em controls the G2/M transition and proliferation through the transcriptional regulation of the Cdc25 phosphatase, string. Ectopic expression of string in cells with reduced Em or high Da levels rescues proliferative defects in mutant cells. Additionally, Da acts as a transcriptional repressor of string. This defines a mechanism through which Em controls cell proliferation by regulating Da, which transcriptionally represses string. In Drosila, Em is required to downregulate Da, triggering mitosis via transcriptional activation of the conserved cell cycle component C25.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive pipeline to analyze phosphoprote data from interventional experiments to identify key proteins and signaling networks involved in cell growth and development. Phosphoproteomics is a tool to determine relative phosphorylation levels on a large scale, but differs from proteomics due to limited detectable sites per protein. The pipeline includes phosphopeptide analysis, correlation, network analysis, and causal discovery, and compensates for missing data issue in proteomics. The study used SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling Amino acids in culture) technique with kinase-dead mutants to generate a dataset. The pipeline was applied to Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentous growth, identifying 5 high-confidence proteins and 19 hub proteins, all involved in stress responses. Nine have direct or indirect involvement in filament growth. Four predicted proteins were validated by phenotypic experiments, showing differential growth. The pipeline presents a systematic way to discover signaling networks using phosphrote data and suggests candidates for investigation. It can be applied to other studies via different platforms.
Researchers studied the regulation of the X chromosome in the male germline of Drosophila melanogaster. They found that X-wide dosage compensation, which is the equalization of X gene expression in males and females, is absent in most of the Doph male germl. Microarray analysis showed no evidence of X-specific inactivation during meiosis, which is the silencing and heterochromization of the X during meiosis in the male or female germl. The team also confirmed that expression of genes driven by autosomal promoters is reduced when inserted on the X chromosome versus autosomes, but this difference is established premeiotic and persists in meiotic cells. The magnitude of X-autosome difference in gene expression cannot be explained by absence compensation, suggesting a previously unknown mechanism limits expression from X during sperogenesis in Dophila. These findings resolve conflicting reports and have implications for patterns of evolution and speciation in Doph.
Researchers have studied the early stages of Citrobacterium infection in mice, a model for human diarrheal infections caused by Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHE). They found that the pathogenesis of both species depends on forming intimate contact with the epithelial cells, creating "attachment/effacement" (A) lesions, which must self-renew by re-infecting the rapidly regenerating epithelium. The study focused on the earliest events of C. rodium establishment and found that colonic epithelial A microcolonies are clonal populations, relying on local growth to persist. In wild mice, microies are established within the first 18 hours of infection, shaping the intestinal geography and severity of infection despite continuous presence of virulent luminal bacteria. Mechanistically, resistance to A lesion formation is mediated by TLR-My88/Tr-dependent signaling, induced by virulent C. rodium in a gene-dependent manner. The study shows that C. rodium pathogenesis in vivo is restricted to a short window determining disease severity and geography.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the overlap between two populations, such as species or genes, when only a fraction of each population is sampled. This is a common problem in fields like ecology and epidemiology, where data is often incomplete. The new method, called Bay-opt estimation, uses Bayesian inference to account for the sampling rates and produces unbiased estimates of overlap. It also provides a way to quantify the uncertainty of these estimates, which can be used to plan future studies by weighing the trade-off between sampling effort and uncertainty.

The method is based on a special case of the diversity problem, where the total number of objects in each population is known. This is different from most existing indices, which assume complete data and lead to bias. The new method can be used for presence-absence data, but requires species abundance to compute. An example is estimating the overlap between two Plasmod parasites, each with 60 types, from samples that share types. The goal is to quantify the uncertainty in the estimates, as the sampling process is stochastic.

The method can be improved by incorporating whole-genome data as a prior on the distribution of repertoire sizes. This opens analysis of Plasmod spp multig antigen families and general studies of diversity in multig families with fixed or sampled sizes.
Researchers have investigated the mechanisms that regulate the active state of eukaryotic kinases, enzymes that phosphorylate proteins to control various cellular functions. They used cAMP protein kinase as a model and combined biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques to identify conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that work together to control the active state. These interactions include a salt bridge between a lysine in the β-strand and glutamate in α-helix, and electrostatic interaction between phosphorylated loop and α-helix and hydrophobic residues of Regulatory Shell. Contrary to previous thought, the conserved lysine in β-str is not required for phosphorylation but essential for the active state. 

The α-phosphates of ATP interact with lys in β-str, forming a salt with glutamate in αelix. Initially, it was assumed lys was for ATP binding and glutamate for stabilizing lys. Without the salt and electro interaction between loop and α-helix, active state is regulated by Shell. Enhancing hydrophity of from leucine to phenylane connected β-region and α-h through hydro interaction between Sh2 and Sh from β-region and RS α-helix. Replacing lys with glutamine rescued catalytic activity by repositioning lys onto loop. Hypothesized inefficient catalysis due to inability to attain closed conformation due to hydroph clamp, lobe twisting, and misaligned ATP. Breaking salt by mutating glutamate to alanine destabilized active associated with Shell, unable to undergo autophosphorylation, transphosphorylation, or catalysis. Shell assembly restored by coexpressing glutamate with PDK, introducing interaction between phosphorylated loop and αelix. Lys is not required for phosphorylation but structural sensor facilitating state by coordinating β-region with αelix.
American Samoa conducted seven rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF) from 2000-2006 under the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis. The World Health Organization recommends post-MDA surveillance using Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) for epidemiological assessment of recent LF transmission. This study compared the effectiveness of two survey designs for post-M surveillance: a school-based survey of children aged 6-7 and a community-based survey of people aged 8. In 2016, a systematic school-based TAS was conducted in 29 elementary schools and a cluster survey in 28 villages on two main islands of American. Blood samples were collected to test for circulating filarial antigen (CA) using Alere Filariasis Strip. The school TAS identified nine antigen-positive children with an overall CA prevalence of 0.7% and one microfilariaemic 7-year-old child. The community survey identified 102 antigen-positive people with an overall CA of 6.2% and 22 microilaria individuals. School TAS had limited sensitivity and negative predictive value but high specificity and positive value for identifying villages with ongoing transmission. The community survey identified antigen individuals of all ages and foci of high prevalence. Both surveys confirmed recrudence of LF transmission.
In zebraf, sex determination is a complex and influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors, with germ cells, specifically oocytes, playing a crucial role in female development. Research has shown that oocytes are necessary for maintaining the female state throughout the animal's life, but how they control sex differentiation and maintenance is unknown. This study investigated the role of two oocyte-produced signaling molecules, Gdf9 and Bmp, in female determination and sex maintenance in zraf. Mutations in Bmp resulted in females developing normally but switching to males during the mid-to-late juvenile stage and becoming fertile. Additionally, mutations in aromatase cypa1 showed that estrogen production is necessary for development, and Bmp's function in sex maintenance is linked to regulating estrogen synthesis via promoting estrogen-producing granulosa cells in the oocyte follicle. The study found that Bmp mutant females initially develop normally but degenerate during the juvenile stage, with oocytes arresting at early stages and premeiotic cells switching to sperogenic, transforming the gonad to a fully testis. The results provide insights into oocyte regulation of sex maintenance in zraf. The hypothesis is that o-somatic gon interaction stabilizes c19a1 expression and estrogen production by the somatic gon. Consistent with this, the somatic gon expresses probable receptors for Bmp.
Hox proteins play a crucial role in controlling the development of the anterior-posterior body axis in animals by regulating specific sets of genes within their broad expression domains. To achieve high regulatory specificity, it is thought that H proteins co-operate with other transcription factors to activate or repress their targets in a highly context-dependent manner. However, only a few of these factors have been identified. This study analyzes the regulation of the death gene reaper (pr) by the H protein Deformed (D) and suggests that activation of pr expression in the anterior maxillary segment is achieved through a combinatorial interaction of D with at least eight functionally diverse transcription regulators on a minimal enhancer. It is proposed that context-dependent combinations of H proteins and other factors on small modular H response elements (HRE) are responsible for the spatio-temporal expression of H targets. Eight transcription regulators, Apt, G, G, E, En, Sl, Br, Doc, and Disco, are required in addition to H protein D to regulate pr expression in a subset of maxillary cells. The study suggests that proper spatio-temporal H regulation is achieved by the action of multiple regulators: H proteins and a large number of structurally diverse factors.
Researchers studied the genetic requirements for signaling from an autoactive Arabidopsis thaliana NB-LRR protein, ADR-L2, which plays a crucial role in plant defense against pathogens. ADR-L2 functions upstream of salicylic acid (SA) accumulation and can act as a helper to transduce specific activation from sensor NB-LRs. The helper activity does not require an intact P-loop. ADR-L and two related members are required for unregulated cell death in lsd mutant. An autoactive mutation A1-LD484 was generated in a small homology motif MHD, leading to dwarf plants with increased resistance and high SA levels. The phenotype requires intact P, suggesting A1D484 phenotypes reflect canonical NB activation. A1D484 was used to define signaling requirements. Signaling from A1D484 does not require NAD oxidase and is regulated by E1 and At1. Transcription of A484 is correlated with outputs; these are SA-dependent and-independent. Requirements for A484 resemble SA-dependent signal amplification and death observed in LSD. Importantly, A484 autoactivation is controlled by E and SA separable but linked pathways. A model provides insight into SA-dependent regulation, including A2.
Researchers have identified two components of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway in Arabidopsis, SUVH and ID2, which interact with the protein MOR6 to mediate transcriptional silencing. SUV and ID2 can act together with MOR6 or synergistically to silence genes, and ID2 interacts with MOR6 to silence a subset of MOR6 target loci. Other RDM components, including Pol IV, V, R2, and DRM2, are also required for silencing at a subset of MOR6 loci. MOR6 was previously shown to mediate silencing through heterochrom condensation, and the SWI/SNF chrom-remodeling complex interacts with MOR6 and SUV9 to mediate silencing. This study shows that RDM components are involved in both methylation and MOR6-mediated heteroch condensation, linking the two processes to enhance silencing at methylated regions. The interaction between SUV9 and MOR6 suggests that SUV9 binding to methylated DNA may recruit MOR6 to chromatin. MOR6 interacts with ID2 and the SW/S complex to mediate heteroch condensation. Components work together to link methylation and heteroch condensation, enhancing silencing at methyl genomic regions. MOR6 functions in silencing loci targeted by RDM components. Whole-genome methylation and RNA-seq data show release of silencing in mor6 is not associated with loss of methylation. ID2 interacts with MOR6, supporting its role in both RDM and MOR-dependent silencing. ID2 binds Pol-produced noncoding RNAs and interacts SW3, a SW/S subunit, contributing noncoding silencing.
Researchers investigated the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp) in modulating phenotypes in vertebrates, using zebraf as a model. Hsp is a molecular chaperone that buffers genetic variation, and its protective role may account for the variable penetrance and severity of heritable developmental malformations. The study found that Hsp inhibition did not induce a heat shock response or perturb phenotype in wild-type strains, but increased the severity of a recessive eye phenotype caused by a p6 mutation, while decreasing the severity of another caused by su mutation. A previously unobserved spectrum of severe eye malations, including anophthalmia, microphthalm, and nanthalmia, was uncovered by limited Hsp function inhibition. Breeding offspring from unaffected parents led to elevated malformation frequencies, revealing oligogenic nature of this phenotype. Unlike Drosila, Hsp inhibition decreased developmental stability in zraf, indicated by increased asymmetric presentation of anophia, microphthalm, and nanthalm phenotypes. Analysis of p6 mutation suggests a mechanism for buffering by Hsp. The study implies that mild perturbation of H function at developmental stages may underpin variable penetrance and express of anomalies where genotype and environment play a role.
Researchers have identified and characterized N-terminal acetylation in Drosila melanogaster, a common protein modification found throughout the tree of life where the N-terminus of a nascent polypeptide becomes acetylated after the removal of the initiating methion residue. They analyzed amino-terminal peptides from Drosila K167 cells and detected over 1,200 mature Ntermini, showing N acylation occurs with similar frequency in insects as humans. A sole determinant for acylation was found to be the X rule, indicating acylation under all circumstances. This rule was used to genetically engineer proteins to study the relevance of presence or absence of acetyl group, creating an assay to probe functional importance of acylation. The assay was applied by expressing mutated proteins in cell lines and flies. A straightforward strategy to study relevance of acylation in cells and organisms is presented. The X rule appears to be valid in lower and higher eukaryotes, suggesting it can be used to study acylation in all species.
Researchers studied the process of termination in RNA polymerase III (RNAP III), an enzyme responsible for producing transfer RNA (tRNA) in cells. Efficient termination is crucial for cell growth and cancer development, but its mechanisms are not fully understood. They used a genetic approach to identify mutants with gain and loss of termination phenotypes in the yeast Saccharomyces pombe. 122 mutations were mapped to a 3.9 angstrom structure of the RN III elongation complex and cluster in the active center helix, loop, and pore, and funnel, indicating involvement of the cleavage domain of subunit C in termination. Purified RN III from a readthrough mutant showed increased elongation rate, supporting a kinetic model where elongation inversely relates to termination efficiency. Mutants exhibited correlations in vitro and in vivo, and surprisingly, amounts of transcription in vivo. A reporter with processing defect and strong terminator ruled out differences in RNA decay, indicating mutants synthesize more RNA than wild-type cells. Increased activity was unrelated to the III repressor M1. Results show center elements of RN III, including C, are determinants of termination and some activate III for transcription. Similar mutations in cancer suggest an unforeseen mechanism of III activation in disease.
Researchers have developed a method to predict protein-protein interactions mediated by SH2 domains using the structure of SH-phosphope complexes and the FoldX algorithm. This approach is necessary because current experiments only cover a fraction of all protein-protein interactions. The method performs similarly to experimentally derived consensus and substitution matrices in predicting in vitro and in vivo targets of SH domains. It was used to provide a set of high-confidence interactions for human SH domains with known structure and phosphorylation state. Predictions were validated using literature-derived interactions and a probabilistic score from Bayes integration of coexpression, conservation, interaction in other species, shared partners, and functions. The predictions led to a new hypothesis for SH domains role in signaling.

 The method's portability to other SH domains needs to be shown, but FoldX can predict in vitro thermodynamics of protein-phope complexes for nine SH domains, making it applicable for genome-wide predictions. Structure-based prediction of SH-mediated protein interactions has been addressed once. Future methods should account for physics and biology of SH domains. Fold predicted in vivo interactions for nine SH-containing proteins and annotated with supporting information, providing a resource for further testing. Fold performs as well as consensus or substitution matrices in prediction in vitro and vivo interactions. With phosphorylation and structure, Fold can give accurate novel interactions.
Researchers have identified a protein called cyclophilin 40 (Cy40) that can break down toxic protein clumps called amyloids in the brain, which are a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. These amyloids are formed when a protein called tau, which is normally helps with cell structure, becomes misfolded and clumps together. Cy40 is a type of enzyme called a cis peptid-proly isomerase (Pase) that helps regulate the shape of proteins. The study found that Cy40 can break down tau amyloids in a lab dish and in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, improving brain health and memory. Using a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance, they saw that Cy40 interacts with parts of tau that have proline, a type of amino acid. They also found that Cy40 can break down other misfolded proteins with prolines. However, when they removed the Pase part of Cy40, it lost its ability to break down amyids. This suggests a unique property of Cy40 allows it to break amyids without using energy. This is the first time a protein has been shown to break down amyids inside cells. The study suggests that using or delivering Cy40 to the brain could help halt or reverse cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the formation and maintenance of heteroc patterns in cyanobacteria filaments, a type of cellular differentiation in multicellular organisms. The model combines the genetic circuit of a single cyanobacter with the diffusion of nitrogen along the filament, capturing the development and sustainment of heteroc patterns. By simulating the behavior of a single cyanacter under nitrogen deprivation and coupling their genetic circuits via diffusion, the model reproduces the main features of heteroc formation and sustainment observed experimentally. The model highlights the importance of diffusion and external conditions in generating and sustaining heteroc patterns. It also shows that noise plays a crucial role in the onset of differentiation, enabling the development of characteristic heteroc patterns for a range of parameters. This suggests cyanobacteria have an efficient response to environmental conditions. The model consists of a filament of cyanacteria, each with a dynamical circuit, interacting through protein diffusion.
A study was conducted in Cameroon to investigate the association between people's perceptions of the Community Directed Treatment with Ivermect (DTI) program and oncherciasis, and their adherence to iverectin in three regions with high onchias prevalence. The study found that adherence toiverin was comparable in two districts, Bang and Bafia, but lower in Yassi. Perceptions of the program and disease were the most significant factors related to adherence. People with a positive opinion ofiverect distribution campaigns were more compliant than those with a negative opinion (55% vs 40 in Bang, 62 vs 48 in Bafia). Misconceptions about onercias transmission were common, with many believing it was due to lack of hygiene in Bafia and Yassi, and high sugar consumption in Bang. The study suggests that perceptions ofiverect distribution are strongly associated with adherence. In addition to education onercias, health authorities should involve communities and encourage community distributors.
Researchers investigated the relationship between genetic and epigenetic variations and protein biomarkers for cancer and cardiovascular disease by combining DNA methylation and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data with protein measurements. They analyzed 121 biomarkers in relation to DNA methylation at 470,000 positions and over 10 million SNPs in 698-103 samples. Epigen-wide association study (EWAS) and genome-wide association study (GW) analyses were performed, and biomarker, DNA methylation, and SNP data were integrated. The study found 124 loci with significant effects on biomarker levels, with most being cis-regulatory in GWAS and trans in EWAS. Eleven EWAS loci were associated with multiple biomarkers, including one with CXCL11, CX9, IL-12, and IL-18 levels. All EWAS signals overlapping with GW loci were driven by genetic variants, while EW signals were confounded by smoking. Cis-regulatory SNPs for biomarkers had an effect on DNA methylation, but not vice versa. The study found associations between biomarkers and methylation at numerous loci in the genome, likely reflecting genetic, environmental, or secondary effects of disease pathogenesis.
Researchers have found that the varicella zoster virus (VZV) can impair the function of natural killer (NK) cells, a type of immune cell that helps fight off viral infections. VV can infect NK cells and make them unable to respond to stimulation, leading to a loss of ability to kill infected cells and produce cytokines. Interestingly, not only infected NK cells but also uninfected cells exposed to VV in culture were affected. This impairment was due to direct contact between NK cells and VV-infected cells. Analysis of NK cell surface receptors showed no change in expression, but cells were still able to release cytotoxic granules when stimulation was bypassed, suggesting VV paralysed NK from responding. Examination of degranulation signaling components showed perturbation following VV culture. Additionally, VV repressed IF-γ and TNF production, most strongly in infected NK cells. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) also infected NK cells and made them unresponsive to stimulation, but differently affected cytokine production compared to VV. These findings reveal a new strategy VV uses to evade the immune system by paralysing NK function.
Researchers investigated the neural basis of apparent motion (AM), a phenomenon where two stimuli presented at different locations appear to move between them. They found that AM affects detection of gratings along the path, with maximum impairment at high contrast levels, and strongest when target orientation matches inducer orientation. A population model of early visual processing, based on contrast normalization, predicted AM-related activation in visual cortex is too small to cause masking or perceived motion. Instead, it suggests suppression of early responses during AM, consistent with predictive coding theory. Predictive models propose higher-level motion predictions "explain" lower-level responses to expected input. Presentation of inducers evokes responses in V1 cells tuned to locations and properties, interfering with actual stimuli perception. However, masking doesn't necessarily imply V1 activation. Predictive account of processing suggests stimuli provide motion context, suppressing responses along path when predictable. The study examined AM's effect on low-level processing by investigating detection of gratings along the path, finding impairment when target matches inducer orientation. A previous study reported masking at single stimulus level, but not maximum performance reduction linked to uncertainty. The model captures results, but can't rule out effects in other early cortex areas.
HTLV-1 Tax, a protein encoded by the Human T-cell leukemia virus, plays a crucial role in transforming CD4+ T cells by promoting proliferation and survival through activation of the NF-κB pathway and induction of NF-κ target genes. To understand the underlying mechanism of HTLV-1 transformation, it is essential to elucidate how Tax activates IK, a key component of the NF-κ pathway. Previous studies have suggested multiple mechanisms for Tax-induced IK activation, but these are controversial due to primary IK activation and secondary activation by cytokines secreted by Tax-induced IK-NF-κ events. Researchers reconstituted Tax-stimulated IK activation in a cell-free system to dissect essential components for IK activation by Tax and the biochemical mechanism. They found Tax is a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, working with Ubc2, Ubc5, or U7, to catalyze assembly of mixed-link polyubiquitin chains. These chains are responsible for direct IK activation by binding to the NEM subunit of IK. The study revealed biochemical function of Tax in IK activation, utilizing minimal ubiquitination components for NF-κ activation.
Researchers conducted a systematic review of the relationship between the number of individuals introduced individuals (propagule pressure) and the success of alien species establishment. They used Bayesian meta-analytical methods to evaluate this relationship across various taxonomic groups, including invertebrates, herbaceous plants, long-lived trees, and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. The study found a positive effect of propule pressure on establishment in all tested hypotheses, but success was most dependent on a range of 10-100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect was primarily due to analytical approaches, with larger effect sizes in animal introductions than plant introductions. No variation was accounted for by study scale (field to global) or methodology (observational, experimental, or proxy). The study reveals consistency in the relationship between propule pressure and alien establishment.
Interleukin-17 (IL-17) plays a significant role in chronic and severe inflammatory diseases by enhancing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by attenuating the decay of encoding mRNAs. The decay of these mRNAs depends on proteins (AUPs) that target AU-rich elements in the 3'-translated region of mRN and facilitate either decay or stabilization. Research shows that UPs and mRNAs assemble in a ribonucleoprotein complex in the presence of microRNA (miR16), leading to degradation of target mRN. Notably, IL-17 attenuates miR expression and promotes binding of stabilizing UPs over destabilizing UPs, reducing decay. This indicates miR independently directs competition between degrading and stabilizing UPs for mRN. UPs affect about 8% of the human transcriptome and miR is ubiquitously expressed, suggesting IL-17 affects many cellular processes beyond inflammation.

IL-17 modulates the interaction between UPs, miR, and target mRN through specific sequences and structural restraints. Besides IL-17, IL-1 also attenuates mRNA degradation. In epithelial and fibroblast cells, IL- with TN- attenuates degradation of mRN encoding inflammatory mediators, resulting in hyper production of pro-inflammatory mediators. This study reports degradation mRN encoding IL-8, IL-6, and G-CS by the mRNA pathway, depending on UP and mi16. Findings show modulation of UP-miR regulation by IL depends on specific target, mi usage, and differential UP participation.

IL-8 degradation was inhibited by AUF in absence mi16. IL- attenuated mi expression and binding, promoting IL-8 to AUF, stabilizing IL-8. Similar findings for other ARE-mRN indicate various UP compete for target, balance regulated by IL, likely via mi. IL-17 inhibition mi expression and mi using LNA resulted in attenuated decay. Enhancing mi expression by lentiviral constructs resulted in degradation.
A study was conducted in Uganda to investigate the relationship between cattle and human trypanosomiasis in areas with active sleeping sickness. The study focused on two districts, Kaberido and Dokolo, which had reported cases of sleeping sickness in the six months prior to sample collection and those that had not. The results showed that villages with sleeping sickness had a higher odds of infection in cattle with Trypanosoma brucei than those without, with an odds ratio of 2.94. Cattle age was also a significant factor, with those between 18-36 months and over 36 months old having higher odds of Trypanosoma brucei infection than under 18 months. Additionally, villages with sleeping sickness had a higher likelihood of Trypanosoma rhodesense in cattle, with an odds of 25. A higher average Trypanosoma bruce prevalence in a herd was associated with a higher likelihood of Trypanoma rhodes being detected, with an odds of 25. The study found a strong association between high Trypanosoma bruce levels in a herd and likelihood of Trypanoma rhodes and village sleeping sickness status. This could be used to determine risk at village or parish level in endemic districts in Uganda.
Researchers have investigated the role of the NS complex in regulating genes in Drosophila flies. The complex is composed of proteins NS1, NS3, MBD2, MCR2, and MOF, and is involved in the regulation of chromosomal and autosomal genes. While the function of the M complex as a dosage regulator is well understood, the role of the NS complex is poorly characterized. A comprehensive ChIP-seq analysis of NS complex members throughout the Dophila genome found that 85.5% of NS-bound genes are constitutively expressed across cell types. NS-targeted genes have an abundance of histone modifications H4ac, H3me, Hme, and Hac in promoter regions, and well-defined nucleosome-free regions and broad transcription patterns. ChIP-seq of RNA polymerase II in NS1 and NS3-depleted cells showed NS proteins are required for efficient recruitment of II to NS-target promoters. The II reduction coincides with binding of TBP and TFI to promoters, indicating NS is required for optimal recruitment of pre-initiation complex on genes. Genes with most loss of II upon NS knockdown are enriched in Replication Element. The findings show the MO-containing NS complex regulates housekeeping genes by modulating II transcription.
Researchers have created a transgenic mouse model to study facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FD), a progressive muscle disorder caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4 macrosatellite repeat and ectopic expression of DUX, a gene encoding a germline transcription factor. The model recapitulates epigen and D4 expression seen in patients and controls, including high D4 expression in germl, incomplete epigen repression in somatic tissue, and FD-specific variegated D4 expression in sporadic muscle associated with D4 chromatin relaxation. The study suggests somatic epigen silencing of D4 is conserved and contracted D4 arrays are silenced less efficiently, leading to varieg expression of D4 protein in skeletal nuclei. Ch and DNA methylation analyses indicate chrom relaxation of D4 repeats in D4-2.5 mice compared to D-12.5 mice, concord with observed D4 expression, modeling difference between FD patients and individuals. In muscle, D4 activates germl and stem programs while suppressing innate response genes. The model may serve therapeutic studies targeting D4 expression in muscle, as detrimental effects can be reversed by RNA interference. Somatic derepression D4 has been associated with changes D4 chrom structure, characterized decreased methylation and lower. The D- pattern suggests locus-intrinsic property of D4 array, conserved between mouse and human.
Researchers have been trying to develop a vaccine against malaria, a disease caused by Plasmodium falcum parasite, using a protein called Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1). However, the current AMA1 vaccine only protects against strains closely related to the vaccine, not all strains. To overcome this problem, scientists created a vaccine with four diverse AMA1 proteins, called Quax or Q, which elicited polyclonal antibodies that inhibited invasion of both vaccine and non-vaccine strains of the parasite. Comparing polyclonal anti-Q with strain-specific antibodies showed Q induced higher levels of broadly inhibitory antibodies associated with conserved domain-3 and reduced domain-2 responses. Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies against Q reacted with a cross-reactive epitope at the rim of hydrophobic domain-1, which mapped to conserved face of AMA and encompassed the 1-loop. Monoclonal antibodies to the 1-loop were 10-fold more potent than previously characterized AMA-inhib mAbs and mode of action was inhibition of AMA binding to its ligand R2. Unlike previously characterized 3D-specific mAb, the 1-loop inhibitory epitope was conserved across strains. Another mAb bound to domain-3 was broadly inhibitory and blocked proteolytic processing of AMA. By m was weakly inhibitory but synergized with previously strain-transending m, which binds to hydroobic on conserved and inhibits R2 binding AMA. Novel susceptible regions and epitopes identified can improve antigen breadth and inhib response of AMA vaccines. Vaccination with diverse proteins may provide universal coverage by redirecting response to conserved epitopes.
Researchers have discovered a previously unknown mechanism that regulates the timing of mitotic spindle displacement in cells, which is crucial for unequal cell division. The mechanism involves the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), its activator Cdc20/Fizzy, its target cyclin, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). In Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes, mitotic spindle displacement begins at a precise time after chromosomes congress to the metaphase plate. Reducing the function of the proteasome, APC, or C20/Fizzy delayed spindle displacement, while inactivating CD in metaphase caused the spindle to displace early. Experimentally unlinking spindle from this mechanism resulted in premature displacement of incompletely assembled mitotic components. The study found that the delay ensures the spindle does not begin to move until it is fully assembled. This is the first demonstration that mitotic progression times spindle in asymmetric division of an animal cell. The link between cell cycle and asymmetric division might be evolutionarily conserved, as mitotic spindle is displaced at similar stage of mitosis in diverse systems.
Researchers conducted a genome scan to identify genes showing evidence of adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in two populations, the Andeans and Tibetans, who have lived at high altitudes for millennia. The study aimed to understand the genetic basis of physiological responses to high-altitude, such as circulatory, respiratory, and hematological adaptations. Four genetic statistics were used to detect signatures of natural selection, identifying candidate genes and regions in each population separately. Results showed distinct patterns of adaptation between the two populations, with evidence of selection in different genes or regions. One gene, EGLN (PH2), involved in oxygen sensing, showed selection in both groups, but with different variation patterns. Key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes were responsible for adaptation in Andans, and different chromosomal regions in Tibetans. The study suggests a genetic role in high-altitude adaptation and provides a basis for future studies to confirm the role of candidate genes in adaptation.
Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA are a major source of genetic instability that can result from interactions with environmental agents or cellular metabolites. Efficient repair of DSBs is crucial for cell survival, but faulty repair can lead to mutations and chromosomal rearrangements. The choice of repair pathway is important to maintain genomic integrity. Inverted repeats (IRs) near DSBs can channel repair from an accurate pathway to a break-induced replication (BIR) pathway, leading to instability. IRs form unusual structures when in single-strand DNA is formed by D-section. They can form two types of structures: intermolecular single-strand annealing (SSA) leading to inverted dimers and intramolecular SSA to fold-back (FB) structures. Both interfere with accurate repair and channel DSB into BIR, promoting destabilization. Protein complexes process FB with short (12-b) versus long (1-k) loops: MR-Sae2 and Rad-Rad10, respectively. Studies uncover mechanisms of destabilization from DSB repair by IR. Given IR abundance in the genome, findings contribute to understanding IR-mediated destabilization with human disease.
Researchers used the fruit fly Drosoph melanogaster as a model to study Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm infections in vivo. Pseudas aerugin is an opportunistic pathogen that causes both acute and chronic infections in susceptible hosts, and chronic infections are thought to be caused by biofilms. Biofilms are structured, multicellular communities of microbes encased in an extracellular matrix that enable long-term survival in the host. The study aimed to develop an animal model for in vivo study of P aerugin biofilms in Dophila. At 24 hours post-infection, Doph, P aerugin biofilms localized and were visualized in Doph crops. These biofilms had a characteristic structure and extracellular matrix composed of DNA and exopolysacide. P aerugin cells from vivo biofilms had increased resistance to antibiotics compared to planktonic cells. Biofilm formation was dependent on expression of exopolyside genes, as pel:: mutant failed to form biofilms. The pel:: mutant was more virulent than PA1, while hyperbio strain PA3 demonstrated less virulence than PA1, indicated by survival of infected flies at 14 postinfection. Bio formation by PA1 and PA3 in the crop was associated with induction of diptericin, cecin A andros antimicrobial peptide expression 24 postin. In contrast, infection with non-bioforming pel:: resulted in decreased gene expression in fly.
Researchers studied the vasopressin 1 receptor 1 (Av1) gene, which plays a crucial role in mediating social behaviors, and found that its expression varies between and within species. They investigated the contribution of the proximal 5' flanking sequence and microsatellite variation in the Av1 gene to its expression and behavior. Using homologous recombination in mice, they found that the proximal 5' flanking sequence contributes to differences in Av receptor distribution in the brain, specifically in the thalamus, amygdala, ventral pallid, and hippocampus. They also found that the Av1 microsatellite structure contributes to Av1 expression in these regions, mirroring inter and intra-species differences in receptor patterns in voles. This is the first evidence that polymicrosat elements near behaviorally relevant genes contribute to diversity in brain expression, providing a mechanism for generating diversity at individual and species levels. However, results suggest that species-specific patterns are mediated by elements outside the 5' flanking region of the gene. The 4kb of 5 flanking region also contributes to species patterns Av receptor in brain. Transgenic mice carrying the prairie Av1 locus display Av receptor similar to prairie voles, and this difference leads to increased affiliative behavior response to AV. Experiments demonstrate that Av1 expression in brain directly contributes to inter and intra-spec variability in AV behaviors. The Av1 is a model for exploring genomic mechanisms to diversity brain expression and behavior relevant to human.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) can cause double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the switch regions of immunoglobulin genes and the c-MYC gene in yeast cells, leading to chromosomal translocations. This process is similar to what happens in human cells, where it can cause Burkitt's lymphoma, a type of cancer. In yeast, stable-loops are formed during transcription in mutants of TH, a complex involved in RNA biogenesis. These loops trigger instability and deamination by A. To understand how this instability is caused by RNA biogenesis impairment and A, the researchers created a yeast system with mammalian switch and c-M sequences to study chromosomal rearrangements in wild-type and TH mutants. They found A acts on heterologous and c-M transcribed sequences to cause DSBS, leading to chromosomal translocations via Non-homous End Joining (NHE). A-induced translocations were enhanced in TH null mutants, suggesting A-mediated DS depend on-loop formation. This study provides new insights into RNA biogenesis preventing rearrangements and A-mediated genome instability, and shows that uracil residues produced by A-deamination are processed into DS and chromosomal rearrangements by conserved DNA repair functions in yeast and human cells.
Researchers studied how Escheria coli cells divide their chromosomes when their cell division plane is not properly positioned. They used time-lapse imaging to track the movement of DNA and found that the protein Fts can pump up to 80% of the chromosome (3.7 Mb) from one daughter to another at an average rate of 1700-800 bp/s. DNA movement is rare and mostly occurs at late stages of cell division when the division protein ZipA has dissociated and the septum is closed to a narrow channel smaller than 250 nm. This suggests the narrow constriction is necessary for DNA movement by Fts. The study shows E. coli can reposition their chromosomes when division is not localized. In cells with misplaced division planes, Fts can move as much as 3.7 Mb of DNA, which is the entire chromosome, at an average speed of 2100-900 bp/s. This is different from previous findings that Fts only moves 400 kb near the replication region in normal cells. The study estimates translocated DNA and speed, and direction of movement, and suggests timing may be determined by Fts ability to bind to DNA when the sept is closed. The work also implies a cell cycle checkpoint that prevents daughters from separating.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework for selecting the optimal set of peptides for epitope-based vaccines using integer linear programming. Epitope-based vaccines have various applications, including therapeutic and prophylactic approaches for infectious diseases and cancer. The development of an epitope-based vaccine relies on knowledge of specific antigens and immunogenic peptides, called epitopes, which are key components of the vaccine. Due to regulatory, economic, and practical concerns, the number of epitopes in a vaccine is limited, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding epitopes are highly polymorphic, making each person's MHC class I and II molecules specific. A combination effective for one person can be ineffective for another, making optimal epitope selection important. The framework uses linear programming to formulate various vaccine design problems and identify optimal epitopes from a set of predicted or experimentally determined epitopes. It selects the set with maximum likelihood of eliciting a broad and potent immune response. The approach allows flexible formulation of numerous design variants, including immunological requirements such as coverage of epitopes from each antigen, coverage of MHC alleles, and avoidance of epitopes with high mutation rates. An implementation outperforms a greedy strategy and evolutionary algorithm with runtimes of seconds for typical sizes.
A study investigated the role of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in facilitating HIV-1 transmission to the cervico-vaginal tissue. The majority of HIV-1 infections in women occur through vaginal intercourse, where the virus in semen is deposited on the cervico-vaginal mucosa. Semen is not just a carrier of HIV-1, but also contains biological factors, including cytokines, that may affect HIV-1 transmission. IL-7, a prominent cytokine in semen of healthy individuals, is increased in semen of HIV-1-infected men. The study simulated an in vivo situation by depositing HIV-1 on cervico-vaginal tissue with IL-7 concentrations comparable to those in semen of HIV-1-infected individuals. IL-7 significantly enhanced virus replication in infected cerv-vaginal tissue and lymphoid explants. Analysis of cells from infected tissues showed IL-7 reduced CD4 T cell apoptosis and increased the fraction of cycling CD4 cells. High IL-7 levels in semen may be relevant to the survival of HIV-1-infected cells in the cervicoaginal mucosa at initial infection, promoting local and dissemination of infection. The study demonstrates IL-7 facilitates HIV-1 male-to-female transmission and suggests high IL-7 in semen may make the female genital mucosa more susceptible to HIV-1 acquisition.
Researchers studied the interaction between the Zika virus (ZIK) and the RNA interference (RNA) response in Aedes aegypt cells, the primary mosquito that transmits the virus. They found that ZIK induces the production of virus-specific small interfering (si) RNAs and PI-interacting (pi) RNAs. However, the piRNAs lacked the characteristic signature of typical small RNAs. The siRNAs were loaded into the Ago2 protein, but silencing this protein did not enhance virus replication. Increased replication in Ago2 knockout cells indicated an antiviral role of the exo-si pathway. The study also found that ZIK capsid protein amplified replication of a reporter virus, unlike yellow fever protein which inhibits the exo pathway. The findings elucidate ZIK-mosquito RNA interactions important for its spread.
A study was conducted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to investigate the association between Sporothrix species and clinical manifestations of sporrichosis. Fifty patients with different clinical manifestations were analyzed, and their isolates were studied using phenotypic and genotypic methods. The results showed that Sporoth brasiliensis was associated with disseminated cutaneous infection, mucosal infection, and hypersensitivity reactions, whereas Sporoth schenck sensu stricto was associated with less severe and more localized disease. Patients infected with Spor brasili required shorter itraconazole treatment duration (16 weeks) compared to those with Spor schck (24 weeks). This suggests Sporrix species are linked to different manifestations of sporrichosis and Spor brasili is effectively treated with itraconazole. This is the first study to demonstrate genotypic identification of Sporrix species and clinical aspects of human sporrich. The majority of isolates were identified as Spor schck, but this study adds new information on Sporili disease and supports careful speciation of Sporrix isolates for clinical care. Sporili has been reported in other Brazilian states, but frequency is lower than Sporck. Sporili caused typical forms of sporrich (lymphocutaneous and cutaneous) but also disseminated. Clinical presentations of sporrich by Sporrix are variable and poorly understood.
Recent studies have suggested that a significant portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed beyond annotated genes, but the nature and quantity of these transcripts remained unclear. Researchers used single-end and paired RNA-Seq and tiling to assess the quantity and composition of transcripts in Poly+ RNA from human and mouse tissues. Relative to tiling, RNASeq identified many transcribed regions outside known exons and non-coding RNAs, mostly introns, suggesting they are fragments of pre-mRNAs. Chromosomal locations of intergenic regions in RNASeq are near genes, consistent with alternative splicing and polyadenylation, promoter and terminator transcripts, or new exons. Reads bridging splice sites identified 5,544 new exons, affecting 3,554 genes. Remaining seqags correspond to single reads with characteristics of random sampling from low background or small transcripts (median=111bp) at higher levels, displaying sequence conservation and originating from open chromatin. Bona fide intergenic transcripts exist, but their number is low compared to exons, and genome not as pervasively transcribed as reported.
Researchers have developed a new method to improve the thermostability of a protein called Bacillus subtilis YA LO domain, which is used in biotechnology. They used a combination of computer and experimental techniques to increase its thermost by 31 degrees Celsius, making it suitable for use in thermophilic systems. The method involves five steps: screening for thermost mutants, experimental evaluation, computational redesign, reevaluation, and combination of multiple mutations. This method is simple and effective, and can be applied to proteins where other methods fail. 

A previous study mutated a residue to alanine, increasing fluorescence tenfold, but the engineered protein has moderate thermost. A more thermost version is needed for studying anaerobic microorganisms, especially thermophilic ones. The success rate of 62% shows the effectiveness of the screening. Eight thermost sites were identified, five at the dimer interface, suggesting stronger interactions increase thermost. Among tested, V120 has highest thermost at 54.2°C. Proteins with high stability are desirable. Three protein engineering methods exist: directed evolution, consensus, and rational design. Each has strengths and weaknesses, and has improved therability with success.
Researchers studied the diversity of sand flies in the Lutzia genus on Barro Island in Panama, a region where cutaneous leishmanias is a health threat to residents and tourists. They used DNA sequencing to determine the diversity and relationships of these flies, and found two "cryptic" species, Lu. sp. vespilion and Lu. gzi. They detected Leish DNA in 43.3% of Lu. trapi, 26.3% of Lu. gzi, and 0% of other sand species. The same ITS-1 sequence was found in Leish infecting Lu. trapi and. Lu. gzi, similar to Leish viannia naiff in GenBank, a previously unknown in Panama but known to cause cutaneous leishias in northern and central America. Distinct Wolia strains were found in three sand species, including Lu. trapi, co-occurring with Leish. Two species, Lu. trap and Lu. gzi, carried Leish at high frequency and are likely vectors of leishias to humans or mammals. A single Leish species, Le. naiff, was identified in both, known to cause cutaneous in America but not reported in Panama, suggesting its range may have expanded or introduced. Leish and Wolia in Lu. trap identifies a vector for disease control.
Researchers have investigated how human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is reactivated in dendritic cells (DC), which are immune cells that play a crucial role in fighting infections. They found that a protein called mitogen-activated kinase (MS) is involved in this process. MS works with a protein called CREB, which binds to a specific part of the CMV genome called the major early promoter (MP). This binding allows MS to be recruited to the MP, where it phosphorylates histones, leading to changes in chromatin structure. These changes enable CMV to exit latency and express its genes. The study suggests that CREB's role in CMV reactivation is not only as a transcription factor, but also in making chromatin modifications conducive to gene expression. Inhibiting the interaction between CRE and MS could be a therapeutic strategy to prevent CMV reactivation. 

In vitro studies showed that chromatin bound to the c-fos promoter is resistant to MS-mediated phosphorylation, but CRE binding to the promoter promotes histone phosphorylation, similar to CMV latency and reactivation. An adenovirus vector was used to study the relationship between ER-MS, CRE-histone H phosphorylation, and IE expression from latency. Transfecting DCs with siRNAs showed that MS binding to MP before reactivation supports this. MS inhibition of IE expression from latency in DC is sensitive and reactivation involves histone phosphorylation bound to latent MP. MS phosphorylation is dependent on concurrent CRE binding to MP. The regulation of MP during CM latency and reactivation provides evidence for interaction between MS and CRE at promoters, controlling gene expression of a clinically important pathogen. Histone phosphorylation is associated with rapid genes, promoting hyperacetylation in a MAP and MS dependent manner, influencing CM reactivation if MP is subject to same regulation.
Researchers have discovered a crucial role for the protein NOL11 in the development of the face and skull in vertebrates, including frogs and mammals. N11 is essential for the production of ribosomes, which are vital for all living cells, but defects in ribosome production lead to a group of disorders called ribosomies. The study found that N11 is highly expressed in the cells that form the face and skull in both frogs and mice. When N11 was reduced in frogs, ribosome production was impaired, cells died, and the face and skull developed abnormally. However, blocking a protein called p53, which helps remove damaged cells, rescued the face and skull defects but not the ribosome problem. This suggests a conserved mechanism between ribosome and cell survival in face development. The study found that N11 is required for ribosome production and cell survival in the face cells that form the skull, but not in other cells at the same stage. Restoring p53 and N11 partially rescued the face defects but not ribosome production. The study provides new insight into the relationship between ribosome production and face development.
Researchers have developed a high-density protein microarray to identify proteins that can be used as diagnostic markers for leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Leptira interrogans. The microarray contained 2,421 proteins, representing 61% of the bacterium's proteome, and was tested against IgG antibodies from 274 individuals, including those with acute, convalescent, and healthy subjects from regions with high, endemic, and no transmission of leptpi. A nitrocellulose blot assay validated the microarray results, identifying 16 antigens that distinguish acute cases from healthy individuals in high transmission areas and 18 that convalescent cases. Some identified antigens, such as Lip32, non-identical domains of Lig, Gro, and Lo22, are known to be recognized by human sera, validating the serodiagnostic approach. Novel antigens, including hypothetical LIC15, showed good sensitivity and specificity for both acute and convalescent patients. This study is the first large-scale evaluation of immunodominant antigens associated with naturally acquired leptiral infection and identified known seragnostic leptiral antigens recognized by antibodies in leptpi cases. The novel antigens may be used to develop new tests and improve current assays for diagnosing this neglected disease. Further research is needed to assess their utility in deployable platforms.
Researchers studied the immune response of mosquitoes to a fungus called Beauveria bassiana, which is a pathogen to mosquitoes. They used the malaria-carrying mosquito Anopheles gambia as a model to investigate the role of melanization, a potent immune mechanism in arthropods, in defense against this fungus. They found that melanin formed on all stages of the fungus, including conidia, germ tubes, and hyphae, but did not stop its growth. Silencing key regulators of melanization, TEP and CL8, abolished melan on hypha but not on germinating conidia or tubes. A layer of hemocytes surrounded germinating conidia but not hypha, suggesting melanization of early stages is cell-mediated and late is humoral dependent on T and CL8. Microscopic analysis showed association of T with hypha surfaces and requirement of both T and CL8 for recruiting phenolase to these. Fungal growth was rapid in T and CL8 knockdown mosquitoes with increased sensitivity to B infections. Melan response retards B growth and dissemination.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of four compounds, bafilomycin (BAF), myopholic acid (M), castanospermine (CAS), and deoxojirimycin (DN), in blocking dengue virus (DENV) infection in the mosquito Aedes aegypt. These compounds are known to inhibit deng virus factors (DENVFs) in mammals and were tested for their ability to prevent infection in the mosquito. The compounds were administered through injection, sugar feeding, or blood feeding, and RNA interference (RNAi) silencing of target genes. Results showed that injection of 5µM BAF and 25µM M prior to feeding on virus-infected blood inhibited DENV in the midgut at 7 days post-infection by 56% and 60, and in saliv gland at 14 post-infection by 90 and 83, respectively. Treatment with CAS or DN did not affect susceptibility to virus. Ingestion of B and M through sugar or blood meal resulted in various degrees of virus inhibition. RNA silencing of vPase subunit and IMP genes reduced DENV, indicating B and M inhibition occurred through inhibition of these DENVFs. Timing of B and M administration was crucial, treatment after exposure diminished antiviral effect. The study provides proof-of-principle that chemical or RNA depletion of DENV vPase and IMP can suppress DENV in adult Aegi, which may reduce transmission.
Researchers have investigated the role of cell volume in the dynamics of seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization, which are abnormal brain states characterized by excessive neuronal depolarization. They used a mathematical model that incorporates cell swelling, ion concentrations, and oxygen supply to demonstrate the transition between seizure and spreading states in response to changes in osmotic pressure. The study found that cell volume acts as a bifurcation parameter, meaning it can cause a sudden change in behavior, and identified a ceiling that separates seizure from spreading depression and another that demarcates spreading from anoxic depolar. The research highlights the protective role of glial buffering against seizures and depression and provides insights into anoxic depolar and cell swelling during ischemia. The study suggests that seizures, spreading, depression, and anoxicolar lie on a continuum of neuronal behavior that can be understood by considering ion concentrations, homeostasis, and swelling in response to osmotic pressure. A unified framework is proposed for a range of neuronal behaviors that may be important in understanding and developing interventions for these pathological states.
Researchers investigated the role of the NLR3 inflamome in the response to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a fungal pathogen that causes paracidiomycosis, a prevalent in Latin America. They found that murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells release IL-1 in response to P. brasili infection through a Syk, caspase-1, and NLR3 dependent manner. P. bras-induced NLR inflamome activation required potassium efflux, reactive oxygen species, phagolysosomal acid, and cathepsin release. Using mice lacking IL-1 receptor, they showed IL-1 has a role in killing P. bras by murine macrophages. The study demonstrates the NLR inflome senses and responds to P. bras cells and plays a role in host defense against the fungus. Further studies are needed to determine IL-1 and NLR inflome role in vivo and how IL-1 activates macrophages for killing activity.
Toxoplas gondii is a brain-tropic parasite that infects various cells, including astrocytes and neurons in vitro, but primarily resides in neurons in vivo. Research suggests that neurons are persistently infected because they lack the ability to clear intracellular parasites. To test this theory, a novel Toxoplas-mouse model was created to mark and track host cells interacting with parasites, even transiently. Findings show Tooplas has a strong predilection for interacting with neurons throughout CNS infection, which remains even with IF-γ depletion, a mechanism by which murine astrocytes clear parasites. This suggests neurons are not incidentally infected, but Tooplas's primary in vivo target. 

Tooplas invades both astrocytes and neurons in vitro, but predominantly interacts with neurons in vivo. One possibility is that astrocytes are infected and killed, leaving neurons as primary host for persistent infection. Alternatively, Tooplas primarily interacts with neurons, persisting in these cells as they interface with parasite. Studies imply Toop encysts in neurons due to inability to clear intracellular parasites, but this has not been directly addressed in vivo due to lack of techniques to identify transiently infected cells. A Tooplas strains were generated to inject Cre recombinase into host cells, revealing neurons as majority of GFP+ parenchymal CNS cells regardless of time or infecting strain. This contradicts "astrocy-killing" model of CNS-Tooplas interactions. Understanding host-pathogen dynamics will provide therapies for currently incurable pathogens. Toop is estimated to chronically infect CNS of world's population.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to explain how cells move and change shape during a process called lamellipodial motility. This process involves the interaction between actin, a protein that makes up the cell's skeleton, and myosin, a protein that helps the cell move. The model shows that the cell's movement depends on three key factors: how strong myosin is, how sticky the cell is, and how fast actin grows. If myin is weak, the cell stays still and symmetrical. If myin is strong enough, the cell starts to move. The direction of movement depends on the cell's boundary conditions. If actin grows slowly, the cell moves in one direction, but if fast, myin spreads along the curved parts of the cell. This feedback loop between myin, actin, and movement is key to the cell's ability to move. Simulations show that moving cells can have different shapes, from straight to curved, in agreement with experiments.
Researchers have developed a new method to assess the reliability of protein-protein interactions (PPI) networks, which are complex networks of proteins that interact with each other to perform various biological functions. With the advancement of experimental techniques such as yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) and tandem purification (TAP), large amounts of PI data are being generated, but they contain high levels of noise and incompleteness. For example, YH screens have a false positive rate of up to 64% and false negative rate of 43-71%, while T experiments have comparable levels of noise. The new technique uses a geometric model to evaluate the confidence of interactions in PI networks and predict new ones, achieving specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90. It was applied to the human PI network from BioGRID, predicting 251 interactions, a significant fraction of which correspond to proteins sharing common terms. The predicted interactions were validated in HPRD and BioGRID databases. The method is available online.
Researchers have developed a fruit fly model to study myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM), a neurological disease caused by a non-coding CT repeat expansion. They tested the role of interactions between expanded CTG and CAG transcripts, which are antisense and sense versions of the same gene. The study found that co-expressing both transcripts increased toxicity and led to the generation of 21-nt repeat-derived siRNAs. These small RNAs targeted genes with CAG repeats, such as Ataxin-2 and TATA protein, which have CAG repeats in both flies and humans. This suggests that repeat-derived siRNAs may enhance toxicity in diseases with antisense transcription.

The study showed that non-coding CT repeats confer length-dependent toxicity in brain and muscle of flies, similar to mammals. Expanded CTG transcripts accumulated in nuclei and affected splicing, indicating key features of DM. To understand CUG toxicity, researchers created flies with pure CT repeats in a protein's 3'UTR. These recapitulated human CUG diseases. Given 70% of genes have antisense transcription, they tested co-expressing CT and CAG transcripts. Co-expressing CAG with CT repeats resulted in enhanced toxicity and triplet-derived siRNAs.

Triplet repeat expansions in noncoding regions cause several diseases, including DM, fragile X, spinocerebellar ataxia, and Huntington's disease. DM, FAS, S8, and HD2 are caused by CT expansions. Antisense occurs widely in the genome, defining its role and impact on repeat diseases may provide insight. Drosila is a system to study neurodegenerative diseases relevant to humans.
Researchers have re-examined the phylogeny and virulence of the soft rot-causing bacterium Pectacterium sp. SCC3, which was isolated from a diseased potato in Finland in the 1980s. Genomic analysis revealed that SCC3, previously classified as P. carotorum, is now accurately classified as P. wasiae. The study indicates that P. wasiae has been present in potato fields worldwide, unnoticed. A combination of genomic and in planta experiments identified features that distinguish SCC3 and other P. wasiae from other soft rot bacteria, including the absence of a type III secretion system contributing to virulence in other rot species. Experimentally established virulence determinants include a putative transcription regulator SirB, two redundant type VI secretion systems, and two horizontally acquired clusters Vic1 and Vic2, containing virulence genes. The genome also revealed traits related to life in planta or specific conditions, such as a benzoic acid/salicy acid carbox methyltransferase of eukary origin. The findings suggest that soft bacteria have a reservoir of unknown traits used in the poorly understood latent stage in planta. The study provides a basis for further investigation of virulence and phylog of soft bacteria and potentially other bacteria.
Researchers investigated how the changes in protein composition of mitochondria occur when they are dysfunctional due to a lack of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mitochondria are the energy-producing structures within cells, and their dysfunction is linked to various human diseases, including aging and cell death. The study used a network analysis of protein data to examine the changes in mt-depleted (ρ) mitochondria. They found that proteins involved in typical mitochondrial functions were downregulated, while those involved in mtDNA repair and protein transport were upregulated. This suggests that cells attempt to compensate for the lack of mtDNA by adjusting protein expression and transport. The study also found that mt protein composition changes the organization of mitochondrial networks in response to dysfunction. The research provides a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunction. 

The analysis of protein networks revealed the biological implications of regulatory mechanisms under dysfunctional states. A systematic data-integrative approach was used to evaluate proteomics data and identify functional modules of proteins, which can be valuable for computational biology working on gene and proteomics. The study found 31% of proteins were non-referenced, possibly novel or with localizations affected by mt depletion. Different states change expression and localization of proteins in mitochondria. A network of reliable proteins was constructed to analyze systemic properties under ρ state. Mitochondrial dysfunction due to mt damage is involved in diseases and likely driving aging and apoptosis.
Researchers have developed a method to deduce the rates of protein synthesis in living cells (in vivo) from rates measured in a lab setting (in vitro). They introduced a concept called "kinetic distance" to compare the kinetics of multi-step processes in different environments. This distance depends on transition rates and can be interpreted in terms of energy barriers. They minimized the distance between in vitro and in vivo processes, imposing that the deduced rates reproduce a known property, such as overall speed in vivo. To demonstrate the method's power, they applied it to protein synthesis by ribosomes, a key process of gene expression. They described the process by a cod-specific model with three pathways and determined individual rates in vitro. Then, they predicted in vivo rates by minimization and validated with three independent in vivo data: cod-dependent speeds, cod dynamics, and error frequencies. Agreement was found between theory and experiment without adjusting parameters. Deduced in vivo rates led to smaller errors than in vitro, primarily due to improved tRNA selection. The method is simple computationally and can be applied to biomolecular processes with detailed in vitro kinetics.
Researchers studied the evolution of Helicobacter pylori, a type of bacteria that infects humans, by analyzing DNA sequences from 97 isolates, including 34 pairs of sequential samples taken from 0.25 to 10.2 years apart and 29 individuals from 10 families. They found that genetic diversity increased over time in a predictable manner, similar to a clock, and estimated short-term mutation and recombination rates. The short-term mutation rate was 1.4×10^-6 to 4.5×10^-6 per nucleotide per year, with three times more substitutions introduced by recombination than mutation. Long-term rate over millennia was 5-17 times lower due to removal of non-synonymous mutations by purifying selection. This contrasts with previous estimates of 1.4×^-9 per year for Escherichia coli and Salmonella divergence, and 1.4×^-6 to 4.5×^-6 for H. pylori over decades. The study suggests short-term rates vary greatly between species, spanning orders of magnitude.
Researchers have discovered that melanopsin, a pigment found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells, plays a significant role in visual perception beyond driving reflex responses such as circadian entrainment and pupillary movements. They investigated its contribution to conventional visual pathways and found melanin projections extend to the dorsal geniculate nucleus, the origin of thalamocortical neurons. This input supports physiological responses in the geniculate and cortex in mice lacking rods and cones, a model of advanced retinal degeneration. Using chromatic stimuli, they isolated melanin-derived responses in mice with an intact visual system, revealing strong melanin input to 40% of neurons in the genic showing activation to light. Melanin input increases the firing rate of these neurons, indicating it encodes irradiance. This was confirmed in melanin knockout mice. The study establishes melanin photoreception as a significant source of sensory input to the thalamortical system, providing irradiance information allowing responses in the absence of rods and cones. This identifies melanin as a potential origin of visual perception and may support vision in retinal degeneration.
HIV-1 infection is associated with a significant depletion of mucosal CD4 T cells, which play a crucial role in regulating the immune response to antigens at mucosal surfaces. This study investigated whether CD4 cell depletion in HIV-1-infected individuals affects humoral responses to antigens at mucosal surfaces. A comprehensive analysis of systemic and mucosal humoral responses to intestinal microbiota showed reduced IgG responses to antigens from Proteobacteria and Firmutes, but not Bacteroidetes. Intestinal secretions of HIV-1-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy exhibited elevated IgM levels and decreased IgA/Ig and IgG/Ig ratios of antibodies to various microbial and food antigens. The findings indicate reduced mucosal cells' ability to switch from IgM to other isotypes, limiting their capacity to react to gut antigens. Decreased microbiota-specific IgA and IgG may contribute to microbial translocation across the mucosal barrier and systemic dissemination, driving chronic inflammation in HIV-1-infected individuals. 

The study found elevated total and antigen-specific IgM in intestinal secretions, reduced Ig/Ig and Ig/Ig ratios of antibodies to microbial and food antigens, reduced Ig levels to Proteobacteria and Firmutes antigens in plasma, and a negative correlation between CD4 counts and Ig levels. Altered mucosal humoral responses in HIV-1-infected may be due to depleted or altered CD4 TF and T cells, warranting further investigation. The study shows low interdependence of Ig responses between intestinal and systemic compartments. HIV-1-infected individuals with low CD4 counts have reduced plasma Ig to Proteacteria and Firmutes antigens. Antireviral-treated individuals displayed increased IgM and decreased Ig/Ig and Ig/Ig ratios to mucosal antigens, indicating lack of help for class recombination.
Researchers have proposed a new model for understanding population dynamics in ecosystems, where the growth of one species is balanced by the collapse of another, releasing resources for the remaining. This mechanism is relevant in communities with strain-specific collapses, such as bacteria due to bacteriophages, or ecosystems with infectious diseases. The emergent dynamics is characterized by "diversity waves" triggered by collapses of dominating populations, with diversity peaking at the beginning and decreasing exponentially. Species abundances have a bimodal time-aggregated distribution, with lower peaks of recently collapsed or introduced species and upper not yet collapsed. The self-organized peak structure has long memory across waves, giving a scale-free time-aggregated distribution with an exponent of 1.7. The model is robust to variations in rules such as diffusion, growth rates, and bet-hging strategies. Simulations preserve patterns of collapse dynamics and scale-free distribution for most species. The fitness definition of a species by long-term growth rate is inappropriate, as growth is zero in this model. Population dynamics in saturated environments is described by neutral drift with resource differences, introducing a model with episodic collapses. A collapsed population is replenished by diffusing individuals from other environments, with collapse probability increasing with size. This results in a steady state at carrying capacity, with diversity waves at longer timescales. The system is described in terms of waves, an emergent property with population growing while diversity decaying.
Researchers have studied the chemotaxis of Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria, to understand how it navigates its environment. Chemaxis is the ability to move towards or away from chemicals, which is crucial for survival and evolution. E. coli moves by sensing chemical concentrations and adjusting its flagella, which are whip-like structures, to change direction. The conventional understanding is that E. coli navigates by adjusting the probability of tumbling, or changing direction, when sensing a change in concentration. However, simulations suggest an additional mechanism: the angle of tumbling also depends on swimming direction along the gradient. This small difference in tumbling angle results in a significant increase in velocity along the gradient. The study proposes a new level of optimization in E. coli's chemaxis, achieved by adjusting flagella switching and tumbling angle. This strategy may be used by other bacteria with similar chemaxis behavior.
Researchers have found that the Stat3 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), which are essential for establishing tolerance by presenting self-peptides to autoreactive thymocytes and diverting them into regulatory T cells. Activation of the NFκB pathway in TE precursors is necessary for TE maturation and proliferation, but Stat3 signaling also contributes to TE homeostasis. A constitutively active Stat3 in the TE compartment increases TE cellularity and bypasses the need for positively selected thymocytes to form the medull region. Conversely, deleting Stat disrupts medull architecture and reduces TE cells. Stat does not affect TE proliferation, but promotes survival of immature MHCloCDlo TE precursors. In contrast, altering the TE compartment, enforced or deleting Stat does not affect TE cellularity or organization.
Researchers have identified 511 small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) in the bacterium Clostridium difficile, a common cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea. Using a combination of computational and experimental approaches, they found 251 putative regulatory RNAs, including 94 intergenic regulators, 91 cis-antisense RNAs, and 66 riboswitches. Expression of 35 RNAs was confirmed through specific experiments. Some RNs, including antisense RN involved in controlling Clostrid autolytic activity, showed growth-dependent expression profiles. 16 predicted c-di-G-responsive ribwitches were expressed and shown to regulate motility and biofilm formation. Abundant RNs encoded by Clostr CRIS loci may aid survival in phage-rich gut communities. This study provides a basis for future characterization of RN regulation in Clostrid difficile.
Researchers have found that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein downregulates the abundance of a liver-specific microRNA called mi-122 by promoting its destabilization through the inhibition of a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly (A) polymer called GL-2. This decrease in mi-122 expression results in the dysregulation of its functions, including its proviral activity for HCV. High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from liver biops revealed that the 22-nucleotide (nt) prototype mi-122 is modified at its 3' end by 3- terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. The proportion of mi-122 bearing a single nucleotide tail is decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV. These single-nucle-tailed mi-122 isomers display increased miRNA activity and stability compared to the 22-nt prototype mi-122. The 3-terminal extension is catalyzed by the unique nucleotidyl transfer activity of GL-2, which can add any ribonucle without preference to the mi-122 3 end. The H core protein specifically inhibits GL-2, and its interaction with GL-2 in the cytoplasm is responsible for mi-122 downregulation. In addition to mi-122, inhibition of GL-2 by the H core affects multiple miRNAs by decreasing the proportion of mono-adenylated isomers. Sequencing of small RNAs from liverops showed that among the top 50 most expressed miRN in liver tissues, six mi exhibited a decrease in 3-end adenylated isomer levels upon H infection. mi-122 levels in human liverops from healthy subjects and patients with H were analyzed, showing decreased levels in specimens from patients (66.3%, 72.7%, and 74.1% in H-1, H-2, and H-3 respectively) compared to normal. The results demonstrate that regardless of types 23- and 24-nt mi-122 bearing single or dinucleotide, their proportions were decreased in tissues from patients with H. The non-templ addition of adenyl residues, the major modification of mi-122, was inhibited by H.
Researchers have discovered a pattern of acquired immunity to Trypanosoma brucei infection in wild lions in the Serengeti ecosystem. This is significant because Trypanosoma causes disease in humans and livestock throughout sub-Saharan Africa, and previous studies have shown no evidence of immunity to natural infections. The study found a decrease in prevalence of T. brucei infection in lions consistent with an increase in cross-immunity from exposure to the genetically diverse species T. congolense, the causative agent of human sleeping sickness. T. bruce rhodesense disappears by 6 years of age in response to cross-immunity from other trypan, including non-pathogenic subspecies T. bruce bruce. This suggests novel pathways for vaccinations against trypanosomias despite the complex antigenic surface proteins of these parasites. 

Sereni lions are ideal candidates for acquired immunity due to co-infection with multiple trypan species and exposure to various subspecies. They are infected with T cong, bruce, and bodes, viv, and sim. Trypan switch surface glycoproteins every 3-5 days to avoid host recognition. This is the first epidemiological evidence of acquired immunity to trypan in any host. It's unlikely innate immunity is responsible, as the pattern is only seen in T bruce and not cong. Observations are consistent with immunity mounted against cong, allowing lions to clear T bruce by 3-5 years and eliminate bodes by 6. Frequent exposure by tse bites accelerates immunity, prevalence is lowest in high-exposure areas, as seen in wood lions compared to plains.
Researchers used mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis to explore the idea that mechanistic models of human coagulation cascades, despite uncertainty, can be computationally screened for points of fragility, which could serve as therapeutic targets. They tested this hypothesis on a well-studied coagulation cascade model, validated from literature. The model, composed of 92 proteins and 148 protein-protein interactions, was validated using 21 datasets from different in vitro coagulation models. Simulated platelet activation and thrombin profiles in presence and absence of anticoagulants were consistent with measured values, with mean correlation 0.87 across trials. Sensitivity coefficients, measuring robustness or fragility of mechanisms, were calculated using Monte Carlo. In absence anticoagul, and surface factor X/activated factor (Xa) and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were fragile, while IX/IX and V/VIII activation and activity were robust. Anti-Xa and thrombin inhibitors are anticoagulant classes, e.g. anti-Xa have FDA approval for prevention venous thromboembolism following surgical intervention and treatment deep venous thromosis pulmonary embolism. In vitro and vivo evidence supports IXIX activity robust. Results support hypothesis computationally derived fragility human cascades as basis for target selection despite uncertainty.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of bacteriophage (phage) interactions with Campylobacterium jejuni, a foodborne pathogen, and a virulent phage in an in vitro system. They used a combination of experimental and modeling approaches to examine the non-linear kinetics of phage-bacteria interactions. The study found that phage-insensitive populations of C. jejuni arose, which is the first phage study to test against in vitro data models of ph-bacteria incorporating ph-insensitive bacteria. A simple model fit the data well and confirmed the importance of inundation and proliferation thresholds in ph therapy. The model was fitted to time series data to estimate thresholds and rate constants, revealing culture-density dependent features of ph infectivity worthy of further investigation. The study shows how empirical insights can be enhanced by kinetic models, and combined in vitro systems are essential for understanding in vivo properties of ph therapy.
Researchers have identified a Toll-like receptor (TLR) in the snail Biomphalaria glabra that plays a crucial role in the snail's immune response to the parasitic flatworm Schistoma mansoni. Schistomias is a disease that affects over 260 million people worldwide, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. The snail acts as an intermediate host for the parasite, allowing it to complete its larval development. The sn's immune response is important in protecting against the parasite, but few specific snail immune factors have been identified and characterized. This study found a TLR, named BTL, in a screen of snail cell surface proteins that differed in abundance between resistant and susceptible snails. The resistant snails had higher levels of BTL and its expression increased when challenged with S. mansoni, while susceptible snails did not. Knocking down BTL in resistant snails made them more susceptible to infection. This is the first characterization of a gastropod TLR and shows BTL's importance in snail immune response to S. mansoni.
Researchers have developed a new tool to measure human exposure to mosquito bites from two species of mosquitoes, Aedes aegypt and Aedes polensis, which transmit diseases such as dengue chikung and Zika in French Polynes. The tool detects and quantifies antibodies in human blood against mosquito saliva proteins. A study in Tahiti and Moore islands found 98% and 68% of people had antibodies against Aedes aegpt and Aedes polensis, respectively. In contrast, people from metropolitan France with no exposure to these mosquitoes had no antibodies. Analysis of different populations showed no cross-reactivity between the two mosquito saliva proteins. This suggests the antibody response to saliva is a valid biomarker for human exposure to bites. The new tool will help understand exposure to mosquito bites, identify areas with high disease risk, and evaluate control strategies in Pacific and tropical regions.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a pathogen that adapts to the intracellular environment of macrophages by interfering with the host cell's metabolic machinery. Temporal profiling of metabolic flux in infected macrophages with differentially virulent mycobacterial strains confirmed this adaptation. Analysis identified a subset of host reactions targeted by the pathogen, facilitating macrophage survival and mycobacterial sustenance. This integration of host and pathogen factors determines pathogenicity. Macrophage survival is sensitized TB susceptibility to glycemic status, while pathogen ensures virulence contributes to pathology. 

The pathogenicity of Mtb is linked to its central carbon metabolism (CM) plasticity, facilitating adaptation to intracellular macrophage. However, evidence suggests M pathity is also supported by host metabolic pathways engagement. Time-dependent modulations in macroage metabolism after infection with mycobacterial strains varied in genotype and phenotype confirmed M pathity is linked to host metabolism regulation. This process is controlled at cell metabolism level, impacting disease pathology. Pathogen strategies were aided by a mycobacterial panel with manifold virulence traits. 

Diabetes is a TB risk factor, compromised immunity in hyperglycemic individuals. Our finding that glucose levels contribute to pathity influencing macroage apoptosis reveals an additional relationship. Glycemic status impacts innate mechanism controlling M infection. Our focus on immunity as disease determinant yields results for vaccine or protection. A case is made for revisiting paradigms understanding M pathity. Metabolic dictates TB pathology, supporting this view.
Researchers studied the role of ZHP-3, a protein in Caenorhabditis elegans, in meiotic recombination and chromosome segregation. Z-3 is the ortholog of the yeast ZIP3 gene, which is required for crossover recombination. The study found that Z-3 protein is dynamic and localizes to the synaptonemal complex (SC) at a key point in meiotic prophase, shifting from along the length of the SC to asymmetrically on the SC and eventually to foci marking crossover events. A Z-3::GFP transgene partially complements a null mutation, showing separation of function, although the fusion promotes wild-type levels of recombination, aneuploidy among progeny is high, indicating defects in meiotic segregation. The structure of bivalents is perturbed in this mutant, suggesting the segregation defect results from inability to remodel chromosomes in response to crossovers. Smo-1 mutants exhibit similar phenotypes to Z-3::FP at higher temperatures, and smo-;Z-3FP double mutants exhibit more meiotic defects than single, consistent with a role for SUM in SC assembly and bivalent differentiation. The study proposes coordination of crossover with SC assembly and bivalent formation reflects a conserved role of Zip/Z-3 in recombination with SC morphogenesis.
Aedes aegyptus, a tropical mosquito species, has spread to temperate regions of Europe and the US, posing a public health concern due to its ability to transmit exotic viruses and nuisance due to its daytime biting behavior. A study in Rome, Italy, one of the most infested metropolitan areas in Southern Europe, investigated eco-climatic factors affecting Aedes aegus abundance in metropolitan and suburban areas. Adult mosquitoes were monitored along a 70km transect, and two spatial-temporal datasets were used to analyze the effect of climatic and environmental variables on Aedes abundance. Results showed association with anthropized habitats and high abundance in both metropolitan and suburban areas, with "green" islands" of abundance in metropolitan areas, and bimodal dynamics with a peak in autumn due to heavy rains and permissive temperatures. An increase in vegetation cover was negatively associated with mosquito abundance in both environments. Temperature and rainfall during the sampling period are shown in figures 3A and 3B, respectively. The study highlights a complex relationship between landscape and mosquito abundance, and suggests prioritizing public control measures in urban areas with high human-mosquito contact and arbovirus transmission risk, and potential health risks after summer months with high densities.
Researchers studied how Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a bacterium that causes tuberculosis, invades host cells called macrophages. They found that a group of lipids called phiocer dimocates (DIM) play a key role in this process. DIM are major virulence factors of Mtb, meaning they help the bacterium cause disease. To understand how DIM work, the researchers created Mtb mutants that couldn't make DIM. They found that DIM help Mtb enter macrophages by changing the host cell's plasma membrane, making it easier for the bacterium to be taken in. This effect required a change in membrane fluidity, as shown by experiments with cholesterol-depleting drugs that reduced phagocytosis and phag acidification between wild-type and mutant strains. Inserting a cholesterol probe in cells showed that the membrane's hydrophobic core changed upon contact with Mtb, while lateral diffusion was unaffected. This effect was dependent on DIM and consistent with a model. The researchers propose that DIM control invasion by targeting lipid organization in the membrane, modifying its biophysical properties, favoring receptor-mediated phocytosis and controlling phagomal pH.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the behavior of small neural networks composed of a few neurons, which is not well described by mean-field approximations. These approximations are useful for large networks, but not for small ones, where differences arise between the approximation and real behavior. Many problems in neuroscience involve studying networks of tens of neurons, but methods to describe small networks are rare, hindering progress. The new method analyzes dynamics of small networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, finding bifurcations with an approach that is analytically tractable and numerically determining global bifurcations. For strong inhibition, networks give complex dynamics through spontaneous symmetry-breaking, forming multiple solutions. This is a finite-size effect, revealing differences between mesoscopic circuits and mean approximation. Symmetry-breaking allows networks to regulate heterogeneity, reducing noise effects on information processing.

The study finds differences with mean-field for strong inhibitory weights, through spontaneous symmetry, a pitchfork bifurcation emerging multiple solutions. New bifcations occur, enriching complexity. The analysis of small networks was pioneered by Beer, studying bifurations with symmetric weights and asymptotic approximations. Most literature deals with 2-4 neurons, while methods for tens are limited. The work extends analysis to biologically plausible networks, deriving bifcation manifolds with less constraints. A finite-size model with excitatory and inhibitory populations is considered. Mean-field provides an approximation, neglecting phenomena like transitions and correlations.
Researchers investigated the presence and viability of Leishmania parasites in extralesional sites during human dermalishiasis. They used Leish 7RNA to estimate parasite burden and viability in extraional sites of dermalishias patients. The feasibility of discriminating parasite viability by PCR of Leish 7RNA was evaluated with luciferase activity of transfected intracellular amastigotes in dose-response assays. Monocytes, tonsil swabs, and skin aspirates of 28 cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishias patients were screened by DNA amplification/Southern blot. Positive samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR Leish 7RNA genes and transcripts. 7RNA amplification coincided with lucifer activity, confirming parasite viability. Of 22 patients presenting DNA in extraional samples, Leish 7RNA or genes transcripts were detected in one or more DNA samples 100% and 73% respectively. Gene transcript number from extraional tissues were comparable to lesions.7RNA were detected in 13/19 (68%) monocytes, 5/12 (42%) tonsil sw, 4/11 (36%) normal aspir, and 22/25 (88%) lesions. Viable parasites present in extraional sites, including monocytes, tons, and skin of dermalias patients. Leish 7RNA is informative for clinical and epidemiologic investigations of leishias.
Researchers have investigated how chromatin features, specifically histone modifications (HMs) and chromatin-binding proteins (CBPs), influence DNA replication timing in fruit flies (Drosophila). They analyzed a comprehensive dataset of 95 CBPs and HMs to predict replication timing using statistical models and found that combinations of CBPs have moderate predictive power, while pairwise interactions between HMs lead to accurate genome-wide predictions that can be further improved by CB. A simplified, biologically interpretable model of the relationship between chromatin and replication was derived, reaching 80% of the model's accuracy using six terms. Pairwise HMs can predict differential replication across cell types. The study supports the existence of combinatorial HM patterns for DNA replication and cell-type independent elements, which could elucidate the regulation of this fundamental process.
Researchers studied the spread of Dengue virus in Brazil, focusing on serotypes DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3, which infect 390 million people and cause 25,000 deaths annually, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. They analyzed complete genome sequences and found new lineages were introduced every 7-10 years, likely from the Caribbean to North and Northeast Brazil, then dispersing at 0.5 km/day. A statistical analysis of evolutionary, epidemiological, and ecological data suggests human and mosquito transportation, rather than mosquito infestation or geographical distances, determine Dengue spread in Brazil. DENV-3 spread 5 times faster than DENV-1. The study used 178 Brazilian genome sequences to determine factors of Dengue dispersal on a country scale using a spatial model. Predictors of spread included distances, air traffic, mosquito infestation, human densities, and population. Results support human spread through transportation and mosquito transportation. Introduction, establishment, and drivers of Dengue spread in Brazil were characterized using genetic and epidemiological data. A phylogeographic approach to genome sequences shows human role in spread through transportation. The investigation indicates distinct introductions and circulation of serotypes and genotypes, impact of traffic in Dengue spread within Brazil, introduction followed by epizoot amplifications in 7-10 cycles. Results concur with epidemi data, periodic Dengue peaks coincide with introduction every 7-10 years.
Researchers investigated how differences in the organization of receptive fields (RF) across three sensory maps in weakly electric fish influence correlations between the activities of electrosensory pyramidal neurons. They used a model based on anatomical differences in RF center size and overlap to predict large differences in correlated activity across maps. However, in vivo recordings showed that electrosensoryram neurons across all three segments displayed nearly identical correlations. To explain this result, they incorporated RF surround effects into the model, varying both RF gain and size relative to center, and found multiple structures gave similar correlations. Incorporating physiological RF differences between maps in the model resulted in similar correlation levels. This suggests RF overlap alone does not determine correlations, which is important for understanding how RF influences neural activity. The study is the first to quantify and compare correlations between pyram neuron activities across all three electric lateral line maps, using a combination of modeling and electrophysiology. In contrast to previous studies, which focused on spiking linearity and correlation, this work examines RF structure and its impact on correlated activity. By varying RF size and gain, different combinations gave rise to identical pyram neuron correlations in the model, with sign and magnitude determined by positively and negatively correlated inputs. Pyram cells in all maps have antagonistic center-surround RF, similar to retinal ganglion cells in the visual system.
Researchers investigated how noise in the responses of neurons affects the ability to encode a stimulus in a population of neurons. They considered a general setting where the shapes and variability of the neurons' tuning curves and responses were not specified, allowing for insights into the problem of population coding. The study showed that if correlations between pairs of neurons have opposite signs to their signal correlations, performance improves compared to independent cases. This "sign rule" (SR) holds for different metrics and levels of heterogeneity. However, SR is not a necessary for good coding, and diverse correlation structures can improve performance, some of which violate SR. The optimal structures lie on the boundaries of possible correlations. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions was provided for performance to be as good as without noise. An example illustrated two regimes with distinct properties of noise leading to optimal coding. The SR was formally established for homogenous correlations, but holds for heterogenous populations. Conditions for chosen correlations to yield performance as good as deterministic responses were identified, satisfied with high probability for large populations.
Researchers investigated how the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa affects the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to antibiotics. They found that Pseudas aerugin alters S. aureus susceptibility to bactericidal antibiotics in a strain-dependent manner and identified three interactions that either antagonize or potentiate antibiotic activity against S. aureus. Pseud aerugin's Las endopeptase potentiates vancomycin's effect by breaking down S aure's cell wall, rhamolids facilitate proton-motive-independent vancom uptake, and 2-hepty-4-hydroquinoline N-oxide (HQ) induces multidrug tolerance in S aure by inhibiting cellular respiration and ATP production. The production of these factors varies between clinical isolates and correlates with their capacity to alter S aure susceptibility. In a mouse burn infection, vancom treatment of S aure was potentiated by the presence of Las-producing P aerugin population. These findings show that susceptibility depends not only on the targeted pathogen's genotype but also on interactions with other microorganisms in the environment. Considering these interactions will improve treatment of polymicrobial infections.
Researchers investigated the mechanism of thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) in patients with deng virus (DENV) infection, which can lead to complications such as bleeding and plasma leakage. They found that patients with deng had higher levels of von Wille factor (VWF), a protein involved in blood clotting, and platelets bound more VWF to their surface. The amount of VWF on platelets correlated with plate count. Patients also had reduced sialic acid on their plate surface, which is removed by neuraminidase, an enzyme. However, deng virus does not have neuraminase activity, and no neuridase was found in patients' plasma or transferrin. In contrast, exposing platelets to VWF-activating protein resulted in removal of sial acid. The neuridase inhibitor oseltivir reduced V-induced plate desial. The study shows that V binding to platelets in deng results in neuridase-mediated desial and clearance.
Researchers have identified a new type of gene regulation in the human genome called bidirectional promoters, which are pairs of genes that face each other and are controlled by a shared regulatory region called a bidirectional promoter. These promoters are often associated with genes involved in DNA repair and may play a role in cancer development. Using a database of expressed genes, they found a large collection of bidirectional promoters and showed that many function as alternative promoters or novel transcripts. They found a significant enrichment of bidirectional promoters in cancer-related genes, including breast and ovarian cancer. The use of this structure in the genome suggests it regulates co-expression among groups of genes. Using data from 79 human tissues, they verified regulatory networks among genes controlled by bidirectional promoters. Subsets of these promoters have similar transcription factor binding sites, including evolutionarily conserved sites.

A new algorithm was developed to map bidirectional promoters in the genome using expressed sequence tags. The set of promoters shows relationships among regulated by bidirectional through co-expression. A subset of promoters regulating breast and ovarian cancer genes contain common transcription binding sites. Misregulation of bidirectional promoters, especially with common sites, may contribute to cancer development. Data confirmed expression of flanking transcripts for 91%, 58%, and 65% of promoters in genes, datasets. The enrichment of bidirectional with repair genes implies a link to cancer pathways. Data confirm association with somatic cancer and indicate type relevant. Bidirectional associated with uterine and ovarian cancers were examined. Expression-clustering showed bid promoters not as one network or thousands of pairs, but intermediate relationships between.
Researchers studied the sex chromosomes of 37 fly species from 22 different families and found a surprising diversity of sex chromosome configurations. Most flies, including fruit flies, have XY sex chromosomes with a large and small chromosome, but this is not always the case. They discovered over a dozen different sex chromosome arrangements, with the small chromosome often being the sex chromosome. Some species have undifferentiated sex chromosomes, others replaced the small chromosome with a different one, or incorporated up to three elements into the sex chromosome, and some have female heterogamy (ZW) sex. Transcript analysis showed that dosage compensation evolved multiple times in flies by upregulating the single X in males, but X chromosomes have fewer genes with male-bi expression, possibly due to sex-specific pressures. This study provides a resource for comparative sex biology and shows similar forces shaped sex chromosome evolution in diverse flies.
Researchers investigated blood samples from 18 mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly and 12 who gave birth to healthy babies in Hawaii between 2009-2012 for the presence of Zika virus (ZIK) IgM and IgG antibodies. One mother who delivered a baby with microaly tested positive for ZIK IgM antibody (16.6%) and three tested positive for ZV IgG (50%). ZV showed a trend with microaly. ZV IgG positive mothers were more likely to deliver babies with microaly than those negative for Z IgG (OR=11.0, 95% CI=0.8-147.9, p=0.083). Similarly, ZV IgM positive mothers were more likely to deliver babies with microaly than those negative for IgM (OR=6.8, 95 CI=0.2-195.1). These findings suggest a link between ZV infection and microaly and presence of Z cases in the US as early as 2009.
Researchers investigated the transmission of Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) infections in the Ashanti region of Ghana, where Buruli ulcer (BU) is prevalent. Although previous studies linked MU to slow-moving water bodies, the exact mode of transmission was unclear. The study used Variable Number Tand Repeat (VN) typing to differentiate MU from other Mycobacterium-producing Mycobacteria (M). By matching VN profiles of MU in human samples to environmental samples, they tracked infections to specific water bodies. Environmental samples were collected from 10 water bodies in four endemic communities. Four VN loci in the MU99 genome were used to genotype environmental and human isolates. Polymorphism was confirmed by sequencing. MU was present in three types of water, significantly higher in biofilm. Four genotypes W, X, Y, and Z were typed in both human and environmental samples. Other genotypes were only found in water. A mouse with characteristic BU lesion was infected with MU. Findings suggest patients may have been infected from community water bodies, and small mammals within communities could be susceptible to MU.
Researchers analyzed a global database of 27,723 records of 971 bird species to understand the distribution and drivers of alien species richness. They found that the origins and identities of introduced bird species were largely driven by European colonialism, mainly from Britain, but recent introductions are now involve more species and countries, driven by economic activity. Global bird species richness is highest at mid-latitudes and determined by anthropogenic factors, notably the number of introduced species, or "colonization pressure". Environmental factors also play a role, with native and alien species being positively associated. Colonization pressure is key to understanding species richness and areas with high native species are resistant to alien species at a global scale, emphasizing threats to environments from introductions.
Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, which are essential for cell growth and development. Research has shown that UBF is necessary for the formation of the pre-initiation complex and epigenetic state of r genes, but its exact function was unclear. Using a mouse model, scientists found that UBF is essential for embryo development beyond the morula stage. In cell cultures, UBF is necessary for transcription of r genes and defines chromatin conformation of both gene and enhancer sequences. Loss of UBF prevents formation of the SL/TIFB-initiation complex and recruitment of RPI-R3/T1 complex, accompanied by histone H3K9, histone H1, and HPα, but not de novo DNA methylation. Genes retain p-acetyl4 and H2, suggesting r genes can maintain active state without UBF. Unexpectedly, loss of U does not suppress transcription of 5, tRNA or snRNA, or expression of hundreds genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. r gene activity does not coordinate global expression for ribosome biogenesis. Loss of U also induces formation of large nuclear structure resembling nucleolar precursor body (NPB) of oocytes and embryos. These somatic NPB contain r synthesis and processing factors but do not associate with r loci.
Researchers have challenged the conventional understanding of how the Wingless/Wnt signaling pathway, a crucial for cell growth and development in animals, functions in the adult intestine. They found that in Drosophila, a membrane-tether form of Wingless, produced viable adults with normal morphology, suggesting that secretion and movement of Wingless are not necessary for tissue patterning. This study tested this principle in the adult intestine, where Wingless gradients mark boundaries between compartments. Results show that Wingless is essential for regulating gene activation, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, epithelial cell fate, muscle differentiation, gut folding, and signaling with Decaplegic pathway, all disrupted by Wing tethering. This supports the requirement for direct, long-range action of Wingless in patterning, relevant for development, homeostasis, and Wnt-driven disease. The adult gut forms through distinct mechanisms during metamorphosis, with different functional demands, including continuous epithelial turnover and regeneration. The study focused on W pathway gradients in the intestine demarcating major boundaries, resolving a long-standing controversy. W secretion and movement are critical for proper W activation during gut development, identifying a context where direct action of Wingless is unambiguous.
Researchers investigated the role of urokinase plasogen activator (uPA) in the pathogenesis of Group A streptococcus (GAS), a bacterium responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. They found that uPA contributes to plasmin recruitment and invasive disease initiation in vivo. In the absence of host plasogen activators, streokinase was required for surface plmin acquisition by GAS. However, in the absence of streokin, uPA was sufficient to promote surface plmin acquisition by strain 544 during incubation with plmin or human plasma. GAS also activated zym pro-uPA in human plasma. To assess u's contribution to invasive disease, a transgenic mouse model was used. C57/BL6 and AlbG mice expressing human plmin transgene were more susceptible to invasive disease than u− mice. Decreased virulence in u− mice correlated with decreased dissemination and reduced surface plmin by GAS. These findings have implications for understanding GAS pathogenesis and targeting plmin activation in bacterial infections.
Helicobacter pylori exploits a unique repertoire of Type IV secretion system components for pilus assembly at the bacteria-host interface. Colonization of the stomach by H. pylori is a risk factor for gastric cancer development. The H. pylori pathogenic island (cPAI) encodes components of a Type IV system (T4) that translocates the oncoprotein Cag into gastric epithelial cells, and Cag is a component of cTSS that binds host αβ1 integrin. Researchers used mass spectrometry to co-purify Cag, C (integrin-binding protein), and C (protein with sequence similarity to C). These proteins are encoded by contiguous genes in cPA and detectable on bacterial surface. All proteins required C translocation into cells and H. pyl-induced IL-8 by gastric epithelial cells; however, not homologous components of T in other species. Scanning microscopy reveals proteins involved pilus formation between H. pyl and epithelial cells. Δag and Δ mutant fail form pilus, whereas Δ strain exhibits hyperiliated and elongated pilus compared to wild-type. This suggests pilus regulated by. A conserved C-terminal hexapeptide in C, C, C, and C. Deletion motifs C translocation and IL-8, and motifs C-terminal C and C required pilus formation.
Researchers conducted a study to identify biomarkers of protection against bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle, a chronic disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis. They vaccinated cattle with BCG and a heterologous B prime-boost protocol and analyzed gene expression in vaccinated-protected, vaccinated-unprotected, and unvaccinated cattle. RNA sequencing revealed 668 differentially expressed genes, with cytokine-cytokine interaction being the most significant pathway. Interleukin-22 (IL-22) was identified as the dominant predictor of protection, besides INF-γ. This was confirmed by RT-qPCR in an independent set of PB samples. BCG vaccination can induce protective immunity in some calves, with resolution of M. bo infection, similar to humans with M. tuberculosis. The most promising strategies improve upon BCG rather than replace it, making it the prototype to judge novel vaccine efficacy. Predicting success after vaccination before pathogen exposure is crucial for vaccine development. Previous studies showed BCG induced immunological cell immunity with strong INFγ production. Several strategies improved B efficacy, such as subunit, DNA, protein, and recombinant vaccines. No reliable immunological correlates of protection exist. Elevated IL-17 was found in vaccinated/protected calves, but not significant. 5 calves were vaccinated with BCG or B/Ad, resulting in significant protection against M. bo challenge compared to uninf animals.
Researchers studied how microtubules are organized at the apical microtub organizing center (MOC) in Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic intestinal cells. The apical MOC is a structure found in most differentiated cells, but how it regulates microtule organization is not well understood. They used a tissue-specific degradation system to test the role of the centrosomal microtule nucleators γ-tulin ring complex (γ-TRC) and AIR-1/AurA at the apical MOC. γ-TRC and AIR-1 are required to form microtules at the centrosome, but not the apical MOC. Surprisingly, microtules remain organized at the apical MOC when γ-T and AIR are depleted. However, loss of G-1 removes a subset of dynamic microtules, and the remaining microules grow faster. This suggests different MOCs use distinct proteins for their function and the apical MOC is composed of γu-dependent and -independent microules competing for resources.
Researchers compared 11 different methods for phasing human genomes, which involves determining the origin of maternal and paternal copies of the 23 pairs of chromosomes. Most sequencing initiatives ignore this, as it's too complex and costly. They used the "Genome-In-Bottle" (GIAB) version of the NA78 genome as a standard. The methods included laboratory-based and computational approaches that use sequencing data or population haplotype information. Metrics included error rates, haplotype lengths, and phasing accuracy. A hybrid approach combining population phasing, genome sequencing data, and haplotype frequencies produced accurate results. Population phasing improved with genome data, and parental genotypes reduced errors by 10-fold. A voting scheme combining multiple predictions enhanced performance and coverage. Regions with phasing errors had low polymorphism or SNV density.
Researchers have investigated the process of type-III protein secretion in Salmonella enterica, a type of bacteria that causes disease in humans. Type-III secretion systems are used by gram-negative bacteria to secrete proteins that help them infect and cause disease. These proteins are built into the bacterial flagellum, a whip-like structure that helps the bacteria move, and virulence effectors that harm the host cells. The flagellar type-III secretion system uses energy from the cell's proton motive force and ATP hydrolysis to unfold and transport these proteins. The study found that flagella can be formed without the type-III ATPase, a protein that helps with this process, by increasing the proton force and protein levels. They also showed that increased proton force can bypass the need for the virulence-associated type-III ATPase. This suggests that type-III ATPases enhance efficiency under low protein concentrations and are not necessary for the protein export process. The study proposes that type-III ATPases help deliver substrates to the export apparatus and ensure efficient unfolding. Increased proton force can export substrates efficiently, overcoming the need for the ATP complex. This has implications for the evolution of the bacterial flagellum and type-III systems. The flagellar biogenesis in Salmonella is mediated by the flagellar type-III system, which is related to virulence type-III systems in pathogenic bacteria. Eliminating the proton force inhibits flagellar type-III secretion and ATP hydrolysis energizes chaper release and secretion. The study demonstrates that ATP activity is not necessary for protein export via type-III systems.
Researchers studied a large family of simple gene regulatory networks (GRNs) consisting of two transcription factor (TF)-coding genes and their associated proteins to determine the capacity for bistability. They used chemical reaction network theory in a comprehensive in silico survey to analyze over 40,000 possible networks and found that around 90% of them can exhibit bistability, including some without the typical cooperativity associated with bistable systems. The study identified 11 minimal bistable networks that cannot be reduced to smaller bistable subnetworks. The large number of bistable topologies suggests that switch-like behavior in GRNs arises easily and is not easily lost through evolution. The researchers applied their approach to Saccharomyces cerevisiae data and identified several GRNs predicted to behave in bistable fashion. They used the Chemical Network Toolbox to analyze 40,680 possible two-gene networks, finding 36,771 bistable, 9% with multiple steady states, and 6.5% monostable regardless of parameters. The study focused on basic biochemical processes in transcriptional regulation but did not include degradation of TF dimers, which can provide nonlinearity for bistability. The identified networks are not guaranteed bistable but their topologies make them bistable candidates, providing hypotheses for experimentation.
Researchers have identified a new genetic cause of orofacial cleft, a common birth defect, in humans and mice. Mutations in the HY2 gene, which encodes hyaluronidase 2, an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, a key component of the developing palate and heart tissue, lead to the condition. Experiments showed that these mutations reduce HY2 protein levels, consistent with symptoms seen in affected individuals. Investigations of mice lacking HY2 revealed craniofacial abnormalities, including submucal cleft palate, and triatum sinister, a rare heart defect, and hearing loss. These findings highlight the importance of HY2 and hyuronic acid turnover for normal development in humans and mice, and reveal a new pathway involved in oracial cleft and triatum pathogenesis.
Researchers have discovered a new details about how the inner hair cells in the ear detect sound. These cells have tiny links called stereocilia that convert sound into electrical signals. The links are made of two proteins, protocadherin 15 (PCD15) and cadherin 23 (CD23). When sound hits the ear, the links are stretched and send signals to the brain. But how the links are made and fixed after they break was unknown. Scientists used a special microscope to see the links and proteins. They found two types of links: one with PCD15 at both ends and one with PCD at one end and CD23 at the other. When links break, CD23 disappears and P15 moves to the side of the cell and forms a new link with P15 at both ends. This new link works but doesn't work like the old one. It takes time for the old link with P15 and CD23 to form again. This process is important for hearing to work. The researchers think this is how links are made in the ear and how they are fixed when they break.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a prevalent arbovirus that causes an estimated 100 million symptomatic deng infections every year, with a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild deng fever (DF) to life-threatening deng hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The transition from DF to DHF is not well understood. A mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling of sera from adult DF and DH patients at critical and recovery phases identified 29 differentially expressed metabolites, including bile acids, purines, acylcarnines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Bile acids were 5-fold higher in DH compared to DF and correlated with liver injury markers AST and ALT. Uric acid was 1.5-fold lower in DH, suggesting decreased antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress. In the recovery phase, eight metabolites remained higher or lower in DH, including chenodeoxycholic acid, indicating prolonged liver impact. Altered pathways linked to DH in critical and recovery phases and host-DENV interactions were identified, advancing understanding DH pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.
Researchers have identified and characterized the guanine 5'-monophosphate reductase (GMPR) enzyme in Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite responsible for African trypaniasis. GR catalyzes the conversion of guanine 5'-monophosphate (GMP) to inosine 5'-monosphate (IMP), a key step in purine nucleotide metabolism. Unlike mammalian and bacterial GRs, T. bruce GR has a unique insertion of cystathion synthase (CBS) domain and is localized in glyosomes. The recombinant T. br GR showed distinct enzymatic differences, with higher affinity for G and NADPH, and increased activity with monovalent cations K+ and NH+. The purine analog ribavir inhibited T. br GR, but not mammalian GRs. These findings suggest a distinct mechanism of GR in T. br compared to its host. Ribavir inhibited trypanosome proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent against trypanias.
Researchers used computer simulations to study how two drugs, benzocaine and phenyto, interact with a bacterial sodium channel to understand how they block electrical signals in cells. Sodium channels are used to treat conditions like epilepsy and heart arrhythmia, and pain. To develop new drugs that target specific channels, it's essential to know how current blockers work. The study found both drugs bind to two sites in the channel: one above the gate and one at the entrance to the lipid-filled fenestrations. Binding to the gate is slightly more favorable. The drugs can pass through the fenestrations with little energy, suggesting a hydrophobic route for entry. Residues direct drugs into the fenestr and form binding sites are important.
Researchers investigated the role of MyD signaling in the immune response to intestinal infection with the pathogen C. rodium. MyD is a key component of the immune system that helps fight off infections, but its specific role in the intestine was not well understood. They created a special mice model that allowed them to turn on or off MyD in specific cell types to see which ones were important. They found that MyD in dendritic cells (DC) and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) were crucial for fighting off the infection. My in DC activated the early response of a type of immune cell called group 3 lymphoid (ILC) and the development of a type of helper T cell called Th17/1. In contrast, My in other cell types like macrophages (MO) and ILC did not help much. They also found that My in IEC helped keep the epithelial barrier strong and made antimicrobial peptides to fight the infection. The study shows that My in DC and IEC are important for a full response to C. rodium infection.
Researchers are working to eliminate onchocerciasis in Africa through annual or biannual iverectin mass administration (MDA). One tool to determine if transmission is interrupted and treatment can stop is an immunodiagnostic test detecting human IgG antibodies in blood to Onchocerca volulus antigen Ov16. A mathematical model, ONOS, was extended to include Ov antibody serostatus of individuals. Seroconversion occurs when worms establish in host, before or after maturation, or after mf production. The study focuses on serconversion in children, ignoring seroreversion. Yearly MDA reduces parasite rate in humans, lowering serconversion in newborns and children who serconverted before control remain positive. Microfilaria prevalence in 5+ and Ov antibody in children under 10 decline with M duration. Association between indicators and predicted elimination probability depends on endemic levels, serconversion trigger, and test sensitivity/specificity. Understanding Ov antibody dynamics is crucial for accurate interpretation and precise endpoint MDA. The study shows endpoint depends on endemic levels, to be considered in guidelines for stopping M.
Researchers have found that prions, a type of infectious protein, can change their properties when propagated in different environments. When prions that were sensitive to a drug called swainine were grown in a cell line called PK1 in the presence of swine, drug-resistant variants emerged. This suggests that prions are made up of a range of variants with different properties, and the fittest ones are selected in a particular environment. Even after cloning, prion populations remained heterogeneous, indicating that mutation-like processes occur at the conformation level. Brain-derived prions are naturally resistant to swine, so it was not surprising that pr that became sensitive after propagation in cells could revert to resistance. However, pr that were resistant after propagation in brain or PK cells were still sensitive to swine, so researchers investigated if it was possible to select swine-resistant by propagation in presence of drug. Interestingly, this was not possible with standard PK cells, but certain sublines of PK allowed swine-resistant, even swine-dependent (that propagated rapidly in presence of drug) to be isolated. Once established, they could be passed in PK cells without losing swine dependence. Misfolded pr protein associated with swine variant was rapidly cleared in PK cells than its sensitive counterpart, indicating structural differences of misfold pr underlie pr properties. Propagation of pr in presence inhibitory drug not only selects drug-resistant pr but stable variants that propagate efficiently in presence drug. Adaptations likely due conformation changes abnormal pr protein.
Researchers analyzed the space of 101 possible metabolisms, which are systems that extract energy from extracellular nutrients, to understand their potential for innovation. They created a map of all possible combinations of 51 reactions in central metabolism and used flux analysis to predict viability on 10 different carbon sources, resulting in 102 potential phenotypes. Viable metabolisms with one phenotype make up a small fraction of the space but exceed 109 for phenotypes. Metabolisms with one phenotype form a network that can be reached through single reaction changes. The distance between networks of different phenotypes is small, allowing metabolisms to reach new phenotypes on new sources through few changes. However, exceptions exist for metabolisms near minimum viability. Increasing complexity enhances potential for conservation and innovation.

The researchers asked if neighborhoods of metabolisms on same source have novel phenotypes and which depend on location in space. They sampled 100 pairs of metabolisms differing in 1-10 reactions and represented phenotypes as binary strings. A change in genotype is innovation if leads to new combinations. They considered a small space of 15 metabolism due to its role in energy extraction and limited to 10 sources and 102 phenotypes. Metabolisms can differ and reside in connected networks. They analyzed how observations translate to metabolisms viable on k sources, which is challenging due to 10 possible k-tuples. They sampled 1000 metabolisms from each network and represented phenotypes as binary vectors, asking if multiple novel in neighborhood exist.
Researchers studied the genetic variation and geographic distribution of the Triatoma dimata complex, a parasite that transmits Trypanosoma cruzi, the cause of Chagas disease, across Mexico and the Neotropics. They analyzed two fragments of the ND4 gene to identify specific haplogroups and found that genetic diversity was lowest where there was most human modification, and Tryosoma cruz infection was highest. Haplog 1 and 3 had more Tryos cruz than expected, while hap 2 had less. There was a difference in DT and DT infection frequencies in hap 1 and 3, but not in 2. Haplog 1 and 3 were most genetically different. The complex diverged from its most recent common ancestor 0.97-0.85 million years ago, with hap 2 and 3 diverging later. Effective population size of hap 1 and 2 increased 0.02-0.03 million years ago. This study supports the origin of the complex around the Tehuante Isthmus and recent divergence of three haplog with differential Tryos cruz frequency and DT specificity, important for vector capacity.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFR) is a rod-borne disease caused by hantaviruses, primarily Hanta virus and Seoul virus, in China. Environmental factors significantly affect the risk of contracting hant infections, mainly through their impact on rodent dynamics and human-rod contact. This study aimed to clarify environmental factors favoring rod-to-human transmission, providing evidence for effective FR prevention and control strategies. From 2006-2015, field data on rod hosts, havirus, epidemiology, and environment, and meteorology were analyzed to quantify relationships among environment, rod species, and FR occurrence. 709 FR cases were included. Rodents in Chhou, a hotspot, mainly Rattus norvegicus, Musculus, R flavius, and others, played different roles across land types, all associated with transmission. Some species were linked to FR in forest and water, R norveicus and flavi in grassland, Mculus and flavi in built. Rod community was associated with environmental variability. Predictive models showed cultivated land highest risk for FR incidence, aligning with 2014-201 statistics. Spatial heterogeneity of FR may be influenced by rod community, associated with local conditions.
Researchers have found that mutations in the HRAS gene, specifically in codon 12, can cause Costello syndrome (CS), a congenital disease characterized by growth retardation, tumor predisposition, and developmental delay. They identified a new germline mutation, c.35_36>T, in a 12-year-old boy with attenuated CS and analyzed HRAS DNA, showing high levels of exon 2 skipping. Using wild and mutant HRAS minigenes, they confirmed that c.35_36>T results in exon 2 skipping by disrupting a critical exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) and creating an exonic splicing silencer (SS). The HR exon 2 is vulnerable due to a weak 3' splice site, making it dependent on splicing proteins like SRS2 for inclusion. Most cancer and CS-causing mutations are located here, affecting splicing differently. Results show that phenotype in CS and somatic cancers is determined not only by mutant HRAS transforming potential but also by exon 2 inclusion efficiency from different mutations. A splice oligonucleotide (SO) blocking critical SE causes exon skipping and halts cancer cell proliferation, revealing potential for new anti-cancer therapies. The most frequent CS mutation, c.34>A, has a modest effect on exon inclusion and high occurrence in both CS and cancer due to high mutation rate and modest protein potential. Other splicing factors like SRS, S3, and S6 are potent oncogenes, underscoring dysregulated splicing in cancer. HR exon 2 is vulnerable, dependent on splicing protein binding to SE for inclusion. Mutations in cod 12 and 13 impact exon inclusion differently, and splicing efficiency is tissue-dependent on splicing protein levels. Germl mutations in HR cause CS, characterized by growth retardation, tumor predis, developmental delay, and heart and skeletal abnormalities. 75% of CS is caused by heterozygous c.34>A mutations in HR.
Researchers studied the role of METTL3, a protein involved in RNA modification, in the development of the cerebellum, a part of the brain. They found that inactivating MET3 in mice led to severe developmental defects, including cerebellar hypoplasia, a condition where the cerebellum is underdeveloped. This was due to increased apoptosis, or cell death, of granule cells in the external granular layer of the cerebellum. MET3 depletion caused loss of a type of RNA modification, m6, leading to changes in gene expression and cell death. The study shows MET3 is essential for cerebell development and m6 plays a key role in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in mammals.
Researchers studied how transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG work together to regulate gene expression in embryonic stem (ES) cells. These cells have the ability to develop into any cell type in the embryo. The study found that when these factors bind together, they are associated with a co-activator called H3ac and increased expression of nearby genes in ES cells. The same locations bound by OCT, NAN, and SOX in ES cells drive expression in early embryonic development. Comparing human and mouse ES cells, less than 5% of individual binding events for OCT, SO2, and NAN are shared between species. However, about 15% of combinatorial binding and 53-63% of combinator binding at enhancers active in early development are conserved. This suggests the combination of OCT, SO2, and NAN is critical for ES cells and plays a role in embryogenesis by binding conserved early enhancers. The study also found that rewiring of regulatory networks mainly affects individual binding, while "regulatory hotspots" bound by multiple factors and active in multiple tissues early development are under evolutionary constraints. Combinatorial binding of OCT, SO, and NAN identifies enhancers with H3ac and Med localization in ES cells. Many combinatorially bound enhancers are active in early development. This implies conserved combinator binding in ES has extensive impact controlling key genes in differentiation and supports the connection between pluripotency and development by OCT, SO, and NAN through enhancers.
AML/ETO, a protein resulting from a chromosomal translocation involving chromosomes 8 and 21, is an oncogenic factor that initiates acute myeloid leukemia by recruiting co-repressor complexes to DNA. It interferes with the function of its wild-type counterpart, A1, by targeting A1 binding sites. However, transcriptional regulation by A/ETO relies on a complex network, as the protein interacts with other transcription factors, including E-proteins, and targets other sites on DNA. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling identified AETO-dependent transcriptional regulation. AETO was found to co-localize with A, demonstrating the fusion follows the binding pattern of the wild protein but does not primarily displace it. The binding of E-protein H was rearranged upon AETO expression, and the protein co-localized with A and H on many regulated targets. The level of H was increased in primary and cell lines expressing AETO. This suggests a major role for the interaction of AETO with A and H in transcriptional regulation by the protein.
Researchers investigated the role of the Leishmania donani histone acetyltransferase H2 (H2) in regulating gene expression. They found that H2 acetylates histone H4 in vitro and in vivo, and is essential for cell growth and survival. In H2-depleted cells, cyclins CY4 and CY9 were downregulated, leading to cell cycle defects. Real-time PCR and DNA array analyses revealed that CY4 and CY9 were responsible for G1 and G2/M phase defects, respectively. Leish genes are arranged in unidirectional clusters, transcribed as polyc units from divergent strand regions (dSRs), which initiate bidirectionally on opposite strands. CY4 and CY9 have their own promoters, activated in a cell-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and real-time PCR showed H4etyl10 acylation of these promoters. Nuclear run-on analyses confirmed CY and CY9 transcription from their promoters at specific cell stages. Two tiers of regulation exist: transcription of polyc units initiates at SRs constitutively, while a subset have own promoters, some activated cell-dependently. The second tier is sensitive to H10 acylation, downregulating expression in H-de cells. This study shows cell-specific activation of promoters in trypanoids, uncovering new facets of regulation in this family.
Researchers investigated how people infer others' intentions in social interactions using a game where 16 pairs of volunteers played a probabilistic learning task. One player, the "adviser", received more information and gave a recommendation. The game's design made the adviser's incentives to help or mislead change over time. Using a Bayesian model, the players' behavior was best explained by hierarchical learning: they estimated the adviser's intentions to predict advice accuracy. Volatility also affected trial-by-trial decisions: players trusted advice more when they thought adviser's intentions were stable. The model predicted players' Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) scores, ratings of adviser helpfulness and adviser's self-reports. Results suggest humans use hierarchical models to infer others' intentions, use volatility in decision-making, and integrate advice with other info. The framework can quantify individual differences and may help study maladaptive social cognition.

Players who interacted with changing advisers showed stronger hierarchical learning and used volatility to update beliefs about advice. A game ensured adviser's incentives to cooperate or deceive varied, making intentions volatile. Two questions were addressed: do humans use hierarchical learning in social interactions and predict advice accuracy and stability. Alternative models were fitted to behavior: (i) humans deploy hierarchical learning, (ii) predict accuracy and stability. Hierarchical learning explained behavior best. Beyond inference, volatility determined trial-by-trial decisions: beliefs to choices were more deterministic when adviser's intentions were stable. The belief-updating reflected adviser's policy and willingness to take suggestions. Players with helpful advisers perceived stable intentions weighted advice more, shown by reduced metaolatility and larger values.
Scrub typhus, a disease endemic in Asia, has been found in urban areas, including Seoul, South Korea's largest city. From 2010 to 2013, national disease data identified indigenous scrub typh in Seoul. Clinical features of patients were compared to a control group. Chigger mites were collected in the city using a trap and identified by phenic and 18 rDNA analyses. Infection with Orientia tsutsugushi was confirmed by sequencing the 56Da gene. Eighty-eight cases of scrub typh were found in Seoul. Sites of infection were mountain areas (56.8%), city parks (20.5%), vicinity of residence (17%), and rivers (5.7%). Eighty-seven chigger mites were collected in Gak mountain, suspected site in Seoul, and seventy-six (87.4%) were Helenula miag and eight (9.2) Leotridium scell. DNA from miag mites yielded O tsugushi Bong strain. Twenty-six patients showed low AP II score (3.4±2.7), low complication rate (3.8%), and no hypalemia. The study found indigenous scrub in Seoul and a subgroup had mild features. Chigger H miag infected O tsug within the city found in endemic area. Scrub ty needs to be considered a differential disease and target for prevention.
Researchers studied the impact of a protein called HENN-1 on two types of small RNA molecules, 21 and 26, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. These RNAs are involved in a process called RNA interference, which affects gene activity by recruiting proteins to target molecules. HENN-1 is an enzyme that adds a chemical group to the end of some RNAs, which affects their stability. The study found that H-1 has different effects on the two types of RNAs: 21 and 26. In the germline, the stability of 21 RN is only slightly affected by loss of H-1, and introducing artificial 21 RNA does not destabilize non-methylated 21 RN. In contrast, 26 RN display reduced stability and increased 3-uridylation when H-1 is lost. Within the 26 class, specifically ER-1-bound 26 RN are modified by H-1, while AL-3/4-bound 26 are not. Global gene expression analysis of h- mutants shows mild effects, including downregulation of gerine-expressed genes. The study suggests that apart from direct effects on 26 levels, most effects on gene expression are indirect. This research refines understanding of endogenous RNA in C elegans and roles of H1 enzymes in pathways.
Researchers conducted a study combining genome-wide association and high-throughput glycomics analysis on 2,705 individuals from three populations to investigate the regulation of protein glycosylation. They found that variants in the Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 (HNF1) and fucyltransferase genes FUT and F8 influence N-gly levels in human plasma. NF1 and its downstream NF4 regulate the expression of fucyltransfer and fucose biosynthesis genes. NF is necessary and sufficient to drive the expression of these genes in hepatic cells, revealing a new role as a master regulator of multiple stages in the fyl process. This has implications for the regulation of immunity, embryonic development, and protein folding, as well as understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying cancer, coronary disease, heart, and metabolic disorders. Acute proteins have altered fyl in diseases and changes in levels of fylated glycans are associated with several pathological processes, including cancer. NF and NF are transcription factors that regulate gene expression in liver and pancreas and are key regulators of metabolic genes. The study confirmed NF in biosynthesis of GDP-fucose and analyzed NF and NF in regulation of fyltransfer (FUT) genes in HepG and Panc cell lines to assess if these factors regulate other stages of fyl. NF knockdown regulated all UT genes except UT8, which was induced upon loss of NF. Identified genes UT, F, UT, and NF are in fyl, suggesting addition of unusual sugar may be rate-limiting in Nly synthesis. Gene encoding NF, with unknown links to glyylation, is associated with plasma Nly proportions. NF knockdown resulted 50% UT transcript suggesting NF regulates UT in Hep. Focused on genes for fucose biosynthesis, rate-limiting in fyl. GM is in novo pathway of L-f to GDP-f, used by core and antennary ftransfer to Nly proteins. NF directly regulates hep ftransfer VI gene UT. Tested NF and NF regulate genes in GDP-f biosynthesis.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called Centromere Protein C (CPC) plays a crucial role in the formation of kinetochores, which are structures that attach chromosomes to the cytoskeleton and help move them during cell division. Surprisingly, the DNA sequence of the centrom has little to do with this process, suggesting that genetic information is being transmitted in a way that is independent of DNA sequence, or epigenetically. The team found that RNA transcribed from the centrom remains bound to the kinetoch region, and this RNA is thought to be part of the epigenetic marking system. They studied maize CPC, a key kinetoch protein, and found that it binds to DNA through a specific region of 122 amino acids, and this binding is sensitive to single-stranded RNA. Long single-stranded nucleic acids promote binding of CPC to DNA, and types of RNAs that stabilize binding match those found in kinetocho in vivo. Removing the binding module causes partial delocalization of CPC in vivo. The data suggest centrom RNA recruits CPC to kinetoch by altering DNA binding characteristics.

 Maize centrom repeats are undermethylated and transcribed to stable RNAs that remain bound to chromatin. Centrom RNAs are 40-200 in length, transcribed from both strands, and maintained single-stranded. RNA may serve as a template to recruit kinoch proteins. Researchers used in vitro and vivo studies to show maize CPC has DNA and RNA-binding capacities, the DNA/RNA domain localized to exon region, and binding required for centere localization. RNA facilitates binding of CPC to DNA in vitro, providing a mechanism for RNA involvement in centere specification. Single-stranded RNA has strong effect on binding, suggesting centrom RNA as epetic mark that mediates final stable assembly. CPC is recruited kineto by protein contacts then converted to DNA-binding by centrom RNA.
Researchers have identified genetic variants associated with birth weight, childhood obesity, and body mass index (BMI) and found that the placenta plays a crucial role in fetal and postnatal health. They examined the placental transcriptome and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that mediate genetic causes of birth weight, childhood obesity, and BMI. The study found that genetic variants associated with birth weight, obesity, and BMI were significantly enriched for placental QTL, with 6.76, 4.83, and 2.26 folds respectively. Importantly, compared to QTL of adult tissues, placental QTL contribute significantly to anthropometric outcomes at birth and childhood phenotypes. The study reveals that placental transcription in utero likely plays a role in determining postnatal size and may hold possibilities for interventions to prevent childhood obesity. 

The study found extensive enrichment of placental QTL for genome-wide association study (GWAS) hits and discovered hundreds of transcripts controlled by genetic variants influencing anthropometric traits. The findings demonstrate placental transcription and functions by identified genes play roles in determining birth weight, obesity, and BMI. The placenta is relevant for determining weight at birth and body in childhood. Identifying genes mediating genetic predisposition for birth, obesity, and BMI is important for understanding mechanisms and clinical prevention. Integrative genomics is a tool to mine GW results. 

The study showcases genetically controlled in utero patterns linked to birth, obesity, and BMI support the hypothesis. Key observation is placental QTL are enriched for GW hits than Q from other tissues, including adipose and liver. The study in utero pathways influencing birth, and BMI and define placenta role for neonatal long-term outcomes compared placental Q with 7 adult tissue Q. Over 3,000 cis and trans-QTL at 10% false discovery rate demonstrate placenta transcriptionally active controlled by genetics.
A study was conducted in Malda district, West Bengal, India to determine the burden of post-kala-azar dermal leishiasis (PKDL) in an endemic area and compare three diagnostic methods for PK detection. PKDL is a non-life threatening disease that often goes untreated, but is relevant to visceral leishiasis (VL) elimination. The study found 26 PK cases with a prevalence of 27.5% among antileishial antibody positive cases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was highly sensitive (88.46%) for confirmation. Most skin lesions persisted after treatment but disappeared within 6-12 months. Two cases relapsed after 1.5 years of miltefosine treatment. A significant number of PK patients remained undiagnosed without active surveys. PCR is helpful for diagnosis, but a well-designed study with more samples is needed to determine if PK patients are parasite-free after treatment and which need longer treatment. PK occurs in 10-20% of VL cases in India, 50-60% in Sudan, and 2% of PK cases with no kalaazar history. Unlike VL, PK is not life-threatening, cosmetic issues don't bother patients who don't seek care, maintaining parasites in population.
Researchers have studied how the process of competence in Streptococcus pneumoniae, a type of bacteria, develops in liquid cultures. Competence is a genetic program that enables horizontal gene transfer, a process where bacteria share genes with each other. They found that competence in the population relies on a self-activated fraction of cells that arises through a growth-dependent mechanism. This fraction expresses a signaling peptide, CSP, which creates a positive feedback loop. However, it was unclear how this population switch is coordinated. By monitoring competence in real-time, they found that it relies on cell-to-cell contact between activated and quiescent cells. CSP remains bound to cells during this process and the rate of competence corresponds to contact between cells. They validated this two-step mechanism by measuring competence in co-cultures with altered to produce or respond to CSP. The protein ComD retains CSP, limiting its diffusion in the medium. They propose that competence cells originate stochastically in response to stress, forming a subpopulation that transmits CSP by cell contact. This process provides an efficient way to maintain CSP-based feedback in all cells. The ability to convert a population to competent is restricted to pneumoc and relatives.
Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV) L2 protein acts as a chaper to ensure the viral genome (vDNA) traffics from endosomes to the trans-Gol network (TGN) and the nucleus, where replication occurs. To reach the nucleus, the L2/v complex must translocate across intracellular membranes. Researchers developed a system using subcellular compartmentalization of enzyme BirA and its substrate to detect translocation of L2 from incoming virions. They found L translocation requires transport to TGN and is strictly dependent on mitotic entry, coinciding with mitotic entry in synchronized cells. Cell cycle arrest retains L/v at TGN; release and progression past G2 enables trans across limiting membrane and infection. Microscopy of Ed-labeled vDNA reveals a rapid shift in vDNA localization during mitosis. At G2/early phase v egress from T to pericent location, accumulating prometaph where it associates with condensed chromosomes. By metaphase and anaphase v is bound to mitotic chromosomes, ensuring distribution into daughter nuclei. Mutations in defined chromatin binding of L blocked translocation, suggesting dependent on chromatin during prometaph. This is the first virus to functionally couple penetration of membranes to mitosis, explaining part of HPV tropism for mitotic keratinocytes.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework to measure the transmissibility of one strain of a pathogen compared to another, using data from competitive mixtures experiments where animals are co-infected with two strains. They observed the mixture in each animal over time and multiple generations of transmission, using influenza in ferrets as an example. Assessing relative transmiss between strains is crucial in three contexts: within human populations where novel strains compete for hosts, during pandemics where a new type competes with existing strains, and with neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) which can reduce transmission but promote resistant strains. The framework also estimates the size of the transmitted inoculum, or initial amount of pathogen. The method is applicable to other viral and bacterial pathogens beyond influenza, requiring consideration of within-host dynamics and potential synergies of co-infection.
Researchers have investigated how plants integrate light and abscisic acid (ABA) signals to adapt to their environment and survive. ABA is a hormone involved in various plant life stages and stress responses, while light regulates growth and development. The study found that BBX21, a protein previously linked to seedling photomorphogenesis, also plays a role in ABA signaling. Data shows BB21 acts upstream of ABA INSENSITIVE (ABI) and ELONG HYCOTYL5 (HY) in seed germination control. HY activates ABI expression, and BB21 interacts with HY. BB21 negatively regulates ABI expression by interfering with HY binding to the ABI promoter. Additionally, ABI activates its own expression, but BB21 negatively regulates this by interacting with ABI. The study indicates BB21 coordinates with HY and ABI on the ABI promoter, working together to integrate light and ABA in Arabidopsis thaliana. HY regulation of ABI represents light and A integration during germination and seedling development. Accumulating evidence shows BB proteins work with HY in photomorphogenesis. Since HY activates ABI, it was investigated whether BB proteins are involved in ABA. Multiple factors in the light pathway regulate A responses by ABI expression. This study shows BB21, a seedling photomogenesis regulator, negatively regulates ABI by interfering HY binding. Light and A are environmental and hormonal cues controlling germination and seedling development. Integrating external with internal pathways is vital for plant survival. The mechanisms between light and A are starting to be understood. ABI and ABI play roles in photomogenesis, A inhibits hypocotyl elongation, conferring adaptation to stresses. Several factors bind ABI and regulate its expression. HY, a photomorphesis factor, mediates A in germination, growth, and development by binding ABI and activating expression.
Researchers have studied the Mediator complex in Candida albicans, a pathogenic fungus, to understand its role in regulating gene expression. The Med complex is a co-regulator of RNA polymerase II and is conserved in eukaryotes. The study focused on three subunits: Med31, Med20, and S9/M13. C. albicans Med shares some functions with model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizacomyces pombe, such as responding to stresses and Med31's role in Ace2-regulated genes. However, it also has additional roles in virulence genes, like morphogenesis and adhesins. Med31,20, and S9/M13 contribute to C. alb's virulence, filamentation, biofilm formation, and ALS is a target for biofilm development. In the worm infection model, Med affects C. alb's virulence. Med31 and S9/M13 regulate cell adhesion genes differently in S. cerevisiae and C. alb, repressing FLO in S cerevis and activating ALS in C. alb. This suggests Med subunits regulate adhesion distinct between species. In Candida glata, Med/G11 plays a conserved role with S cerevis in drug resistance. The study shows C. alb has conserved functions with S cere and Schizo, but additional roles in virulence genes, notably adhes. Phenotypic analysis shows Med subunits' roles in C. alb pathogenesis, growth, biofilm formation. Data show Med subunits control adhesion differently in S cere and C.
Researchers studied how the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa develops resistance to antibiotics when it forms a biofilm, a complex community of bacteria attached to a surface, compared to when it grows freely in liquid. They used a genetic technique to systematically remove and measure the contribution of each gene to antibiotic tolerance in both states. The study found many genes that contribute to resistance in one state but not the other, revealing differences and similarities between biofilm and plankic antibiotic tolerance. The research design mimicked the complexity of natural biofilms and showed behaviors seen in clinical isolates, such as the emergence of quorum-deficient mutants. The study found that the biofilm state itself plays a significant role in resistance, providing a basis for new treatments against P aerugin biofilm infections. The researchers used a transposon mutagenesis and genetic footprinting technology to quantify the contribution of each P aerugin locus to tobrycin in biofilm and plankic states. They competed mutants in a library in four conditions: biofilms with tobrycin and plankic growth without tobr. To understand the role of state and environment in tolerance, they examined the importance of each gene in the presence of toycin as a function of whether the bacterium is in bio or plankic. The study provides a comprehensive examination of antibiotic tolerance in different states and the extent of shared mechanisms and genetic components. While there is overlap between loci that modulate tolerance in bio and plankic cells, most genes are state-specific.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called Flexible Algorithm for Model Selection (FoS) to analyze complex biological systems with many interacting components and limited information about their dynamics. Traditional model selection methods compare a few models or search the entire space, which can be impractical due to the vast number of possibilities. FoS uses local and non-local search methods to avoid getting stuck in local minima and account for similar processes. It was tested on simulated data and shown to handle various structures, then applied to experimental data on CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation under different conditions, revealing dynamic changes in proliferation in 3D cultures compared to suspension. The algorithm can handle diverse models and is useful for complex data-driven model evaluation.

The development of improved search and selection algorithms for complex spaces is crucial for research. FoS was designed for complex dynamics in large spaces and diverse structures. Without prior knowledge, comparing models allows data-driven inference of important processes. There's a need for algorithms efficiently searching large spaces to describe observed dynamics. A previous algorithm worked well on theoretical systems but relied on dense sampling and neglected compensating effects. Other algorithms rely on exhaustive or predefined structures. FoS was motivated for complex systems and can be applied to various problems, unlike others designed for specific structures.
Researchers conducted a 12-month follow-up study in Bolivia to evaluate the effectiveness of benznidazole (BN) treatment in children infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. The study involved 103 seropositive children who received BN treatment, with 3 experiencing side effects. Blood samples were taken before, during, and after treatment, and analyzed for serology, conventional PCR, and real-time PCR, and Th1/Th/2/17 cytokines, including IL-17. Among 57 children who completed follow-up, 6 (11%) showed both PCR+ and qPCR+, 24 (42%) PCR- but q+, and 27 (47%) PCR- and q-. IL-17 levels were significantly higher in seropitive children before treatment and decreased to normal levels after one year. IL-17 levels were positively related to parasite counts by qPCR. At 12 months, IL-17 levels in non-reactive subjects were higher than reactive or ambiguous, suggesting IL-17 as a potential biomarker for BN treatment response. Plasma IL-17 might detect persistent T. cruzi infection and inflammation.
Neisseria meningitidis, the primary cause of bacterial meningitis, has a genome rich in repetitive DNA, nearly 2% of which is occupied by a small transposon called Coria. Bioinformatic analysis identified eight subtypes of the element with four distinct transcriptional ends. Transcription analysis using PCR and lacZ reporter revealed two ends encode strong promoters. The strongest promoter is dictated by polymorphism Y128 at the right end of the element. Examples of elements drive transcription of adjacent genes, while others express non-coding RNAs. Pairwise comparisons of three meningococ genomes show more than two-thirds of Coria maintain subtype at any locus due to recombinational switching between elements in a strain. Upon switching, a new allele spreads through population by natural transformation. This may represent a new mechanism for variation in meningococcus. The strain-to-strain variability of Coria and number of strong promoters allows for widespread effects within population. Defining strength of promoters by subtypes Cor ends provides resource to predict transcription of subtype at locus.
Researchers have identified two genes, Chae and Vel, in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostus, which regulate the production of a toxin called Txin. This toxin promotes virulence, or the ability of the pathogen to cause disease, in maize plants with a specific genetic trait called Texas sterile cytoplasm (Tms). The toxin is produced more in the dark and less in the light, and its production is linked to the expression of a gene called Tox1. Mutants of Chae and Vel produce less toxin and have reduced virulence on maize with Tms and normal cytoplasm. Deletion of Chae or Vel reduces tolerance to hydrogen peroxide and expression of a gene CAT, one of three catalase genes. Chae and Vel mutants also have reduced aerial growth, increased sporulation, and sterility, while overexpression of Chae strains are sterile and Vel strains more fertile. Chae and Vel repress melanin biosynthesis genes, leading to enhanced melanization in mutants and reduced in overexpression strains. The study suggests Chae and Vel positively regulate toxin production, virulence, oxidative stress, development, and growth, and negatively control melanin biosynthesis and differentiation.
Researchers have studied the mechanism of ion selectivity in bacterial Nav channels, which are channels that allow certain ions to pass through the cell membrane while blocking others. They used a combination of non-equilibrium simulations and two-dimensional free energy landscapes to understand how ions move through the selectivity filter of the bacterial Nav channel. The results showed that two potassium ions can block the entrance of the selectivity filter when forces are applied in the inward direction, but not outward. This block occurs in a local minimum of the free energy landscape where two ions can be "locked" in place by forces. In contrast, sodium ions move through the selectivity filter as a unit in a "knock-on" mechanism in both inward and outward directions, with no local minimum in the free landscape for a block state. The non-equilibrium simulations predicted the energy required to break the potassium block is consistent with experimentally measured for bacterial channels to induce inward currents of potassium ions. This study highlights the importance of including non-equilibrium factors in simulations to understand ion selectivity mechanisms. The results differ from those from crystal structures or equilibrium free landscapes and are consistent with electrophysiological measurements of bacterial channels.
Researchers studied the spread of rabies virus in the brains of dogs with furious and paralytic forms of the disease. They found that the furious form had more rapid viral colonization of the cerebral hemispheres, measured by viral antigen in neuronal bodies and RNA. The study quantitatively assessed the amount of rabies antigen in cell processes in a cohort of naturally infected dogs (5 furious and 5 paraly) shortly after illness. Measurements were taken at different levels of spinal cord, brain, and cerebrum. Results compared the amount of rab viral antigen in neuronal bodies. The amount of rab viral antigen in processes decreased in rostral direction, following the pattern of rab antigen in neuronal bodies and percentage of involved bodies. However, there was a delay in process following body involvement, consistent with replication in body and transport to processes. Greater amounts were seen in processes in furious compared to paraly at all levels examined. This was evident when comparing (1) neurons with similar antigen, (2) percentages involved, and (3) levels 100% positive. Findings suggest intracellular transport of virus may be slower in paraly, resulting in slower propagation. Possible mechanisms involve host differences in intracellular transport, possibly cytokine-mediated, as previous studies showed greater inflammation in paraly.
Researchers have studied the role of the protein CTC in regulating gene expression in fruit flies (Drosophila) by identifying its binding sites in the genome. CTC is a zinc-finger protein known to block enhancer-promoter interactions in vertebrates, but its function in Dophila was only recently characterized. One known CTC binding site was previously identified in the Fab-8 insulator in the Bithax complex (BX). The study used chromatin immunoprecipitation with microarray analysis to find CTC sites in BX, 3-M Adh, and Antennedia regions. CTC sites in BX map to known insulators Mc, Fab-6, and Fab-8, and new elements Fab-2, Fab-3, and Fab-4. CTC is associated with all known or predicted insulators in BX except Fab-7, suggesting a common CTC-dependent mechanism. Comparison with Polycomb target sites and histone modification supports BX regulation model. ChIP analysis of CTC sites in BX, 3-Mh, and Antennedia enabled a CTC consensus sequence. CTC clusters may form and mediate chromatin loops, partitioning regulatory elements into domains. CTC is required for Fab-8 insulator function in BX. ChIP analysis of CTC and Su(Hw binding sites shows similar patterns.
Scientists have long understood that enzymes recognize and bind to their substrates through a process called molecular recognition, which often involves conformational changes that prepare the active site for catalysis. However, the details of this process have been poorly understood due to its dynamic nature. Researchers studied the enzyme peptidyl deformase, a metal-dependent enzyme, and its interaction with a slow-binding inhibitor called actin. They solved crystal structures of the initial and final states, as well as intermediate snapshots during the process. The study found that the ligand reshapes a hydrophobic pocket, driving closure of the site, which is then secured by additional interactions. Biochemical and computational analyses allowed reconstruction of the sequence of events from encounter to key binding. A "movie" of the process was created, which can be extrapolated to catalysis.

The study integrated biophysical, computational, and kinetic analyses to better understand the slow-binding mechanism. It focused on induced-fit enzyme inhibition, but the phenomenon is applicable to broader receptor-lig interactions. Slow-binding inhibitors are favored for therapeutics due to unique properties, including potency and long-lasting effects. Actin is a slow-binding inhibitor of peptidase, a metal-dependent enzyme. Crystallographic analysis of enzyme variants, motions and reconstructions of catalytic events have been documented, but often with unnatural inhibitors not mimicking the substrate or transition state of actin. The slow binding kinetics of actin (10 seconds) is puzzling compared to catalysis (10 milliseconds). A conformational effect during hydrogen bond formation, aligning substrate and stabilizing the complex, may explain this.
Researchers have investigated how sensory information is transferred from the thalamus to the cortex, the primary gateway that relays sensory information to the brain. They found that a single cortical cell receives input from many thal cells, but each thal cell also receives feedback from the cortex. During sensory processing, the influence of this feedback loop is largely ignored. The study used dynamic-clamp techniques on thal slices in vitro and combined theoretical approaches to mimic the retinthalocortical pathway. They mimicked cortical input through a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory conductances, resulting in varying levels of afferent activity in thal cells. The study found that efficiency of sensory transmission depends on three factors: the number of thocortical cells, cortthal synaptic statistics, and correlation between thal cells. Counterintuitively, efficiency increases when correlation between thal cells decreases. This suggests that relay cells can be amplified when desynchronized by cortical feedback. This mechanism could direct attention to specific thal subassemblies and select input to cortex based on cortically-defined priorities.
Researchers have investigated the role of a protein called NMAD-1 in regulating DNA replication and repair during meiosis in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that worms lacking NM-1 have reduced fertility and defects in the first stage of meiosis, leading to fewer embryos and more males due to incorrect chromosome segregation. Analysis of the worm's germline showed reduced DNA replication and repair, and increased apoptosis of maturing cells. To understand how NM-1 works, the researchers identified proteins it binds to, including topoisomerase-2, which is involved in DNA repair and replication. NM-1 also localizes with top-2 on chromatin, and most top-2 binding depends on NM-1. This suggests NM-1 acts on chromatin to regulate replication and repair during meiosis in C. elegans. The study aimed to understand NM-1's role in reproduction by analyzing a strain with a deletion of the gene, which removes most of the protein's activity. NM-1 binds to the same sites on chromatin as top-2 and interacts with it in vitro and in vivo, indicating NM- acts on chrom to regulate these processes in meiosis in C. elegans.
Researchers have identified a new protein called adipocyte membrane-associated protein (AAP) that plays a crucial role in the early stage of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. CMV is a common virus that can cause serious diseases in newborns and people with weakened immune systems. The virus has a large genome and complex proteins that can infect many types of human cells, but the way it infects cells is not fully understood. The study found that AAP is necessary for CMV infection in two types of cells: epithelial and fibroblasts. When AAP was knocked out, CMV infection was reduced in these cells. However, when AAP was added to cells that are not usually resistant to CMV, such as canine and murine cells, CM infection increased. The study also found that AAP helps CMV enter cells by interacting with a specific protein on the virus at low pH and moving a protein called pp65 to the nucleus. This suggests AAP is a key player in CMV infection and helps the virus infect multiple types of cells.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model that combines intrinsic and extrinsic factors to understand how hematopoietic progenitor cells make decisions to commit to specific lineages. The model shows that cytokine-mediated receptor feedback can induce a "switch-like" response to external stimuli during multilineage differentiation, providing robustness to both bipotent and committed states while protecting progenitors from noise-induced decommitment. This supports both instruct and stochastic theories of commitment: cell fates are driven by lineage-specific transcription factors, but cytokine signaling strongly biases lineage by regulating inherently noisy cell decisions. The model suggests that kinetics of differentiation to a mature state depend on the progenitor state and chosen route of commitment. It also agrees with lineage receptor expression kinetics from microarray experiments and provides a framework to integrate classical and alternative paths in hematopoies observed experimentally.
Researchers have used electron microscopy to study the structure of the Bunyamwera virus, a member of the Orthunavirus genus, which poses a threat to human and animal health. The virus particles are irregularly shaped but have a repeating pattern of glycoprotein spikes on their surface. Each spike is 18 nanometers long and changes shape when introduced to an acidic environment. Using a technique called subtomography, a three-dimensional model of the trimeric glycoprotein spike was created at a resolution of 3 nanometers. The glycoprotein consists of a fusion protein and has a unique tripod-like arrangement with protein contacts between spikes at the base and tips. This structure is different from previously known fusion protein arrangements, suggesting a wider variety of viral protein combinations. The study shows a change in shape occurs when the virus enters a host cell and provides a blueprint for this group of emerging pathogens. 

The glycoproteins of Bunyamwera virus are similar to those of related viruses that cause disease, sharing 54 and 53% similarity with the segments of SBV and ORO. Despite the impact on health and economy, little is known about Orthunavirus structure. This study uses electron microscopy of the prototypic virus to address the lack of information. Upon acidification, a major change is seen in the head of the trimer spike corresponding to the fusion protein. The results provide the first detailed 3D analysis of Orthunavirus and a model for this group of medically important viruses, showing a unique mode of protein oligomerization.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study on 5,308 individuals of Asian descent to identify genes associated with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), a major cause of blindness in Asia. They found a significant association between a variant in the ABCC5 gene and anterior chamber depth (ACD), a key anatomical risk factor for PG. The AB5 variant was linked to an increased risk of PG in a separate case-control study of 4,276 cases and 18,801 controls. The association strengthened when a subgroup of controls with open angles were included. The study suggests genetic variants influencing AC dimensions may contribute to PG risk. AB5 is expressed in ocular tissues relevant to PG, such as the iris, ciliary body, and lens. The study provides clues to mechanisms underlying PG, a global cause of blindness. The prevalence of precursor to PG, narrow angles, is 10% in many Asian populations. The association between angle closure and shallow AC makes it appropriate to remove at-risk individuals from controls to assess the relationship between AC and PG.
Researchers have identified developmental enhancers, called bilaterally conserved regulatory elements (Bico), that are shared between deuterostomes and protomes, two groups of animals that were previously thought to have distinct developmental toolkits. These enhancers show sequence and gene conservation, suggesting a common regulatory apparatus. Bico are predicted to act as response elements to signaling pathways and drive expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate central nervous system. The discovery of Bico expands our understanding of how developmental logic is encoded in the genome and how it evolves. The small number of identified Bico implies extensive rewiring of cis-regulation between protome and deuterome clades, but additional Bres may be revealed as our understanding of cis-reg logic and bilian genomes grows. Bico are developmental enhancers that encode complex patterns of transcription factor binding sites, such as Bore, an enhancer of Id, which is predicted to function as a BMP responsive element and drives expression in the developing nervous system. The discovery of Bico offers a new avenue for exploring how developmental logic is encoded in the genome and how it evolves.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the impact of vaccination on the diversity of influenza viruses within an individual hosts. They analyzed data from a randomized, controlled trial of vaccine efficacy and used next-generation sequencing to characterize the diversity of influenza A virus and assess the effect of vaccine-induced immunity within populations. The study isolated the impact of vaccination while allowing for natural infection to occur. They found 166 cases of H3N2 influenza over 3 seasons and 19 years and obtained genome data for 119 samples, identifying intrah single nucleotide variants ≥1% frequency. Phylogenetic analysis showed no stratification by pre-hemagglutination and neuraminase inhibition titers. The majority of intrah single nucleotide variants were rare and few were found in more than one individual. Most samples had fewer than 15 nucleotide variants across the genome, and diversity did not vary by sampling day, vaccination status, or pre-antibody titer. Contrary to expectations, vaccination had little impact on intrah diversity in natural infection and vaccine immunity may be a minor contributor to antigen drift at local scales.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of a genetically modified, live attenuated Leishmania donovani parasite (LC-/-) in inducing a protective immune response against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in mice of different ages. VL is a severe disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donani, with no effective vaccine available for any age group. Previous studies showed LC- induced a strong immune response in young mice. This study compared LC- mediated immune response in 18-month-old (aged) and 2-month (young) mice. Analysis of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from infected with LC- showed enhanced effector responses, augmenting CD4+ T cell function compared to wild-type (WT) infected cells. Similarly, splenic dendritic cells from LC-infected young and aged mice induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IL-6, IF-γ, TNF) and down-regulated anti-inflammatory (IL-10) genes compared to WT. Immunization with LC- induced IgG2 antibodies, lymphoproliferative response, pro-inflammatory responses, and heightened leishicidal activity in young and aged mice. Upon virulent Leish challenge, LC-immunized mice displayed multifunctional Th1 CD and cytotoxic CD T cells, reducing parasite burden in spleen and liver compared to naive. However, LC-induced response in aged mice was reduced compared to young, correlating less protection.
Researchers created chimeric viruses by combining the capsid proteins of enteric and respiratory enteroviruses (EVs) to understand why these viruses have different properties and cause various diseases. They found that the capsid proteins determine the viruses' sensitivity to acid, optimal growth temperature, and tissue preference for replication in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract, which are key factors in their virulence. Using a chimeric virus with the capsid of EV68 (respiratory) and EV94 (enteric), they showed that capsid proteins are necessary and sufficient for acid sensitivity and tropism in cell lines and tissues. They also found that capsid genes influence optimal growth temperature, as EV94 adapted to higher temperatures with a mutation in VP1, while EV68 capsid did not. Additionally, EV68 maintained infectivity after acid treatment, but non-structural proteins modulated the immune response. This study reveals another layer of diversity in one of the most prevalent pathogens and may aid in vaccine or antiviral development.
Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein gE-I is a transmembrane receptor found on the surface of infected cells and virions that binds human immunoglobulin G (Ig). It can also participate in antibody bridging (ABB), a process where antigen fragments (Fab) of Ig bind viral antigen while Fc binds to gE-I. IgFc binds g-E at basic, but not acidic pH, suggesting Ig bound extracellularly by surface g-E would dissociate and degrade in acidic endosomes/lysosomes if endocytosed. The fate of viral antigens associated with g-E bound Ig was unknown: could remain surface or endocyt with Ig. Researchers developed an in vitro system to study ABB and trafficking using 4-D confocal imaging of A complexes with transferrin or epidermal growth, characterized intracellular markers. Data showed cells expressing g-E and viral HSV-1 endocyt anti-D Ig and g in g-E dependent, resulting lysosomal localization. This suggests g-E can mediate clearance of infected surfaces of anti-viral host Ig and viral antig to evade Ig-mediated responses, a mechanism for viral receptors in evasion and pathogenesis.
Researchers studied the transcriptome of the protoscoleces (PSC) of Echinococcus granulosus, a parasite that causes cistic hydatid disease in humans and animals. They used Roche 454 sequencing and in silico analysis to explore the excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs) released by the parasite. The study generated 26,514 non-reduant sequences, of which 22,910 (86.4%) were mapped to the published E. granus genome and 17,705 (66.8%) were in coding sequence (CDS) regions. Of the 2,280 predicted ESPs, 138 were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, 124 in protein metabolism, and 11 in glycolysis/glucone (GLN) pathways. Additionally, 44 antigen proteins, molecular chaperones, and proteases were identified. Many proteins were enriched in development-related pathways, such as TGF receptor and insulin pathways. This study provides valuable information on parasite adaptation to hosts, aiding novel intervention targets for hydat treatment and control.
In the fungus Aspergillus nidans, the protein NirA plays a crucial role in regulating the assimilation of nitrate, a major nitrogen source in soil. When nitrate is present, NirA accumulates in the nucleus and activates transcription of genes involved in nit assimilation. However, in the absence of nit, Nir is predominantly found in the cytosol and inactive. Researchers used mass spectrometry to find that in the absence of nit, methion 169 in Nir's nuclear export sequence (NES) is oxidized to methion sulfox (Metox). This oxidation depends on Fmo, a flav-containing monxygen, which uses methion and cystine but not glutathione as substrates. The function of Fmo cannot be replaced by alternative F proteins in A. nidans. Exposure to nit led to rapid reduction of Nir-Met169 to Met169, independent of thiorexin and methion sulfox reductases. Replacement of Met169 with isoleuc, a sterically similar but not oxidizable residue, led to partial loss of Nir activity and insensitivity to Fmo-mediated export. In contrast, replacement of Met with alanine transformed the protein into a permanently nuclear and active factor. Co-immoprecipitation of Nir-Kap interactions and subcell localization of Nir mutants provided evidence that Met oxidation leads to change in Nir conformation.
Researchers studied how functional constraints shape the evolution of mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels, which are crucial for propagating action potentials. Since the 1950s, mathematical models by Hodgkin and Hux suggested that sodium channel properties need to be tightly constrained for action potential to propagate. There are nine mammalian genes encoding voltage-gated channels, many of which are more than 90% identical in sequence, suggesting similar function. However, the multiplicity of genes raises the question: why so many? The researchers demonstrated that the simplest constraints - membrane excitability and uniqueness of resting potential - directly constrain sodium properties. They compared predicted constraints with data on mammalian channel properties from literature, including 172 sets of measurements from 40 publications, wild-type and mutant, under various conditions. Data from all channels, including mutants, obeyed the excitability constraint, while channels in muscle obeyed the resting constraint. Excitability alone distinguished nine channels into four groups consistent with phylogenetic analysis. Calculations suggest functional differences between groups.
Researchers have been searching for new antiviral drugs to treat serious influenza infections, as current options are prone to resistance. The influenza polymerase, which transcribes and replicates the virus genome, is a target for antiv drugs as it can stop replication early. Studies on the polymer's domains have led to a structure-based approach to optimize inhibitors. The unique cap-snatching mechanism of transcription can be inhibited by targeting the PB cap-binding or endonuc domains. This study presents high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the 2009 H1N1 PA endonuc domain with specific inhibitors, including diketo compounds and green tea catechin, which chelate manganese ions in the active site. The binding modes of different compounds and mononucleotide phosphate show how substituents on the metal scaffold can bind in distinct pockets and the active site's plasticity. This will help design more potent inhibitors for the capatching enduc activity of the virus polymer. 

The enduc structure provides detailed information on inhibitor binding to the polymer. New options for targeting the virus are needed. This will guide medicinal chemistry to optimize lead compounds for efficient enduc inhibition. Additional enduc-inhibitor structures and sequence variations for resistance will advance novel and efficacious therapeutics. The capatching mechanism has been a target since it stalls replication, is conserved, and no host counterpart. Despite trials, no H3 enduc structures have been obtained with inhibitors or analogs, limiting structure optimization. The enduc from other strains with different sequences yielded crystals. This study reports pH1 enduc with divalent ions and 4-substit 2-dioxo acid.
A new immunization protocol has been developed to produce potent polyspecific antiven against three medically important vipers in Thailand and neighboring countries, namely Caloselasma rhodoma, Cryptelyrops alab, and Dabo siensis. The protocol uses a "low dose, low multi-site" immunization method, which has been shown to be effective in producing antiven against elapid and cobra venoms. Four horses were immunized with a mixture of the three viper venoms, resulting in a rapid increase in ELISA titers against all three venoms, reaching a plateau at the 8th week post-immunization. The in vivo neutralization potency of the antisera against the venoms was 10.40, 2.42, and 0.76 mg/ml, respectively, exceeding the minimal limits set by the Queen Saoh Memorial Institute. The polyspecific antisera also effectively neutralized the procoagulant, hemorrhagic, necrotic, and nephroxic activities of the venoms. This immunization protocol is useful for producing potent polyspecific antiven against snake venoms and equine antiserum against tetanus, diphtheria, and rabies.
Researchers have found that a protein called Sse, produced by the Salmonella bacteria, helps the bacteria to maintain a long-term infection in the body by stopping the movement of immune cells called macrophages and dendritic cells. These cells are important for fighting off infections, but when they can't move properly, the body can't clear the bacteria. Sse works by binding to a host protein called IQAP, which is involved in cell movement. A mutation in Sse eliminates its function. In mice infected with Salmonella, fewer immune cells were found in the spleen when Sse was present compared to when it was not. This suggests that Sse is crucial for the bacteria to stay in the body for a long time.
Researchers have identified a genetic mechanism behind the increased virulence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), a pathogen that causes severe disease in healthy individuals. CA-MRSA is more virulent than hospital-acquired-MRSA (HARSA). The study found that the product of the p-mec gene, located in the mobile genetic element SCCm of HARS, but not CA, suppresses the expression of phenol-sol-soluble modulin (PSM), a cytolytic toxin of S. aureus. The p-m RNA inhibits translation of the agr gene encoding a transcription factor for PSM via specific binding to agr mRNA. Mutations in the p-m promoter in 25% of 325 clinical MRSA isolates attenuated transcription, and 9% had no p-m. Most p-mutated or p-m-deleted HARSAs had increased PSM expression compared to intact p-m strains, and some produced high amounts comparable to CA-MRSA. Deletion of p-m from HARS carrying p-m increased expression of Agr and P, and virulence in mice. p-m suppresses MRSA virulence via inhibition of agr translation and absence of p-m in CARSA causes high virulence.
Researchers investigated the phenomenon of antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) in type I interferon-deficient mice, which occurs when maternal antibodies from a previous deng infection enhance the severity of a subsequent infection with a different deng virus serotype. They found that 5-week-old A129 mice born to DENV-immune mothers succumbed to D2 infection within 4 days, whereas those born to naïve mothers survived. Clinical manifestations included hepatocyte vacuolation, vascular leakage, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Anti-TNF therapy protected the mice and correlated with healthy hepatocytes, while blocking IL-6 did not impact virus titers or outcome. This model may help dissect mechanisms in deng pathogenesis and evaluate vaccine/therapeutic candidates. ADE has been reported in mice with cross-reactive, non-neutral antibodies and matally acquired heterotyp deng antibodies induced A in AG129 mice with earlier death, increased viremia and vascular permeability upon D2 infection of mice to D1-imm mothers compared to naïve mothers. The study used immunocomised AG129 mice, deficient in type I and II IF receptors, which are not susceptible to D infection due to virus inability to interfere with murine IF response.
Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify factors associated with visceral leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the Leishmania infantum parasite, in the Americas. They analyzed 51 studies and found that male sex was associated with visceral leishiasis when diagnosed by skin test, but not when diagnosed serologically. Younger individuals were less likely to be infected but more prone to illness. Presence of dogs at home, higher seropositivity in nearby, lower socioeconomic status, and vegetated areas were linked to infection, while chickens in the house and nutritional status were not. Ecological studies showed dog seropositivity associated with human visceral leishias, highlighting dogs as a marker for disease occurrence. This is the first review of its kind in the Americas, clarifying some aspects and raising new questions about the disease dynamics. However, results cannot be applied to other contexts due to the disease's unique characteristics. A review of risk factors in Asia showed similar patterns, such as clustering, household conditions, vegetation, and poverty. In Brazil, case-fatality rates varied between 4.2-10% in treated patients. Diagnosis methods include hypersensitivity, parasitological, serological, and molecular tests.
Inhalation of Francisella tularens (Ft) causes acute and fatal pneumonia, and the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis and lethality remain unclear. Research reveals that an innate cellular response, not bacterial burden or cytokine production, drives pathology and mortality in pulmonary tularem. Leth infection elicits medullary and extra-medullary myelopoiesis, recruiting immature myeloid and myeloid suppressor cells (IM/MD) to the lungs, which fail to mature and die, leading to necrotic lung damage, loss of function, and host death. This process is partially dependent on Ly6+ cells. Acceleration of this process may account for rapid lethality with Schu4. In contrast, sub-lethal infection with LVS shows a predominance of mature neutrophils and monocytes, required for protection, suggesting a threshold for lethal infection. Eliciting mature phagocytic response provides transient protection against Schu4. The study suggests the nature of myoid response determines host mortality versus survival in Francisella infection.
Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, is an invasive species that spreads rapidly and can transmit diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses. To understand its spread and mitigate risks, researchers reconstructed its colonization pattern using population genetics and Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approaches. The study found that in Southeast Asia, populations from China, Thailand, and Japan have low differentiation and high co-ancestry values, indicating a common origin and high connectivity. China appears to be the oldest population. Outside Asia, invasion in La Reunion, America, and the Mediterranean is supported by chaotic distribution, maintaining high diversity in adventive populations. Independent introductions may have facilitated establishment through admixture of unrelated genomes, resulting in intra-population variability. This may extend to genetic mechanisms controlling vector competence. In the invasion context, ancestry and admixture create conditions for efficient transmission and outbreaks. The study provides origins of populations from Southeast Asia, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Pacific, and North America, valuable for predicting vector capacity and risk models. Variation in eco-geographic populations may result from interactions between genetic and environmental factors, crucial for assessing arvirus outbreaks in old and new areas. Invasion routes were inferred using Approx Bayesian computation, implemented in DIY2.0. The Chinese sample, collected in Southeast coastal native area, has low differentiation and high coance values with other Asian samples, confirming ancestral origin. albict was primarily supported by chaotic distribution mediated by human activity.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes chronic infections in wounds and found that its ability to grow in high-density environments, rather than its virulence or biofilm functions, is key to its fitness in these infections. They analyzed clinical isolates from human wounds and found that many were defective in virulence and biofilm formation, and that these functions were not necessary for bacterial fitness in mouse wounds. In contrast, genes involved in anaerobic growth, metabolism, energy production, and membrane integrity were crucial. This was consistent with findings that impaired mutants' fitness could be represented by anaerobic, oxidative, and membrane stress conditions in vitro and high-density bacterial growth in the absence of a host. These results shed light on bacterial functions in chronic infections, the nature of stresses on bacteria at infection sites, and suggest targets to compromise infection pathogenesis.
A study was conducted at the Center for Teaching, Research, and Referral for Bancrofilariasis (NEF) in a bancrofilariasis endemic area to evaluate the occurrence of intrascrot lymphangiectasia, testis morphology, and consistency, and hydrocele recurrence in patients who underwent hydrocelectomy. A total of 968 patients with unilateral or bilateral hydrocele (Group 1) and 218 patients from the same area who had undergone hydrocele-sparing hydrolectomy elsewhere (Comparison Group) were enrolled. Twenty patients from the Comparison with hydrocele were reoperated at NEF and constitute Group 2. In Group 1, 1128 hydrolectomies were performed (mean age 30.3yr, mean follow-up 8.6yr). Hydro recurrence rates in Group 1 and Comparison (age 31.5) were 0.3% and 19.3, respectively (p<0.001). There was no recurrence in Group 2 (age 25.1, mean follow 6yr). Perioperatively, leaking or dilated lymphatic vessels were seen on the inner or outer surface of hydrocele wall or surrounding tissue in 30.9% and 46.3 of patients in Group 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.081). Testicles were abnormal in shape, volume, and consistency in 203/128 (18%) and 10/28 (35.7) patients from Group 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.025). Lymph fluid from dilated lymphatic vessels is a component of chronic hydrocele fluid threatening test integrity in bancfilari endemic areas. To prevent recurrence, authors advise complete excision of hydrocele when leaking or dilated vessels are sutured or excised.
Researchers have identified a deubiquinating enzyme, Ts37, in the parasite Trichella spiralis, a zoonotic nematode that causes trichlos, a disease found on all continents except Antarctica. Trich spir infects skeletal muscle cells, disrupting their function. A probe was used to identify deubiquinating activity in T spir larvae, and immuno-blot and imm-precipitation identified several potential Ds. These were analyzed by LC/MS, yielding peptides with homology to 5 conserved human Ds: UCH5, U3, HAP, OT6, and Atin-3. The gene encoding putative U5 homologue, Ts37, was cloned and recombinant protein expressed and purified. Deubiquinating activity was verified by Ub-AM assay. Recombinant Ts37 co-precipitated with putative spir proteome components, including yeast homologue ADR1. Inhibitor LD-44 specifically inhibited recombin Ts37 and reduced L larvae viability. This study reports the first T spir D, a cystine protease orthologous to human U5. Results suggest interaction with proteome conserved throughout evolution.
Researchers have identified a new potential target for treating Chagas disease, a tropical illness caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The parasite's cysteine protease enzyme, cruzain, has been considered a valid target for treatment, but its inhibition doesn't fully explain the effectiveness of certain compounds against the parasite. Two nitrile-based cystine protease inhibitors showed anti-tryosomal activity in the 0.1-1μM to 1μM range, with two compounds having EC50 values of 0.12μM and 0.25M, significantly lower than their Ki values against cruzain, a recombinant form of cruzain. This suggests the compounds' anti-tryosomal activity may not be solely due to cruzain inhibition, indicating a potential polypharmacological profile towards cystine proteases. Another study evaluated cathepsin inhibitors on a cyclohexane dicbox scaffold, showing anti-tryosomal activity greater than expected from cruzain inhibition. cruz is a validated target for Chagas treatment, with oral activity of cystine inhibitor 777 in animal models providing basis for validation. Efficacy of 3 and analogs in a murine Chagas model motivated the study. Potent dipeptyl nitr inhibitors of cruz showed no anti-tryosomal activity, questioning cruz potency as predictor. Results suggest anti-tryosomal effects of potent compounds may be due to inhibition of other cystine proteases, such as cruzain-2, not yet identified as targets. Compounds 5 and 11 may have a polypharmac profile, targeting cruzain isoforms or other cystine proteases in the parasite. Cystine inhibition profile suggests a new antag target may share characteristics with cathein, and phenic screening for antag agents should include potent inhibitors of this enzyme.
Researchers have created a detailed map of the physical structure of the maize genome, which covers 93.5% of the genome and is aligned with 86.1% of the genetic map. The map contains 25,908 genetic markers that align nearly 73% of the maize genome to the rice genome. The study found that 1 kilobase in rice corresponds to 3.2 kilobase in maize, indicating a 6-fold genome expansion. This is due to maize's polyploid origin, where most regions correspond to two regions in maize. Inversions account for most chromosome variations during diploidization. The study also found evidence of ancient duplication before maize and rice divergence. Reconstructing the paleobotany of maize indicates its progenitors had 10 chromosomes.

The alignment of genomes shed light on chromosomes contributing to polloid, rearrangements and diploid, and homologous regions. RFLP mapping showed two maize chromosomes align with one rice and sorghum, a whole genome duplication event. Table 3 shows primary and secondary duplications in maize. Detection of 3 copies per over (Table 2) supports tetraploid emergence. Duplications in rice are not limited to ancestor and maize. Average size is similar to rice physical map. A genetic map was developed to anchor and orient contigs along chromosomes. Multiple events contribute to complex pattern, recent duplication easier than ancient. Synteny shows rearrangements since maize and rice divergence.
Researchers investigated the generation of infectious prions, the proteinaceous agents responsible for transmissible spong encephalopathies, in vitro. They aimed to mimic the early etiology of sporadic disease by de novo generation of infectious prions. Using protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PM) procedure, they analyzed the possibility of spontaneous generation of prions. Under standard PM conditions, de novo generation of prions was not observed, supporting its use for diagnostic applications. However, PM was modified to generate prions in the absence of pre-existing prions in different species at a low and variable rate. De novo generated prions were infectious when inoculated into wild-type hamsters, producing a new disease with unique clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical features. This study provides additional evidence for the prion hypothesis and a model to study sporadic disease mechanism. It also suggests prion diversity is not restricted to known forms, and new infectious foldings may produce novel phenotypes.
Researchers have developed a neural model, called the Angular Velocity Unit (AV), to estimate angular velocity in bees, which can reproduce experimental observations of visual odometry and corridor-centering in free-flying honeybees, including previously unaccounted behaviors. The model is based on electrophysiological data and tested with behavioral data. According to the model, the AV response can be considered an extension of the optomotor response. The model is tested behaviorally in silico with the corridor-center paradigm, where bees navigate a corridor with gratings (square or sinusoidal) on walls. When combined with an existing flight algorithm, the detector reproduces invariance of the flight path to the frequency and contrast of gratings, including deviations from centering behavior found in real bees. The detector also responds to unit movement along the corridor for a range of grating frequencies, demonstrating it can be used as a visual odometer.

The model, called the Angular Detector Unit (ADU), reproduces behavioral patterns previously unaccounted for in corridor-center response, including deviation of flight path from center due to frequency differences in sinusoidal gratings and deviations from center for square and sinusoidal gratings. The detector only responds to temporal frequencies 10-100Hz, lower than experienced in behavioral experiments on honeybees. Additional circuitry for calculating AV estimation must be present. Neural recordings from ventral nerve of honeybee found distinct responses to moving patterns in view. Odometry is unaffected by environment frequency, suggesting AV responses could estimate distance by summing output over visual field. The model tested this relationship, results in Fig 11, show for range frequencies 0.1-0.
A long-term follow-up study of 50 African trypanosomiasis (AT) patients from the Ivory Coast who refused treatment after initial diagnosis found that 10 out of 11 patients who continued to refuse treatment showed parasite clearance using microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Most of these patients (7/10) displayed decreasing serological responses, becoming negative to trypanosome antigens (Li1.3, 1.5, and 1.6). The study found two alternative progressions of AT: an asymptomatic infection with long-lasting serological responses and spontaneous resolution with negative parasitological and PCR results and dropping antibody titers. This is in contrast to the classic lethal outcome of AT. The study does not estimate the frequency of these alternative courses, but notes that field control programs encounter subjects with positive serological results but negative parasitological tests. Recognizing trypanotolerance in humans, as accepted in animals, is a step forward for future research in AT.
Researchers investigated whether ionizing radiation selects for p53-deficient hematopoietic progenitors in mice. p53 is a tumor suppressor gene, and its loss can provide resistance to genotoxic stimuli, including radiation. Given that p53 null mice develop lymphomas with high penetrance and irradiation accelerates lymphoma in p heterozygous mice, they hypothesized that selection for p-deficient cells contributes to the link between irradiation and lymphoid malignancies. They found that p53 disruption does not provide a selective advantage in unstressed hematopoietic system or previously irradiated BM allowed to recover. However, upon irradiation, p53 confers a selective advantage, leading to long-term expansion of p-def clones and increased lymphoma. Selection for p-def cells is attributed to protection from irradi-induced ablation of progenitor cells, prevention of irradi-induced loss of clonogenic capacity for stem and progenitor, improved maintenance of progenitor fitness, and elimination of competing p-type progenitors.
Researchers have identified a protein called SmKI-1 in the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, a type of flatworm that causes schistosomiasis in humans. This protein acts as a serine protease inhibitor, which means it blocks the activity of enzymes called trypsin and neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase is a key component of the human immune system that helps fight off infections and inflammation. The study found that SmKI-1 binds to the active site of neutil elast, preventing it from functioning properly. This could be a mechanism used by the parasite to evade the host's immune system. The researchers also showed that Sm-1 inhibits the ability of neutil to kill schistosomes, the larval stage of the parasite. To understand the role of Sm-1 in the parasite, they knocked down its gene in the parasite and observed a significant impact on its development in vitro and in vivo. They also tested Sm-1's ability to reduce inflammation in mouse models of diseases, such as liver damage caused by acetaminophen and arthritis. Sm-1 reduced neutrophil recruitment and elast activity in these models. In another model, it reduced neutil accumulation, IL-1 secretion, and hyperiception. Sm-1 also inhibited neutil recruitment in response to carrageenan in mice. The study concludes that Sm-1 is essential for parasite survival and has potential as a therapeutic against inflammatory diseases.
Researchers have developed a new method to accurately model high-resolution structures of transmembrane helical (TM) proteins from distant homologues, which are proteins with similar but not identical structures. These proteins are crucial for various cellular functions, but their structures are largely uncharacterized and hard to predict due to lack of close homologs. The method was tested on 50 pairs of TM protein homologs with diverse topologies, sizes, and sequence identities, and achieved near-atomic accuracy in membrane-embedded regions. It outperformed starting templates and is suitable for computer-based protein engineering, redesigned and X-ray structures showed similar interactions. The method was validated in two blind predictions, including adenosine A2 and chemokine CX4 receptors, and ranked first in accuracy. It should be useful for modeling and designing large structurally uncharacterized TM proteins from various homologs.
Listeria monocytogen, the bacterium responsible for listeriosis, a foodborne disease that poses serious risks to fetuses, newborns, and immunocompromised individuals, has been found to switch from an active, motile lifestyle to a persistent state in vacuolar lifestyle in epithelial cells. During infection in human hepatocytes or trophlast cells, L monocogen ceases to produce the actin nucleating protein Act and becomes trapped in lysosome-like vacuoles termed Lister-Containing Vacoles (Lis). Subpopulations of bacteria resist degradation in Lis and enter a slow-replicative state. When Act is absent, as in ΔAct mutants, vacolar bacteria parasitize host cells in a "viable but nonculturable" (VB) state, preventing detection by conventional counting methods. Exposure to high doses of gentamicin does not trigger Lis formation but selects for vacolar and VB bacteria. These results reveal L monocogen's ability to enter a persistent state in epithelial cells, favoring asymptomatic carriage, lengthening incubation of listiosis and bacterial survival during therapy.
Researchers developed a neuromechanical model of auditory streaming to study the alternations between integrated and segregated percepts in the A-BA triplet paradigm. The model combines neurophysiological and psychoacoustic experiments to characterize the effects of manipulating stimulus parameters. Unlike previous models, it includes neuronal units with sensory-dependent inputs mimicking the pulsatilike responses to tones and a computation for competition in the primary auditory cortex. Mutual inhibition, adaptation, and noise are implemented, along with NMDA recurrent excitation for temporal memory. Percepts are identified in the firing patterns of units. The model predicts that manipulating the frequency difference between A and B tones affects the dominance of the stronger percept, a property established in visual bistable paradigms. Psychoac experiments confirmed the prediction and constrained the model, achieving quantitative agreement between results. The model provides a platform to extend to other conditions, including context and volition.

The study focuses on the dynamics after the build phase, motivated by physiological and perceptual bistability models. It incorporates sound-evoked A1 responses to a competition and identifies percepts in neuronal dynamics. NMD-like dynamics enables binding from one triplet to the next. Increasing stimulus strength favors the attended percept, but inputs should be dynamic and dependent on percept state. Future work will explore attention effects in streaming. Alternations after the build, the neuromechanical formulation distinguishes from auditory models. Parameters balance adaptation and noise were tuned to match percept durations, fitting a log distribution. A responses were interpreted using neuetric functions mimicking build.
Researchers have developed a method to assess the allergenicity of Schistosoma mansoni proteins using a humanized Ratophil Leukemia cell line (RSAT8) and a cell-free translation system. This method allows for rapid production of parasite proteins in 90 minutes, eliminating the need for purification. Antigen integrity is confirmed using Western blotting. The RSAT8 cell line is challenged with the translated proteins and luciferase activity measured, indicating cellular activation by the allergen. The method is suitable for medium to high-throughput studies using individual sera and can assess potential allergenic of anti-helminthic vaccine candidates. Characterized parasitic allergens such as Par 2, SmAL-1, and IgE factor SE/alpha-1 were expressed in wheat lysate and E.coli and activated the basophil reporter line, while SmAL2 did not. This technology enables genome-wide assessment of S mans allergenicity, the Schistos allergome, and unravelling the allergome of S mans and other parasites. This could lead to understanding of basis of allergity and relationship between parasite IgE and host mechanisms at molecular level.
Researchers studied the phenomenon of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila, a type of genomic incompatibility that occurs when the abundance of transposable elements (TEs) differs between two parents. They found that when TEs inherited from the father are absent in the mother's genome, they can become activated in the offspring, causing germline damage and sterility. Using D. virilis as a model, they characterized the effects of divergence in TE profile between parents on offspring. They discovered that divergence in the TE landscape is associated with persisting differences in germl TE expression between genetically identical females of reciprocal crosses, and these differences are transmitted to the next generation. Chronic and persisting TE expression coincides with increased levels of piRNAs associated with reduced gene expression. They also found that gene expression is idiosyncratically influenced by differences in piRNA profile of parents that arise from polymorphic TE insertions. These results support a model where early germl events in dysgenesis establish a stable state of TE and gene expression in germl maintained through adulthood and transmitted to next generation.
Researchers have identified a potential new target for treating Fragile X Syndrome, a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. They found that overexpressing three histone deacetylases (HDAC3, 6, or 11) suppresses neurodegeneration in a Drosila model of Fragile X. This suppression is due to selective transcriptional repression of the CG repeat-containing gene. The study suggests the CG repeat induces changes in histone acetylation at the F1 locus, leading to increased F1 expression and neurode. The researchers also found increased acetylation of histones at the F1 locus in patient lymphoblasts and fibroblasts with the disorder, correlating with elevated F1 expression. Histone acetylase inhibitors reduced F1 expression to control levels in patient cell lines and extended lifespan in CG repeat-expressing Dila. These findings support a model where the CG repeat promotes chromatin remodeling, increasing toxic F1 expression.
Researchers have found that genetics play a crucial role in controlling CD8 T cell function and immunopathology during chronic viral infection. CD8 T cells are vital for controlling chronic viral infections, but factors such as the host's immune response contribute to maintaining effector CD8 cell responses versus CD T cell exhaustion during chronic infection. The study examined the impact of MHC heterogeneity versus non-MHC host genetics on the development of chronic infection by infecting mice with the clone-13 strain of lymphocytic choriomitis virus (LCMV). Results showed that mice with increased MHC diversity had better control of the virus compared to those with less MHC diversity. Notably, mice on a specific genetic background succumbed to the infection, but CD T cell depletion prevented mortality, indicating mortality was CD T-cell dependent. These mice maintained CD T effector cytokine production and reduced T exhaustion marker PD-1 expression, and induced a larger Th1 response. Mortality in these mice was also dependent on CD T-mediated IF-γ production. The study indicates that increased M heterogeneity results in a higher frequency of responding CD T cells during chronic infection, and both immune environment and M diversity contribute to T-dependent viral clearance and mortality.
A recent study analyzed the genetic characteristics of Bacillus anthracis isolated from northwestern China from 1990 to 2016. Anthrax is a re-emerging zoon disease in China, particularly in rural areas. The study described the general characteristics of human anthrax outbreaks in northwestern China over the past decade and analyzed the genetic of Bacillus anthracis using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and multilocus-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) with 15 markers. Five subline/subgroups, A. Br.001/002, A. Br. Voll, A. Br94, A. Br Ames, and A. Br.008/009, were detected using 13 SNP sites. All subgroups were found in Xinjiang, while one in Shaanxi, two Gans, three Qinghai, and four in Inner Mongolia. The geographical distribution of B. anthrac populations exhibited different SNP characteristics from strains before 1990 in China. A. Br Ames was observed scattered from Inner to other provinces. All 106 strains were assigned 36 MLVA genotypes, 21 of which were first observed in this study. Strains from recent outbreaks were classified subgroups A. Br.001 and A. Br and genotypes MLVA-28, ML-30, ML-31, ML-38, ML-CH3, and MLCH18. By SNP and MLVA, diversification ML genotypes and geographical B anthrac populations became balanced across northwestern China. This study provided preliminary results on B. anthrac diversity in China, promoting prevention and control of this disease.

The study used methods to track anthrax outbreaks and illustrate phylogen relationships B anthrac national international levels. China strains isolated Xinjiang 1982 genotyped these methods. Since 2005, Anthrax Surveillance covered 12 provinces mainland China. Human anth cases reported 86 total 2016. Recent human and livestock outbreaks reported provinces Liaoning, Jiang, Yunn, Xin. Four large-scale outbreaks north China 2011, 201,2016. A comprehensive retrospective epidemiological molecular study B anthrac species conducted. Br Ames found Xin. ML15 identified new genotypes MLCH3, CH7, CH18 Inner ML31 Xin. 106 B anthrac strains 13 samples provinces distributed 5 SNP subgroups described Vanrt. These subgroups Br.001 (50), Br (18), Br.008 (11), Br Voll (4), Br94 (23).
Researchers studied the role of goblet cells, a type of cell in the intestinal lining of the gut, in defending against bacterial infections. They found that goblet cells produce a molecule called REL-β, which recruits CD4 T cells, a type of immune cell, to the site of infection. This recruitment of CD4 cells leads to increased proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells, the cells that line the gut, and production of a protective cytokine called IL-22. Without RELβ, mice were more susceptible to infection and had deeper penetration of bacteria into the gut lining, leading to ulcers and increased mortality. The study suggests goblet cells play a critical role in recruiting CD4 cells to protect against enteric pathogens.
Researchers have identified a crucial interaction between the C-terminal motif of norovirus VP and the HE-1 domain of eIF4, which is essential for translation initiation. Norovirus, a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans, uses an unusual mechanism to initiate protein synthesis that relies on interactions between VP protein attached to the 5' end of the RNA and eukotic factors in the host. The study focused on murine norirus (MNV) and found that VP binds to the middle fragment of e4 (residues 652-113). Using pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy, and isothermal calorimetry, they demonstrated that a 20 amino acid stretch at the C-terminus of MN VP mediates direct and specific binding to HE-1 within the fragment of e4. Analysis revealed the MN C-termin binds e4 HE-1 via a conserved motif in all noriruses. Mutagenic mapping suggested the MN VP C-termin interacts e4 in a helical conformation. NMR spectroscopy defined the VP binding site on e4 HE-1, confirmed by mutagenesis and binding assays. The site is non-overlapping with binding for e4 on e HE-1, showing norirus VP can form ternary VP-e4-e4 complexes. A fusion proteins containing the C-terminal of MN VP inhibited in vitro translation of norirus but not cap or I-dependent. This defines structural and functional interaction between norirus VP and e4, revealing a binding site that might be targeted for antiviral therapy.
Researchers investigated the evolution of gene clusters in bacterial genomes, where genes encoding proteins in a common pathway are often found near each other on the chromosome. Several explanations have been proposed, including natural selection favoring clusters for efficiency, the selfish operon model, and persistence model. The selfish model suggests clusters are easily transferred to other species, improving survival, while the persistence model proposes genes in proximity are less likely to be disrupted by deletions. The study developed computational models to examine conditions for cluster evolution. The selfish model was re-implemented and run under various conditions, then a Moran process with selection and gene rearrangement by inversion was introduced, and a model with selection and inversion was developed. Surprisingly, clusters failed to evolve under many conditions. Factors promoting evolution include low gene number in pathway, high population size, and selfish model, high transfer rate. The analysis showed evolution can occur under direct and indirect selection with certain conditions, making the selfish model a viable explanation for clusters. However, the model cannot explain clusters in order of biochemical reactions, proposing multiple mechanisms, including transfer. The persistence model explains clustering of essential genes, less likely to be disrupted by deletion. The selfish model offers evolution without selection, clusters persisting due to proximity facilitating transfer between species, applying to accessory genes. A model was constructed with a Moran process and inversion, tracking a population of bacteria with a pathway of 3 or more genes. The selfish model was re-examined by varying parameters, revealing conditions for clustering.
Malaria, caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical regions worldwide. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to severe consequences of infection due to the adhesion of parasite-infected erythrocytes in the placenta. This adhesion is mediated by a variant of Pf1, a parasite-encoded, hyper-variable antigen on the surface of infected cells, called VARCSA, which binds to chondroit sulfate on syncyotrophlasts in the intervillous space of placent. VARCS is only expressed in the presence of placenta, suggesting its expression is repressed in men or non-pregnant women, but the mechanism is not understood. Researchers found that the gene encoding VARCS contains a small open reading frame that represses translation of the mRNA, a novel form of regulation in malaria parasites. This mechanism is reversible, allowing high levels of protein upon selection, enabling parasites to upregulate expression in presence of appropriate tissue.

 Studies on mechanisms of VARCS expression and protein in general will provide insights into host-parasite interactions underlying pathogenesis of disease. Analysis of 5 leader of VARCS transcripts from selected for binding and isolated from pregnant women revealed the found upstream of Pf1 region not spliced and present in mRNA, indicating VARCS encoded by bicronic transcript. This suggests additional regulation of Pf1 variant with pregnancy malaria, preventing expression when plac not available. VARCS transcripts detected in non-pregn individuals, including children and men, suggesting post-transcription mechanisms operating, lower immune exposure. Contrary evidence by proteomic study detected VARCS parasites non-plental and earlier study CSA-binding parasites nonregn hosts. The parasite genome contains 60 genes varying between isolates, VARCS conserved in most, if not all, isolates.
Researchers conducted a study on 34 children infected with deng virus (DENV) in Nicaragua to understand the differences in gene expression between severe and non-severe manifestations of the disease. They collected blood samples from patients on days 3-6 of illness and used genome-wide microarray analysis to identify genes differentially regulated between subgroups. The most striking differences were between deng patients with and without shock, particularly in mitochondrial proteins associated with protein synthesis. In deng hemorrhagic fever, a subset of genes encoded neutrophil-derived anti-microbial peptides associated with innate immunity. A meta-analysis with published datasets confirmed DENV infection is associated with changes in protein and nucleic acid metabolism. In vitro infection led to an interferon signature, not observed in patient samples by day 3-6, suggesting a transient interferon response. The study highlights differences between manifestations and commonalities of DENV infection. A large number of genes upregulated during illness were shared among all deng patients, representing a common response to infection. IRF and BL were strongly represented, supporting B cell stimulation and proliferation. A distinct profile was found between Nicaraguan deng patients with shock and DH, and between DF and DH. A meta-analysis with existing datasets identified common and differences. Comparing severe and non-severe cases, 32 genes were different, with 25 more expressed in severe and 7 in non-severe.
Researchers studied how the Herpesviruses, a type of virus that causes disease, enter the body. They focused on Murid Herpesvirus-4 (Mu-4), a virus related to the one that causes Kaposi's Sarcoma. Mu-4 targets the olfactory epithelium, a layer of cells in the nose responsible for smell. To enter, Mu-4 binds to a molecule called heparan sulfate (HS) on the cells. Without HS, the virus can't enter. The olfactory epithelium has HS on its surface, allowing Mu-4 to bind and enter. The virus goes down the cilia, tiny hair-like structures on the cells, and infects the neurons or nearby glial cells that support them. This suggests the olfactory epithelium is a key entry point for Herpesviruses.

 Mu-4 can infect neurons, even though it's not typically meant to. The olfactory epithelium may provide a way for Herpesviruses to enter the body. HS is thought to be a first step for Herpesvir to bind to cells, but it's also important for Mu-4 entry. This means targeting HS in the olfactory epithelium could be a way to stop Herpesvir infection. Other factors, besides HS, may limit Mu-4 entry to the olfactory epithelium. A study used Mu-4 to see how HS, virus binding, and infection relate in the body. They found the olfactory epithelium is targeted by Mu- due to its unique features. In lab, Mu- depends on HS to enter cells, and without HS, it can't. The study shows the olfactory epithelium is a specific entry point for Mu- and not just a result of being inhaled. The epithelium has neurons, sustacular cells, and precursor cells, each with different roles.
Researchers have identified a new regulatory mechanism by which controls the expression of genes required for Salmonella to invade epithelial cells. This mechanism involves the protein CRP, a widely known metabolic regulator, which silences the expression of SPI-1 genes under non-permissive conditions. In the absence of CRP, Salmonella expresses high levels of SPI-1 genes during mid-log growth phase. Genetic analysis revealed that CRP modulates the level of Hil, the master regulator of Salmonella invasion, at the post-transcriptional level. A newly identified motif within the 3' untranslated region of Hil is required for this regulation. Additionally, the sRNA Spot42 is under transcriptionally repressed by CRP and when repression is relieved, Spot42 positively affects Hil expression. In vivo and in vitro assays show Spot42 targets the 3'UTR of Hil transcript through its unstructured region. These findings highlight the 3'UT of Hil as a hub for postcriptional control of Salmonella invasion gene expression.
Researchers investigated the relationship between CAG repeat instability, chromatin structure, and transcription in the context of Huntington's disease (HD) using R6 and R2 transgenic mouse lines. These mice express a similar transgene, integrated at different sites, and recapitulate tissue-specific HD instability. The study found that instability rates are higher in R2 tissues compared to R1 samples. High transgene expression and chromatin accessibility correlated with increased CAG instability in R2 mice. Transgene mRNA and H3K trimylation at the HD locus were increased, while H3 dimylation reduced in R2 tissues relative R1. However, levels of transgene and histone marks were similar in striatum and cerebellum, two tissues showing different C instability. The study suggests that transcription modulates somatic CAG in vivo. Specifically, results indicate that elongation is tissue-dependent, contributing to tissue-selective C instability. The transgene is integrated in a more euchromatin and transcriptionally active region in R2 mice than R1, supporting active chrom structure in increased instability. C instability was higher in R2, irrespective of repeat size, than R1, suggesting chrom context and expression rather than initial size underlies instability. Despite similar HD expression in striatum and cerebellum, these tissues present different instability levels. Histone modifications associated with heterochrom, euchrom, and initiation were comparable in striatum and cerebell. Accessibility to DNA repair factors when chrom is open was tested, and found not to correlate with instability.
Researchers studied the genetic features of Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a highly virulent virus, to understand how it spreads in humans. They analyzed the virus in immunocompromised patients with disseminated disease at different infection sites, comparing respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous, and blood specimens. Three nucleotide changes occurred within five days: a non-conservative amino acid change in VP1 within the BC loop (97), a region considered immunogenic and important in poliovirus adaptation, a conservative amino substitution in protein 2 (38), and a silent mutation in protein 3 (175). Infectious clones were constructed with Br (A) and clinical (C) lineages containing one or both non-syn mutations. In vitro tropism and competition assays showed VP1 Leu to Arg substitution within BC conferred replicative advantage in SH-SY5 neuroblastoma cells. This mutation was associated with second non-cons mutation (167 or 167) in VP EF loop in neuroblast cells. Models of EV71 VP variants were built to determine substitutions' effects on structure and host interactions. No significant changes were observed, but substitutions may alter interactions with cell receptors. Results show VP1 BC loop of EV plays critical role in tropism, independent of lineage, contributing to dissemination and neurotropism in immunocompromised patients.
Researchers studied how certain bacteria called Streptoccus recognize and respond to signals that help them take in new genetic material from their environment. This process, called competence, is crucial for their evolution and allows them to gain traits like antibiotic resistance or virulence. In Streptoccus, these signals are controlled by a system called quorum sensing (QS) mediated by peptides called pherones. One such system, ComRS, involves a peptide Com that is processed, secreted, and imported into the cell where it activates a protein ComR. Com then triggers a feedback loop to express Com and an alternative factor SigX. ComRS are found in most Streptoccus species, but Com and Com diverge significantly, suggesting species-specific communication. To study cross-talk between Streptoc species and Com interaction, researchers developed a test to measure Com response to cognate and heterologous peptides in vivo, revealing strict, intermediate, and promiscuous specificity among species. They also solved the structure of Com from S suis to understand interaction and search for features that explain recognition. Using this, they probed the conformation of the binding site by mutagenesis and biochemically in vitro. Results show a model for recognition and specificity, and predict novel peptides that induce Com activity.
Researchers studied the replication of centrom DNA in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, a model organism with epigenetically inherited centromes. They found that each centere is associated with a replication origin that fires first on its respective chromosome, and epigen formation of new centeres (neocromes) is accompanied by shifts in replication timing, making neocere the first to replicate and associated with origin complex (ORC) components. Changing the level of centere-specific histone H isoform led to a concomitant change in OR association with centere regions, supporting the idea that centere proteins determine origin activity. Analysis of centere-associated DNA revealed a replication pattern characteristic of constitutively active origins. This pattern is conserved with centere position among strains and species, independently of DNA sequence. The study suggests that inheritance of centere position is correlated with constitutively active replication that fires at distinct time.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors contributing to chronic back pain in adults of European ancestry. They analyzed data from 158,025 individuals, including 29,531 with chronic back pain cases, from 15 cohorts in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and UK Biobank. Chronic pain was defined as back pain lasting 3-6 months or more. The study found a genome-wide significant association with a variant in the SOX5 gene, which was replicated in 283,752 UKob participants and exceeded genome-wide significance in joint analysis. Two other loci, CC26/GMC and DCC, reached genome-wide significance in joint analysis. This is the first genome-wide association study for chronic pain and identifies a genetic link to SO5.
Taenia solium cysticosis is a neglected zoonotic disease that affects humans and pigs in many developing countries, particularly in West Cameroon. The disease is underreported due to its various symptoms, with epilepsy being the most recognized, and lack of diagnostic tools in endemic areas. A study was conducted to estimate the burden of the disease in Cameroon using cost and Disability Adjusted Life (DAL) Year estimations. Parameters were collected and imported into software, with different distributions used for each type of information. Based on a prevalence of 3.6%, the number of people with neurocystercosis-associated epilepsy was estimated at 50,326 (95% CI 37,299-65,924), representing 1.0% of the population, and pigs with cysticosis at 15,961 (95% CI 12,320-20,044), 5.6% of the pig population. Total costs due to T. solium cystosis in Cameroon were estimated at €10,255,202 (95% CI 6,889-14,754), with 4.7% losses in pig husbandry and 95.3 direct and indirect due to human cystosis. The burden per case was €194 (95 CI147-253). Average DALs lost were 9.0 per thousand per year (95 CI 2.8-20.4). The study provides country-specific estimations of human and animal burden of the zoon disease. A comparison with South Africa indicates salaries play a role in monetary burden. Knowing salary and prevalence allows rapid indication of total cost.
Researchers have identified a non-coding RNA called Rsa in Staphylococcus aureus that plays a crucial role in reducing the bacteria's virulence. Rsa is present in all Staphlococcus species and its deletion increases the bacteria's invasiveness in mice and resistance to opsonic killing. However, it promotes biofilm formation and colonization in mice, leading to chronic infections. The study found that Rsa represses the translation of mgrA, a global regulator, by forming a duplex with the Shine-Dalg sequence and loop interaction within the mRNA. This repression leads to increased biofilm formation and decreased capsule synthesis, making the bacteria less susceptible to opic killing by polymonuclear leukocytes. In animal models, Rsa reduced the severity of acute infections and enhanced chronic catheter infections. Rsa is part of a regulatory network contributing to the bacteria's interactions with the host, moderating invasiveness and chronic infections. This is the first example of a conserved RNA in S aureus functioning as a virulence suppressor of acute infections. The researchers propose that R has been positively selected through evolution to support commensal and saprophytic interactions with the host.
Researchers have developed a new method to visualize the process of HIV-1 uncoating, a crucial step in establishing a long-term infection, using a fluorescently tagged version of a protein called cyclophilin A (Cyp-DRed) that binds to the HIV-1 capsid. They found that Cyp-D remains associated with the core after the viral membrane is removed and is lost concurrently with the capsid in vitro and in living cells. The rate of loss is influenced by core stability and accelerated upon initiation of reverse transcription. The majority of cores lose Cyp-D shortly after fusion, while a small fraction remains intact for several hours. Single particle tracking at late post-infection reveals gradual loss of C-D dependent on reverse transcription. Unating occurs in the cytoplasm and at the nuclear membrane. This novel assay enables time-resolved visualization of single HIV-1 unating in living cells, revealing previously unapprecited spatio-temporal features of this incompletely understood process.
Researchers investigated the use of oligonucleotides in archaeal and bacterial genomes to understand their properties, such as codon usage, DNA stacking, and structural conformation. They analyzed oligonucleotide frequencies in coding and non-coding regions and found that prokotic chromosomes can be described by hexanucle frequencies, indicating prootic DNA is short-range correlated, with information encoded in oligonotides. Oligonucle usage varied in AT-rich and host-associated genomes more than GC and free-living genomes, mainly in nonoding regions. Bias in tetranucle usage correlated with GC content, coding regions more biased than nonoding. Nonoding regions were 5.5% more AT-rich than coding, on average, in 402 examined chromosomes. Pronounced compositional differences were found within and between AT and GC genomes. GC genomes were similar in tetranucle usage nonoding than AT genomes. Differences between AT and GC may be attributed lifestyle, tetran usage host-associated was more dissimilar and biased than freeiving.
Researchers have investigated the process of meiotic recombination, which ensures the correct segregation of homologous chromosomes during gamete formation and contributes to DNA diversity through large-scale crossovers and local gene events. They analyzed both types of recombinant molecules in sperm at six active hotspots and found a novel form of biased transmission exclusive to non-crossover recombinants, arising from differences in crossover and non-crossover heterodup formation and mismatch repair. This form of biased conversion does not influence hotspot activity, but constitutes a previously undetected source of recombination-driven meiotic drive, potentially affecting thousands of hotspots throughout the genome. At two hotspots, this drive favors G/C over A base pairs, consistent with established correlations between GC content and recombination in mammalian genomes. Heterozygosity at a single SNP can influence hotspot activity in cis, and biased conversions have been observed in some assays, arising from initiation on one chromosome and correction from the other. This form of meiotic drive is strong enough to promote allele fixation, and may contribute to the correlation between GC content and recombination and evolution of genomic composition.
Researchers have developed a computational model to understand how environmental chemicals and drugs affect human health by integrating toxicology and biology data. This model, called a protein-protein network, reveals new connections between chemicals and diseases, predicting which compounds may harm human health. The network can also identify unexpected associations between chemicals and proteins. Examples include chemicals linked to breast cancer, lung cancer, and necrosis, and potential targets for diethylhexylphthalate, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloribenzo-dioxin, pirix acid, and permethrin. These associations are supported by recent studies, showing the power of combining toxicogen data with other types of data.

To develop this model, researchers used the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, which contains information on chemicals and proteins associated with diseases. They selected 42,194 associations between 2,490 compounds and 6,060 proteins known to be involved in human diseases. To predict which chemicals affect health, they analyzed clusters to identify chemical-disease associations. When linking chemicals to diseases, it's essential to note there's no direction in the association, meaning it's not possible to separate positive from negative between a chemical and disease.

Analysis of environmental chemicals with gene expression is lacking. With advances in toxicogenomics, information on protein activity in response to small exposures becomes available.
Researchers have developed a new way to study how the brain processes sound by creating a mathematical model of how neurons respond to different sounds. This model, called a network receptive field, shows that neurons in the auditory cortex are more sensitive to a wider range of sounds than previously thought. They found that neurons respond to multiple features of a sound, such as pitch and timing, in a complex way that can't be explained by simple models. The new model reveals that neurons have separate parts that excite and inhibit each other, and that interact in a way that allows them to detect specific patterns in sounds. This is important for recognizing complex sounds and may be a key part of how we understand speech and music. The model also shows that neurons respond to sounds in a larger time and frequency range than previous models suggested. By using this model, researchers can better predict how neurons respond to sounds and understand how the brain processes sound in a more complex way.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for casein kinase 2 (CK)-mediated phosphorylation of the BMAL1 protein in regulating the mammalian circadian clock. Using a novel peptide, they found that CK2 phosphorylates BM1 at serine 90 (BM1-S90) in central and peripheral clocks. Further analysis revealed a novel function of the RY protein as a repressor of CK2 kinase activity towards BM1. Co-immunoprecipitation and real-time monitoring of protein interactions showed that RY-mediated binding of CK2 to BM1 inhibits BM1-S90 phosphorylation by CKα. The FAD domain of R1, C-terminal BM1 domains, and BM1 lysine 537 acetylation/deacetylation by CLOCK/SIRT are critical for RY-mediated BM1-CK2 binding. Conversely, BM1-S90 phosphorylation is necessary for BM1 lysine 537 acetylation. A model proposes a negative feedback loop where RY-dependent CK-driven post-translational BM1-BM1 is integral to the core oscillator. BM1-BM forms an interlocked loop in the machinery and has roles in the circadian through R-mediated negative suppression. R proteins have a dual function, repressing BM1-CLOCK transcription and repressing CK2 activity towards BM90. In RY-deficient mice, BM1 is hyperphosphorylated, suggesting R involvement in rhythmic BM modification. This study investigated the oscillatory mechanism of CK-mediated BM1 phosphorylation and found a role of R as a repressor of phosphorylation. CK2 is thought to be constitutively active, but this study shows a role in BM1 phosphorylation and R as a regulator of CK-mediated BM1 phosphorylation. A model illustrates the mechanism of CK-mediated postlational loop and its role in the intracellular core oscillator.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Salmonella enterica adapts to survive in the presence of bile, a substance produced by the liver that is toxic to bacteria. Bile disrupts bacterial membranes, denatures proteins, and damages DNA. The study found that Salmonella can adapt to low concentrations of bile by changing gene expression, including upregulating the Rpo-dependent stress response and other stress responses. The Rpo stress response is crucial for adaptation, as Rpo mutants are sensitive to bile. Adaptation is not just a population response, but individual cells can become resistant without adaptation. When a non-adapted Salmonella culture is plated on lethal bile, resistant colonies appear at a frequency of 10^-6 to 10^-7 per cell generation. Fluctuation analysis shows these colonies come from pre-existing resistant cells. Some isolates are stable, indicating resistance can be acquired by mutation. Genome sequencing of resistant mutants shows lipopolysaccharide transport alteration is a common cause of resistance. However, selection on lethal bile also provides non-mutational isolates, suggesting cells can survive due to physiological state. Single cell analysis shows cells activate stress response in absence of bile, indicating phenotypic heterogeneity in bacterial populations.
Researchers have found that the bacteriophage Mu, a virus that infects E. coli, is organized as a stable domain within the E. coli chromosome. This domain is formed by the proximity of the Mu's ends, which are 37 base pairs apart on the genome. The formation and maintenance of this domain is dependent on a strong gyrase site at the center of Mu, Mu proteins, and E. coli nucleoid proteins IHF, F, and H. This domain was observed at two different locations on the chromosome. In contrast, phage lambda does not form an independent domain. Low-level transcription from phage promoters, one of which is domain-dependent, promotes the establishment and maintenance of the Mu domain. The researchers propose that this domain makes Mu transposition easier by creating topological requirements and proximity of the ends. The benefits to the host from a subset of proteins expressed by the phage may help its long-term stability.
Primaquine (PQ) is the only licensed drug that prevents Plasium vivax (Pv) relapses and clears mature gametocytes of Plasium falciparum (Pf). A study in Papua New Guine children investigated the effect of Q on Pv and Pf gamocyte carriage after treatment. Children received radical cure with chloroquine, artemether-lumeftrine plus Q or placebo. Blood samples were collected 2-4 weekly over 8 months. Gamocytes were detected by reverse transcription PCR targeting p25 and p25. Q reduced Pv gamocyte incidence by 73%, comparable to its effect on blood-stage infections. 92% of Pv and 79% Pf gamocyte infections were asymptomatic. Pv gamocyte positivity and density were associated with high-stage parasite densities. Multivariate analysis showed reduced odds of gamocytes in mixed-species compared to single-species infections for both Pv and Pf. No difference between Q and placebo arms was observed in Pv gamocyte density or proportion of Pv infections carrying gamocytes. Relapses likely caused by hypnoite were equally likely to carry gamocytes as new infections caused by infective bite. Relapses contributed to Pv reservoir, highlighting importance of anti-hypite treatment for control.
Researchers have studied the role of Rho GTPases in cellular processes such as cell migration, cytokinesis, and endocytosis, which involve actin remodeling. Although Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 have different effects on actin, they share a common mechanism of targeting the plasma membrane and activation by GTP binding. The researchers developed a framework to analyze data on GTP cycling between the membrane and cytosol to understand the differential regulation of these switches. Analysis revealed details of GDI cycling and distinguished between G-dependent and -independent mechanisms, including vesicle trafficking and association/dissociation of Gase with membrane molecules. Data on Rac cycling showed lower affinity of G for RacG compared to RacD can be explained by faster dissociation from the membrane. Non-steady-state solutions for membrane Gase fraction are presented in multidimensional charts. This methodology was applied to glucose-stimulated cycling in pancreatic β-cells, illustrating effects of Gs/Gs and affinities between Gases and membrane/GDI on bound Gase. Similar charts can be used to assess targeted modifications for altered Gase-G balance in disease scenarios. The study demonstrates R-G cycling can access diverse pathways through different manipulations in cellular systems.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programs for schistosomiasis collect data to assess the impact of interventions and progress towards World Health Organization (WHO) goals of morbidity control and elimination as a public health problem. Typically, prevalence and intensity data are collected from school-aged children (SAC) as they are relatively easy to sample and likely to be infected with schosome parasites. However, adults are also likely to be infected. This study investigates how the age distribution of infection impacts mathematical model recommendations for preventive chemotherapy levels to achieve WHO goals. For moderate prevalence regions, treating only SAC may achieve goals, but for high prevalence with high infection in adults, adult treatment is required to meet goals. The optimal strategy for a region requires consideration of burden in adults, not solely based on SAC prevalence. Past epidemiological data informed models for transmission control, but more accurate data are needed to determine treatment for a region. Collecting prevalence and intensity from a broader age range, including adults at baseline and throughout treatment, is important to determine strategy. Additional data, such as individual adherence to treatment, should be collected in M&E. Including adults in treatment efforts, a large schos infection burden remains untreated, creating a reservoir. Adults in high-risk and women of childbearing age should be treated. Mathematical models recommend adaptations, such as increased treatment levels or frequency. Burden in adults varies geographically, impacted by local and cultural factors, access to water, sanitation, and hygiene. Infection profiles and burden in adults vary for schosome in countries and communities. This study explores how age profiles with low to high burdens in adults impact model recommendations for treatment levels to achieve WHO. Collecting age-specific data, including adults in M&E is important. SAC are likely infected due to age-related contact and absence of immunity, treatment focused on this age to prevent morbidity.
Researchers have developed a computational model to predict the effectiveness of surgery for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a neurological disorder causing seizures. The model uses brain connectivity data from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 22 patients with TLE and 39 healthy individuals to simulate seizure onset and spread. The study found that patients with TLE tend to transition from non-epileptic to epileptic states more often than controls in the model. Regions in the left hemisphere, particularly temporal and subcortical areas, are frequent starting points for seizures in patients. Contralateral and frontal regions may play a role in seizure spreading or resistance. The model predicts that patient-specific surgery, chosen based on individual models, may lead to better outcomes than standard procedures. This work provides a step towards personalized modeling epilepsy surgery to inform treatment strategies. 

The brain was modeled as a network with regions abstracted to nodes and connections mapped through DTI. Seizure initiation and spreading were modeled using connectivity specific to patients. This is based on previous studies simulating epilepsy with human connectome data using atlases. Weighting of edges was another factor to consider. The model was validated by examining initial nodes in the brain. In TLE, seizure origin in the left temporal lobe was expected to match clinical observations. The top escaping nodes were found in patient and control populations, with five locations in both.
Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) uses various strategies to evade the host's antiviral defenses, including interference with interferon and apoptotic signaling. The virus encodes four interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) that function in a dominant-negative manner to block cellular IR activities and target IR-induced proteins such as p53 and TGF-β-activated Smad transcription factors. This study identifies a novel mechanism by which HHV-8 interferes with apoptosis by targeting the BH-only pro-apoptic Bcl-2 family member Bim, a key regulator of HH-8 replication. The viral factor vIR-1 directly inactivates Bim via nuclear translocation, as shown by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis of transfected cells and lytically infected endothelial cells. Co-precipitation assays revealed a direct interaction between vIR-1 and Bim, with B-binding residues ofIR-1 mapped by deletion and mutagenesis. Generation of B-refactory vIR-1 variants confirmed the importance ofIR-1:B interaction in prolication and anti-apopt activity ofIR-1. Blocking the interaction with a cell-perme peptide corresponding to B-binding ofIR-1 confirmed the relevanceIR-1:B association toIR-1 prolication. This is the first report of an IR protein interacting with a B-2 family member and sequestering B or any member as a means of inactivation. The data reveal a novel mechanism used by virus to control replication-induced apoptosis and suggest inhibiting IR-1:B interaction may provide an antiral strategy.
Epithelial Integrin Regulates the Amplitude of Protective Lung Interfer Responses against Respiratory Pathogens

Researchers have found that a protein called epithelial integrin, specifically αβ6, plays a crucial role in maintaining the lung's immune system's readiness to respond to invaders. When the lung is injured, α6 is upregulated, and helps to moderate acute lung injury (ALI). However, the mechanisms behind this process were unclear. Studies showed that upregulation of α6 during influenza infection is involved in disease pathogenesis. Mice lacking α6 (β KO) had increased survival during infection due to limited viral spread into alveolar spaces, leading to reduced ALI. Although β KO mice had normal lungs, they had constitutively activated CD11+ alolar macrophages (AM) and elevated type IFN signaling, which was traced to loss of α-activated growth factor (TGFβ). Administration of exogenous Tβ to β KO mice reduced CD11+ AM, type IF activity, and protective phenotype during infection. Protection extended to other respiratory pathogens like Sendai virus and bacterial pneumonia.

Mice lacking α6 were protected from disease caused by infection. Compared to controls, β KO developed less AL, characterized by edema, inflammatory cytokine expression, and vascular permeability. β KO mice had baseline homeostasis with high CD11+ CDc macrophages opposed to CD11- alolar macrophages. T-β'rescue' experiments and β KO mice type IFN showed resistance depended on loss Tβ and elevated IF signaling, while phenotypic changes macroph were independent IF at least level IF shown β/IFAR KO. Macrophages from Tβ-treated KO displayed decreased IF transcripts Irf, If1, and O1 comparable to WT. Loss α activated T-β resulted in altered macro and increased IF activation. The role α in modulating AL hypothesized upreg during infections like influenza important for pathogenesis. Tested β KO with 200 pandemic H1 virus, β-def mice were protected from virus disease and broad pathogens, independent effects overall numbers. KO treated Tβ had CD11+CDb macroages, reversing phenotype, and no longer protected infection. Loss α-mediated T-activation important for protection and macro. KO had altered environment decreased viral spread.
A retrospective analysis of 733 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis at a reference center in Argentina from 2006-2015 evaluated the usefulness of the Leishman Skin Test (ST) as a diagnostic tool for the disease. Leishmania Viannia brazili, the most common cause of cutaneous and mucosal leishiasis in the Americas, has a low parasite burden in lesions, making diagnosis difficult through direct parasite identification. The ST is a delayed hypersensitivity test to Leish antigens injected intradermally, used in endemic areas as a complement to diagnosis. The study found that 65% of cases were confirmed through positive smears from skin or mucosal lesions, with only 6 having negative ST. Among negative smear cases, 190 were also negative by ST, but 69 were positive. ST results were similar across age groups, with lesions older than 21 days correlating with positive results for both smear and ST. This supports the use of ST as a diagnostic for cutaneous leishias across all age groups in endemic areas. The correlation with smear was high, suggesting standardization of the technique and further research into protocols will aid management of suspicious cases.
Researchers have identified a genetic mechanism that contributes to the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) by studying how the body's immune cells, called macrophages, respond to high levels of bad cholesterol in the blood. When macrophages are exposed to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LD), they transform into foam cells that contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. The researchers used a combination of techniques to map the changes in chromatin and gene expression in macrophages before and after exposure to LD. They found that LD-induced changes in chromatin were associated with changes in expression of nearby genes involved in foam cell formation and atherosclerosis. The transcription factor CEB-beta, previously not known to play a role in foam cell formation, was upregulated and bound to genes involved in inflammatory pathways. Variants at CAD-associated loci were enriched in the subset of chromatin altered by LD exposure, including one at the PP2 locus. The protective allele of this variant increased CEB-beta binding and enhancer activity. The protein product of PP2, L3, was present in foam cells in atherosclerotic plaques and upregulated by LD in macrophages, leading to increased degradation of pro-inflammatory mediators. This study provides a mechanism contributing to CAD risk at the PP2 locus and highlights the importance of studying epigenetic changes in disease processes involving pathogenic stimuli.
Researchers in Malawi conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of a single round of azithromycin mass treatment in districts with a trachoma prevalence of 5.0-9% in 1-9 year olds. The World Health Organization recommends three rounds of treatment in such districts, but this may not be practical due to resource constraints. The Malawi Ministry of Health administered one round of azithycin to 8 districts with baseline prevalence 5.0-9%, achieving 80% coverage. Surveys were conducted 6 months later in 18 evaluation units of these districts, using standardized methods. All 18 units had trach prevalence <5%. The study shows one round of azycin with 80% coverage can reduce trach prevalence to <5% in Malawi districts with 5.0-9%. This approach may be a cost-effective alternative to re-surveying districts. Malawi aims to eliminate trach by 2020. Eight districts had baseline 5.0-9% prevalence from 2013 surveys. If low prevalence is sustained, one round of well-conducted MDA may eliminate trach. However, without a control group, it's uncertain if reductions were due to MDA or other factors. This study suggests Malawi may eliminate trach as a public health problem by 202.
Researchers have identified six calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPs) in Arabidopsis that play a crucial role in the immune response to pathogens. These CPs are activated by NLR proteins, which recognize pathogen effectors and trigger immune responses such as cell death, reactive oxygen species production, and transcriptional reprogramming. The study found that CP1/2 activation by pathogen effectors controls the onset of cell death, while sustained CP4/5/6/11 activation phosphorylates WRKY transcription factors to regulate transcriptional reprogramming for N-dependent pathogen restriction. Additionally, CP1/2/4/11 phosphorylate NAD oxidases for ROS production. The study shows that Ca2 signaling via CPs is essential for diverse signaling and pathogen resistance mediated by intracellular NLR sensors. A subgroup of WR transcription factors act with CPs in NLR signaling, with sustained CP4/5/6/11 phosphorylating WR8/48 for transcriptional reprogramming and CP1/2/4/11 phosphorylating NAD oxidases for production. NLR proteins do not directly interact with pathogen effectors, but monitor host protein perturbation to mount responses. For example, Avr2 degrades Arabidopsis IN to activate R2, while Avr1 and AvB induce IN phosphorylation via host kinases to initiate RPM signaling.
Researchers conducted a study to forecast the incidence of Schistosoma haematium in the district of Nion, Mali, a region in sub-Saharan Africa, where the disease is prevalent. They used a statistical method called state-space forecasting, which takes into account seasonal and annual fluctuations in the data. The study analyzed data from 1996 to 2004 and found that the forecasts were accurate, with an average error of 25% for 1-5 month predictions. This method captured non-linear interactions between the disease and external factors such as climate and public health interventions, making it a useful tool for managing and assessing Schistoma transmission and intervention. The study suggests that this framework can be applied to other areas in the Sahel region, where Schoma is a significant public health concern.
Researchers studied how the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) interacts with host cells to infect them. They found that the virus uses a protein called pp150 to prevent its genes from being expressed in cells that are in the S2 phase of the cell cycle. This is because pp binds to a protein called cyclin A, which is only present in S2 cells. The researchers created a mutant virus that can't bind to cyclin A and found that it replicates well in S2 cells, but not in mitotic cells. They also found that another viral protein, p21, destabilizes cyclin to keep the cells in S2. A double mutant that can't bind cyclin with both pp and p21 had a severe impact on virus growth and cell viability. The study suggests that pp and p21 work together to keep cells in S2 to allow the virus to replicate.
Researchers investigated the genetic causes of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease that leads to motor neuron degeneration and paralysis. They used targeted sequencing of 169 known ALS genes in 242 sporadic cases and 129 controls to identify novel variants linked to the disease. Results showed a significant enrichment of novel and rare variants in cases, indicating potential disease-causing mutations. This study highlights the use of next-generation sequencing and functional analysis to understand sporadic disease etiology. 

A candidate gene approach was used to discover new mutations in relevant ALS genes in sporadic cases. Bioinformatics tools assessed variant pathogenicity and combined with rare variant analysis showed cases had a higher burden of deleterious mutations than controls. This suggests novel or rare mutations in key genes may contribute to sporadic ALS. Next-generation sequencing has revolutionized disease study, but distinguishing disease-causing from benign variants is a challenge. New approaches are needed to make sequencing results clinically informative. Familial ALS is more homogeneous than sporadic, with 20 known genes explaining 60% of cases. 

Of 242 sequenced patients, 144 had rare or novel variants, suggesting at least 40% of cases have no identifiable genetic cause. New variants were found in ALS and associated genes, but no association with previously identified SNPs in the population, except APO. New genes were identified through trio and RRM studies.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the development of immune cell memory to the influenza virus. They found that IL-6 is crucial for the formation of CD4+ T cell memory, but not CD8 T cell memory. IL-6 limits the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are a type of immune cell that can suppress the activity of other immune cells. Without IL-6, Tregs are more active and suppress the activity of virus-specific CD4 T cells, leading to a weaker immune response against the virus. The study used mice with and without IL-6 and found that those without IL- had a weaker CD4 memory response, but not CD8 response. This suggests that CD4 and CD8 cells differ in their susceptibility to suppression by Tregs. The researchers also found that IL-6 does not affect the survival of CD4 cells, as there was no difference in cell death between mice with and without IL- after infection.
Researchers have identified a new function of the enzyme enolase in the parasite Entamoeba histolytica, a glycolytic enzyme that converts 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenpyruate. They found that enase binds to and inhibits the activity of Dmt2, a protein that methylates DNA and RNA. This interaction was unexpected as glycolytic enzymes were thought to be cytoplasmatic. Enase was shown to have both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in the parasite. Glucose starvation drives enase to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with Dn2 and reduces RNA methylation. The role of enase as D2 inhibitor was confirmed in E histolytica with a nuclear localization signal. This study establishes enase as the first Dmt interacting protein and reveals a new role for glycol enzyme in modulating D2 activity. Enase was also found to inhibit D2 in Drosophila and human cells, suggesting the interaction is conserved.
Researchers have identified microRNAs (miRNAs) in the saliva of mosquitoes for the first time. miRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are generally found inside cells. However, circulating miRN have been found in human serum and saliva, but not in the saliva of blood-feeding insects like mosquitoes. The study aimed to find miRN in mosquito saliva and their role in Chikunya virus (CHV) infection. Next-generation sequencing identified 103 miRN in mosquito saliva, 31 of which were new and named. Some miRN were only present in CHV-infected mosquitoes. Five mi were tested for their effect on CHV infection and showed they play a role in transmission and establishment during feeding on the host. Inhibiting these mi decreased viral replication, suggesting they enhance CHV in the host and at the site of infection. This is the first report of exogenous miRN in mosquito saliva.
Researchers studied the role of three proteins, Rad51, Rad52, and Rad59, in repairing damaged mitochondrial DNA in yeast cells. Mitochondria have their own DNA, separate from the cell's main DNA, which encodes proteins for energy production. Deletions in this DNA can cause inherited diseases and cancers. Most deletions are flanked by repetitive sequences, suggesting they result from recombination events. The study found that Rad51 and Rad59 are in the mitochondria's matrix and Rad51 binds directly to DNA. They used an enzyme to create a double-strand break in the mitochondrial DNA, allowing analysis of repair in yeast. Loss of these proteins decreased spontaneous deletions and Rad51 and Rad59 impaired repair of induced breaks. This is the first study to show Rad51,52, and59 impact mitochondrial DNA repair. The researchers improved a system to introduce a single break per genome to identify repair proteins. Mitochondrial base excision repair has been studied, showing conserved pathways exist. Homologous recombination repair in mitochondria has been reported in yeast, fruit flies, and mice. This study showed Rad51 and59 localize to the mitochondria. Identifying factors interacting with Rad51,52,59 will help elucidate mitochondrial repair pathways. Despite importance to energy and cell maintenance, mitochondrial repair mechanisms are poorly understood, particularly double-strand break repair.
Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a significant global health issue, particularly among disadvantaged populations, resulting from acute rheumatic fever (AR), a complication of Group A Streptococcal (GAS) infection. The role of social and environmental factors in GAS infection and progression to AR/RHD is not well understood. This systematic review aimed to determine the association between social determinants of health and GAS, AR, and RHD, and the effect of interventions targeting these. A literature search of PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases identified 1,164 publications, 90 of which met criteria, comprising 91 studies. 49% were of poor quality in relation to the question. The proportion of studies reporting associations between socioeconomic determinants and risk of GAS was 57.1%, and AR/RHD was 50%. Crowding was the most assessed factor (14 studies GAS, 36 AR/RHD) followed by socioeconomic status (6, 36). Most studies assessing crowding, characteristics, education, employment, and nutrition reported a positive association with risk of GAS, AR/RHD. Crow and socioeconomic status met criteria for causation. The literature lacks quality, mostly observational, not interventional. Crow as a cause of GAS and ARHD presents a target for prevention.
Researchers studied the Pho/PhP bacterial signaling network, a two-component system found in many bacteria. They found that a single mutation in the sensor kinase PhQ, which abolishes its phosphatase activity, results in a striking change in phenotype. The mutant responds to stimulus in a bistable manner, unlike the wild-type, which has a graded response. Mutant cells have different morphologies in on and off states, and this state is inherited over generations. External conditions that repress signaling in the wild-type drive the mutant to the on state. Mathematical modeling suggests bistability depends on autoregulation of key proteins PhP and PhQ in the circuit. The mutant's characteristics come at a fitness cost, with the on state having lower fitness in stationary cultures in rich medium. However, due to inheritance of the on state, a population of cells can be epigenetically trapped in a low-fitness. The study demonstrates the versatility of the prototypical two-component architecture and highlights tradeoffs in the Pho/PhP system.
Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a devastating infection caused by the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri, with a high mortality rate and lack of established treatment. Due to the lack of economic incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop anti-AM drugs, research relies on drug repurposing, applying known drugs for rare diseases. N. fleri has an essential requirement for ergoster, a building block of plasma membranes, similar to fungi. Disruption of sterol biosynthesis by small-molecule inhibitors is a validated strategy against fungal pathogens. N. fleri encodes ster 14-demethylase CYP51, sharing 35% sequence identity with fungal orthologs, raising the possibility of repurposing antifungal drugs. This study assessed the impact of antifungal azoles, conazoles, on sterol biosynthesis and viability of N. fleri trophotes, identified endogenous C51 by mass spectrometry, and interactions between recombinant C51 and conoles. The data validated C51 as a druggable target in N. fleri and conazoles as candidates for P treatment. Fluconazole and micon have been used in combination with other drugs in human AM patients. De novo ster biosynthesis occurs in most eukaryotes, including human pathogens like fungi and freeiving amoae. The similarity raises the possibility of repur antifungal drugs and az-based P therapy for AM. Fluazole depletes ergol by blocking C14 of biosynthetic catalyzed by C51. Fluazole belongs to the conazole pedigree targeting C51. This class includes micon, keto, vor, and itra that exhibit amoic effect in vitro.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4α) in maintaining type 2 immune responses and protective immunity against nematode infections. Nematodes trigger a protective type 2 immune response via IL-4α, but its role in maintaining type 2 responses after polarization was unknown. The study used a mouse model where IL-4α gene deletion can be controlled temporally and found that sustained IL-4α expression is required for maintaining type 2 responses and immunity following Nippostrongus brasiliensis infection. Temporal deletion of IL-4α before secondary infection with N. brasiliensis showed that IL-α signaling drives efficient recall of type 2 responses and parasite clearance. This study demonstrates IL-α mediated signaling is necessary for maintaining anti-nemat type 2 responses, a novel function distinct from its role in polarization.
A global analysis of the distribution of Bartonella bacteria in mammals reveals that the pathogen likely originated as an environmental bacterium that infected insects before transitioning to mammals. Rodents and domestic animals serve as reservoirs or key hosts for most Bartonella genotypes in humans. The study found evidence of exchange between phylogenetically distant domestic and wildlife animals due to increased contact, highlighting the need to avoid contact between humans, animals, and wildlife to protect health. Bartonella is a rich system for examining human impacts on infectious disease spread within and between species, across landscapes, and the globe. Phylogenetic inferences about origin should be interpreted with caution due to limited data and unsampled taxa. The pathogen is ideal for tracing zoonotic potential and impacts on native hosts. The study constructed a large phylogeny of Barton from 16sRNA and glA genes to determine evolutionary history, host switching, and spillover into humans from commensals to wild species. Ecological factors, not immunological incompatibility, contribute to host specificity. Diverse zoon strains have similar clinical presentations, physicians should consider broad animal hosts and Barton genotypes when investigating suspected infections.
A noncoding RNA MALAT plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression by modulating the expression of oncogenic transcription factor BMYB. Research found that MALAT levels are elevated in cancer tissues and associated with hyperproliferation, but the underlying mechanism was unclear. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis in human diploid fibroblasts revealed MALAT regulates cell cycle genes and is required for G1 and mitotic progression. Depletion of MALAT leads to activation of p53 and its target genes. Cell defects in MALAT-depleted cells are sensitive to p53 levels, indicating p53 is a major mediator of MALAT activity. MALAT-depleted cells display reduced expression of BMY, an oncogenic factor in G/M progression due to altered splicing of BMY preRNA and aberrant splicing. In human cells, MALAT promotes proliferation by modulating expression and preRNA of cycle transcription factors. The study provides insights into MALAT's role in regulating proliferation. MALAT levels during cell cycle influence expression of cycle genes. MALAT depletion in human diploid fibroblasts induces DNA damage and activates p53 and target genes. Cell defects in MAL-depleted cells are sensitive to p levels, indicating p is effector of MAL function. Mitotic defects in MAL-de cells suggest MAL role in mitosis via expression/preRNA of mitosis genes or defect in p-deficient cells is result of DNA stalled forks. Mitosis is most canonical pathway downregulated in MAL-de fibblasts. Abnormal MAL expression in types or tissues leads to aberrant splicing and misexpression of cycle genes, contributing to tumor progression. MALAT may influence key cycle regulators, resulting in alteration of downstream cycle genes. Observed splicing changes for regulator BMY in MAL-de cells. Unlike MAL-de cells, p or p+MAL cells respond to serum by expressing cycle genes. Results indicate p vital for G arrest in MAL-de cells.
Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in regulating growth, metamorphosis, and reproduction in insects. While its role in repressing larval metamosis is well understood, the molecular basis of its promotion of adult reproduction is not fully elucidated. The J receptor, Methoprene (Met), has been shown to mediate J action during metamosis and vitelogenesis, but the precise mechanism of the latter is lacking. Researchers used RNA interference (RNAi) to mimic a J-deprived condition in migratory locusts and found that J stimulates DNA replication and increases ploidy in preparation for vitelogenesis. Two genes, Mc4 and Mc7, in the DNA replication pathway were expressed in the presence of J and Met. Depletion of Mc or Mc inhibited novo synthesis and ploidy, resulting in reduced vitelogenin mRNA and impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. Luciferase reporter and electrophoretic mobility assays showed Met directly regulates Mc and Mc by binding upstream sequences with E-box or E-like motifs. This suggests the J-receptor acts on Mc and Mc to regulate replication and ploidy for vitelogenesis and oocyte maturation.
Researchers conducted a study to determine the optimal duration of prednisone treatment for patients with recent nerve function impairment (NFI) due to leprosy. The study, called "Treatment Early Neurop in Lepros" (TENL), compared a 20-week and 32-week prednisone courses. 868 patients with recent NFI (less than 6 months) were randomly assigned to either a 20-week or 32-week prednisone treatment. Prednisone was started at 45-60mg/day, then tapered. NFI was assessed through muscle testing and monofilament testing. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with improved or restored function at 78 weeks. Secondary outcomes included Reaction Scale, SAL Scale, and Participation Scale. Results showed no significant difference between groups: 78.1% in 20-week and 77.5 in 32 (p=0.821). Secondary outcomes also showed no difference, except a higher adverse events in the longer arm. A 20-week predone was as effective as 32 in improving and restoring NFI in lepro patients, making it the preferred initial treatment duration.
Researchers studied the vocalizations of male Rocky Mountain elk and European red deer to understand how sound production relates to anatomy and physiology. They created a computer model of the larynx and vocal tract based on elk anatomy and biomechanics to simulate sound production. The model produced a range of fundamental frequencies, with low frequencies requiring low vocal fold strain but high lung pressure and glottal flow, while high frequencies needed large muscular effort and lung pressure. Glottal efficiency, the ratio of radiated sound to aerodynamic power, was higher in elk, suggesting an advantage in high-pitched signaling. This is due to lower airflow and acoustic radiation at higher frequencies. Both types are used by males during mating, serving as honest signals. The low-frequency call relates to body size, high-frequency to muscular strength and endurance. Contrary to expectation, some large mammals use high-pitched vocalization. The study simulated elk and red calls with a finite model of oscillating vocal folds within larynge cartilage, applying muscle activations and vocal tract propagation to understand the system. The lnx model was based on anatomy and biomechanics of elk and deer laryes. Elk vocalizations were near the top, red vocalizations near the bottom. Fold oscillation was sustained at minimum 65 Hz and maximum 140 Hz. High pressures were necessary for both, calls were uttered at high rates in both species. Efficiency of aerodynamic to acoustic energy in lary sound showed differences. High frequency production provided an advantage.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-through sequencing (ChIP-seq) data, a technique used to map transcription factor binding and chromatin modifications. Current methods discard reads that map to multiple locations on the genome, known as multi-reads, to focus on reads that map uniquely to one location, known as uni-reads. This can omit up to 30% of alignable reads. The new approach allocates multi-read as fractional counts using a weighted scheme, increasing sequencing depth by 22-25% and 17% in STAT and GATA ChIP samples. Incorporating multi-read identifies novel peaks not detectable by uni-read and improves peak detection in mappable regions. Analysis shows multi-read peaks have similar characteristics to uni-read, but mostly reside in segmental duplications. Validation by quantitative real-time ChIP confirms GATA multi-read peaks and identifies novel target genes. This demonstrates multi-read importance in studying factor binding in repetitive regions with IP experiments.
Researchers estimated the economic benefits of achieving the 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) targets for four neglected diseases: African trypanosomiasis, lepro, visceral leishias, and Chagas disease, which are controlled or eliminated by innovative and intensified management (IDM). The study found that meeting these targets would result in significant economic gains for individuals affected by these diseases, mainly due to reduced productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments (OPP). The researchers used a systematic review of existing data on OP and productivity loss related to these diseases, combined with projections of the number of people affected by each disease in countries and years 2011-2020 and 202-203. They compared an ideal scenario where the WHO targets are met with a counterfactual scenario where the situation stayed the same as in 1990. The economic benefit was the difference between the two scenarios, reported in 2005 US dollars, purchasing power-adjusted, discounted at 3% per annum from 201. Probabil sensitivity analyses were used to quantify uncertainty around the base estimate. The total productivity gained for the four IDM diseases was 23.1 (15.9-34.0) billion in 201-202 and 35.9 (25.0-51.9) in 202-203, corresponding to 10.7 (7.4-15.7) and 16.6 (11.6-24) reduction in OP for the same periods.
A long-held assumption in neuroscience is that highly selective neurons, which respond to a narrow range of sensory inputs, carry more information about external stimuli. In the auditory cortex, neurons initially respond broadly to a variety of sounds and then become highly selective in sustained responses. This has led to the interpretation that early responses encode sound presence and later responses encode content. Contrary to this, researchers found that the population conveys similar information across epochs despite selectivity differences. The amount of information encoded depends on the total number of spikes in the population, not selectivity. Inhomogeneous Poisson spiking behavior accounts for this property. These results suggest a novel encoding principle shared among sensory systems. 

In the auditory cortex, selectivity increases as spiking evolves after sound onset. Initially, neurons respond to many sounds with high spiking rates, then settle to lower values. Adaptation leads to fewer active neurons, a sparser representation, and higher selectivity. This adaptation is shared among sensory systems. Based on selectivity, the theory posits unselective responses encode presence and selective responses encode identity. However, interpreting informativeness based on selectivity has caveats. Observations in auditory cortex raise questions about dynamic encoding in sensory systems.
Researchers have investigated the role of the OX40 co-stimulatory molecule in controlling persistent viral infections. Unlike acute infections, where the immune system clears the pathogen, chronic infections require sustained T cell responses to control replication and prevent spread. While inhibitory signals like PD-1 are known to limit T cell activity, little is understood about stimulatory signals that maintain anti-viral T cells. The study found that O40 is crucial in controlling LCMV13 infection, a persistent virus. Anti-v T cells express high levels of O40 in the presence of antigen, and cells lacking O40 fail to accumulate. This leads to impaired germinal center responses and antibody production, resulting in O40-deficient mice failing to control LCM13 over time. O40 signaling promotes long-term T survival, suggesting its importance in persistence. In contrast to acute LCM, O40 shapes both CD4 and CD8 T responses during persistent LCM13, including antibody-dependent responses. O40-deficiency impacts anti-viral response, highlighting its role in chronic infections. O40 drives T responses to several viruses, but is dispensable in acute LCM. However, its importance in chronic infections was unclear. PD-1 expression correlated with O40, suggesting sustained O40 during L13 is due to ongoing antigen recognition. O40 expression was stronger on CD4 cells, but some anti-v CD8 cells also displayed O40. The study establishes O40 as key in sustaining cellular and humoral immunity during persistence, with implications for T dysfunction in human viral infections.
Researchers have identified a remarkable example of convergent evolution in aquatic animals, where a mechanically optimal method of swimming with elongated fins has evolved independently at least eight times in both vertebrates and invertebrates across three phyla. This phenomenon is distinct from the convergent evolution of morphological features, such as wings and camera-type eyes, where the evolved trait is a pattern of movement that occurs across a morphologically diverse set of appendages in aquatic animals. These animals swim by undulating their elongated fins while keeping their body relatively rigid, with fins running lengthwise along the body rather than crosswise like a trout's tail. The researchers hypothesize that the regulation of optimal wavelength, elongation, and fination in these phyla may be due to common genetic networks underlying convergent evolution, as seen in electric organs. They found that the optimal wavelength (OS) maximizes force generated by the body, also maximizing swimming speed. By dividing the length of undulation along an animal's fin by the mean amplitude of undulations along the fin, the OS is consistently around 20. This value can predict the number of undulations needed for a swimming animal to cruise at any velocity. The study unifies a vast diversity of swimming organisms, from invertebrates like cuttlefish to vertebrates like cartilaginous and bony fish.
Researchers have investigated the role of condens, a class of evolutionarily conserved protein complexes, in neural stem cell (NS) divisions during cerebral cortex development. They found that two types of condens complexes, condens I and II, are essential for NS divisions and survival in mice. Simultaneous depletion of both condens causes severe defects in chromosome assembly and segregation, leading to DNA damage and p53-induced apoptosis. Individual depletions of condens I and II lead to slower loss of NS, with distinct mitotic defects: chromosome missegregation in condin II-depleted NS and mitotic delays in condin I-depleted NS. NS depleted of condin II display hyperclustering perentric heterochatin and nucleoli, indicating condin II's role in establishing interphase architecture. These defects persist in postmitotic neurons. The study demonstrates overlapping and non-overlapping functions of condens I and II in NS, providing insight into balancing acts of the two complexes.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanisms of sex determination and differentiation in the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni, which has a unique sex-determining system but only exhibits phenotypic sexual dimorphism after infecting a vertebrate hosts. They analyzed the transcriptome of S. mansoni in a stage- and sex-comparative manner, performing RNA-seq on males and females at five developmental stages: cercaria, three in vivo schosulum stages, and adults. A total of 7,168 genes were differentially expressed between sexes at least one stage, with 4,065 functionally annotated. Transcript data were complemented with H3K27me histone modification analysis using ChIP-seq before cercaria and after adult phenotypic sexual dimorphism. The study identified candidate determinants of sexual differentiation, sex-based players of interaction with vertebrate host, and dynamic H3me3 histone mark between sexes illustrating sex-based epigenetic landscapes. Results suggest that sexual differentiation in S. mans is accompanied by distinct male and female transcription landscapes of host-parasite interaction, genetic determinants, and epigen regulators. This could lead to optimized dimorphism in this parasitic species. S. mans is pathogenic to humans, this study provides therapeutic targets and insights into parasite development interaction with vertebrate and reproductive function.
Researchers have developed a new approach to handle disagreements among experts in large-scale annotation efforts by assigning a confidence value to each annotation, representing the probability of its correctness. This approach estimates annotator-specific parameters from data and computes certainty levels for individual annotations. Two probabilistic models were created and compared using simulations, then applied to a 10,000-sentence corpus annotated by eight experts, with a 1,000-sentence subset further annotated by five new experts. The study shows that even in worst-case scenarios, all annotators disagree, the approach significantly increases the probability of choosing the correct annotation. A corpus of 10,000 sentences is made publicly available, annotated on several dimensions. The approach is general and can benefit most annotation studies. 

The study aims to quantify certainty in individual annotations for a group of annotators, retaining the dataset for training and testing machine learning. Models for reliability are based on the corpus. To validate, a second annotation cycle was performed with five new annotators on a 1,000-sentence subset. Annotators distinguished knowledge from conclusions, certainty, evidence from speculations, scientific from methodological statements. The goal was to generate a corpus for training computers to perform tasks at scale.
Researchers have developed a new approach to produce antiviral antibodies against hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a deadly disease caused by Andes virus (AND) and AND-like viruses in South America. Since convalescent plasma from survivors is limited, they explored using DNA technology to produce antiralics, including polyclonal neutralizing antibodies. Geese were vaccinated with AND DNA vaccine encoding virus glycoproteins and developed high levels of neutralizing antibodies, which lasted over a year. A booster resulted in extremely high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Analysis showed these antibodies were highly reactive to specific amino sequences of AND glyrote. The protective efficacy of goose-derived antibodies was tested in a hamster model of lethal HPS. Sera or Ig/IgFc from vaccinated geese were passively transferred to hamsters starting 5 days after AND challenge. Both protected 8/8 and 8 hamsters, respectively. In contrast, hamsters receiving Ig/Ig from non-vaccinated ge or no treatment developed HPS. This demonstrates the DNA/goose platform can produce a candidate antiral product preventing lethal disease when administered post-exposure.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Dmta enzyme in cancer development by studying its effects on DNA methylation patterns in a mouse model of lung cancer. Dmta is responsible for establishing normal methylation patterns, and mutations in Dmt have been linked to leukemia. Deleting Dmt in a mouse model of lung cancer led to tumor progression, suggesting it might suppresses cancer by stabilizing methylation. Whole-genome bisulf sequencing showed profound methylation changes in K-as-induced lung cancer. Dmt-type tumors had large hypomethyl domains corresponding to lamina-associated regions, while Dmt-deficient tumors were uniformly hypomethylated. Further analysis revealed Dmt is required for maintaining methylation of active domains and Dmt-deficient tumors showed deregulation in these domains. The study defines features of cancer methylomes and Dmt's role in maintaining methylation in cancer.
Researchers have studied the neural activity patterns in the premotor cortex of songbirds to understand how they generate sequences of neural activity that control singing. They found that neural activity in this area is organized on a scale of 100 micrometers, with basal ganglia-projecting excitatory neurons firing at a specific phase of a 30 Hz rhythm. This suggests that premotor activity is inhomogeneous in time and space, and a mesoscopic pattern underlies the generation of neural sequences controlling song. In singing birds, the relationship between time and space in premotor area HVC is neither random nor globally organized as a wave, but clustered on 100 μm length. A 30 Hz rhythm in local field potential (LFP) correlated with inhibition influences timing of one projection neuron type, HX, and this rhythm coherent over length matching projection calcium activity. Calcium imaging and multi-electrode recordings show patterns of excitatory and inhibitory neurons are spatially clustered, with two types HX neurons and H interneurons firing in alternating phases of 30 Hz rhythm. Inhibitory neurons show patterned activity throughout song, whereas projection neurons fire sparsely, with calcium correlated events between neighbors. This suggests a microcircuit where multiple excitatory neurons drive interne populations. Recurrence of these scales and rhythmic times across species and contexts raises possibility that clustering and 30 rhythmic alternation of excitatory inhibitory may be feature cortical microcircuits for sequential behavior.
Researchers have identified 64 genes in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that are essential for growth and development, but also extend lifespan when inactivated. These genes are highly conserved from yeast to humans and are involved in insulin, metabolic, translation, RNA, and chromatin regulation pathways. Early inactivation of these genes causes growth arrest at larval stages, but some animals live longer than wild-type adults. The gene daf-16 is required for survival of arrested larvae, suggesting increased longevity is a physiological response to gene inactivation. Insulin signaling plays a role in aging regulation at any stage of life. The study suggests that lifespan is regulated by genetic and environmental factors in many species. Previous research has identified components of cellular processes that regulate lifespan. In C. elegans, loss-of-function in insulin/insulin growth factor-1/daf-2 pathway doubles lifespan. Regulation of DAF-2 occurs during adulthood. C. elegans lifespan extended when fed RNA targeting insulin/d-2 at any larval stage through adulthood. Conditional d-2 alleles cause dauer if inactivated at L stage, but longevity if inactivated in adults. Null d-2 alleles are lethal, demonstrating uncoupling developmental and aging phenotypes of genes. Essential genes are underrepresented in genome-wide screens for postdevelopmental phenotypes like aging. Caloric restriction extends lifespan across species, including yeast, worms, flies, and mice. Sir-2.1 and let-363 in C. elegans regulate lifespan via caloric restriction. Unlike insulin, imposing at any time increases lifespan. Mitochondrial function perturbations increase lifespan. DAF-16 activity modulated by J signaling, SIR-2.1 deetyl, H-1, LIN-14, and SM-1 in nucleus.
Researchers have identified a critical step in the process of zebraf fin regeneration: the creation of a specialized epidermis that guides growth from underlying tissue after amputation. They performed a genetic screen to find mutations that block this process and found a temperature-sensitive allele of lamin beta 1, a component of the extracellular matrix, that prevents regeneration. Lamin beta 1, not its paralog, is induced in a subset of epithelial cells after amputation and is required to establish a polarized basal epithelial layer. This leads to expression of morphogenetic factors, basolateral positioning of phosphorylated Ig1, patterning of osteoblasts, and regeneration of bone. Lamin 1 is dispensable for juvenile growth, homeostatic tissue, adult maintenance, repair of fins, or renewal of genetically ablated osteoblast. Mutations or transgenic receptor inhibition disrupt lamin 1 expression, linking growth factor to epithelial maturation during regeneration. The study reveals transient induction of lamin 1 in epithelial cells as a key step in formation of signaling-competent epidermis.
Researchers compared different methods for accounting for relatedness in genome-wide association studies using family data, specifically linear mixed models (LMM) approaches. Several LMM software packages have been developed, but it's unclear how they differ from previous implementations. They applied LMM to a genome-wide study of visceral leishiasis in 348 Brazilian families (362 individuals, 197 genotyped) and compared results to traditional family-based tests and alternative approaches. LMM showed strong concordance and controlled genome-wide error rate, except when applied to longitudinal data with repeated measures. They also correlated with alternative approaches, except transmission-based on small or non-existent SNPs. LMM performed well compared to competing methods, with choice based on speed and ease-of-use rather than power error considerations. 

The study used real and simulated data from a genome association study of visceral leishias in 348 families (363 individuals, 197 with genotype and phenotype). The Brazilian data was used with a larger case-control set by Fola et al. LMM analysis was computationally convenient, but standard software like GWAS was slow. The results relate to genotypes from a single data set, a Brazilian study of leishias. The study focused on results using pruned SNPs to estimate kinship for genome-wide in Mendel, which uses all SNPs by default. They compared LMM and alternative approaches in Table 1 through real and simulated data from the Brazilian set Fola et al. Kinship between pairs were estimated prior to fitting linear model on genome data, rather than theoretical values. Fitting a linear model for each SNP across genome was computationally challenging.
Researchers have developed a high-throughput screening assay to identify compounds that inhibit Trypanosoma cruzi infection in mammalian cells. A 200-compound library was screened using a recombinant T. cruzi strain expressing β-galactosidase. Three compounds, P1, NT, and CX, were selected for their high activity against T. cruz and low toxicity to host cells in vitro, with IC50 values of 54, 190, and 23 nM, respectively. Each compound has a different mechanism of action on intracellular T. cruz amigote proliferation. CX shows trypanocidal activity, essential for chronic Chagas disease treatment, while NT has tryostatic effect and P1 affects division. These compounds also show activity against intracellular T. cruz from Y and Leishmania species. Characterization of anti-T. cruz activity led to selection of two compounds with IC values 2M, P6 and CX, 100 times lower than current medicines. This provides new candidates for Chagas and leishiasis treatment.
Researchers have developed a portable, low-cost diagnostic platform for detecting Brugia parasites in mosquitoes, a major cause of lymphatic filariasis. Current methods rely on PCR or real-time PCR detection, which require expensive equipment and infrastructure. The new platform, called "Backpack PCR," uses a rapid DNA extraction method with sodium hydroxide and a portable, battery-powered PCR machine with a strip-based detection. It's a proof-of-concept for detecting Brug malayi, but can be adapted for Wuchereria bancrofti and other mosquito-transmitted pathogens. The team compared the new method to standard column-based DNA extraction and found it effective. They also compared it to real-time PCR and conventional PCR with gel electrophoresis, showing it's sensitive and specific. By using a miniaturized PCR, they demonstrated the platform's potential for point-of-collection use, compact enough to fit in a backpack. This eliminates reliance on expensive equipment without compromising detection sensitivity, providing an alternative to column-based extractions requiring infrastructure. The system increases molecular monitoring feasibility in endemic areas and provides a framework for W bancfti detection.
Researchers have studied the self-assembly of elastom proteins, which are proteins that can stretch and recoil due to their unique structure. These proteins are made up of alternating domains that provide elasticity and help the assembly process, and elements that stabilize the structure. Changes in the number and arrangement of these domains affect the assembly and properties. A new simulation model was created to examine the impact of architecture on assembly and integrity. The model used diffusion-limited aggregation to simulate the self-assembly of rod-like particles with different architectures. Results showed that the length and number of domains significantly impact the structure's morphology and integrity. Highly connected polymers were formed from rods with large crossing elements and small domains. This study provides insights into the evolution of elastom proteins and can guide the design of new biomaterials.
Researchers have investigated the role of the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) in the Ebola virus genome, which are longer than most non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses. They found that the 5-UTRs do not function as internal ribosomal entry sites, but instead regulate cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of a reporter gene. The 5-UT from the viral polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppressed translation compared to a beta-actin 5-UT. The 5-UT has four upstream AUGs (uAUGs) and ablating each uUG enhanced translation of the primary open reading frame (ORF), most dramatically in the case of the L5-UT. The uUG was sufficient to initiate translation, surrounded by a weak Koz sequence and suppressed ORF translation in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions where eIFα was phosphorylated, the presence of uF maintained translation of LOR, indicating u modulates translation in response to cellular stress. To address the role of u in virus replication, a recombinant Ebola was generated with u mutated to UCG. Mutating two nucleotides outside previously-defined protein and cis-regulatory sequences attenuated virus titers 10-100 lower than wild-type in Vero A549 cells. The mutant also exhibited decreased RNA synthesis as early as 6 post-infection and enhanced sensitivity to stressor thapsargin.
Researchers have developed a new method to map double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human chromosomes, which are breaks in the DNA that can lead to genomic instability and cancer. They found that these breaks are not random, but occur in specific hotspots scattered along the chromosomes, protecting 50-250 kilobase DNA domains. About 30% of these domains have genes that are expressed together, and proteins PAR1 and HNPA2B1 bind to the ends of these domains. This suggests a new type of gene regulation where clusters of genes are silenced by double-strand breaks and PAR1 and HN2A1 binding. The study highlights the relationship between chromosomal fragile sites, organization, and gene regulation, which may be important for cancer and gene therapy. Double-strand breaks in the genome have been studied for years, as they can lead to cancer by deleting tumor suppressor genes, amplifying genes, and causing oncogenic fusions. The researchers found non-random breaks with blunt ends that define 50-250 kilobase domains protected from breaks. Transcription shows some domains have co-expressed genes, suggesting regulation inside large regions delimited by breaks. PAR1 and HN2A1 bind to the ends of these domains, providing a clue to a mechanism. The breaks may correspond to fragile sites in chromosomes and the technique can be used to study fragile sites in many cells.
Researchers studied trypanosomat infections in bats from two areas with different levels of preservation in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They analyzed 181 bat specimens from Reserva Ecológica Guçu (REG) and Estação Florestal Mata Atlântica (EFMA) and found 24 individuals (13%) infected with trypanosomatids. Molecular characterization using PCR targeting the 18S rRNA gene showed similar infection rates in both areas, 15% in REG and 11 in EF (p=0.46). Trypanosoma cruzi was the most detected parasite (54%), followed by T. cruzi DTI and TIV and Trypanos sp. in Neotropical phlost bats. Mixed infections were also observed. T. cruz DTI and TIV are genotypes involved in acute Chagas disease in Brazil, and T. disii was found in an infected child's heart. Crithidia mellae, a protozoan parasite infecting vertebrates in the Americas, was also detected. Bats harbor a great diversity of trypanids, maintaining tryosid diversity in the sylvatic environment.
Ticks are the primary arthropod vectors of human and animal diseases in Europe, with Iodes ricinus being a major transmitter of various bacteria, viruses, and parasites. They can be co-infected with multiple pathogens, increasing the likelihood of transmission to humans or animals. However, data on co-infection prevalence is limited, focusing on well-known pathogens. Ticks also carry symbionts, which play roles in tick biology and may interfere with pathogen transmission. This study evaluated the prevalence of 38 pathogens and symbionts, co-infections, and interactions between pathogens and symbion. 267 Iodes ricinus females were collected in the Ardennes and analyzed for 37 pathogens by high-throughput PCR, TBE by RT-PCR, and four symbts by nested PCR. Results showed 45% were co-infected, carrying up to five pathogens. Adding symbt prevalence, all were infected with at least one microorganism, up to eight in one tick. Interactions between pathogens suggested a strong association between Borrelia garini and B afii, no interactions between symbion and pathogens. This study reveals high pathogen co-infection rates, questioning co-transmission to humans and animals, and health consequences. High symbt prevalence with pathogens opens avenues for their effects on pathogen transmission and vector competence.
Researchers have developed a computational model to understand how hematopoietic stem cells decide between different lineages, specifically the erythroid-myoid lineage, which is controlled by the genes PU.1 and GATA.1. These genes are turned on and off in a switch-like manner, but prior to commitment, they are expressed at low levels, a phenomenon known as priming. The model reveals a mechanism involving a cofactor regulated by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner, necessary for bistability and switch behavior. The PU.1-GATA switch also interacts with another antagonistic pair, FOG-1, which inherits the state of upstream genes and reinforces decision through feedback, leading to irreversible commitment. This switch is an example of a network implementing both primed and committed states by cooperativity through cofactor recruitment. Perturbing feedback between regulators and targets suggests reprogramming strategies. The approach provides a framework for lineage studies and could aid in finding lineage-determining genes.
Enterococcus faecalis, an opportunistic pathogen with high intrinsic resistance to lysozyme, a key effector of the innate immune system, requires a complex network of transcription regulators and genes to inhibit enzymatic and antimicrobial activities. Researchers sought to identify novel genes modulating E. faalis resistance to lysoe. Random transposon mutagenesis in a quadruple oat/pgA/dlt/sig mutant led to identification of insertions in the enteroccal polyschar antigen (EPA) region, downstream of conserved epA-ep genes, proposed to encode core machinery. The PA region was previously linked to EPA decoration, but its role unknown. This study shows EPA contributes to resistance to antimicrobials and virulence in zebraf infection by conferring phagocytosis. Deletion of pgA in L monocogen is associated with 32-fold decrease in resistance. Transposon mutagenesis of OP strain showed disruption of genes encoding EPA decoration increases E fa resistance to lyzym. In-frame deletion in wild-type background had same effect. The contribution of oat, pgA, dlt, and sig to lyzym resistance was carried out using E fa J2 as background, avirulent in zraf model. Mapping transon sites revealed 9 of 16 insertions downstream conserved epAep region, encoding core apparatus producing EPA. The region displays variability and proposed responsible for EPA decoration. This study shows quadruple mutant oat/pgA/dlt/sig still high to lyzym compared to Firmutes.
Researchers have developed a new model called RER (Regression of Combined Expression) to analyze how genes are regulated in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), a type of blood cancer. This model combines data from two sources: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). GA provides information on gene expression, copy number variation (CN), DNA methylation (DM), and microRNA (mi) regulation, while EN contains data on transcription factor (TF) binding. RER first infers TF and miRNA activities specific to each sample, then uses these to infer TF-miRNA interactions. This two-stage approach overcomes a challenge of integrating EN data from generic cell lines with sample-specific GA measurements. The model was tested on AML data from GA and related TF data from K562 in EN. It was verified through 10-fold cross-validation and shown to predict gene expression accurately. RER also recovered known regulatory interactions and outperformed existing methods in detecting miRNA/TF targets. A feature selection identified 18 regulators consistent with cytogenetic risk, including miR-548, whose targets were enriched in leukemia pathways, suggesting its role in AML pathogenesis. Survival analysis using inferred activities as a potential AML prognostic marker. This framework integrates GA and EN data, revealing AML regulatory program at a global level.
Researchers investigated the role of RNA interference (RNAi) in the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsum, a species that causes disease in various crops worldwide. They created mutants lacking genes for three key RNAi components: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DR), Dicer-like (DCL), and Argonaute (AGO) proteins. Surprisingly, no growth defects were observed in mutants grown on normal or minimal media. However, mutants lacking CL1, CL1CL2, and AGO showed severe conidiation and conidia defects. Total RNA and small RNA populations were analyzed in parental and mutant strains, revealing greatest effects in CL1, CL1CL2, and AGO strains. A previously unknown double-stranded RNA virus, Colletotrichum higginsum non-segmented RNA virus 1 (ChV1), was derepressed in these mutants. Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship between ChV and segmented viruses. Immunoprecipitation of small RNAs with AGO showed abundant 5'-containing siRNAs. Higginsum parental and CL mutant cured of ChV revealed conid and spore defects caused by ChV. The study proposes RNAi involving CL and AGO in C as an antiviral mechanism.
Researchers investigated the role of histone acetyltransferase MOF in meiotic expansion of H2 phosphorylation during spermatogenesis in mice. They found that MOF is involved in all three waves of H2 phosphorylation, which occur during meiotic prophase I. The first wave is ATM-dependent and occurs at leptotene, while the second and third are ATR-dependent, occurring at zygotene and pachene, respectively. The third wave of H2 phosphorylation marks unsynapsed chromosomes. MO deletion in spermatocytes caused loss of H4ac in leptene and zgot spermatocytes, resulting in γ2 signals only along chromosomal axes and chromatin-wide H2 phosphorylation loss. In almost 40% of early-mid pachene spermatocytes, γ2 and M1 were detected along unsyn axes, but failed to expand, causing meiotic sex inactivation failure. RAD51 was proficiently recruited to double-strand break sites, but defects in repair and crossover were observed, indicating MO facilitates meiotic repair after51 recruitment. MO regulates meiosis and expansion of all three H2 phosphorylation waves from leptene to pach stages initiated by ATM and ATR.
Researchers investigated the effects of Human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1) infection on human T-cell development in the thymus of "Immune System" Rag-2/-γ- mice. These mice were infected with HT-1 at a time when three subpopulations of thymocytes have been detected. In all inoculated mice, HT-1 provirus was found in thymocytes, and proviral load increased with length of infection. In HT- infected mice, alterations in T development were observed, which correlated with proviral load. Mature single-positive (SP) CD4 and CD8 cells were numerous at expense of immature and double-positive (DP) thymocytes in thus of HT- infected Rag-/- mice. These cells also accumulated in spleen. Lymphocytes from thus and spleen were activated, shown by expression of CD25, which correlated with presence of tax and increased of NF-κB dependent genes such as Bcl-1, anti-apopt gene in thym. Hepatosplenomegaly lymphoma and lymphoma were observed in HT- infected mice several months after infection. These results demonstrate potential of Rag-/- animal to elucidate initial steps of leukogenic process by HT-1.
In Sudan, schistosomiasis remains a major public health concern, particularly Schistosoma haematium infection. An integrated control program was implemented in Jabal locality, White State, Sudan from 2009-2011, targeting 78,615 primary school students out of 482,902. Prevalence of S. haematium and S. mansoni at baseline was 28.5% and 0.4%, respectively. After 6-9 months post-treatment, prevalence of S. haematium reduced to 13.5% (95%CI=0.331-0.462), with higher reduction in girls and rural areas. Health education increased awareness and clean water supply at Alida village reduced infection. No change in S. mansoni prevalence between baseline and follow-up (95%CI=0.9336.891). Prevalence of S haematium reduced by 50% at project end. Approximately 200,000 received praziquel therapy, education, or clean water. Integrated intervention should be adapted to consolidate achievements.
Researchers have discovered that the matrix protein of the Nipah virus (NiV), a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus, plays a crucial role in viral budding by trafficking between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Unlike other paramyxiruses, which replicate in the cytoplasm, NiV matrix protein was found in the nucleus at early stages of infection before localizing to the plasma membrane. Mutations in the putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) and leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) in Ni-M impaired nuclear-cytoplasm trafficking and abolished NiV budding. A conserved lysine residue in NLS mediated nuclear import and was also a site for monoubiquination regulating export. Overexpression of ubiquitin enhanced NiV budding, while depletion of ubiquitin via proteas inhibitors resulted in nuclear retention of Ni-M and blocked budding. Live Ni virus was sensitive to proteas inhibitors, with an IC50 of 2.7nM, a concentration achievable in humans. This suggests a potential therapeutic target for acute Ni infection.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how non-enveloped viruses, such as the poliovirus, enter and deliver their genetic material into cells. They used a combination of imaging and infectivity assays to track the virus's capsid and genome in live cells. The study found that the polirus releases its genome quickly and efficiently, without limiting its ability to infect cells. The virus binds to the cell surface and enters through a clath, caveolin, flotin, and microtubule-independent, but tyrosine and actin-dependent endocytic mechanism. After internalization, the virus releases its genome from tightly sealed invaginated vesicles within 100-200 nm of the plasma membrane. This resolves a long-standing debate on whether the virus directly breaks the plasma membrane or relies on endocytosis to deliver its genome into the cell. This method can be applied to study entry mechanisms of other nonvelop viruses.
Dengue fever remains a significant public health concern in Cambodia, particularly affecting children. The National Dengue Control Program (NDC) relies heavily on education as a means of prevention and control, delivering it to communities and schools. An ethnographic study conducted in 2003-2004 in eastern Cambodia explored the approaches used in education and their effectiveness in controlling deng. Community education through health centre activities and campaigns is provided by the NDC, but is underfunded and delivered irregularly, while school education is restricted in time and lacks follow-up activities for prevention and control. As a result, adherence is partial. The study suggests the need for sustained education for deng prevention and control and approaches to ensure translation of knowledge into practice.

Health education plays a crucial role in informing and encouraging people to prevent and participate in controlling deng as transmissible diseases. However, in resource-poor countries, health education efficacy is complicated by economic and infrastructural factors. In Cambodia, deng health delivered through outreach and school programs is insufficient and underfunded. This does not indicate a reduced need for education. Local prevention and control involving community members through education in community and schools offers potential to reduce deng, but cannot occur where education is poorly resourced and episodic and attention is not paid to knowledge translation to practice.

Two factors impact outreach: political commitment and resource availability. The study explores input and effectiveness of community HC and school education for deng to address this gap. Challenges facing deng control in Cambodia are elucidated. No specific model was used to structure health activities or education; strategy and content developed to include activities, information, practices regarded important to deng and mortality. Community education through radio, television, billboards, banners, posters, and leaflets. Existing deng education materials and strategies must be redefined practical and applicable. Little training in health education for practitioners during training or in-service, they lack skills and perceive education not part of work.
Researchers investigated the presence of microRNAs (miRNAs) released by filarial nematodes into the bloodstream of infected hosts. They used deep sequencing and bioinformatics to identify over 200 miRNA sequences of nematode origin in Dirofia imis-infected dog plasma and 21 in Onchocerca volulus-infected human serum. Two miRNA candidates, mi-71 and mi-34, were detected in D. imis-infected dog plasma using stem-loop RT-qPCR assays. Brugia pangi-infected samples were also analyzed, as these miRNAs were previously detected in extracts from this species. The presence of mi-71 and mi-34 discriminated infected from uninfected samples, with no mi amplification in uninfected samples. However, miRNA numbers did not correlate with microfilaria for either parasite, possibly due to imprecision in mf counts or mi contributions from unknown number of worms. Parasite-derived miRNAs were found in plasma or serum for species not living in bloodstream.
Researchers have developed a model to study the activation of Src tyrosine kinases, a type of enzyme involved in cellular signaling. The activation involves a significant structural change from an inactive to active state. A coarse-grained model of the catalytic domain was created using experimental structures of two stable states and simulated dynamics of conformation transitions. Energy landscapes were explored by constructing a network of clusters from simulations, revealing two major pathways for activation. The first pathway involves coordinated interactions between the α helix, activation loop, and β strands in the N-terminus of the catalytic domain. The second pathway involves conformation change coupled to partial unfolding of the N-terminus of the catalytic domain. The mechanism of α helix and loop switching was also detailed. A Markov model was tested to account for structural kinetics in the context of conformation changes. Results provide a framework for understanding conformation transition in Src activation.
Researchers have identified the genetic basis of lethality in offspring from crosses between Arabidopsis thaliana plants with different ploidy levels. They found a single-effect QTL, DSL1, and two QTL with epistatic relationships to DSL1, which affects postzygotic lethality via maternal expression in the sporophyte. Fine mapping placed DSL1 in an interval encoding the maternal transcription factor TT2. Maternal parents with loss-of-function in TT2 suppressed F1 lethality caused by paternal interploidy crosses. The frequency of cellularization in the endosperm was affected by natural variation and tt2 loss-function mutants. The genetic basis of natural variation and single-gene mutations suggests F1 leth in polypids can evolve rapidly. The role of sporophytic TT2 in interplo crosses indicates developmental programming by the mother regulates viability of interplo hybrid offspring.
Researchers conducted a comparative evolutionary analysis of bacterial pathogens in bats and rodents using Bartonella and Leptira as models. They analyzed genetic data from 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 from 38 rodents, and 26 Leptira from 20 bats. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies were generated for hosts and bacteria, and coevolutionary congruence was tested using ParaFit, PAC, and Jane. Results showed significant coevolution between Bartonella and bat hosts (ParaGlobal=1.970, P≤0.001, m value=7.332, P0.000) and between Bartonella and rodents (ParaGlobal=102.440, P.001, m=86.532, P.000). In contrast, Leptira and bats showed no coevolution (ParaGlobal=0.004, P=0.84, m=4.631, P.562). Separate analyses of New and Old World datasets yielded congruent results. Event-based cophyeny was used to reconstruct evolutionary histories for each pathogen and host. Leptira had the most host switches (0.731), while Bartonella had the fewest (0.264). Both bat and rodent hosts showed Bartonella coevolution with minimal switching, while Leptira lacked congruence and had high host switches. Differences in disease transmission and host ecology may explain variable coevolution patterns. Understanding coevolution and host-switching between pathogens and hosts can predict spillo between mammal reservoirs and humans.
Researchers have developed a new framework to understand how animals that swim using a wavelike motion, called undulatory swimming, move. They used a mathematical model of a chain to study how muscle contractions cause movement. The study found that muscle contractions trigger the first movements of the body, which then cause the animal to move forward. The researchers also found that simple patterns of muscle contractions can lead to complex movements. The frequency of muscle contractions compared to the natural movement of the body is important for the shape of the movement. This understanding can help explain how animals swim fast. The study used computer simulations to confirm the results and found that previous research on the best stiffness for speed is correct. 

The study used a chain model of undulatory swimming to understand how muscle and environment cause movement. The system is forced by muscle, environment, or both. The researchers applied a forced oscillation framework to understand movement. The frequency of muscle compared to the natural movement is important for the shape. The study found how power from muscle is used and dissipated into the environment. A formula for speed was derived from the equations of motion. Movement of undulatory swimmers starts from muscle activation. There are two issues in undulatory. First, how muscle leads to movement. Second, how movement produces forward motion. The study presented the forced oscillation formulation and used to generate motion. Examples of active and passive swimming were discussed. The pathway of power during swimming was discussed.
Researchers investigated whether genetic recombination between subspecies of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei from humans and animals can generate new strains of the human pathogen T. b. rhodesense (T), responsible for sleeping sickness (African Trypanosomias, H) in East Africa. They found that a single gene, SRA, which confers human infectivity to T, can be transferred to the animal pathogen T by sexual reproduction. By tracking the inheritance of S in crosses of T and T set up by co-transmit genetically-engineered parental tryosome lines through tse flies, S was readily transferred into new genetic backgrounds by reproduction between T and T, creating new strains of the pathogen T. There was no evidence of diminished growth or transmissibility of tryosomes carrying S. Although expression of S is critical to survival of T in the host, the gene exists as a single copy in representative of T strains. S was found on homologue chromosome IV in majority of T isolates, but Ugandan T had S on both homologues. The mobility of S by recombination explains genetic variability of T in Africa. New strains of human pathogen T are generated by recombination with larger pool of animal-infect tryosomes. Such recombinants present risk future outbreaks of H.
Researchers studied how electrical connections between cells in the islets of Langerhans, called gap junctions, affect insulin secretion in neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), a condition caused by dysfunctional β-cells. They found that gap junctions play a crucial role in coordinating insulin response to glucose and suppressing insulin secretion at low glucose levels. In a mouse model of NDM, expressing ATP-insensitive K channels, they showed that reducing gap junctions can suppress overall islet response. They created a computational model of islet electrical activity and insulin secretion, verified against measurements of calcium and insulin in islets with varying gap coupling levels. The model predicted that gap coupling suppresses calcium and insulin secretion in the presence of ATP-sensitive K channels. They found that reducing gap coupling can recover calcium and insulin in islets with ATP-sensitive K channels. The model matched clinical presentation of different NDM mutations and predicted recoveries in calcium and insulin for many mutations with reduced gap coupling. Stochastic noise played a role in recoveries. The study shows how islets function as a multicellular system and the role of gap channels in exacerbating effects of decreased excitability. It suggests new options for NDM and other monogenic diabetes.
Researchers have developed a framework to predict the behavior of complex gene networks by accounting for a phenomenon called retroactivity, which affects how a module's performance changes when connected to other modules. The framework uses three matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity, which can be calculated from measurable parameters like dissociation constants and promoter concentrations. Internal retroactivity measures the effect of intramolecular connections on a module's dynamics, while scaling and mixingactivity describe how intermodule connections change dynamics. Based on these matrices and a module's isolated dynamics, the team can predict how it will behave when connected to other modules. They applied this to network motifs like autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, toggle, and single motif. A metric was also created to measure a module's robustness to interconnection with other modules, useful for evaluating natural networks and designing synthetic systems to minimize retroactivity.
Researchers have studied the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of the human X and Y chromosomes, a region that has undergone rapid evolution and is essential for proper separation of X and Y chromosomes during meiosis. The PAR1 region has an exceptionally high crossover rate, 17 times higher than the genome average, but the mechanism behind this is unknown. A study in mice suggested crossovers in PAR may be independent of PRDM9, a protein that localizes crossovers in autosomes. To investigate, researchers created a fine-scale map of crossovers using African-American pedigrees and analyzed recombination rates from linkage disequilibrium in human populations and DNA evolution signatures. They also identified PRDM binding sites in human cells. Contrary to mice, PRDM does not localize recombination in human PAR. Recombination is more rapid and intense in PAR than autosomes and hotspot activities differ among human populations. Hotspots have changed between humans and chimpanzees with no shared hotspots.
Researchers have identified a new isoform of the histone demethylase JMJD2/KDM4, called Δ-JMJD2, which plays a crucial role in skeletal muscle differentiation. In muscle cells, specific genes are silenced by epigenetic modifications, including histone H3 methylation. The promoter of the gene encoding myogenic factor Myogen (My) is key for muscle initiation of differentiation. The mechanism of H3 demethylation at My promoter is unclear. Δ-JJD2 increases during differentiation of C2 myoblasts into myotubes and is necessary for myotube formation and muscle-specific expression. It promotes MyD-induced conversion of NIH3T3 cells into muscle cells. ChIP-chip analysis shows Δ-J2 binds mainly to genes involved in transcriptional control and this binding is linked to activation. Δ-J2 is recruited to My promoter at onset of differentiation, promoting demethylation of H3me and H3. The induction of Δ-J2 isoform is crucial for muscle differentiation by removing repressive chromatin marks at My promoter, promoting My expression and contributing to initiation of muscle-specific expression. Genome-wide analysis shows Δ-J acts as coactivator for genes induced during skeletal differentiation and binds My promoter to regulate H3 methylation, allowing My expression and myot differentiation.
The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) is in its final stages, with only 25 cases reported in 2016, but global eradication requires certification by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the absence of transmission in all countries. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the GWEP when the number of cases is lower and cost per case is higher than any other time. Using data from GW, the cost of implementation, pre-certification, and certification stages are estimated, and cost-effectiveness modeled for 1986-203. Two scenarios are compared: doing nothing (no intervention since 1986) and control (only surveillance and response 201-203). The cost per case averted, disability-adjusted life year (DAL) averted, and cost at-risk year averted are reported. Cost-effectiveness is assessed against a threshold of one GDP per capita (less than $500 in low-income countries). The GW cost estimated $11.95 (4.70-12.49) per case averted 198-203. The pre-cert and certification phases cost $0.004 and $0.001 per capita year. The DAL averted by GW relative to nothing is $222 (118-372) 198-203. GW is more cost-effective than control by 203. GW is more cost-effective control if willing to pay one life without GWD risk $0.10. Even if costs double, GW still cost-effective relative nothing.
Researchers studied the protein BB32 from Borrelia burgdorferi, a bacterium that causes Lyme disease, to understand how it evades the human immune system's complement system. They found that the protein's carbox-terminal domain, BB32-C, binds to and inhibits the serine protease of the human complement's classical pathway, C1. The study investigated BB32 orthologs from other Lyme disease-causing Boria, B afii and Bgar, and found that Bafii's BB-C exhibited similar activity to BB-C in binding and inhibiting the complement. However, Bgar's BB-C had reduced activity. The researchers created a chimeric protein that mimicked Bgar's properties and solved the structure of BB-C to 1.7Å resolution, revealing its anti-parallel four-helix fold and surface-exposed residues important for C1 binding. They found that BB-C only recognized C1 fragments containing the serine protease domain. This study improves understanding of BB's complement evasion mechanisms and suggests it may be shared among Lyme disease-causing Boria.
Researchers have investigated how the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans undergoes a morphological and transcriptional switch from commensalism to pathogenicity. They found that the F2 transcription factor is regulated by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 and the cell wall biosynthesis kinase Cbk, in a role distinct from its conserved function in cell cycle progression. In stationary yeast cells, F2 has a diverse pool of phosphoisoforms, but a window of hyal induction before the cell cycle, phosphorylation is transformed to the yeast profile. This transformation does not occur when stationary cells are reinoculated into fresh medium supporting growth. Mass spectrometry and mutational analyses identified phosphorylated residues by C28 and C1. Substituting these with nonosphorylatable alanine altered the phosphorylation and abated the hyal profile. Transcript profiling the phosphorylation mutant revealed the hyal phosphorylation is required for expression of genes in pathogenesis, host interaction, and biofilm formation. Changes in expression resulted in defects in pathogenic processes. F2 interacts with chromatin modifier P3 in phosphorylation-dependent manner, providing a mechanism for phosphorylation to regulate specificity. A novel cell-independent phosphoregulatory event subverts a component of cycle to role in commal to pathity.
Trypanosoma brucei, a human pathogenic parasite, has both de novo and salvage pathways for pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, making it non-reliant on salvage pyrimines for growth. Thymidine kinase (TK) catalyzes the formation of dTMP and dUMP, one of several enzymes redundant to the novo pathway. Surprisingly, TK is essential for growth and infectivity in a mouse model, and catalytically active is required for function. Unlike humans and other kinetoplastids, T bruce lacks dCMP deaminase (DD), an alternative to dUMP formation. Ect expression of human DD rescued the RNAi growth and allowed selection of viable null cells. Metabolite profiling revealed buildup of deoxypyrim nucleides in TK depleted cells. Knock of cytidine deaminase (DA), converting deoxycidine to deuridine, led to thym/deuridine auxrophy. Unexpectedly, T encodes an unidentified 5-nucleidase converting deypyrim nucleides to nucleosides, leading to buildup in TK cells at expense of dTP pools. Bioinformatics identified potential genes encoding 5-nid activity, including an HD protein phosphorylating deoxyonucle 5-monophosph. TK is essential for thym nucleides synthesis, regardless novo or salvage. Reliance in absence DD may be shared among trypanids, providing a target for single drug.
Researchers have investigated how translation initiation occurs in mRNAs that lack the Shine-Dalgarn sequence, a crucial for ribosome binding in prokary systems. They found that these mRNAs are generally less structured in their initiation region and show minimal folding at the start codon. Using reporter constructs in bacteria, they showed that local RNA unfoldedness determines start cod recognition in Shinealgodependent translation. Consistent with this, start codons reside in single-stranded regions, while internal codons are in structured areas of the mRNA. Bioinformatics and experimental data suggest that absence of secondary structure is necessary and sufficient for Shinealgodependent translation. This provides a mechanism for recognizing the correct initiation site in the absence of a ribosome site. Genome-wide searches in proary and organellar genomes revealed a large fraction of transcripts are translated Shinealgodependent. The extent varies between organisms, from 15% in γteobacteria to 100 in mitochondrial genomes. Data support RNA unfoldedness as a major factor for start recognition in SD translation. No alternative motifs or structural requirements were found, but mRN lacking SD exhibit minimal structure at translational start, suggesting cod accessibility is key in SD initiation.
A study was conducted in Bihar, India to investigate the development of post-kala-azar dermal leishiasis (PKDL) in patients treated with 20mg/kg liposomal amphotin B (Ambisome) for visceral leishmaniasis (VL). PKDL occurs in up to 10% of patients with VL in India, but its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Between July 2007 and August 2012, 874 patients received 20mg intravenous Ambis as first-line treatment for VL, with a high cure rate (99.3%) and low default rate (0.3%). Patients were educated on PK symptoms and advised to return if they developed. Of 831 completing treatment, 24 (0.3%) returned with symptoms confirmed PKDL, diagnosed by clinical history, appearance, and skin smear. 89% had macular lesions, with median time to development 1.2 (0.8-2.2) years. Demographic and clinical characteristics of VL patients who developed PKDL were similar to those who did not. However, time to PK was shorter with Ambis in a subset previously treated with sodium stibogluconate. In this cohort, PKDL appears infrequent with no risk factors. Median to developing PK compared to conventional treatments should be considered when counseling Ambis regimens.
Researchers studied the re-infestation of Triatoma infans, the main vector of Chagas disease, in three villages in northwest Argentina after community-wide insecticide spraying in 1992. They used continuous and discrete-time models to analyze infestation dynamics and found a 6-month lag between detection of new infestation and dispersal events. The models showed a seasonal increase in bug establishment from May to November, coinciding with an increase in dispersal distance. The probability of new bug establishment increased with time since last infestation. These findings challenge current understanding of T. infans ecology and highlight gaps in knowledge. Experiments are needed to close these gaps.

The study used discrete and continuous Markov models for site-level transitions from uninfested to infested and vice versa. Both models showed seasonality in bug establishment on new sites by T.ans coinciding with seasonality in dispersal distance. Three aspects of T.ans control were addressed: establishment rate of new populations as a function of distance from existing populations, mechanisms for seasonality in establishment, and effect of insecticide and previous infestation on rates. A continuous model estimated within-season changes and time-dependent effects of insect spraying, but requires assumptions about sources of dispersers between t and t+1. The contribution of each site to establishment between t and t+1 was estimated by interpolation between number of bugs at site t and t+1.

The study aimed to optimize vector control by understanding spatial and temporal pattern of insecticide application. In contrast to non-spatial analysis, this study showed individual site properties like distance, infestation history, and spraying history contribute to establishment rate. To optimize timing of control, understanding season of dispersal intensity and distance is crucial, not just duration of tethered flight.
Researchers investigated the effects of polyomavirus SV40 (SV40) microRNA on the pathogenesis of viral infections in Syrian hamsters, a commonly used animal model for studying SV40. They inoculated young adult hamsters with different variants of SV40 and analyzed viral loads in tissues over 270 days. All strains established persistent infections with slow clearance, displaying broad tissue tropism in liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain. Liver and kidney had higher viral loads, with kidneys being the primary site for long-term infection. Expression of SV40 microRNA was detected in infected tissues, while microRNA-negative viruses showed higher DNA loads in liver and kidney. Viruses with complex regulatory regions had modestly higher loads in kidney than simple regions. Early transcripts were higher than late in liver and kidney, and infectious virus was infrequently detected. There was limited clearance of micro-deficient viruses. Wild-type and micro-negative SV showed similar transformation rates in vitro and tumor induction in vivo. This study demonstrated tissue tropism for SV40 in hamsters and first evidence of SV microRNA expression and function in vivo. MicroRNA reduced viral loads in infected tissues with simple or complex regions.
Researchers conducted the most comprehensive genome-wide examination of positively selected genes (PSGs) in mammals to date, using high-coverage assemblies of eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of the dataset improved statistical power and allowed for new lineage and clade-specific tests to be applied. Approximately 16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two species showed significant evidence of positive selection (FDR < 0.05) according to a likelihood test. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of selection on lineages or clades. Identified PSGs were enriched for defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but also for specific functions such as complement immunity and perception. Several pathways were enriched for PSG, suggesting co-evolution of interacting genes. A Bayesian analysis indicated PSG switched between positive and non-selection multiple times, suggesting selection is often episodic. PSGs were expressed at lower levels and in a more tissue-specific manner than non-PSGs. Genes expressed in spleen, testes, liver, and breast were enriched PSG, but not in brain. This study provides evidence for widespread selection in mammalian evolution and insights into selection's functional implications.
Staphylococcus aureus, an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes skin and mucosal surfaces, often forms persistent infections through surface-associated biofilms. Researchers discovered a novel extracellular fibril structure that promotes S. aureus biofilm integrity. Biochemical and genetic analysis revealed these fibers have amyloid properties and consist of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins (PSMs). Mutants unable to produce PS were susceptible to biofilm disassembly by matrix-degrading enzymes and mechanical stress. Previous studies associated PS with biofilm disassembly, but this work shows soluble PS disperse biofilms while polymerized do not. PS aggregation into amyloid fibers modulates their biological role in biofilms. 

The S. aureus biofilm contains polysaccharides and DNA that interact with structural and enzym proteins. Under certain conditions, S. aureus produces amyloid fibers that contribute to biofilm integrity. Purification analysis revealed several PS of the phenol modulin family present. These fibers share morph and biophysical characteristics with bacterial amyloids such as E. coli, B. subtilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Biochemical analysis revealed fibr structures composed of PS. Ordered PS aggregation into amyloid abrogates bioactivity ascribed to moneric PS. Our findings suggest PS modulate bioassembly using amyloid as control for activity. This is the first to identify extracellular fibril in S. aureus. We interpret results as aggregation amy can regulate PS in bioenvironment. Our demonstrate S. aure PS in biofilms fibrils and implicate fibr as means altering activity and function.
Researchers have developed a new method to monitor the persistence of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, in infected individuals. The disease affects over 6 million people in 20 countries, mainly in Latin America. Current methods to check for infection, such as blood tests and PCR, have limitations as they can't detect the parasite when it's in low in the blood. The new method, called Ab3, is an antibody that stays in the blood when the parasite is still present. It was tested in 165 serum samples from Chagas patients and showed a strong correlation with the parasite's presence. Ab3 was high in untreated patients and decreased in those who received treatment and cleared the parasite from their blood. Ab3 is a new biomarker for parasite persistence in Chagas patients treated with benidazole. It's thought to be caused by the immune system's response to parasites in tissues that can't be detected by blood tests. Measuring Ab3 could help monitor infected patients' status.
Chikungunya virus (CHV) is an arthrogenic alphavirus that causes fever and severe joint and muscle pain, with chronic musculoskeletal pain persisting in a fraction of patients for months to years after initial infection. To understand what promotes chronic disease, researchers created a recombinant CHV that expresses Cre recombinase (CH-C), which replicates in myoblast and fibroblasts and induces arthritis in mice. Importantly, it also induces chronic disease, including persistent RNA and myitis and synovitis similar to wild-type CHV. CH-C infection of tdato reporter mice resulted in a population of tdato cells that persisted at least 112 days. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometric profiling revealed these td cells were predominantly myofib and dermal muscle fibbl. Treatment with antibody against Mra, a defined receptor for CHV, reduced td cells in chronic and diminished levels of RNA, implicating td cells as reservoir of chronic RNA. Isolation and cytometry sorting td fibbl from skin and ankle and analysis for RNA revealed td cells harbor most persistent CHV RNA at time. This CH-C and tdato system identifies cells survive CHV in vivo and enriched persistent CHV RNA, a tool for studying CH pathogenesis in acute and chronic disease.
Researchers applied dimensionality reduction methods to understand how the structure of neural activity in the brain contributes to brain function. However, it was unclear how results from these methods generalize to larger numbers of neurons and trials, and how they relate to the underlying network structure. To address this, they applied factor analysis to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates and spiking models that generated irregular activity through balance of excitation and inhibition. They compared the scaling of two key dimension reduction outputs, shared dimension and variance, with neuron count. Results showed that networks with clustered connectivity differed, and in vivo recordings were consistent with clustered. Recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify dominant variability that generalizes to larger network. These findings can guide interpretation of dimension reduction in limited neuron and trial and sampling, and relate outputs to underlying structure. 

The study focused on shared variability among simultaneously recorded neurons, as it has implications for information encoded by a population. Dimensionality methods were applied to V1 recordings and spiking models to understand generalization to larger neurons and trials, and relation to underlying structure. Spiking models allowed sampling of desired neurons and trials, assessing dimension reduction over range. This assesses results from limited neurons representative of larger. Known structure influenced scaling trends. Clustered network had fewer dimensions, but represented large variance. Results suggest factor provides characterization single-trial population than PCA. Spontaneous activity in vivo and spiking models were studied. Trends of shared dimension and variance with increasing neurons and trials were analyzed. Spontaneous V1 anesthetized macaque and clustered spiking models were used.
Researchers have discovered that a molecule called 2-aminoacetophen (2-AA), produced by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, plays a crucial role in modulating the host's immune response to infection. In experiments, mice treated with 2-AA before infection had a 90% survival rate compared to 10% in non-treated mice. 2-AA activates key immune pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPs), nuclear factor (NF-κ), and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also attenuates immune response by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines. Pretreatment with 2 is characterized by a transcriptional block of c-J N-terminal (JNK) and NF-κ activation, with preserved activation of extracellular regulated kinase (ER)1/2. This leads to CA/enhancer protein-β (c/EBβ) activation and formation of c/EB-p complex, preventing NF activation. 2 dampens inflammation while increasing survival and pathogen persistence, consistent with its ability to signal bacteria to switch to chronic infection mode. The study reveals a QS immunomodulatory signal promoting aspects of interking communication, facilitating pathogen persistence and host tolerance. Unlike other QS molecules that promote virulence, 2 minimizes immune activation and increases survival, allowing long-term path presence in vivo. Cytokine profiling shows 2 limits pro-inflammatory activation.
Researchers have studied the evolution and function of the L1D1 gene, a domesticated from a LINE-1 retroelement, in mammals. They found that L1 originated in the common ancestor of eutherian mammals, but was lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution. L1 has evolved under positive selection in primate and mouse, and prosimian L1 has replenished itself with a recent L1 ORF from the prosian genome. This suggests L1 has been selected for novelty, possibly for genome defense. L1 loss is associated with extinction in several megab lineages, but not in sigmodine rodents. The study highlights the role of retroelement domestication in mammalian biology and that domesticated genes can adopt different functions in lineages. L1 originated at least 106 million years ago, making it more ancient than domesticated retrogenes syncin and F1. Human L1 plays a role in pluripotency, but L1 has been lost in some lineages, suggesting it may have evolved for defense against L elements.
A highly conserved bacterial protein, RNase Y, plays a crucial role in the processing the 3' end of 16S rRNA and ribosome quality control in E. coli. coli. However, it is not essential in E. coli, but its loss makes the bacteria more sensitive to stress. Researchers found that RNase Y is essential in Vibrio cholera, a pathogen that causes cholera, and is vital for virulence, stress regulation, RNA processing, and ribosome control. They analyzed the RNA and ribosome profiles of a V. cholera strain depleted of RN Y and other RN associated with 16 rRNA processing, showing Y is also crucial for 16 r 3 end maturation in V. cholera and impeding subunit assembly into 70 ribosomes. Y's importance to V cholera pathogenesis was demonstrated by loss of colonization, biofilm formation, reduced toxin production, and altered expression of virulence RNAs in V cholera depleted Y. The Y genes of several distantly related pathogens can complement E. coli ΔY under stress, showing conservation of Y's activity in regulation. This study provides the first exploration of Y's role in a human pathogen, showing conserved function across species in essential processes.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the structure of human transcription factor networks (TF) and their robustness to genetic and environmental perturbations. They found that TF networks share a common assortativity signature, which contributes to their phenotypic robustness. Assortativity measures the tendency of nodes with similar numbers of edges to connect in directed networks, comprising four components that form the assortativity signature. Theoretical studies suggest that increasing one component of TF's assortativity leads to increased phenotypic robustness, but biological context is limited due to lack of characterization of real-world TF assortativity. The study used DNase-seq data to measure genome-wide TF in 41 human cell and tissue types and found that all TF share a common assortativity signature that confers phenotypic robustness. They determined the extent to which each of the four components of assortativity contributes to robustness. Theoretical work showed that TF models with increased assortativity exhibit increased robustness to mutations and gene duplication due to reduced subgraph size and path length, which dampen phenotyp effects. Models of TF are used to study transcriptional dynamics and sensitivity to environmental and genetic perturbations. Robustness of biological networks stems from several sources, including degree distribution and autoregulatory subgraphs. Results suggest assort provides an additional source of robustness in biological networks and human TF share assortativity that confers such robust.
Researchers investigated how populations of inhibitory (IN) and excitatory (EX) neurons in the neocortex encode stimulus-related information. They recorded the activity of up to 74 neurons in anesthetized rat somatosensory barrel cortex using 128-channel multi-electrode arrays. The study found that individual IN neurons, classified by their spike waveforms, discriminated between 6 stimulus classes better than EX neurons in granular and infragran layers. Ensembles of IN cells provided as much information as ensembles of the 20 most informative EX neurons, but with less redundancy. This suggests that a consortium of IN neurons dominates the neocortical network, efficiently processing sensory activity. IN neurons had higher stimulus-related information than EX counterparts in gran and infrag layers, with sharper temporally-precise responses to stimuli. IN ensembles had lower redundancy compared to EX ensembles of best cells. IN cells conveyed more information about stimulus location and frequency than EX neurons due to higher spikes, precision, and lower adaptation.
Researchers in synthetic biology have been working to reprogram living cells to perform new functions for various applications. Initially, they focused on transcription factors, but regulatory RNAs have gained attention due to their high programmability. However, functional circuits made with RNAs are limited. This study reports the engineering of a fundamental logic unit based on riboregulation to sum two bits of information in molecular concentrations. The designed circuit robustly performs computation in a cell, encoding result as fluorescence amplitudes. The system uses post-transcription control with small RNAs and alloster transcription factors to sense signals. This result shows RNAs can be key in synthetic biology, paving way for complex biocomputers using this circuit as a block.

A genetic adder was engineered in Escheria coli with regulatory RN. The focus was on ribg of translation to implement design. A cell was programmed to sum two bits of information in IPTG and ac molecules, reporting as red and green fluorescence. A genetic system was engineered exploiting ribg to achieve this behavior. RNA has been used to engineer expression in vivo due to its versatility and designability at the nucleotide level. Mechanisms of expression through modulation with non-coding RN and chimer molecules have been developed.

This circuit is different from previous adds as the reporter gene is not duplicated, making it organized and scalable. The genetic footprint was reduced using RN compared to circuits with TFs. Designs with proteins are limited, especially with propensity and orthogonality with host, not allowing easy de novo design.
Researchers have studied the enzyme cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (c-II), which plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular nucleotide pools by dephosphorylating 6-hydroxypine nucleide 5'-monosphates. High levels of c-II are associated with poor outcomes in patients treated with cytotoxic nucleide analogues. To understand its role in resistance to therapy, they screened ribonucleide phosphates as potential c-II inhibitors. These compounds have a chemically and enzymatically stable phosphorus-car linkage instead of a regular phospho bond. Six compounds were found to be better ligands than the natural c-II substrate, inosine 5-monophosphate (IMP). The study of purine and pyrimidine analogues and modifications in the phosphon chain defined rules for affinity. Binding was analyzed in silico and explained by van der Waals contacts, highlighting three c-II residues Phe 157, His 209, and Tyr 210. Docking predictions were confirmed by experimental measurements of nucleotase activity in the presence of best phosphon analogues, which induced total inhibition of c-II at 2mM. The study emphasizes the importance of non-hydroable phosphon bond in designing new c-II inhibitors and hydrophobic stacking by protein residues.
A recent study has found evidence of prion infectivity in milk and colostrum from sheep incubating natural scrapie, a transmissible spong encephalopathy. This is the first time prions have been detected in dairy products from affected ruminants, which previously considered safe for human and animal consumption. Prion protein was found in mammary glands and lactal ducts of scrap-affected ewes, particularly those with mammary ectopic lymph follicles due to Maedi lentivirus infection. However, infectivity was also present in milk and colstrum from ewes with healthy mammary glands and those with lymphoproliferative mastitis. Bioassay revealed prion in milk and colstr fractions, including cellular, cream, and casein whey. In a mouse model, the highest infectious titre was equivalent to 6µg of brain from a terminally scrap-affected ewe. These findings suggest colstr and milk from incubating rumin could transmit TSE directly or through milk-derived animal feed. This raises concern for human T exposure from ovine and other T-susceptible dairy products.
During the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Liberia from April 2014 to March 2015, a total of 16,370 laboratory samples were tested, resulting in 10,536 identifiable individuals, of whom 3,897 were confirmed positive for Ebola RNA. There were significant differences in sex, age, and place of residence between confirmed and suspected cases that tested negative for Ebola RNA, with young children and elderly and rural areas being risk factors for death. The case fatality rate of confirmed cases decreased from 80% to 63% during the study period. Data collection and management were challenging due to malfunctioning surveillance and reporting systems, but laboratories were able to register demographic and clinical information systematically. The investigation was part of the public health response in Liberia and not considered human subjects research, as data were not collected for research purposes but for health response, and were anonymized. Samples from individuals were identified using raw data. Patients visiting facilities were triaged and transferred to Ebola Units if suspected or probable cases. Despite limitations, data yielded important findings about the outbreak in Liberia, valuable for further epidemiological investigations and understanding.
Researchers have studied the catalytic mechanism of tyrosinase, a copper-containing monooxygenase that converts phenol to orthoquinone, in complex with the "cadd" protein. They found that the Tyr98 residue in the cadd protein, accommodated in the tyrosase active center, is converted to quin through μ2:2-pero-dopper II and Cu II-dasiquinone intermediates. To clarify the mechanism, high-resolution cryo-crystal structures (1.16-1.70 Å) were determined, revealing a previously unknown step: Cu movement triggers hydroxylation and syn-anti rearrangement of copper ligands after μ2:2-pero-dopper II formation. This places the hydroxyl group in equatorial position for electrophilic attack by CuO2 oxidant. UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy confirm μ2:2-per-dopper and Cu II-dasiquin intermediates. The catalytic mechanism typically involves quin separation from deoxy and new substrate entry. Crystallography shows Cu movement to Cu-3 prior to hydroxylation, suggesting Cu-3 is functional site, not artifact. A catalytic mechanism toward cadd Tyr98 is proposed, with oxidation and protonation triggering intermediates.
Researchers have studied the early stages of ribosome production in eukaryotic cells, specifically the formation of the large ribosomal subunit. They focused on the first precursor to the large subunit, the pre-60 particle, which contains 30 assembly factors (AFs) including RNA helicases. These helicases drive conformation rearrangements but lack substrate specificity in vitro. The researchers found that Dbp helic, essential for normal accumulation of pre-60 preribosomal in S. cerevisiae, associates with a complex of AFs Npa, Npa, Nop, and Rsa prior to incorporation into 90 preribosomal particles. Tandem affinity purifications showed Npa forms the backbone of the complex. Npa andpa directly bind Dbp and Npa is essential for insertion of Db within 90 preosomal particles. In vivo cross-linking analysis mapped Npa RNA sites on 25 rRNA adjacent to root helices of first and last secondary domains 25 r. This suggests Npa and Db function in formation/clustering root helices largeunit RNAs creating core ribosomal structure. N also crosslinks snoRN involved decoding and peptid transfer center in vicinity binding sites sno on 25 r. Data suggest Db and Npa play key roles compacting core 25 r and controlling sno-rRNA interactions.
Researchers investigated how the brain's catecholamine system, specifically norepinephrine and dopamine, regulates learning in response to changing environments. They found that the cateolamine system plays a crucial role in adapting learning rate to environmental changes. The study used a combination of scalp electrophysiology, pharmacology, and computational modeling to analyze data from 32 participants. They discovered that the P3 component of the EEG, a measure of phasic cateolamine release in the cortex, predicted learning rate and mediated the effect of prediction error on learning. The P3 also mediated the impact of unexpected outcomes and uncertainty on learning. Pharmacological manipulation of cateamine activity affected learning in response to task changes, depending on participants' baseline learning rate. These findings provide evidence for a causal role of cateamine systems in learning regulation as a function of environmental change.
Researchers implemented a syndromic surveillance system called EPIC in two rural villages in Senegal to monitor infectious diseases diagnosed by Point-Of-Care (POC) laboratories. From 2010 to 2016, two POC laboratories were established in the Salm region of Senegal, and EPIC was used to analyze data produced by the Tim hospital laboratory in Marseille, France. The study aimed to describe implementing EPIC using data from the two POC in Senegal. After EPIC, 15 pathogens were monitored routinely diagnosed in the two POC using the same methodology as in France. In 5 years, 2,577 patient samples from 775 patients were tested in Diel and Ndi POC, 739 were positive for at least one pathogen. Retrospective analysis with EPIC generated 443 alarms. From January 2016,316 samples from 298 patients were processed in Niak POC, 56 were positive for at least one pathogen. Retrospective analysis with EPIC generated 14 alarms. EPIC successfully used data from two rural P in Senegal, West Africa.
Researchers studied how cells in blood vessels, called endothelial cells, work together to respond to a chemical signal called histamine. They found that the way these cells are arranged affects how they respond to histamine. When endothelial cells are alone or in a single layer, they react quickly increase and then decrease their internal calcium levels in response to histamine. However, when they are in a network, they oscillate, or go up and down, their calcium levels in a pattern. This pattern depends on how many cells are connected to each other through gaps between them. The researchers used a technique called micropatter and a computer model to understand how this works. They found that the more cells connected, the less often the calcium oscillates. This affects how the cells contract and change shape in response to histamine, leading to different responses depending on how they are arranged. The study suggests that endothelial cells can sense and respond to histamine based on how they are arranged in the blood vessel.
Researchers investigated the role of antigenic sites on the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) attachment protein outside the conserved cysteine domain (CCD) in immunity. They previously identified a large repertoire of epitopes on the G protein in infants following primary infection using whole-fragment phage display libraries. In this study, they evaluated the immunogenicity and neutralization efficacy of antigen sites outside the CCD using recombinant E. coli expressed ectomain, CCD-deleted ectomain, N and C-terminal subdomains, and antigen peptides. Results showed that the CCD-deleted, N and C-terminal subdomains and peptides generated antibody titers in rabbits and mice that bound glycosylated recombin mammalian expressed ectomain and RSV particles, but had minimal neutralization titers compared to intact ectomain. Vaccinated mice were challenged intranasally with RSV-A Line 19, and viral replication in nasal cavity and lungs was reduced in vaccinated animals compared to unimmun controls. Control viral loads post-R challenge correlated with serum binding to particles. Low Th2/Th cytokine ratios were found in lungs of CCD vaccinated mice after challenge. The study demonstrates multiple protective sites on RSV protein outside CCD contributing to a vaccine against RSV disease.
In Drosophila neuropeideric neurons, specifically the Tv4 neurons in the ventral nerve cord, receive a signal from their target cells that triggers the activation of the FMRF gene, leading to neuropeptide expression. This study focuses on the role of RNA processing in target-derived signaling and identifies two components of the U5 subunit of the spliceosome, b2 (72) and Pr8, which play crucial roles in controlling FMa expression in Tv neurons. Analysis of b2 reveals its control is executed through two mechanisms: proper axonal pathfinding to receive the BMP ligand and proper splicing of genes in the BMP pathway, thickve (tk) and Medea. These results show involvement of RNA in diversifying neuronal identity within the central nervous system.

The study describes a cell-specific role of b2 in controlling neuropeideric identity of Tv neuron in embryonic Dophila CNS, achieved through three steps: axon pathfinding, dim expression, and activation of BMP signaling. The Tv neuron requires target-derived retrograde signal, mediated by BMP ligand Gbb, to terminally differentiate and activate FMa. FMa expression in Tv neurons is a model for addressing molecular aspects of retro instructive signals in nervous development.

b2 and Pr8, as components of the spliceosome, are involved in retinitis pigment disease, but not cell specification. This study addresses their function, focusing on b2 and its role in RNA processing of Tv neuronal fate. Phenotypes of b2 and Pr mutants suggest Tv differentiation defects from their roles as splice components. The effect of b2 and Pr on neurons contrasts their roles as essential components of the spliceosome, prompting investigation of specific genes responsible for defective differentiation. One necessary component is retro BMP signaling, and b2 regulates at three points: axon path, BMP reception, and splicing of tk and Med.
Researchers have discovered a new way that the body controls the levels of certain proteins called F-box proteins, which are part of a group of enzymes called SCF ubiquitin ligases. These enzymes play a crucial role in many diseases, including cancer, and their misregulation can lead to problems. One way to control F-box levels is through a process called autocatalytic ubiqulation, where the SC complex breaks down the protein. However, a new study found another way to control F-box levels, specifically for a protein called Met30, which is separate from the main SC component Sk1. This new pathway requires a different part of the SC complex called Cdc/Cul, but not Sk1. This pathway is important for maintaining chromosome stability and protecting against heavy metal stress. It also assigns a new function to a group of SC ubiquitin ligases that includes C53/C34, but is separate from Sk1. The study focused on yeast, but has implications for human biology.
Researchers studied the behavior of Kines-3 motor proteins, specifically KIF1, which transport vesicles and membrane-bound organelles in neuronal cells. Contrary to current models, they found that native and expressed KIF1 proteins exist as dimers, not monomers, in the inactive state. This means that K1 motors are not activated by dimerization with cargo, but rather are autoinhibited by two distinct mechanisms. The study suggests a new model for activation of dimer K1 motors by cargo binding. Both monomeric and dimer forms of K1 can diffuse along microtubules, but only dimers undergo processive, ATP-driven motility. Processive motility is characterized by smooth, unidirectional movement along microtules with an average velocity comparable to vesicles moving in vivo. Dimer K1 motors may use a hand-over-hand mechanism like Kines-1, but this is unclear. Non-specific binding to microtule enhances processivity. Loss of K1 or Unc104 function leads to decreased synaptic vesicles in axonal growth and death, highlighting the importance of understanding kines regulation for correct cargo transport. In the absence of cargo, kines motors are inactive to prevent futile ATP hydrolysis.
Researchers investigated the regulation of seed metabolism in tomato plants by analyzing the metabolite profiles of 76 different tomato introgression lines grown in two consecutive seasons. Factorial analysis confirmed the presence of 30 metabolite quantitative trait loci (QTL). Amino acid contents showed high variability across the population with similar patterns in both seasons, while sugars exhibited significant seasonal fluctuations. Integration of tomato peric metabolite profiling identified the main factor for metabolic polymorphism as the genotypic background rather than environment or tissue. Analysis of variance indicated greater phenotypic plasticity in introgression lines than the M82 cultivar. Heritability suggested the mode of inheritance of metabolite traits in seed differed from fruit. Correlation-based network analysis comparing seed and pericarp metabolites showed seed displayed tighter interdependence of metabolic processes than fruit. Amino acids in seed network played a central role maintaining interactions with other metabolites, sugars, and acids. Six highly regulated amino acids, Gly, Ser, Thr, Ile, Val, and Pro, were identified with strong interdependence confirmed by QTL mapping.
Vibrio cholera, a bacterial pathogen that colonizes both the chitinous exoskeleton of zooplankton and the human gastrointestinal tract, uses a protein called N-acetylucosamine binding protein (Gbp) to attach to these surfaces. Research has shown that Gbp binds to both marine chitin and mammalian mucin, but the mechanism was unknown. Studies reveal that Gbp has an elongated, four-domain structure with domains 1 and 4 showing structural homology to chitin binding domains. A screen found that Gbp binds GlcNA oligosacides. Structure-guided Gbp truncation mutants show domains 1 and 4 of Gbp interact with chitin in vitro, while in vivo studies reveal domain 1 is crucial for mucin binding and intestinal colonization. Bacterial studies show domains 2 and 3 bind V cholera surface. Mouse virulence assays show only first three domains of Gbp are required for colonization. This explains how Gbp provides modular interactions between V cholera, intestinal epithelium, and chinous exoskeleton.
Researchers studied how the immune system's response to tuberculosis (TB) and found that a specific type of immune cell, called HLA-DR+CD4 effector T cells, is resistant to suppression by another type of immune cell called regulatory T cells. This resistance allows the HLA-DR+ cells to continue to activate and contribute to inflammation in TB. The study found that these cells express higher levels of certain cytokines, such as IFN-gamma, IL-17, and IL-22, which can counteract the function of regulatory cells. Blocking the CCR5 and PD1 pathways, which are known to promote regulatory cell suppression, showed that HLA+DR cells are resistant to this suppression. Additionally, HLA+ cells expressed higher levels of Th1/Th17 cytokines, which can negatively regulate regulatory function. The study suggests that HLA+ cells may contribute to disease by compromising regulatory cell-mediated suppression in TB. This is consistent with the idea that TB and other chronic infections are associated with immune activation. The study identifies HLA+ cells as a potential marker for disease and response to therapy.
Researchers studied mice that lack a protein called PrP, which is linked to the cell membrane by a GPI anchor, and are susceptible to prion infection but accumulate anchorless PrSc rather than intracellularly. They investigated whether these mice could propagate prions despite the deviant structure and location of anchorless PrSc. The study found that R and ME prions, but not 22 pr, propagated in GPI mice developed novel tropisms, as determined by Cell Assay. Surprisingly, levels of proteinase-resistant PrSc (PrPres) in R- or ME-infected GPI brain were 25-50 times higher than wild-type. When returned to wild brain, ME pr recovered original properties, but R pr gave rise to novel strain S, which remained unchanged after three passages in wild mice. Both R and S are stably propagated in wild mice, suggesting two conformations separated by high energy barrier abated in GPI mice.
In the fruit fly embryo, the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in patterning the dorsal-ventral axis during embryonic development. The pathway is mediated by the transcription factor Mad and opposed by the repressor Brinker. Researchers used a combination of RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation to study the transcriptional network underlying the differentiation of the dorsal ectoderm in response to BMP signaling. They identified multiple target genes, including positive and negative regulators of the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) signaling pathway. Manipulation of EGF levels showed that it negatively regulates embryonic BMP transcription. The BMP network has a self-regulating property, balancing its activity with the antagonistic EGF pathway for correct patterning. The study found key roles for the Zelda and Zerkünt transcription factors in establishing the expression domain and widespread binding of insulator proteins to Mad and Brinker-bound regions. Analysis of embryos lacking the BE-32 insulator showed reduced transcription of a BMP target gene and fewer amios cells specified by BMP signaling.
In Tunisia, cases of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major are increasing and spreading from the southwest to new areas in the center. To improve current knowledge on L. major evolution and dynamics, multi-locus microsatellite typing of isolates from Tunisian governorates where the disease is endemic (Gaf, Kairan, and Sidi Bouid) was performed during two periods: 199-1992 and 200-201. Analysis of genotyping isolates collected in Sidi Bouid 199-199 and 200-201 shows that over two decades, Leish parasites evolved generating genetically differentiated populations. The patterns of 200-201 isolates from three governorates indicate L major did not spread from south to center Tunisia according to geographical, suggesting human activities source the disease expansion. Genotype analysis suggests Bayesian model approach and F-statistics flows between governor and districts.

Researchers conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of anthelmint chemotherapy and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions in reducing helmin infections among HIV-infected adults in Kenya. They found that deworming with albendazole and prazantel significantly reduced the odds of infection with any helmin species by 89%. Access to safe flooring was also associated with a lower odds of infection, but to a lesser extent. For schistosomiasis, treatment with prantel was protective. Among individuals not treated with albend or prant, safe flooring and latrine access reduced the odds of infection. There was no evidence of synergy or antagonism between anthint chemotherapy and W resources. The study suggests dewing is effective in reducing helmin infections among HIV-infected adults, with W offering minimal additional benefit except for flooring.
Researchers have studied the structure and function of a type of protein called lectin-like bacteriocin, found in certain bacteria that live on plants. These proteins can kill closely related bacteria, including some plant pathogens like Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas species, but how they work was unknown. The structure of LlpW, a lectin-like bacterin from Pseudomonas putida, shows it has two parts: a mannose-binding lectin (MB) domain and a C-terminal beta-hair extension. The C-terminal MB domain is similar to MB domains in plant lectins and binds to mannose and oligosaccharides. Mutations show the sugar-binding site in this domain is crucial for killing bacteria. The N-terminal MB domain is similar but structurally different and lacks mannose-binding site. Experiments with engineered N-domain chimeras from Llp homologs with different killing spectra show the N-domain determines specificity. This bacterin is made of two domains that evolved separately for target recognition and toxicity.

The LlpW from Pseudomonas putida is the first prokaryotic member of the MB lectin family, which includes proteins with two MB domains. Llp is a bacteridal and fits the picture of MB domains in defense. No antibacterial activity has been found in eukaryotic MB proteins, making it hard to identify features that give Llp its intraspecific activity. Defensive roles have been proposed for oligomannose MB lectins in insecticidal, nematic, antifungal, and antiviral activities. Some plant lectins trigger apoptosis in cancer cells and are found in mucus and epithelial cells, suggesting a protective function for MB domains. Mannose can bind to Llp but it's unclear if they're part of the natural ligand for activity. The N-domain plays a major role in target selection.
Researchers have studied the process of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis, a type of bacteria that undergoes a complex developmental process to form a spore. During this process, the spore, called the forespore, resides within the mother cell and is regulated by a factor called σG. However, the mechanism of σ's activity has been unclear. The researchers found that σ requires eight proteins encoded in the spoII operon and foresore protein SpoQ, which share similarities with components of specialized secretion systems. One of these proteins, SpoIA, resembles an ATPase and has conserved motifs required for σ activity and spore formation. They discovered that SpoIA and SpoQ reside in a multimer complex spanning two membranes surrounding the foresore. Without these proteins, the foresore develops invaginations and collapses. Importantly, maintaining foresore integrity does not require σ. The researchers propose a model where SpoIA-SpoQ proteins form a novel secretion apparatus allowing the cell to nurture the foresore, maintaining its physiology and σ activity during spore maturation. They found that SpoIA shares similarity with ATPases of type II and IV secretion systems and conserved motifs are required for σ activity and spore formation. The SpoQ, SpoIA proteins, and ATP motifs in SpoIA are required to maintain fores integrity. In their absence, the fores develops invaginations and appears to collapse.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with bipolar disorder (BD), a highly heritable and disabling condition affecting approximately 1% of the population. They analyzed data from 1,190 cases and 401 controls, and an additional 2,191 cases and 1,434 controls, but did not detect genome-wide significant associations for individual loci. However, they found an association between the power to detect effects from previous genome-wide studies and replication (P=1.5×10^(-7). To demonstrate this result is not a false positive, they analyzed replication rates in a meta-analysis of height and showed associations replicate as a function of power, approaching a linear relationship. Within BD, SNPs near exons exhibit a greater probability of replication, supporting enrichment of reproducible associations near functional regions of genes. These results indicate common variation associated with BD near exons (±10kb) could be identified in larger studies, providing a framework for assessing potential replication combining results from multiple studies.
Researchers have developed a new approach to study cancer cell proliferation by assigning a "Prolifer Index (PI) to each gene based on its expression levels and growth rate across 60 cancer cell lines. They found that genes essential for cancer growth have positive PI values, while tumor suppressors have negative values. Processes like cell cycle, DNA replication, and protein production are associated with cancer, while migration is not. Analysis of non-cancer proliferation across 224 lymphoblast cell lines shows differences between cancer and nonancer, highlighting translation and splice machineries. A comparison across species reveals cancer resembles microorganisms while nonancer does not. Combining cancer and nonancer signatures predicts patient outcome and geneity in cancer. The study points to inherent differences between cancer and nonancer determinants, which may lead to novel anti-prolative drugs.
Cysticercosis (CE) can affect the heart and vena cava, but cases are rare. A 11 patients with cardiac and/or vascular CE were followed over 15 years (1995-2009). Main symptoms included chest pain and shortness of breath, although 2 were asymptomatic. Cysts were mostly in the right atrium and vena cava. 9 were previously diagnosed with disseminated CE. Echocardiography was the diagnostic method of choice, although serology, electrocardiogram, chest-ray, computed tomography/magnetic imaging and histology aided diagnosis and follow-up. 9 underwent cardiac surgery and received long-term antiparas treatment for median 25 months (4-93). One died intraoperatively due to cyst rupture and vascular dissemination. 2 died 10 and 14 years after diagnosis due to pulmonary embolism and failure respectively. One lost to follow. Those with cardiac involvement had no complications and were cured. Only one required second operation. With vena involvement developed PE and multiple complications. CE is associated with high risk of lethal complications. Manifestations and complications vary according to cyst location. Isolated CE may be cured after surgery, while vascular involvement is associated with severe complications. CE should be in differential diagnosis of cardiovascular in endemic areas.
Researchers have identified a protein called Tir in Staphylococcus aureus, a type of bacteria, that mimics a human immune system protein called Toll-like receptor (TLR). This mimicry allows the bacteria to evade the human immune response and reduce inflammation, making it harder for the body to fight off the infection. The study found that when this protein is expressed in human cells, it blocks a key signaling pathway called NF-kB, which is crucial for the immune response. In a mouse model of skin infection, the bacteria with this protein were less virulent, meaning less able to cause disease, than those without it. The protein was also associated with lower activity of immune cells called neutrophils and macrophages, which are key to fighting infection. The protein is located in a mobile genetic element called SCC, which also confers resistance to an antibiotic called fusidic acid, but not to another antibiotic called methicillin. Interestingly, low doses of fusidic acid increased expression of the protein. Epidemiological studies did not find a link between this protein and clinical presentation, but found an advantage in strains with this element.
Researchers studied the development of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and mosquitoes (Anopheles gambia) to understand how gene expression changes contribute to their different embryonic morphologies. They analyzed gene expression data during embryonic development and found that many gene pairs have similar expression profiles in both species. However, a cluster of genes specific to the mosquito's extraembryonic serosa was identified, which is involved in cuticle synthesis later in development. A striking difference was also found in the expression of maternal genes, with Drosila displaying a sharp reduction at the maternal-zyotic transition and Anophe sustaining expression. The researchers propose using gene clustering by temporal discordance to identify genes underlying morphological diversity.
Researchers conducted a study in Papua New Guinea to investigate the presence of Haemophilus duyi and Treponema pallidum subsp perten DNA in asymptomatic individuals, flies, and household items in an endemic area. They collected swabs from the skin of asymptomatic individuals, flies, and environmental surfaces and tested them for H. duyi and T. perten DNA. Of 78 asymptomatic participants, 16% had H. duyi DNA and 1% had T. perten DNA. In subgroup analysis, H. duyi positivity did not differ between exposed or not exposed to a case in the household. Of 17 cultures from asymptomatic, 2 yielded definitive H. duyi diagnosis. Of 10 flies, 90 had H. duyi and 50 had T. perten DNA. Of 6 bed sheets, 33 had H duyi and 17 had T pert DNA. This is the first report of H duyi on asymptomatic skin and H du and T perten in flies and items. Ubiquity of H du in environment contributes to spread.

The study aimed to demonstrate H du in asymptomatic children, contacts of cases, and environmental sources. PCR showed 20% of asymptomatic children had H du DNA on skin, no symptoms or signs of infection. People from households with and without ulcer had similar positivity rates. PCR-positive were more likely to change bed linens less than once a week. Flies outside houses with ulcers had 90 H du and 50 T pert DNA. H du was reproducibly detected in 21/21 replicates. Household visits of patients with ulcers, 57 had H du and 5 T pert in ulcers, neither in 38. Cultures from ul 29 yielded no growth, 71 small rods or coccacilli. Asymptomatic contacts 47 yielded no growth, 53 small rods or coccilli, 6 gram negative tested 2 H du. By exposure, 24 of asympt in group exposed to H du and 18 not exposed had du (OR 1.
The International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee's Curriculum Task Force developed a set of bioinformatics core competencies to provide a framework for training and curricula across various user groups and programs. The competencies were based on surveys of employers and training programs and refined through a multi-year community engagement process. This report presents the current status of the competencies and illustrates their application in diverse training contexts. The goal is to assist educators by providing a conceptual framework for sharing experiences and best practices in bioinformatics education despite divergent needs and expectations. The competencies are not a prescription for specific curricula or standards but a basis for educators to draw upon common experiences designing, refining, and evaluating their programs. 

A series of use cases demonstrate the competencies' value in defining, refining, and assessing bioinformatics training. These cases highlight diverse training needs, user types, programs, and settings. A bioinformatics users require a basic understanding of methods and focus on interpretation of outputs. The competencies provide a basis for educators to design, refine, and evaluate training despite divergent goals and student populations.
Researchers studied the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercalis, which infects over a billion people worldwide, to understand how its development is arrested third-stage larva (L3) is formed. Unlike other nematodes that infect humans, S. steralis has both parasitic and free-living forms, allowing scientists to investigate mechanisms of L3 arrest and activation. The free-living nemode Caenorhabditis elegans has a similar developmentally arrested larva, the dauer, controlled by four pathways: cyclic GMP (cG) signaling, insulin/IG-1-like (IS) signaling, transforming factor (TGF) signaling, and biosynthesis of dachronic acid (DA) ligands. The researchers hypothesized that homologous pathways in S. steral have similar regulation and are involved in L3 arrest. They conducted a deep-sequencing study of the polyadenylated transcriptome, generating 2.3 billion paired reads from seven developmental stages, and constructed expression profiles for S steral homologs of C elegans dauer genes. Intriguingly, genes encoding G pathway components were coordinately upregulated in L3. In contrast to C elegans, Seral has a paucity of genes encoding IS ligands, several with abundance suggesting involvement in L3 development. Seven Seral genes encoding homologs the Cans regulatory TGF ligand were identified, three expressed only in L. Putative biosynthetic genes did not appear coordinately regulated L development. The data suggest dauer genes in Seral may play a role in L development, with significant differences between species.
Researchers studied the effects of two bacterial toxins, Cytothal distending toxin (CDT) and colibactin, on cell nuclei in the context of survival. These toxins are secreted by pathogenic bacteria and humans are frequently exposed to them. The study used mouse models and cell cultures to assess nuclear remodeling in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that CD and colact induced nuclear remodeling associated with formation of deep cytoplasmic invaginations in cell nuclei. These structures, observed in vivo and vitro, correspond to nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR). The core of NR concentrated ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenylated RNA, and main components of complex CR involved in mRNA turnover. These structures are active sites of translation, correlated with high ploidy, and MAP and calcium signaling. Data showed that concentration of ribonucleoproteins within nucleus is dynamic, transient, and protects cell until genotoxic stress relieved. Bacterial genotoxin-induced NR is a gateway for mRNA to be transported for local translation. Findings offer insights into NR formation, a feature of many cancers, not only in response to DNA damage but also to genotoxic bacteria.
Researchers evaluated maxillary bone deformation in patients with leprosy using three-dimensional computed tomography (3-CT). They reconstructed three-dimensional images of the maxilla in 10 patients with lepro and 5 controls, and measured the anterior-posterior length of the maxilla (MA). The difference between MA of patients and controls was evaluated after compensating for individual skull size, and compared with previous paleopathological findings. Three patients with lepromatous leprosy showed marked atrophy of the maxilla (8.6-11.1-17.9mm), consistent with visual deformity and paleopathological findings. The study confirmed maxillary regression described in paleopathological studies and enabled precise calculation of bone defects for reconstructive surgery. Stereoscopic 3-CT images facilitated qualitative evaluation, showing nasal and alveolar process deformation in 4/10 patients. Maxillary lesions in excavated lepro skeletons were described as facies lepro by Moller-Christensen and rhinaxillary syndrome by Andersen et al. DNA M. lepr was identified in these bones. This study is the first objective morphometric evaluation of lepro-induced maxillary lesions. The difference between estimated and measured MA indicates atrophied maxilla thickness, corresponding to bone prosthesis thickness needed for reconstruction. This method may aid reconstructive max defects caused by lepro.
Researchers investigated how the auditory system represents sounds in a way that is not affected by background noise. They found that as sounds travel up the auditory pathway, neurons adapt to the statistics of the stimulus, such as mean and contrast. This adaptation increases from the auditory nerve to the midbrain and cortex. To see if this adaptation helps build noise-invariant representations, they presented complex sounds in noise and measured responses in the midbrain and cortex. They found that the code for sounds in the periphery is affected by noise, but the code in cortex is not. Noise tolerance is correlated with adaptation, so populations that adapt most to statistics are most noise-toler. This suggests adaptation is a mechanism for building noise-invariant representations in the brain.

They measured responses to complex sounds in noise in the midbrain and cortex and simulated in the periphery, finding a progressive increase in noise tolerance. Neuron-level and population changes in adaptation and noise tolerance are correlated, suggesting adaptation drives noise-toler representations. As sounds travel the pathway, responses become less dependent on noise level. They measured how coding in auditory centers is affected by noise, finding a progressive increase in adaptation to altered statistics. By the cortex, populations represent sound in a noiseoler fashion, responding to common features between clean and noisy conditions.

Adaptation to statistics increases along the pathway, populations shift from low-level sound attributes to mean, contrast, and noise-independent information. This is a step towards context-invariant, categorical representations seen in higher areas.
Researchers studied how the yeast protein-protein interaction network, or interactome, changes in response to heat shock, a type of cellular stress. They used Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a well-characterized model organism, to investigate the reorganization of the interactome during stress. The team calculated changes in interaction weights of the interactome from mRNA levels upon heat shock and found a significant decrease in overlaps and connections of yeast modules. The interactome's diameter increased 4.9-fold in heat. Key proteins of the heat response became centers of heat-induced communities and provided residual connections after shock. The changes resembled a "stratus-culus" transition, from a globally connected to multifocal structure. The study showed heat induces partial disintegration of the interact's global organization. This may occur in other stresses and complex systems, such as proteins, social networks, and ecosystems, which may decrease intermodular links, form compact modules, and disintegrate globally. The research provides a system-level adaptation mechanism to environmental changes.
A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effect of amiodarone on patients with Chagas cardiomy, a chronic condition caused by Trypanosoma cruzi prevalent in Latin America. The study searched MEDLINE, Embase, and LACS databases up to January 2018 and included 9 studies (3 before-after studies, 5 case series, and 1 randomized trial) with a total of 38 patients allowing individual patient data analysis. Amiodone reduced ventricular tachia episodes by 99.9% (CI 99.8-100%), ventricular beats by 93.1 (82-97.4%), and ventricular couplets by 79% (0.21, 0.11-0.39). Studies not included in the analysis showed reduction in ventricular beats, tachia, and couplets. Pooled incidence of adverse effects showed amar was associated with corne microdepos 61.1 (19.0-91.5), gastrointestinal 16.1 (6.6-34.2), bradycia 12.7 (3.7-35.6), dermatological 10.6 (4-21.9), and discontinuation 7.68 (4-13.7). Quality evidence ranged from moderate to low. Amiodone is effective in reducing ventricular arrhythmias but no evidence for endpoints sudden death, hospitalization.
Researchers studied the seasonal patterns of deng fever in rural Ecuador from 2009-2016 using medical records from two hospitals. They used a statistical model to determine short and long-term patterns of the disease, as well as the effect of day of the week and public holidays. The study found that deng fever cases were more likely to be diagnosed on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and less likely on Saturdays and Sundays. Public holidays did not affect deng diagnoses, except for an increase on the day after Christmas. School schedules did not impact deng diagnoses in school-aged children. The study also found that climate factors such as total precipitation, interaction between precipitation and temperature, and interaction between precipitation and days affected deng diagnoses. This is the first report of long-term deng fever seasonality in Ecuador, one of few from rural areas, and one of few using daily reports. The results can inform local disease prevention, public health planning, and global models of deng trends.
Researchers have found a way to activate the innate immune system, the body's first line of defense against infection, without triggering autoimmunity or chronic inflammation. They did this by expressing a specific part of a virus, called Rd, in the absence of other viral proteins, making it detectable to the immune system. This led to a long-lasting, dramatic increase in antiviral genes and resistance to lethal viral challenge in mice. The mechanism was found to operate through a protein called MDA and be independent of the adaptive immune system. Human cells showed similar results, with Rd inducing an antiral network and blocking HIV-1 infection. Importantly, mice remained healthy with normal longevity despite massive gene elevations. The study provides a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiral protection.
Researchers tested the independent-action hypothesis (IAH) for a plant virus, Tobacco etch virus (TEV), which states that each virion has a probability of infection and virions act independently during the infection process. They found that the number of primary infection foci increased linearly with dose and followed a Poisson distribution. At high doses, primary foci containing both genotypes were found at a low frequency (<2%). The probability of a genotype infecting the inoculated leaf systemically infecting the plant was near 1, but in rare cases, genotypes could be trapped in the inoculated leaf by other genotypes. The frequency of mixed-genotype infection was predicted by the independent model. Independent action appears to hold for TE, and Ne is dose-dependent for this RNA virus. The number of virions causing systemic infection can be small and approaches 1 at low doses. Dose dependency in TE suggests that Ne estimates for different viruses are not meaningful unless dose effects are considered.
Researchers have developed a new statistical method to study how genes are controlled by multiple genetic variants across different tissues in the body. Most previous studies looked at one tissue or cell type at a time, ignoring shared information between them. The new method, called Bayesian Sparse Regression, can analyze gene expression in multiple tissues and genetic variants simultaneously. It was tested on 2,000 genes in four tissues and showed it's more powerful than traditional methods in revealing genetic control of gene expression at the system level. It identified a genetic variant for the Hopx gene not found by other methods and showed 27% of genes have common regulation across tissues, increasing eQTL detection by 5-fold compared to single tissue analysis at 5% false discovery rate. This method can uncover complex genetic mechanisms controlling gene expression and is adaptable to other systems and humans, applicable to multiple and whole-body phenotypes.

The new method uses an efficient algorithm, Evolutionary Stochastic Search, and can identify polygenic regulation and secondary genetic effects not found by traditional methods. Global expression analysis in multiple tissues is now feasible, but few methods analyze gene expression across tissues with genetic variants. The new method can identify more cis and trans-effects than single marker methods at the same false discovery rate and finds regulation across tissue types. It also provides a list of genetic variants and assesses their contribution to gene variability.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how cells decide to undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in response to external signals such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TRAIL. This process, called extrinsic apoptosis, is controlled by a unique "variable-delay, snap-action" switch that allows cells to choose between life and death. The model, based on mass-action representation of reaction pathways, was trained with experimental data from live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblot of cells with protein depletion and overexpression. It accurately reproduces normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, enabling detailed study of switching mechanisms. Analysis and experiments show that the delay before effector caspase activation is determined by initiator casase-8 activity and reactions downstream of TR receptor. Sudden effector casase activation is achieved by membrane permeabilization and relocalization of proteins like Smac. Interactions among Bcl-2 family, Sm partition from XIAP, and pore assembly mechanics are critical for snap control.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Listeria monocytogen interacts with the placenta during pregnancy to cause infection. The placenta protects the fetus from the mother's immune system and other pathogens, but L monocytogen has a way to breach this barrier. A protein called Internalin P (InP) is secreted by the bacterium and helps it infect the placenta. The study found that InP binds to a protein called afadin, which is involved in cell junctions between cells. A crystal structure of InP showed a unique features, including a calcium-binding site. Cells expressing InP had less force on a substrate, similar to cells without afadin. Monocytogen mutants lacking InP couldn't form actin protrusions necessary for crossing the cell layer, and a similar effect was seen in bacteria with a deleted InP. Afadin in host cells didn't rescue the defect. The study suggests InP targets afadin to help monocogen cross the placenta, contributing to infection.
Researchers studied the proteome of Treponema pallidum s. pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis, using mass spectrometry techniques. They analyzed the DAL-1 strain of the bacteria isolated from rabbits and detected 603 peptides corresponding to 557 unique proteins, representing 54% of the predicted proteome. This is the most comprehensive description of the T. pallum proteome to date. The detected proteins were characterized by their biological function and localization, with half allocated to various categories. Proteins with unclear annotations were subjected to additional analysis. 116 potential membrane proteins were identified, 16 with evidence of outer membrane localization. 12 proteins related to the paralog tpr gene family were found. Protein abundance was semi-quantified using label-free methods. A low correlation was found between microarray data and protein abundance. The study provides insights into T. pallum protein expression, paving the way for understanding the pathogenicity of this organism.
Protein Kinase A (PKA) is a key receptor for the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in eukaryotes. AMP binds to two tandem AMP-binding domains (CBD-A and B) within the regulatory subunit of PKA (R), unleashing the activity of the catalytic subunit (C). The CBD-A in PKα is required for PK inhibition and activation, while CBD functions as a "gate" domain that modulates control exerted by CBD. Preliminary evidence suggests CBD dynamics are critical for gate function. To test this hypothesis, researchers used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to investigate two-domain PKα (91-379) in apo, c2, and C-bound forms. Comparative NMR analyses led to a conformation selection model where each CBD samples both active and inactive states independently of adjacent CBD within a degenerate free landscape. Degener is critical to explain sensitivity of CBD to interactions and high affinity for AMP. Binding AMP eliminates degener, stabilizing active conformation within CBD and inter-C contacts, which require AMP. The inter-C interface is dispensable for intra-C conformation selection but indispensable for PK activation as occludes subunit sites within CBD. Structurally homolog c-bound CBD exhibit differences in dynamics, supporting conservation of structure does not imply dynamics.
A study investigated the role of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (IS15) in macrophages during vaccinia virus infection. IS15 is a protein induced by interferon and associated with antiviral immunity. Researchers compared the proteomes of IS15- and IS+ bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMD) after vaccinia virus (VV) infection. The results showed that mitochondrial and oxidative phosphorylation (OXOS) pathways were altered in IS- MD treated with interferon. Mitochondrial respiration, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive species (ROS) production were higher in IS+ MD than IS- MD following interferon treatment, indicating IS-dependent mechanisms. IS depletion led to a change in macroage polarization. IS- macrophages showed a pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern typical of M1, but blocked nitric oxide (NO) production and arginase activation. Following interferon treatment, NO release was higher in IS+ macroages than IS- macroages, concomitant with a decrease in viral titer. IS- macroages were permissive for VV replication following interferon treatment. The study demonstrates that IS governs the functionality of mitochondria, specifically OXOS and mitagy, broadening its role as antiral agent.
HIV-1 protein Vpu plays a crucial role in the virus replication by degrading the cellular CD4 receptor and enhancing viral particle release. It binds to CD4 and recruits the βTr subunit of the SCβCP ubiquitin ligase complex through its phosphorylated DS52XX56 motif. However, V escapes degradation by inhibiting the degradation of βTr targets such as β-caten and Iκα. This study investigated V's inhibitory function on Em1 and Cdc25, βTr substrates involved in cell cycle progression. Phosphorylation of V at serine 61, adjacent to the βTr-binding motif, triggers V degradation by a βTr-independent process. Mutation of V61 in the HIV-1 provirus extends the protein's half-life and increases HIV-1 release from HeLa cells. The S61 determinant is conserved in HIV-1 isolates. Results show differential phosphorylation of V determines its fate as an adaptor or substrate of ubiquitin ligases. Conservation of V degradation, despite negative effect on release, suggests a role in overall HIV fitness.
Researchers investigated how the development of tissues in the body is coordinated with whole-body development to ensure robustness against environmental and physiological perturbations. They proposed two hypotheses: tissue pattering is coordinated with whole-body over time or at developmental milestones. A staging scheme was developed for the wing imaginal discs of Drosila larvae based on patterning gene expression, linked to whole-body events: moulting, larval, and pupation. The progression of pattern showed alignment at moul and pupation, indicating these events represent milestones. Between milestones, pattern showed variability in response to temperature and physiological changes. Data showed discs from wandering larvae had greater variability in patterning stage, suggesting wandering is not a milestone. Tissue patter remains robust against perturbations by aligning at milestones. This work provides insight into how individual tissue development is coordinated with the body as a whole.
In highly polarized cells, such as fungal hyphae, endosomes play a crucial role in both endocytosis and long-distance transport of various cargo, including mRNA and protein complexes. However, the relationship between these processes is not well understood. This study demonstrates that the ESCRT regulator Did coordinates endosomal transport in fungal hypha of Ustago may. Loss of Did results in defective vacuolar targeting, less processive long transport, and abnormal shuttling of early endosomes. The late endosomal protein Rab7 and vacuolar protease P1 exhibit increased shuttling on these aberrant endosomes, suggesting defects in endosomal maturation and identity. Molecular motors fail to attach, explaining disturbed processive movement. The endosomal RNP linker Up1 is absent on endosomes, resulting in defects in long-distance mRNA transport. The ESC regulator Did coordinates endosomal maturation and provides correct identity for efficient endosomal long transport. Endosomal maturation and fusion with vacuoles depend on functional ESC machinery for vacolar sorting. In the absence of Did, late endosomal Rab and cargo vacu protease shuttle intensively on early endosomes. A link between ESC complex and endosomal transport is discovered, but indirect, affecting mRNA loading on endosomes. Endosomal maturation is essential for endytic recycling and polar growth in cells. ESC components are present early during long trafficking. Did is required for endytic functions and long transport. Loss causes localization of end proteins and decreased processivity of endosomes.
Researchers studied two types of riboswitches, which are molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to adenine, in two different bacteria: Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio vulificus. They found that while both bind adenine, they control gene expression at different levels: transcription and translation. The Bacillus subtil ribwitch depends on co-transcription binding of adenine to function, whereas Vibrio vulus ribwitch can bind adenine after transcription is completed and still regulate translation. The rate of transcription is crucial for Bacillus ribwitch to perform efficiently, supporting co-transcription regulation. In contrast, Vibrio ribwitch can regulate without transcription-translation coupling. The study suggests that the nature of regulation, transcription or translation, has a significant impact on ribwitch mechanisms.
Researchers studied the process of transcription initiation in bacteria Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholera using high-throughput sequencing of RNA 5 ends (5 RNA-seq). They found that a type of transcription initiation called primer-dependent initiation (PDI) occurs in both bacteria, where a 2-4 nucleotide oligonucleotide primer is used to start transcription. PDI is prevalent in stationary phase of growth in E coli, but its role and occurrence in other bacteria was unknown. The study established P as a regulatory mechanism that modulates biofilm formation in E coli and found similar pattern in V cholera. P is detected in stationary phase, not exponential, and preferentially at promoters with T-1+1 and G-1+ sites. RNA-seq and primer analyses indicate P from T-1 and G-1 produces transcripts from position 1. In E coli, P is involved in biofilm growth. The study also found P in pathogenic Gammapobacteria Vibrio cholera, with similar pattern to E coli. coli. P produces full-length transcripts with 5' hydroxyl and sequence 5-UA and 5-GG. A growth-dependent process generates 5-UA and 5- oligonucleotides in both E and V cholera.
Researchers investigated the effect of parental genome imbalance on the expression of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis, a plant species. Imprinted genes are genes that are expressed by a single parental allele, either from the mother or father, and play a crucial role in growth and development. Previous studies in mammals and plants showed that parental genome imbalance affects embryo growth and may be involved in reproductive isolation between species. The researchers tested the effect of genome imbalance on four imprinted genes FERTIZATION INDEPENDENT SE2 (F2) and FLOWERING WEN (WA) controlled by DNA methylation and MEA (MEA) and PES (P1) by histone methylation. They found that genome imbalance deregulated expression of F2 and P1 in an antagonistic manner, meaning one increased maternal dosage repressed growth while increased paternal dosage enhanced growth. Increased maternal dosage also caused loss of imprinting in F2 and MEA. However, changes in P and ME expression could not be fully explained by fluctuations in F2 expression. The study shows that genome imbalance deregulates imprinting mechanisms independent of known regulators. The complex network of expressed and silenced imprinted genes in response to imbalance does not support simple models from the parental conflict hypothesis.
Researchers have analyzed brain activity recordings from electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to understand how brain rhythms, or oscillations, are organized in the brain. They found that these oscillations appear as frequency bands on a logarithmic scale, preventing mutual entrainment and cross-talk. Unlike previous studies, this research focused on what brain rhythms reveal about functional connectivity rather than how they emerge or if they are necessary for function. By reverse-engineering networks, or "virtual brains", with similar dynamics to EEG/ME recordings, researchers found that these networks share structural and topological features with real brains. They also recreated diseased brains, such as epileptic and schizophrenic, with altered oscillatory activity, and found consistent alterations in connectivity and dynamics. The complexity of the network, quantified by Tononi and Edelman, was a good indicator of brain fitness, with diseased brains displaying lower complexity. The study suggests that brain rhythms convey information about functional connectivity, not anatomy, and has implications for neurobiology and disease.
Researchers conducted a genetic analysis of 1,374 Hispanic individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (ESA) to understand the population structure of Hispanics in the United States. They used 60,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected for linkage disequilibrium to identify genetic differences among individuals from Central America, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and South America. By analyzing principal components of ancestry, they found three main origins: Caucasian, African, and Native American, and a fourth component separating Mexican and South American samples. Clustering the first four components, they identified four subgroups: Dominican/Cuban, Mexican, Central/South American, and Puerto Rican, aligning with self-identification. To demonstrate the importance of considering population structure in genetic studies, they analyzed triglycerides in the LPL and TR1 genes, previously associated with Caucasians but not confirmed in Hispanics. They found significant association in both genes, highlighting the need to account for genetic heterogeneity in Hispanic populations.
Researchers have discovered a new role for the Elong complex, a group of proteins involved in various cellular processes, in transcriptional silencing and genome stability. They found that Elong interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a protein essential for DNA replication and repair, to regulate gene silencing and sensitivity to DNA damage. Cells lacking Elong's catalytic subunit, El3, lose silencing of certain genes and are sensitive to DNA inhibitors and damaging agents. Deletion of El or mutations in other Elong subunits also result in loss of silencing and increased sensitivity. El is required for cell progression in the presence of DNA inhibitor hydroxyurea. Analysis shows El mutant exacerbates sensitivity to damaging agent methylmethanesulfate in cells lacking histone chaperone As1 and H lysine acetylase R109. El binds PCNA in vivo and in vitro, indicating a novel role for Elong in transcription silencing and genome stability linked to replication and repair.
Researchers have developed a machine-assisted method to improve the process of manually curating biomedical knowledge from publications, known as document triage, which is crucial for building accurate and organized knowledge bases. Current query-based methods often yield unsatisfactory results and are difficult to generate optimal queries. The proposed method uses deep learning based on convolutional neural networks to classify and rank publications for curation, trained on a gold-standard dataset from UniProt/SwissProt and NHRIEB GWAS Catalog. Evaluation on real-world curation of UniProt/Siss and GW Catalog shows the machine-assisted method outperforms query-based methods, improving efficiency and enriching content. The method achieves 1.81 and 2.99 times higher precision than query-based methods for UniProt/S and GW Catalog, respectively, without compromising recall. It retrieves many relevant publications query-based UniProt could not find. This demonstrates the method can make triage more efficient, allowing human curators to focus on challenging tasks improving knowledge quality.
A study investigated the link between gain-of-function mutations in the KCNJ2-encoded Kir2.1 channels and atrial arrhythmias in short QT syndrome type 3 (SQT3), which is associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). The researchers used detailed computer models of human atrial electrophysiology to understand how these mutations lead to arrhythmias and identify potential targets for treatment. They modified a model of the human atrial action potential to mimic the effects of heterozygous and homozygous forms of the D172 and E299 Kir2.1 mutations, and incorporated wild-type and mutant channels into multi-scale and heterogeneous tissue models. The study found that both mutations shortened the action potential duration and decreased conduction velocity, refractory period, and excitation threshold, and wavelength of re-entry. Stability of reentrant excitation in 2D and 3 tissue models was mediated by changes in tissue excitability and dispersion of action potential in mutation conditions. Combined block of IK and IK was effective in terminating re-entry with heterozygous D172 conditions, whereas IK block alone may be safer for E299 mutation. Combined of IK and IK produced a synergistic antiarrhythmic effect in both forms of QT3. The study provides mechanistic insights into atrial arrhythm with QT2.1 mutations and highlights pharmacological strategies for management of QT-linked AF.
Researchers investigated whether adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) can alter the course of Chagas disease, a parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) that affects the heart and is endemic in Central and South America. Mice were infected with T. cruzi and injected with ASC 3 days post-infection. The cells remained in the abdominal cavity for up to 9 days and most migrated to abdominal subcutaneous fat, an early parasite reservoir. ASC injection reduced blood parasitemia, cardiac inflammation, and tissue parasitism at 30 days. Cytokine analysis showed an anti-inflammatory response in ASC-treated mice. In contrast, splenocytes from placebo-treated mice produced pro-inflammatory cytokines important for parasite control. ASC mice had higher IL-10 levels at 60 days. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed right ventricular (RV) dilation prevented in ASC-treated mice. Injection of ASC after T. cruz infection prevented RV remodeling through modulation of immune response, promoting parasite control and heart protection from damage.
Researchers have developed new analogs of a compound called Retro-2, which inhibits the growth of Leishmania parasites, a type of parasite that causes leishmaniasis. Leishmania resides in specialized compartments called parasitophorous vacuoles (LPVs) within mammalian cells. The new analogs, DHZ36 and DHZ36.1, were found to be more effective in controlling Leish infections than the parent compound Retro-2. They reduced the size of LPs and lowered parasite numbers in Leish infections. Additionally, the analogs limited Leish infection in macrophages with an EC50 of 13.63-2.58μM and 10.57-2.66M, respectively, lower than Retro-2's 40.15M. The analogs also reversed Leish suppression of IL-6 release by infected cells after LPS activation. Unlike Retro-2, the analogs killed Leish parasites in axenic cultures, a desirable for treating Leish infections. Studies validated and extended the structure-activity relationship of Retro-2. The analogs were non-toxic to mammalian cells, suggesting the retrograde pathway is more sensitive in Leish.
Researchers have developed a method to predict which transcription factors are sensitive to the nucleosome, a complex of DNA and proteins that helps organize and regulate gene expression. They found that the Acute Myeloid Leukemia-1 (AML-1) transcription factor, which regulates immune gene expression, is sensitive to the nucleosome within the Ly49 gene family. This was confirmed in a cell line with natural expression of Ly49, where nucleosomes were depleted at AML-1 binding sites in expressed LyA compared to silent Ly genes. The study suggests nucleosome regulation contributes to Ly gene expression and proposes a method to predict nucleosome sensitivity to aid in understanding its role in gene regulation. A whole-chromosome analysis revealed many transcription factors display nucleosome coverage and lack 10 bp periodicity, identifying AML-1 as sensitive in the Ly cluster. Predictions were confirmed in a line with expressed Ly genes showing preferential nucleosome depletion at AML-1 sites compared to inactive genes. It will be interesting to study AML-1 sensitivity at non-Ly genes to determine if it's a trait for Ly regulation only. In a line naturally expressing Ly, AML-1 sites are depleted nucleosomes in promoter/enhancer regions of expressed Ly compared to unexpressed genes, implicating nucleosome in Ly regulation in vivo.
Researchers have identified a crucial step in the regulation of cell cycle progression, specifically the phosphorylation of CDK4 at T172, which determines its activity. Unlike other CDKs, CD4 is not activated by phosphorylation of its T-loop by CDK-activating kinase (CAK), but rather by dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites by Cdc phosphatases. CD4 and CD6, bound to cyclins D, initiate mitogenic signaling cascades by inactivating the cell cycle suppressor pR at the restriction point. The study used chemical genetics to inhibit CD7, the only known CA for CD2 and CD1, and found it prevented phosphorylation of CD4, but not CD6, which was partly dependent on binding to p21. In response to CD7 inhibition, p21 bound to CD increased with disappearance of its phosphorylation at S130, catalyzed by CD4 and CD2. S130 mutation of p prevented CD4 phosphorylation and inhibited CD6 and CD2 phosphorylation of p21. CD7 inhibition revealed indirect involvement in CD4 activation, existence of other CD-activating kinases, and CD-dependent feedback by p phosphorylation of CD4 and CD2 to sustain activation and p inactivation at the restriction point. CD4 and CD6 associated with cyclin D and cyclin1 phosphorylated p in vitro. CD6 was less phosphorylated than CD and its T-phosphorylated form in cyclin D-CD6 but not cyclin3CD6. Phosphorylation cyclin D-bound CD6 was inhibited by CD7. CD7 inhibition delayed CD2 activity due to T160 phosphorylation stabilized by cyclin binding.
Researchers have identified a protein called DUET/M1 that plays a crucial role in meiosis, a process that produces haploid cells essential for sexual reproduction in plants. Meiosis is triggered by transcription factors that activate a cascade of genes, but these factors are not conserved and mechanisms ensuring proper meiotic expression in multicellular eukaryotes are poorly understood. DUET1, a PHD finger protein, is essential for Arabidopsis male meiosis and functions as a transcription regulator. It binds to H3me2 in vitro and this interaction is critical for its function during meiosis. DUET is required for microtubule organization during me II, independently of its function in I. It shows stage-specific expression, confined to diplot. Two genes, TDM1 and J, are critical for cell transitions and spindle organization in meiosis, and are targets of DU, with T1 being a direct. DU regulates microtub organization and cell transitions during me and activates meiotic gene T1. Expression shows reduced expression of 12% of known meiotic genes in du mutant. Results reveal DU as transcription regulator during me in plants and suggest meiotic under stagewise control in plants like yeast.
Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by fragile X premutation CG repeats. Previous studies have shown that fragile X CG repeats can cause neurodegeneration and that CG-binding proteins α and hnRNP A/B can modulate CG-mediated neurotoxicity. Researchers investigated the role of α in CG-mediated neurode using a proteomic approach and identified over 100 proteins that interact with α. Notably, R62, the Drosophila ortholog of p RNA helicase, can modulate CG-mediated neurode. Fragile X CG repeats decreased R62 transcription, leading to nuclear accumulation of H70 transcript and other mRNAs involved in stress and immune responses. This suggests that abnormal accumulation of these mRN, likely due to impaired export, contributes to FAS pathogenesis.

Fragile X premutation CG repeats reduced viability of heterozygous R62 mutant flies, supporting a strong interaction between R62 and CG-mediated cell death. R62 is the Dophila orth of p RNA helic. Nuclear accumulation of specific mRN caused by X premutation CG repeats indicates a potential deficit in export contributing to FAS path. Earlier studies showed α and hnNP A/B are CG-binding proteins that modulate CG-toxicity.

Systematic proteomic, genetic, and microarray analyses show nuclear accumulation of m caused by X premutation CG repeats contributes to FAS, possibly via impaired export due decreased R62. Altered H70 and turnover similar to R62/p mutation. Fragile premutation CG likely produce deficits in export mediated by R62, such as H70. Nuclear accumulation interferes with neurons' ability to respond to stress.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a type of bacteria, forms complex communities called biofilms on surfaces. These biofilms are held together by an extracellular matrix, a mixture of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins. Researchers studied how this matrix forms and its components during bio development. They focused on the polyschar synthesis locus (Psl polyschar) and its role in biofilm formation. During attachment, P is anchored to the cell surface in a helical pattern, promoting cell-cell interactions and matrix assembly. This holds bacteria in the biofilm on the surface. Disrupting P from the surface disrupts the matrix and bio structure. During maturation, P accumulates on the periphery of 3D microcolonies, creating a P matrix-free cavity in the microcol center. At dispersion, cells appear in this cavity. Dead and extracellular DNA are concentrated in the P-free area. Deleting genes controlling cell death and autolysis affects matrix and microcol formation. This provides a mechanism for P aerugin to build a matrix and cavity for cell dispersal. Visualization shows P is a key matrix component, opening avenues for bio-related complications.
Researchers studied the genetic makeup of pancreatic cancer tumors and two types of lab models used to study cancer: patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO). Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PD) is a type of cancer with poor prognosis, and new treatments are needed to improve outcomes. PDX and PDO are promising tools to identify potential drugs for PD. To be effective, these models should match the cancer's genetic diversity and patient-specific sensitivities. The study compared the genetic makeup of 16 pairs of tumors and PDX from PD and metastasis, including a unique set of 5 pairs of primary tumor, PDX, and PDO. A pipeline was developed to score concordance between PD models and human tumors for genetic events, mutations, variations, and copy variations. Tumor comparisons showed single-gene concord across major PD driver genes but poor agreement across mutational load. Genome and chromosome analysis of structural (SV) events highlighted unrecognized conc across chromosomes. Ploidy presented a challenge when assessing copy changes; however, ploidy-correct copy suggest agreement between donor pairs. The study found that PDX and PDO can serve as transplantable systems for probing PD molecular properties, but may be selective across genomic complexity levels.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 19,091 breast cancer cases and 20,606 controls of East-Asian descent to identify genetic factors contributing to breast cancer risk. They analyzed 690,947 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls, then evaluated 5,365 SNPs in 3,972 and 3,852, and 94 in 5,203 and 5,138, and finally 22 in 17,423 subjects. The study found a significant association between SNP rs9482 near the TGF-activated kinase 2 gene on chromosome 6q25.1 and breast cancer risk, with a P-value 3.8×10-12 in combined analysis. Adjusted odds ratios were 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and 0.80 (0.75-0.86) for A/A and AA genotypes compared to GG. Two other SNPs, rs3951 in the ESR gene and rs710 at 11q24.3, showed consistent association in each stage. This study provides evidence for a novel breast susceptibility locus represented by rs9482 and two possible loci in ESR and 11q.3.
A study of 230 Cryptococcus neoformans isolates from HIV-positive patients in South Africa found high genetic diversity in the region, with 50 different sequence types identified, including 18 new ones. The isolates were grouped into three main types, VNI, VNI, and VNB, with 72% belonging to seven high-frequency types. Analysis showed no geographical clustering, suggesting reactivation of latent infection rather than recent acquisition. Comparison of genetic data with clinical parameters found a link between lineage and outcome, with VNB having worse survival (HR 3.35, CI 1.51-7.20, p=0.003) even after adjusting for known indicators and treatment. Phenotypic assays on a subset of 89 isolates showed lineage-associated virulence, with VNII increased lacc activity (p=0.001) and CSF survival (p=0.000). This indicates Cryptoccus is a phenotypically heterogeneous pathogen and lineage plays a role in virulence during human infection. Understanding diversity in Africa will help investigate how diversity is structured across environments and assess risks posed to infection.
Researchers have identified the transcription factor Tec1 as the last component of a newly evolved signaling pathway that regulates the pheromone response in the white phenotype of Candida albicans, an opportunistic human pathogen. This discovery provides a comprehensive description of the pherone response pathway in the white phenotype of C. albicans and sheds light on how signaling pathways may evolve. The pherone response pathway in C. albicans appears to have derived from three ancestral programs: the upstream portion, including receptors, trimeric protein, and MAP kinase, from the mating process; Tec, the transcription factor from filamentation; and white-specific downstream genes from biofilm. This evolution of pherone pathway offers a paradigm for how signaling pathways evolve. C. alb's white pathway is young and has not had time to duplicate or modify components in response to selective pressures, making it a unique example of a new pathway's evolution. The study suggests that Tec activates genes involved in shared pathways with opaque pher response and membrane processes, adhesion, and biofilm formation. The white and opaque pathways of C. alb differ, with the opaque sharing components with S. cerevisiae haploid pher response.
Researchers investigated the variation in genomic GC content among bacteria, which ranges from less than 20% to over 70%. They tested the hypothesis that this variation is due to differences in mutation patterns by examining synonymous polymorphism datasets from 149 species. The study found a significant excess of GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations in GC-rich bacteria across diverse species, but not in AT-rich bacteria. This excess cannot be explained by mutation bias, as it would imply GC-rich bacteria are losing GC content, which is unsustainable. Translational selection and gene conversion are also ruled out, as optimal codons are AT-rich and excess GC→SNPs occur in datasets with no recombination evidence. The study concludes there is selection for increased GC content in many species, and since GC is correlated with genomic content, there is selection on base composition in bacteria. 

The study analyzed 149 species from 8 phyla, 15 classes, and 77 genera with at least 8 sequences and 10 synonymous polymorphisms at 4-fold sites. GC→AT nucleotide diversity was less than 0.1. GC-rich bacteria have a genuine excess of GC→ mutations, while AT-rich have excess AT→ mutations, possibly due to infinite sites violation. Restricting analysis to low diversity species reduces violations: 14 of 25 with diversity 0.5.
Researchers have developed a new approach to map the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infections (STH) in Kenya, using data from 106,370 individuals surveyed between 1974 and 2009. They combined ecological and climatic covariates from high-resolution satellite data with survey locations to create Bayesian-time geostatistical models for each species, interpolating the probability of infection exceeding 20% across the country for 1989 and 2009. Maps for each species were integrated to estimate combined STH prevalence using the law of probability, adjusting for associations between species. Population data was combined with models to estimate the population at risk and requiring treatment in 2009. Results showed high endemicity below 20% in most areas, with areas ≥20% around Lake Victoria and coast. Comparison of 198 and 2009 distributions showed STH decreased over time. The model estimated 2.8 million school-age children live in districts warranting mass treatment. Bayesian-time geostat models can estimate combined STH prevalence, suggesting a quarter of Kenya's school children live in high-prevalence areas.
Researchers investigated the role of innate immune cells, specifically invariant NKT cells, in controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. They found that splenocytes from uninfected mice produced interferon-γ when cultured with M-infected macrophages, leading to suppressed bacterial replication. This control was dependent on CD1-restricted NKT cells, which required CD1 expression on infected macrophages and IL-12 and IL-18. Even small numbers of NKT cells were sufficient to restrict M replication. Adoptive transfer of primary NKT cells from uninf mice significantly reduced bacterial burden in lungs of mice infected with virulent M by aerosol. NKT cells had a direct bactericidal effect, independent of synthetic ligands. This is the first evidence that CD-restricted N cells mediate protection against M in vivo. 

Innate lymphocytes have roles in resistance to infections, but their contribution to Mtb immunity is controversial. NK cells are activated early and produce interferonγ, critical for macrophage activation. Blocking IL-12 or IL-18 abrogated control of replication, showing N cell activation dependent on IL-12 and IL-18. Splenocytes restricted mycobacterial growth dependent on N cells. To test CD-restricted N cells, splenocytes from mice lacking N cells were tested. CD/- mice lack both invariant and CD-restricted N cells, while J/- mice lack only invariant N cells. Absence of CD-restricted cells did not alter tuberculosis outcome in previous studies. Infected macroph produced IF- by naïve splen which correlated with reduced M. The main source of IF is NK and T cells. Splenocytes from uninf R mice, lacking B and T cells but enriched for NK, restricted growth.
Researchers studied how a protein called Bacillus subtilis spore coat transglutase (Tgl) helps form strong chemical bonds between proteins in the coat that surrounds bacterial spores. Unlike other similar enzymes, T is produced in an active form and doesn't need additional factors to work. To understand how its activity is controlled during spore assembly, they found that pre-assembled substrates (other proteins) on the spore coat guide T to its location on the surface. They identified key sites on T that interact with substrates and showed that the first step of the reaction, forming an enzyme-substrate complex, is crucial for T's localization. This suggests that T's activity is controlled by its substrates to ensure proper timing and location of cross-linking pre-assembled complexes on the spore surface. In experiments, T was shown to be part of cross-linked products, indicating it becomes part of the structure. The study suggests that T's dependency on substrates is a mechanism to control its activity and specificity during spore formation in other spore-forming bacteria.
A study was conducted to investigate the distribution and risk factors of Opisthorchis vivini infection in southern Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). Opisthoris vivini is a foodborne trematode species that causes biliary diseases and cholangiocarcinoma. Approximately 2.5 million individuals in Lao are infected, but epidemiological studies are scarce and the spatial distribution remains unknown. A cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire survey was carried out in 51 villages in Champas province in 2007. Data on demographics, socioeconomic status, water, sanitation, and behavior were combined with remotely sensed environmental data into a geographical information system. Bayesian statistical models identified age, Lao ethnic group, educational attainment, occupation, and unsafe water source as risk factors, while history of praziquel treatment, access to sanitation, and distance to freshwater were protective. Spatial patterns were governed by environmental factors, predicting two risk profiles: low in mountains and high in the Mekong corridor. The study provides the first map of infection in Champas province, important for targeting control efforts. Infection is associated with exposure to intermediate host, human behavior, and culture, sustained by lack of sanitation.
In the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the presence of Anopheles and Cule mosquito larvae is common, which can lead to the transmission of lymphatic filariasis and malaria. The study aimed to determine the importance of drains as larval habitats for these vectors. Data from the Urban Malaria Control Program (UMCP) and a special survey in 2006 were used to analyze the types of habitats, focusing on drains. Logistic regression was used to evaluate factors impacting the presence of mosquito larvae. Spatial variation in proportion of habitats with larvae was assessed through Moran's indicator of association. More than 70% of larval habitats in Dar Sala were human-made. Aquatic habitats associated with agriculture had the highest Anophe presence and second highest Cule presence. However, majority of habitats were drains (42%) and 43% (1,364/3,149) of culicine and 33% (320/976) of anopheline were drains. Compared to flowing water, odds of Anophe and Cx larvae were 8.8 and 6.3 (p<.001) times larger in stagnant drains. There was association between vegetation and mosquito presence (p<.001). Proportion of habitats with larvae was spatially correlated. Restoring and maintaining drains in Dar Sala has potential to eliminate more than 40% of larval habitats treated with laricides by UMCP. Importance of human-made habitats for both diseases underscores need for synergy between control efforts.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection leads to changes in lipid metabolism in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of infected cells, favoring viral replication. Previous research showed that DENV inhibits HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) phosphorylation, creating a cholesterol-rich environment for viral replication. This study found higher MG activity in DENV-infected cells, associated with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inactivation. Metformin, an AMPK activator, decreased MG activity, suggesting AMP inactivation mediates increased MG. AMPK activity was reduced in DENV-infected cells at 12 and 24 hours post-infection. MG and cholesterol co-localized with viral proteins NS3, NS4A, and E, indicating MG and AMP activity in replicative complex formation. Metform and lovastatin, an MG inhibitor, altered co-localization and replicative complexes, suggesting active MG required for replicative formation. Metform showed dose-dependent antiviral effect in DENV-infected cells, while compound C, an AMP inhibitor, increased viral copies and infected cells. PP2, MG phosphatase, was not affected by D infection. Data show elevated MG in DENV cells through AMP inhibition, not increased PP activity. Inhibition showed antiral effect in MG-independent manner. Results suggest DENV increases MG through AMP inactivation, leading to cholesterol ER for replicative complexes.
Researchers used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to study the process of tRNA translocation on the ribosome, a crucial for protein synthesis in cells. They found that the process can be broken down into two types of movements: slow, large-scale collective motions and fast local fluctuations. The study identified specific regions of the ribosome that undergo these movements, which resemble rigid body rotations. The ribosome is thought to function as a "thermal ratchet", where random fluctuations lead to large-scale movements. However, previous studies used discrete approximations to describe dynamics, while single-molecule methods can project energy onto specific coordinates. By analyzing the dynamics of an intact ribosome, the researchers found collective coordinates that capture 30-body rotation, 30-head swivel, and tRNA displacements, essential for translocation. These motions were used to convert between kinetic and energy measurements, providing an upper estimate of the free energy barrier for translocation. This framework can be applied to other biological processes with multiple intermediates and states.
Researchers have explored the genetic landscape of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) by analyzing 84 sporadic MTC samples and 36 normal thyroid tissues. They used the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel to identify 101 mutations in 18 genes, with the most common being in the RET proto-oncogene, occurring in 47 cases. Other mutations were found in genes encoding Harvey sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, serine/threon kinase 11, v-kit-Zuckerman feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, mut homolog 1, Kiest ratcoma viral oncogene hom, and MET-oncogene. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and break-ap fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), with 2 of 98 cases positive for ALK. Targeted sequencing identified Glutaminefructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GF1)-ALK and echoderm microtubule-associated protein 4 (E4)-ALK fusions. PCR and Sanger sequencing confirmed the GF1-ALK fusion, indicating an intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion. A metastatic M case with E4ALK showed a response to AL inhibitor crizotin. The study found several mutations in MTC and first identified AL fusions in M, suggesting E4ALK may be a driver and target for AL inhibitors, and GFALK a candidate for molecular therapy.
A study was conducted in Malda district, West Bengal, India to evaluate the role of asymptomatic Leishmanias in the transmission of visceral Leishias (VL) and post-Kala-azar Dermal Leishias (PKDL) in the region. A total of 289 individuals were screened for Leishial antibody, with 185 testing positive, of which 96 had a history of VL/PK and 89 without. 79 were classified as asymptomatic Leishias and 10 as active VL with a ratio of 7.9:1. Among asymptomatic cases, 2 were lost to follow-up as they moved to other places. Among asymptomatic infected, disease progression in 8/77 (10.39%) and seroconversion 62/77 (80.52%) were noted, with 7 (9.09%) remaining ser-positive after three years. Progression to disease among asymptomatic individuals occurred up to three years after baseline. The study found a prevalence of 3.16% asympt Leishial infection, lower than previous studies in Bihar. The ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic cases was 7.9:1. Individuals with no history of VL/PK but positive for Leish antibody were classified as asymptomatic. Those who became seronegative during follow-up were referred as seroconversion and developed symptoms of VL/PK as progression.
Researchers used a technique called Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to analyze genetic rearrangements in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. These rearrangements, known as gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCR), can lead to diseases and cancer. The study found that the presence of a repetitive element called Ty on a non-essential chromosome arm of S. cerevisiae increased genome instability due to increased formation of monocentric non-recipro translocations. MLPA revealed the distribution of translocations induced by Ty in wild-type was random and majority were mediated by six targets on four different chromosomes, despite 254 potential targets in S. cerevis genome. Most Ty-mediated translocations resulted from RAD-dependent recombination, but some non-recipro trans were mediated by RAD-independent between Ty elements. RAD-independent trans did not require Rad51 or Rad59 proteins or Rad1-10 complex. Defects in ASF-RT109-dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 increased Gs and whole-chromosome duplications, and aneup occurred with Gs. MLPA is a technique for rapid analysis of Gs and facilitates genetic pathways that prevent and promote G and ane.
Researchers have developed a new method called Semi-Definite-based Underestimation (SD) to improve protein docking, which is the process of associating two proteins. Docking is driven by a "free energy funnel" determined by favorable interactions near the native state. The SD method minimizes a quadratic function to estimate local energy minima and uses this underestimator to bias sampling. However, applying SD to rotational and translational space (SE(3) is challenging due to its geometry. To address this, a strategy separates variables for side-chain optimization, center-to-center distance, and five angular descriptors of relative orientations. Removing the center-to-center distance improves efficiency, as the five-dimensional space has a well-behaved energy surface for underestimation. This method explores energy surfaces of complexes corresponding to local energy minima, similar to macromolecular association through collisions. Results show the energy landscape is a funnel in a broad neighborhood of the native state, and SD generates predictions with less than 5Å ligand interface root-mean-square deviation, achieving a 20-fold efficiency gain over Monte Carlo methods.
