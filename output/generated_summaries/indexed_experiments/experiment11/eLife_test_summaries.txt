    Title: 
    Abstract: Most nervous systems combine both transmitter-mediated and direct cell–cell communication, known as ‘chemical’ and ‘electrical’ synapses, respectively. Chemical synapses can be identified by their multiple structural components. Electrical synapses are, on the other hand, generally defined by the presence of a ‘gap junction’ ( a cluster of intercellular channels ) between two neuronal processes. However, while gap junctions provide the communicating mechanism, it is unknown whether electrical transmission requires the contribution of additional cellular structures. We investigated this question at identifiable single synaptic contacts on the zebrafish Mauthner cells, at which gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release and where the contact unequivocally defines the anatomical limits of a synapse. Expansion microscopy of these single contacts revealed a detailed map of the incidence and spatial distribution of proteins pertaining to various synaptic structures. Multiple gap junctions of variable size were identified by the presence of their molecular components. Remarkably, most of the synaptic contact’s surface was occupied by interleaving gap junctions and components of adherens junctions, suggesting a close functional association between these two structures. In contrast, glutamate receptors were confined to small peripheral portions of the contact, indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse. Thus, our results revealed the overarching organization of an electrical synapse that operates with not one, but multiple gap junctions, in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions. The relationship between these intercellular structures will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses found throughout animal connectomes and provide insight into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses.

    Synapses are specialized cell–cell contacts where two neurons can share relevant functional information. The exchange of information can occur directly through cell–cell channels, known as ‘electrical synapses’, or indirectly, via the release of a chemical messenger, known as ‘chemical synapses’ ( Pereda, 2014 ). While the molecular complexity of chemical synapses with structurally distinct pre- and postsynaptic components has long been recognized ( Wichmann and Kuner, 2022; Wilhelm et al., 2014 ), less is known regarding the molecular and structural complexity of electrical synapses. Electrical synapses are a modality of neuronal communication mediated by structures known as ‘gap junctions’ ( GJs ) ( Goodenough and Paul, 2009 ). These structures contain intercellular channels formed by the apposition of two hemichannels, each provided by one of the connected cells, and which cluster together into GJ ‘plaques’ ( Goodenough and Paul, 2009 ). Hemichannels are formed by proteins called ‘connexins’ ( Goodenough and Paul, 2009; Söhl and Willecke, 2004 ) in vertebrates and ‘innexins’ ( Phelan et al., 1998; Phelan, 2005 ) in invertebrates that, though unrelated in sequence, share a similar membrane topology that allows them to assemble into intercellular channels. While GJs are ubiquitous and present in virtually every tissue of the organism providing metabolic coupling ( Goodenough and Paul, 2009 ), they additionally serve as a pathway of low resistance for the spread of electrical currents between neurons ( and cells of the heart ), the main form of signaling in the brain, which is fast enough to operate within the time frame required for decision-making by neural circuits ( Bennett, 1997; Alcamí and Pereda, 2019 ). Electrical synapses are generally perceived as structurally simpler than chemical synapses and exclusively involving the function of intercellular channels

Because of their identifiability, CEs have historically been amenable for exploring synaptic structure and function with novel technical approaches. Here we applied expansion microscopy to these terminals, which allowed us to generate a ‘map’ of the distribution of its various synaptic proteins. We found that most of the contact area of a CE operates as an electrical synapse and only a peripheral ~19% is dedicated to chemical transmission. The 4× diameter increase after expansion represented a 13× increase of the oval contact areas and did not alter the morphology of the terminals, as supported by ( 1 ) expansion reproduced the characteristic concavity of the CE synaptic contact area with the M-cell; ( 2 ) the spatial distribution of chemical vs. electrical synaptic areas was consistent with that observed by electron microscopy in adult goldfish ( Tuttle et al., 1986 ) and unexpanded zebrafish terminals Lasseigne et al., 2021; ( 3 ) labeled puncta contain all the molecular components known to form GJs at CEs; ( 4 ) morphometric analysis indicated that the expansion process had no selective effects across the CE population; and ( 5 ) finally, consistent with this analysis, tissue expansion was tridimensional and exposed the expected pre- vs. postsynaptic localization of proteins at single punctum representing individual GJs. The properties of any ‘map’ are determined by the methodology that was employed to create it. While the sentence “The map is not the territory” was coined by Alfred Korzybski to metaphorically illustrate the distinction between brain perception and reality Korzybski, 1933, it applies to the properties of maps in general and to the usefulness of applying expansion microscopy to expose the synaptic map of CE contacts. Moreover, any useful map should not necessarily be fully accurate ( discussed in “Of exactitude in science” by Borges, 1998 ), but capable of capturing an element of reality

A group of auditory afferents, each of which terminate as a single synaptic contact, known as a club ending ( CE ), on the distal portion of the lateral dendrite of the Mauthner ( M- ) cell ( Bartelmez, 1915; Bartelmez and Hoerr, 1933; Figure 1A ). Because of their unusual large size and experimental accessibility, CEs represent a valued model for the correlation of synaptic structure and function. Ultrastructural analysis of CEs in adult goldfish ( Robertson et al., 1963; Tuttle et al., 1986; Kohno and Noguchi, 1986 ) and larval zebrafish ( Yao et al., 2014 ) revealed the presence of GJs coexisting with specializations for neurotransmitter release. Consistent with these synaptic specializations, stimulation of CEs evokes a synaptic response that combines electrical and chemical transmission ( Furshpan, 1964; Yao et al., 2014; Echeverry et al., 2022; Lin and Faber, 1988 ). A wealth of evidence indicates that GJs at these terminals consist of heterotypic intercellular channels created by the apposition of a presynaptic hemichannel formed by connexin Cx35. 5 and a postsynaptic hemichannel formed by Cx34. 1, two of the Cx35 ( Cx35. 1 and Cx35. 5 ) and Cx34 ( Cx34. 1 and Cx34. 7 ) orthologs ( Miller et al., 2017; Rash et al., 2013 ). These junctions also contain the scaffolding protein ZO1 ( Flores et al., 2008; Lasseigne et al., 2021 ), which regulates channel function. The synaptic contact areas of CEs ( Figure 1A ) can be visualized and unambiguously identified by immunolabeling for these GJ proteins, which are revealed as large fluorescent oval areas at the distal portion of the lateral dendrite of the M-cell ( Figure 1B–D ). Immunolabeling is commonly used to define the biochemical composition of a synapse by allowing detection of the presence of specific proteins. We combined this approach with a protein-retention expansion microscopy protocol ( proExM; Tillberg et al

., 2017; Rash et al., 2013 ). Strikingly, expansion following staining with N-cadherin and ß-catenin antibodies, protein components of ‘adherens junctions’ ( AJs ), showed that these proteins are also distributed all throughout the contact area, but in a fashion that is mutually exclusive with connexin. This suggests that the subsynaptic topography of electrical synapses is carefully and intimately coordinated. Finally, double labeling with Cx and glutamate receptor antibodies showed that, while GJs are distributed throughout the entire contact area, a much smaller number of glutamatergic sites are restricted to the periphery occupying a small fraction ( ~19% ) of the contact’s surface. Thus, our data suggest that synaptic communication at electrical synapses results from not one but the coordinated action of multiple GJs of variable size, which may require the functional contribution of additional structures, such as AJs.

., 2013; Miller et al., 2015 ). That is, biochemical data and chimera analysis suggested that ZO1b, one of the two zebrafish orthologs of ZO1 whose function is critical for the presence of connexins at electrical synapses, is located in the postsynaptic hemiplaque from where it exerts its critical function ( Lasseigne et al., 2021 ). Confirming this conclusion, our expansion microscopy unambiguously exposed the postsyn localization of Z1 at individual GJs ( Figure 2C ). The postsyn localization of Z1 is consistent with its role in regulating the function of connex at the synapse ( Flores et al. 2008; Ligne et al. 202 ). In contrast, the presyn localization of Z1 was not observed ( Figure 2C ), suggesting that Z1 is not involved in the formation of the presyn hemichannel. These results are consistent with biochemical data showing that Z1 is not required for the formation of the presynichannel ( Ligne et al. 202 ) but is necessary for the function of the postsynichannel ( Ligne et. 202 ). The postsyn localization of Z1 is also consistent with its role in regulating the function of connex at the synapse ( Flores et al 2008; Ligne et 202 ). In contrast, the pres localization of Z was not observed ( Figure 2 ) suggesting that Z is not involved in the formation of the presichannel. These results are consistent with biochemical showing that Z is not required for the formation of the presannel ( Ligne 202 but necessary for the function of theannel (igne 202 ). Theyn localization of Z is consistent with its role regulating the function of conn at the syn ( Flores et 200; Ligne 202 ) In contrast the localization was not observed suggesting that is not involved in the formation theannel These results consistent biochemical showing that is not required the formationannel but necessary the functionannel ( Ligne 202 ) Theyn of Z is consistent with regulating function conn at syn ( Flores 200; Ligne 202 ) In contrast localization not observed that not involved theannel These consistent biochemical showing not requiredannel but necessaryannel ( Ligne 202 The localization of Z is consistent with regulating conn at syn ( Flores 200; Ligne 202 ) In contrast not observed that not involvedannel These consistent showing not requiredannel butannel ( Ligne 202 The localization of Z is consistent with regulating conn syn ( Flores 200; Ligne 202 ) In not observed that notannel These consistent showing requiredannel butannel (igne 202 The localization of Z is consistent conn syn ( Flores 200; Ligne 202 ) not observed thatannel These showing requiredannel butannel (igne 202 The localization of Z is consistent conn ( Flores 200; Ligne 202 ) not thatannel These showingannel butannel (igne 202 The of Z is consistent conn Flores 200; Ligne 202 notannel that These showingannel butannel (igne 202 The of Z is consistent Flores 200 Ligne notannel that showingannel ( 202 The Z is consistent Flores 200 Ligneannel that showing ( 202 The Z consistent Flores 200 Ligne that showing ( 202 The consistent Flores 200 L that showing 202 The consistent 200 that 202 consistent 202 consistent 202 consistent 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202
Researchers investigated the role of the pre-Böt complex (preBöt), a key generator of inspiratory breathing rhythm, and its neurons that project to the facial nucleus (7) to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity. They used optogenetic viral approaches to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects facial pad activity with minimal effects on breathing, altered by anesthetic and conscious states. The population of 7-projecting preöt neurons consisted of excitatory and inhibitory neurons sending collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei regulating autonomic activity. Modulation of preöt subgroups based on axonal projections is useful for understanding mechanisms coordinating breathing with motor and physiological behaviors. This is fundamental given abnormal respiratory autonomic and oracial activity associated with disease development and progression.

Preöt neurons projecting to the facial nucleus are likely transmitting rhythm rather than generating it. Photoinhibiting these neurons on inspiratory activity is due to collaterals, but cannot rule out possibility they are a subgroup of rhythm-generating neurons with collater to facial. Selective photoin of preöt facial premotor neurons affects MP activity with minimal breathing changes. Transduced axons of preöt7 neurons project to multiple brainstem nuclei, including RV, A, NTS, BC, VR, and IR. Collateral projections from excitatory and inhibitory preöt to premotor have been described for inspiratory and expiratory coordination. Divergent axons from commissural excitatory preöt to H and VR may initiate inspiratory activity.

Preöt neurons modulate circuits beyond breathing, projecting to medullary autonomic centers and cardiorespiratory coupling. Photoin preöt produces apnea, reduces sympathetic activity, respiratory modulation BP, and increases parasympathetic activity. Neurons in preöt modulate oracial behaviors, such as upperways and swallowing, exploratory sniffing, and whisking. Understanding pre subgroups coordinating breathing with motor and physiological is fundamental given abnormal autonomic and oracial associated disease.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus ( PBN ) represent aversive information and signal a general alarm to the forebrain. If CGRP neurons serve as a true general alarm, their activation would modulate both passive nad active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat. However, most prior research has focused on the role of CGRP neurons in passive freezing responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active defensive behaviors. To address this, we examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Our electrophysiological results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP neurons during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, presumably by amplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system, capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception, and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger.

    CGRP neurons, known for relaying US information to the forebrain and inducing passive freezing behavior ( Han et al., 2015 ), were examined to explore their role in active defensive responses. Using a naturalistic paradigm with a robot and other aversive stimuli of varying threat levels, we recorded neuronal activity and found that CGRP neurons encode different threat intensities through variations in firing duration and amplitude. Optogenetic activation of these neurons during fear conditioning amplified the perceived threat posed by the US, making it seem more dangerous, while inhibiting them weakened it. The expression of defensive behaviors varied depending on the type of US: under robot chasing conditions, increased CGRP activity made the robot seem as if it were moving faster, driving the animals to flee more during both conditioning and the retention test. In contrast, under footshock conditions, elevated CGRP activity predominantly enhanced freezing responses. Systematically escalating robot speed to simulate higher threat levels strengthened conditioned fleeing responses, whereas silencing these neurons prevented the formation of active defensive behaviors. Overall, our findings indicate that CGRP neurons act as a general alarm system, primarily orchestrating freezing responses but also contributing to active defensive behaviors by intensifying the perception of heightened threats, ensuring responses are adapted to the level of danger. The choice of defensive strategies depends on the perceived severity of the threat ( Fanselow and Lester, 2013 ). For instance, when an animal detects a predator at a relatively safe distance, freezing is the most likely defensive behavior, as it helps avoid detection. However, as the threat becomes more imminent and threat levels increase, freezing is no longer the optimal choice

. Jaws and control groups showed no difference in movement during light on and off phases, indicating that light delivery did not alter their defensive behavior ( Figure 2B ). However, activation of CGRP neurons immediately induced robust freezing behavior, consistent with previous studies ( Bowen et al., 2020; Han et al., 2015 ). These results confirmed that stimulating CGRP neurons without external aversive stimuli generates rapid, unconditioned freezing behavior in mice. We then tested whether manipulating the activity of CGRP neurons during fear conditioning with robot chasing promotes fleeing behavior or amplifies freezing behavior. To effectively enhance the general alarm signal, additional activation of CGRP neurons was applied at 30 Hz during the robot chasing. CalcaCre/+ mice underwent the fear conditioning paradigm in which the CS was paired with the robot chasing ( 3 s, 70 cm/s ), with CGRP neurons selectively activated ( 30 Hz ) or inhibited ( 3 s on and 1 s ramp down ) throughout the presentation of the chasing ( Figure 3A ). To rule out the possibility that the observed behavior was merely a reaction to the cue and confirm that it resulted from the CS-US pairing, an unpaired group was included. In this group, the CS was not paired with the robot chasing; instead, the robot chasing was delivered within the inter-trial interval. Physical bumping occurred during robot chasing, potentially influencing the perception of threat. To ensure that differences in defensive behavior were not due to variations in bumping among the four groups, we analyzed bumping incidents and found no significant differences ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C; Video 1 ). This confirms that any observed differences in defensive responses are likely attributable to alterations in CGRP neuronal activity. During conditioning, all four groups demonstrated fear memory formation, as evidenced by a progressive increase in freezing levels ( Figure 3B )

. The pinprick caused hind paw withdrawal, and the tail pinch triggered vocalizations ( audible squeaks ) and immediate escaping behavior, indicating the highest threat intensity, whereas the robot chasing prompted only escaping behavior without any vocalization. CGRP neurons showed significantly excited firing that was time-locked to the onset of all three aversive stimuli and maintained this activity throughout the duration of each stimulus. After the offset of the stimuli, neuronal activity gradually restored back to the baseline with a slight delay ( Figure 1H ). These aversive stimuli elicited significantly different amplitudes of firing rates ( Figure 1I ). During the tail pinch, which generated the strongest defensive behavior, CGRP neurons exhibited the highest excitation amplitude, ranging from 33 to 98 Hz, with an average of 58 Hz. Taken together, these results indicate that CGRP neurons represent the temporal characteristics and intensity of different aversive stimuli through variations in firing duration and amplitude. To determine whether increasing or decreasing CGRP neuronal activity would induce defensive behaviors other than freezing, we first observed which defensive behaviors were elicited by either stimulating or inhibiting CGRP neurons in the absence of any external stimuli. CalcaCre/+ mice were randomly assigned to groups and bilaterally injected with either AAV-DIO-ChR2-mScarlet for activation, AAV-DIO-Jaws-GFP for inactivation, or AAV-DIO-eYFP for control, followed by the implantation of optic fibers over the PBN ( Figure 2A ). To activate CGRP neurons, mice received 30 s of 40 Hz photostimulation, delivered four times, based on the observed spontaneous firing rate of approximately 43 Hz in response to robot chasing ( Figure 1I ). For inactivation, CGRP neurons were inhibited for 2 s, followed by a 1 s ramp down, repeated in cycles until a total duration of 30 s

., 2018; Carter et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2022 ) and transmit interoceptive and exteroceptive information to the forebrain ( Bernard and Besson, 1988; Chiang et al., 2019 ). Additionally, these CGRP neurons relay US information to the central amygdala during conventional fear conditioning with electric footshock ( Han et al., 2015 ). Prior studies have primarily focused on the role of CGRP neurons in mediating passive freezing behavior, demonstrating that activation of these neurons exclusively elicits immediate freezing behavior and contributes to the formation of fear memories ( Bowen et al., 2020; Han et al., 2015 ). However, for CGRP neurons to serve as a true general alarm system, they must be capable of transmitting threat-related signals and facilitating the coordination of appropriate defensive behaviors, whether passive or active. While the role of CGRP neurons in passive responses is well-established, their potential involvement in active defensive behaviors remains unexplored. To address this, we employed a more dynamic and ecologically relevant US by using a predator-like robot to chase the animals, thereby incorporating an imminent threat. We hypothesized that CGRP neurons modulate adaptive defensive behaviors depending on the severity or type of threat. We first recorded CGRP neuron activity in response to various aversive stimuli including the robot chasing to determine whether they encode noxious stimuli differentially. We then manipulated CGRP activity—both activating and inactivating—during fear conditioning with robot chasing and footshock. Our results suggest that manipulation of CGRP neurons bidirectionally modulates conditioned fleeing behaviors through altering the perception of the threat

. Our results showed that a robot speed of 70 cm/s did not induce fleeing response during the retention test ( Figures 3F and 5E ) ; however, increasing the robot’s speed to 90 cm/s elicited conditioned flight responses in control mice. Moreover, CGRP activation combined with a 70 cm/s robot speed induced flight responses similar to those observed with a 90 cm/s robot speed in control mice. This suggests that CGRP activation amplifies the perceived threat, thereby promoting active defensive behaviors. We optogenetically inhibited CGRP neurons in animals while they were being chased by the robot during conditioning. During this session, the Jaws group showed less freezing and fleeing compared to the control group. However, the reduced fear responses were not sustained on the retention test day, suggesting that transient inhibition during the chasing was insufficient to suppress the acquisition of fear memory ( Figure 3E ). It has been reported that a square pulse can cause strong rebound excitation following inhibition ( Chuong et al., 2014 ). While ramped illumination reduces the magnitude of rebound excitation, it does not eliminate it entirely, leaving small residual excitation. This residual activity may have contributed to the formation of fear memory despite the inhibition of CGRP during the chase. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings indicate that CG neurons in the PBN play a critical role in modulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying the perception of threat and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger. The choice of defensive strategies depends on the perceived severity of threat ( Fanselow and Lester, 2013 ). For instance, when an animal detects a predator at a safe distance, freezing is the most defensive behavior, as it helps avoid detection. However, as the threat becomes more imminent and levels increase, freezing is no longer the optimal

The final answer is: 

Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent aversive information and serve as a general alarm to the brain. If CGRP neurons serve as a true alarm, their activation would modulate both passive and active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat. However, most research has focused on the role of CG neurons in passive responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active behaviors. To address this, we examined the role of CG neurons in active behavior using a predator-like programmed to chase mice. Our electrophysiological results showed that CG neurons encode the intensity of aversive through variations in firing and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CG neurons during chasing elevated responses in both conditioning and retention, presumably by amplifying the perception of threat as more dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CG neurons reduced responses, even the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand the understanding of CG neurons in the PBN as a critical system, capable of regulating active behaviors by amplifying perception and ensuring responses to levels of danger.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The relationship between obesity and human brain structure is incompletely understood. Using diffusion-weighted MRI from ∼30, 000 UK Biobank participants, we test the hypothesis that obesity ( waist-to-hip ratio, WHR ) is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction ( ISOVF ), an index of free water, and intra-cellular volume fraction ( ICVF ), an index of neurite density. We observed significant associations with obesity in two coupled but distinct brain systems: a prefrontal/temporal/striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal/occipital/striatal system associated with ICVF. The ISOVF~WHR system colocated with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions, decreased glial density, and high mu opioid ( MOR ) and other neurotransmitter receptor density. Conversely, the ICVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors. To test whether these distinct brain phenotypes might differ in terms of their underlying shared genetics or relationship to maps of the inflammatory marker C-reactive Protein ( CRP ), we estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF ( rg = 0. 026, P = 0. 36 ) and ICVF ( rg = 0. 112, P < 9×10−4 ) as well as comparing correlations between WHR maps and equivalent CRP maps for ISOVF and ICVF ( P<0. 05 ). These correlational results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity, whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation.

   . Given previous findings of significant association between macroscopic differences in brain structure and visceral obesity, we elected to report associations with WHR in the main text and report complementary results for BMI as a measure of whole body obesity in the SI. Specifically, we tested each metric at each region for association with waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR ), and identified two anatomically and functionally distinct brain systems associated with obesity, using prior maps of gene expression, cellular composition and neurotransmitter receptor density to refine functional characterization of each obesity-associated system. Finally, we then completed two further analyses to explore the potential directionality of the relationship between obesity and brain microstructure. In the first, we we used genome-wide association statistics ( GWAS ) for brain ISOVF and ICVF ( Warrier et al., 2022 ), and for WHR ( Pulit et al., 2019 ), to estimate the genetic correlations between each MRI metric and WHR, and test the secondary hypothesis that the WHR would have a tighter genetic correlation with ICVF than ISOVF. In the second, we produced brain maps for the association of ISOVF and ICVF with C-reactive protein ( CRP ), a measure of systemic inflammation. Given the pro-inflammatory properties of adipose ( particularly visceral adipose ) tissue we predicted tighter correlations between maps of CRP and ISOVF than maps of CRP with ICVF.

Previous well-powered studies have identified associations between obesity and a pattern of reduced grey matter volume or cortical thickness centred on fronto-temporal cortex and sub-cortical structures. Here, using NODDI modelling of diffusion-weighted MRI data from ∼30, 000 participants in the UK Biobank we have extended these findings to demonstrate associations between obesity ( WHR ) and two measures of grey matter microstucture, ISOVF ( an index of tissue water content ) and ICVF an index of neurite density ( see Table 1 for a summary ). Similar to previously reported associations with brain grey matter macrostructure, positive scaling of WHR and tissue water content ( i. e. oedema ) was most pronounced within frontal and temporal cortices and subcortical structures. In contrast, we observed a more anterior-posterior pattern of association between WHR and neurite density, with more obese individuals having higher neurite density in posterior compared to anterior brain regions. By relating obesity associated grey matter microstructure maps to gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas, we show that regions where WHR was more tightly linked to tissue water content had greater expression of pattern recognition receptors ( PRR ) and receptors for binding fatty acid derivatives, and reduced expression of genes associated with biological processes linked to interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) responses. Interestingly, these regions were also richer in astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells but not any class of neurons; and had high concentrations of some but not all neurotransmitter receptors or transporters tested, for example, histamine ( H3 ), mu-opioid, D1, and 5HTT

. Obesity in turn causes a pro-inflammatory state systemically and blood concentrations of CRP, IL-6 and other cytokines have previously been associated with changed ( increased ) micro-structural MRI metrics of free water ( Kitzbichler et al., 2021 ). So inflammation could potentially mediate effects of obesity on the brain tissue water content ( see also Turkheimer et al., 2022 ). Our finding that the CRP-WHR map correlation is significantly stronger for the ISOVF maps than the ICVF maps would be consistent with this hypothesis. Using novel techniques for analysis of spatial co-location of whole genome transcript maps and MRI phenotypes to optimise subsequent enrichment analysis of strongly co-located gene transcripts, we found that transcripts co-located with ISOVF~WHR were enriched for IL6 and pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ), both implicated in innate immune signalling; whereas transcripts co-located with ICVF~WHR were enriched for taste receptors. This pattern of results is consistent with the model that changes in neurite density associated with obesity might reflect primary brain changes in taste sensation and reward processing that drive consummatory behaviours leading to obesity; whereas changes in brain free water associated with obesity might reflect effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by adipose tissue that drive extravasation and oedema in some brain regions. One limitation of this study is that data was collected at multiple centres and even though we used site as a nuisance regressor there might be unaccounted for non-linear effects. However Duff et al., 2022 showed that quantities derived from UK Biobank scans at different sites are reliable. It should also be mentioned that the age range of the AHBA donors ( 24-57 years ) is only partially overlapping with the participants in the UK Biobank ( 44-80 years )

. In contrast, the medial temporal-occipital-striatal system where obesity was associated with increased neurite density was co-located with expression of transcripts positively enriched for taste receptor activity and lower fatty acid binding, glutamate receptor activity and other biological processes linked to protein kinase C-activating G-protein-coupled receptor signalling. Interestingly, this system was not co-located with any specific cell class but it was co-located with specific neurotransmitter receptor maps including H3, Mu, CB1, and A4B2, meaning that regions showing the greatest positive scaling between neurite density and WHR showed relatively low expression of receptors linked to feeding, appetite, and energy expenditure. ISOVF and ICVF are weakly correlated ( i. e. independent ) markers of free water and neurite density, respectively. Both are significantly and mostly positively correlated with WHR in brain systems. Obesity-related differences in ISOVF and ICVF were coupled ( negatively correlated ) but also anatomically, transcriptionally, and neurobiologically differentiated from each other ( Table 1 ). This raises the question: Could these two brain phenotypes have a different causal relationship with obesity? For example, it is conceivable that the changes in brain water associated with obesity could represent an effect of obesity on the brain, that is WHR→ISOVF, whereas the obesity-related changes in neurite density could represent an effect of the brain on obesity, that is ICVF→WHR. Such a bi-directional mechanistic model of the relationships between obesity and the brain seems somewhat plausible. Obesity is usually caused by changes in eating behaviour and physical activity, which are controlled by brain systems enriched for opioid, dopamine and cannabinoid receptor-mediated signalling. So changes in the brain, indexed by neurite density, could conceivably cause adipogenic eating behaviours and thus obesity

. We found a modest, statistically significant positive genetic correlation between ICVF and WHR ( rg=0. 11±0. 030, P<9×10−4 ), but no genetic correlation between ISOVF and WHR ( rg=−0. 026±0. 03, P=0. 3 ) ; see Appendix 2—table 2 for details. These results indicate shared effects of genetic variation on obesity ( WHR ) and neurite density ( ICVF ), but no shared genetic effects on obesity and brain water content ( ISOVF ). In the final analysis we compared the effects on microstructure of three variables of interest at the same time, WHR, BMI, and specifically CRP, a measure of systemic inflammation. To this end we looked at the pairwise relationships of the maps ISOVF~CRP vs ISOVF~WHR, ICVF~CRP vs ICVF~WHR, etc. ( see Appendix 2—figure 13 ). Given the pro-inflammatory properties of adipose ( particularly visceral adipose tissue ) we predicted stronger correlations between CRP and ISOVF maps than CR and ICVF maps.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) to drive metastatic dissemination in experimental cancer models. However, tumour cells undergoing EMT have not been observed disseminating into the tissue surrounding human tumour specimens, leaving the relevance to human cancer uncertain. We have previously identified both EpCAM and CD24 as CSC markers that, alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin, identify EMT CSCs in human oral cancer cell lines. This afforded the opportunity to investigate whether the combination of these three markers can identify disseminating EMT CSCs in actual human tumours. Examining disseminating tumour cells in over 12, 000 imaging fields from 74 human oral tumours, we see a significant enrichment of EpCAM, CD24 and Vimentin co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour body in metastatic specimens. Through training an artificial neural network, these predict metastasis with high accuracy ( cross-validated accuracy of 87–89% ). In this study, we have observed single disseminating EMT CSCs in human oral cancer specimens, and these are highly predictive of metastatic disease.

    The role of EMT in tumour dissemination has long been debated but, lacking evidence of cells undergoing EMT whilst disseminating from human tumours in vivo, this role has had to be inferred from mouse models and human cell line models. Here, through applying our understanding of EMT cancer cell heterogeneity and markers for EMT CSCs, we have identified EMT CSCs disseminating from the primary tumour in human pathological specimens. Importantly, the presence of these disseminating stem cells is strongly correlated with tumour metastasis. Using an image-based machine learning approach, we have demonstrated the ability to predict metastasis with high accuracy through staining for EMT CSCs. A partial EMT state has previously been identified in an OSCC scRNAseq dataset; this state retained epithelial gene expression alongside expression of mesenchymal genes, and was correlated with nodal metastasis and adverse pathological features ( Puram et al., 2017 ). Now, using immunofluorescent staining for EMT CSCs that retain the epithelial marker EpCAM alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin and the CSC plasticity marker CD24, we have identified single EMT CSCs disseminating into the stroma surrounding oral tumours. However, epithelial keratins are not retained. We have also shown that retention of EpCAM is not on its own sufficient alongside Vimentin to mark disseminating EMT CSCs that correlate with metastasis. There is a requirement for CD24, which we have previously shown to be a plasticity marker within the EMT population even when driven into full morphological EMT under TGFβ treatment ( Biddle et al., 2016 ). This suggests that the EMT CSC state may be more complex than a simple coalescence of epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics

., 2012; Tsai et al., 2012 ). We have previously demonstrated that a CD44highEpCAMlow/- EMT population can be separated from the main CD44lowEpCAMhigh epithelial population in flow cytometric analysis of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) cell lines and fresh tumour specimens ( Biddle et al., 2016; Biddle et al., 2011 ). We identified retained cell surface expression of EpCAM ( Biddle et al., 2011 ) and CD24 ( Biddle et al., 2016 ) in a minority of cells that have undergone a full morphological EMT. Both EpCAM and CD24 were individually associated with enhanced ability to undergo MET, and thus are markers of EMT CSCs exhibiting retained plasticity. We therefore reasoned that retention of one or both of these markers may identify an important population of tumour cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated from the primary tumour in human tumour specimens, and are responsible for subsequent metastatic seeding. Here, we characterise the combined role of EpCAM and CD24 in marking a population of disseminating tumour cells in human OSCC specimens. Staining for EpCAM and CD24 alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin in over 12, 000 imaging fields from 74 human tumours, stratified on metastatic status, identifies cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated into the stromal region surrounding metastatic primary tumours. Using an image-based machine learning approach, we show that the presence of these EMT CSCs in the tumour stroma is predictive of metastasis.

In multiple types of carcinoma, cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) to enable metastatic dissemination from the primary tumour ( Biddle et al., 2011; Lawson et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2014; Ruscetti et al., 2016 ). This model of metastatic dissemination has been built from studies using murine models and human cancer cell line models. However, this process has not been observed in human tumours in the in vivo setting, leading to uncertainty over the relevance of these findings to human tumour metastasis ( Bill and Christofori, 2015; Williams et al., 2019 ). A key complication with efforts to study metastatic processes in human tumours is the inability to trace cell lineage. As cancer cells exiting the tumour downregulate epithelial markers whilst undergoing EMT, they become indistinguishable from the mesenchymal non-tumour cells surrounding the tumour ( Li and Kang, 2016 ). Therefore, once these cells detach from the tumour body and move away they are lost to analysis. Attempts have been made to use the retention of epithelial markers alongside acquisition of mesenchymal markers to identify cells undergoing EMT in human tumours ( Bronsert et al., 2014; Jensen et al., 2015; Puram et al., 2017 ). However, these studies were limited to characterising cells undergoing the earliest stages of EMT whilst still attached to the cohesive body of the primary tumour. EMT must be followed by the reverse process of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition ( MET ) to enable new tumour growth at secondary sites, and therefore retained plasticity manifested as ability to revert to an epithelial phenotype is an important feature of metastatic CSCs ( Ocaña et al., 2012; Tsai et al., 2012 )

. An important strength of our study has been the ability to look at the single cell level in an automated fashion across thousands of fields of view from human tumours, enabling us to observe and quantify human tumour cells disseminating into the surrounding tissue. This in turn enabled us to identify single disseminating EMT CSCs, and use these to train an ANN to predict metastasis.

The retention of EpCAM expression in a sub-population of tumour cells that have undergone EMT raised the prospect that we may be able to identify these cells outside of the tumour body in human tumour specimens, as EpCAM is a specific epithelial marker that would not normally be found in the surrounding stromal region. In combination with EpCAM, we stained tumour specimens for CD24 as a second marker of plastic EMT CSCs, and Vimentin as a mesenchymal marker to identify cells that have undergone EMT. Notably, CD44 cannot be used as an EMT marker in the context of intact tissue as it requires trypsin degradation in order to yield differential expression in EMT and epithelial populations ( Biddle et al., 2013; Mack and Gires, 2008 ). Vimentin, on the other hand, accurately distinguishes EMT from epithelial tumour cells in immunofluorescent staining protocols ( Biddle et al., 2016 ). By combining EpCAM as a tumour lineage and EMT CSC marker, Vimentin as a mesenchymal marker, and CD24 as a plastic EMT CSC marker, we aimed to identify tumour cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated into the surrounding stromal region. For this, we developed a protocol for automated four-colour ( three markers +nuclear stain ) immunofluorescent imaging and analysis of entire histopathological slide specimens, to test for co-localisation of the three markers in each individual cell across each specimen. To determine whether this marker combination identifies EMT CSCs, we initially tested the protocol on the CA1 OSCC cell line and an EMT CSC sub-line that is a derivative of this cell line ( EMT-stem sub-line; Biddle et al., 2016 ). EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells were greatly enriched in the EMT-stem sub-line, comprising 41% of the population, compared to 2. 1% in the CA1 line ( Figure 1A, B and E ). Cells with this staining profile were absent from normal keratinocyte culture and cancer associated fibroblast culture ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 )

     Cancer stem cells (CSCs) undergo epithelial-mesymal transition (EMT) to drive metastatic dissemination in experimental models. However, tumour cells undergoing EMT have not been observed disseminating in human tumour specimens, leaving the relevance to human cancer uncertain. Researchers identified EpCAM and CD as CSC markers alongside mesenchymal Viment to identify EMT in human oral cancer lines, allowing investigation of these markers to identify disseminating EMT in human tumours. Examining 12,000 fields from 74 oral tumours, a significant enrichment of EpCAM CD and Viment co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour in metastatic specimens was seen. An artificial neural network predicted metastasis with 87% accuracy. This study observed disseminating EMT in human cancer, highly predictive of metastatic disease.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Apoptosis and clearance of apoptotic cells via efferocytosis are evolutionarily conserved processes that drive tissue repair. However, the mechanisms by which recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells regulate repair are not fully understood. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a map of the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds. We find that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including resident Lyve1+ macrophages, during inflammation. Interestingly, human diabetic foot wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway genes and display altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor Axl and its ligand Gas6. During early inflammation in mouse wounds, we detect upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR3-independent mechanisms. Inhibition studies in vivo in mice reveal that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but is dispensable for efferocytosis. By contrast, inhibition of another efferocytosis receptor, Timd4, in mouse wounds decreases efferocytosis and abrogates wound repair. These data highlight the distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell detection coordinates tissue repair and provides potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients.

   . We also found that mRNAs encoding efferocytosis receptors and signaling pathways are upregulated in the early skin wound beds and in diabetic foot wounds, and confirmed protein upregulation of the efferocytosis receptors Axl and Timd4 in murine wounds. Interestingly, efferocytosis receptors were upregulated in professional phagocytes as well as in fibroblasts, which also increased expression of a large number of efferocytosis ligands in both mouse wounds and diabetic foot ulcers ( Figures 2 and 3 ). These data resonate with recent data suggesting that fibroblasts can engulf apoptotic endothelial cells to alter their contractility, migration, and ECM production ( Romana-Souza et al., 2021 ), and may indicate a direct role for fibroblasts in modulating the inflammatory milieu of early wounds through detection of apoptotic cells. Growing evidence suggests that distinct efferocytosis receptors elicit cell- and tissue-specific responses. Axl and Mer exhibit differential ligand specificity and shedding upon activation ( Zagórska et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, Axl null bone marrow-derived macrophages are unable to perform efferocytosis with TLR3 activation in vitro, which suggests that Axl plays a central role in efferocytosis in inflammatory environments ( Bosurgi et al., 2017b ). Here, we show that in early murine skin wounds, Axl inhibition did not impact efferocytosis in a detectable manner, but rather Axl expression shifted from dendritic cells to macrophages, suggesting possible compensatory mechanisms via other efferocytosis receptors. Furthermore, we did not detect differences in Axl expression in TLR3 null and control wounds, further suggesting the inflammatory wound environment in vivo displays activation of Axl receptor expression independent of TLR3. Axl may function in skin wounds by interacting with other tyrosine kinase receptors, which has been shown for EGFR, MET, and PDGFR ( Meyer et al., 2013 )

Here, we provide an atlas for the dynamic changes that occur in the early inflammatory stage of wound repair in the skin at the single-cell level. We found that apoptotic and efferocytosis pathways were upregulated in distinct cell types in mouse wounds and in diabetic foot wounds of human patients. Using functional inhibition studies in mouse wounds, our data show that efferocytosis receptors, Axl and Timd4, have differential effects on efferocytosis and wound repair. We found that apoptotic genes were upregulated in most of the cell types present in early wounds, which likely allows the dynamic shifts in transcriptional profiles of inflammatory cells we observed in the first few days of tissue repair. Apoptotic cells are required for tail regeneration of Xenopus laevis ( Tseng et al., 2007 ) and tissue regeneration of planaria ( Hwang et al., 2004 ) and have been widely implicated in early wound repair ( Greenhalgh, 1998; Arya et al., 2014 ). Mechanistically, apoptotic cells can release signaling factors including Wnts and PGE2 to promote proliferation of tissue resident cells and tissue repair in multiple species ( Codispoti et al., 2019; Li et al., 2010; Fuchs et al., 2013 ). Detection of apoptotic cells has also been linked to inflammation and context-dependent integration of IL-4 signaling to activate an anti-inflammatory and tissue repair gene program ( Bosurgi et al., 2017a ). Exposure of PtdSer on the outer leaflet of apoptotic cell membranes acts as a sensor for engulfment in evolutionarily conserved mechanisms ( Rothlin and Ghosh, 2020 ). Our data suggest that in skin wounds, apoptotic cells are rapidly detected and removed via efferocytosis, which is consistent with the large number of phagocytic neutrophils and macrophages in early wounds

. When we compared the expression of genes associated with the efferocytosis pathway between non-diabetic and diabetic foot ulcers, we found a striking increase in overall expression of efferocytosis pathway genes in diabetic wounds compared to non-diabetic wounds ( Figure 3A ). In particular, the expression of AXL increased in all cell types in diabetic wounds, while expression of its ligand GAS6 increased in all cell types with the exception of basal keratinocytes and mast cells. To further investigate the AXL/GAS6 signaling pathway, we analyzed these data with CellChat, which quantitatively infers intercellular signaling networks from scRNA-seq data ( Jin et al., 2021 ). This analysis revealed altered signaling between AXL and its ligand GAS6 between the two groups. In non-diabetic patient wounds, GAS6 expression by several cell types, including monocytes/macrophages and fibroblasts, stimulated signaling via AXL receptors on fibroblasts and pericytes. However, in diabetic patient wounds, GAS6 and AXL expression was more robust in several cell types. Notably, monocytes/macrophages increased GAS6 stimulation and newly expressed AXL to receive pathway signaling in diabetic wounds ( Figure 3B ). To validate these findings, we stained sections of non-diabetic foot wounds and diabetic foot ulcers with Abs against Gas6 and CD68, a macrophage marker. Indeed, we found that Gas6 staining was more prevalent in diabetic skin sections, and that it colocalized with the macrophage marker ( Figure 3C ). Further, when quantified via corrected total fluorescence ( CTF ), more Gas6 staining was observed in diabetic samples, though this was not significant. This supported the CellChat results, indicating that macrophages express Gas6 more highly in diabetic wounds. Taken together, these data indicate that diabetic wounds may activate and modulate GAS6-AXL signaling, and suggest a potential avenue for future research

. We find that early murine wound beds and human diabetic foot wounds significantly upregulate apoptotic genes and receptors that recognize apoptotic cells and that inhibition of multiple apoptotic receptors impairs wound repair. Given the importance of apoptosis in wound repair and the expression of distinct apoptotic receptors in different cells, skin wound healing is an excellent model to decipher the mechanisms by which distinct cells recognize and respond to interactions with apoptotic cells. Given further research into the healing phenotypes of efferocytosis-inhibited wounds, it may be that targeting these mechanisms may reveal therapeutic avenues that promote healing in chronic, non-healing wounds, particularly in diabetic patients.

. While we saw a nonsignificant downregulation of Axl mRNA at 1 day ( D ) post injury, Axl mRNA was significantly downregulated in skin wounds treated with anti-Axl Ab on day 5 compared to control IgG Ab injected wounds ( Figure 5B ), indicating that the anti-Axl Ab treatment reduced Axl signaling in skin wounds. Next, we examined the effect of Axl inhibition on apoptotic cell clearance in skin wounds. TUNEL+ cells were present but rare in both anti-Axl Ab and IgG Ab-treated 1-day wounds ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A ). Additional staining in sections from wounds 3 and 5 days after injury also showed no significant difference in cleaved ( active ) caspase 3+ cells in anti-Axl Ab and IgG Ab-treated wounds ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ). Further, we detected no significant changes to gene expression of selected members of the efferocytosis signaling pathway or common inflammatory cytokines 1 day after injury, indicating no major inflammatory defects ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ). Thus, additional efferocytosis mechanisms, potentially including other members of the TAM family, likely clear apoptotic cells in early skin wounds despite Axl inhibition. To characterize the impact of Axl inhibition on inflammation at 3 days after injury, we used flow cytometry to quantify the immune cells present in the wound bed ( Figure 5C–D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1D ). Interestingly, no differences were observed between anti-A Ab and Ig Ab-treated wounds in the number of neutrophils, macrophages, T cells, or dendritic cells ( Figure 5C ). However, anti-A Ab-treated wounds had significantly fewer fibrobl compared to Ig Ab-treated wounds ( Figure 5D ), suggesting that Axl may promote fibroblast recruitment to wounds.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have provided novel insights into the dynamics of gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues and have enabled the construction of transcriptomic cell atlases. However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and positively identifying the cell types that correspond to gene expression clusters in single-cell sequencing data sets remains a challenge. We describe a straightforward genetic barcoding approach that takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools in Drosophila to allow in vivo tagging of defined cell populations. This method, called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing ( TaG-EM ), involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during single-cell sequencing, labeling a cell population of interest. By creating many such independently barcoded fly strains, TaG-EM enables positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects, identification of multiplet droplets, and barcoding of experimental timepoints, conditions, and replicates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TaG-EM barcodes can be read out using next-generation sequencing to facilitate population-scale behavioral measurements. Thus, TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens in addition to improving the ability to multiplex and reliably annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments.

   . We have developed a straightforward genetic barcoding approach that takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila to allow deterministic in vivo tagging of defined cell populations. This method, called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing ( TaG-EM ), involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the poly-adenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during droplet-based single-cell sequencing, labeling a cell population of interest. Genetic barcoding approaches have been employed in many unicellular systems, cell culture, and viral transfection to facilitate high-throughput screening using sequencing-based readouts ( Bhang et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2009; van Opijnen et al., 2009 ). In multicellular animals, techniques such as GESTALT have enabled lineage tracing by using CRISPR to create unique barcodes in differentiating tissue ( McKenna et al., 2016 ), and barcode sequencing has also been employed to map connectivity in the brain ( Chen et al., 2019 ). Genetically barcoded fly lines can also be used to enable highly multiplexed behavioral assays which can be read out using high-throughput sequencing. Flies carrying TaG-EM barcodes can be exposed to different experimental perturbations and then tested in assays where flies, larvae, or embryos are fractionated based on behavioral outcomes or other phenotypes. Thus, TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) -based behavioral or other fractionation screens analogous to BAR-Seq or Tn-Seq approaches employed in microbial organisms.

Advances in next-generation sequencing, as well as single-cell and spatial genomics are enabling new types of detailed analyses to study important biological processes such as development and nervous system function. Here, we describe TaG-EM, a genetic barcoding strategy that enables novel capabilities in several different experimental contexts ( Figure 1 ). We demonstrate that the genetic barcodes can be quantified from mixtures of barcoded fly lines using next-generation sequencing. Analysis of structured pools of flies with defined inputs suggests that TaG-EM barcode measurements are highly accurate and reproducible, particularly in cases where multiple barcodes are used to label an experimental condition and averaged ( Figure 2 ). Sequencing-based TaG-EM measurements recapitulated more laborious, one-at-a-time measurements in a phototaxis assay, an age-dependent fecundity assay, and a gut motility assay, demonstrating that TaG-EM can be used to measure behavior or other phenotypes in multiplexed, pooled populations ( Figures 3–4 ). We did note that one line ( TaG-EM barcode 14 ) exhibited poor performance in oviposition assays, suggesting that barcode performance should be verified for a specific assay. We excluded this poor performing barcode line from the fecundity tests; however, backcrossing is often used to bring reagents into a consistent genetic background for behavioral experiments and could also potentially be used to address behavior-specific issues with specific TaG-EM lines. In addition, other strategies such as averaging across multiple barcode lines ( 3–4 per condition, which yielded R2 values >0. 99 in tests with structured pools ) or permutation of barcode assignment across replicates could also mitigate such deficiencies

We cloned a fragment containing a PCR handle sequence and a diverse 14 bp barcode sequence into the SV40 3’ untranslated region ( UTR ) sequence just upstream of the polyadenylation sites in the 10xUAS-myr::GFP ( pJFRC12, Pfeiffer et al., 2010 ) backbone ( Figure 1A ). A pool containing 29 unique barcode-containing plasmids was injected into Drosophila embryos for PhiC31-mediated integration into the attP2 landing site ( Groth et al., 2004 ) and transgenic lines were isolated and confirmed by Sanger sequencing ( Figure 1B, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). We recovered 20 distinctly barcoded Drosophila lines, with some barcodes recovered from multiple crosses ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Such barcoded fly lines have the potential to enable population behavioral measurements, where different exposures, experimental timepoints, and genetic or neural perturbations can be multiplexed and analyzed by measuring barcode abundance in sequencing data ( Figure 1C ). In addition, the barcodes, which reside on a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct, can be expressed tissue-specifically and read out during droplet-based single-cell sequencing, labeling a cell population and/or an experimental condition of interest ( Figure 1D ). We conducted initial experiments to optimize amplification of the genetic barcodes using primers targeting the PCR handle inserted just upstream of the 14 bp barcode sequence and PCR primers downstream of the TaG-EM barcode in the SV40 3’ UTR sequence ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). To test the accuracy and reproducibility of sequencing-based measurements of TaG-EM barcodes, we constructed structured pools containing defined numbers of flies pooled either evenly with each of the 20 barcode constructs comprising 5% of the pool, or in a staggered manner with sets of barcodes differing in abundance in 2-fold increments ( Figure 2A )

. It is likely that the strength of the Gal4 driver contributes to the labeling density. However, we also observed variable recovery of TaG-EM barcodes that were all driven by the same pan-midgut Gal4 driver ( Figure 6—figure supplement 10 ). For single-cell RNA-Seq experiments, the cost savings of multiplexing is roughly the cost of a run divided by the number of independent lines multiplexed, plus labor savings by also being able to multiplex upstream flow cytometry, minus loss of unbarcoded cells. Our experiments indicated that for the specific drivers we tested TaG-EM barcodes are detected in around one quarter of the cells if relying on endogenous expression in the gene expression library, though this fraction was higher ( ~37% ) if sequencing an enriched TaG-EM barcode library in parallel ( Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement 8 and Figure 6—figure supplement 9 ). In the future, generation of additional TaG-EM lines will enable higher levels of multiplexing. In addition, while the original TaG-EM lines were made using a membrane-localized myr::GFP construct, variants that express GFP in other cell compartments such as the cytoplasm or nucleus could be constructed to enable increased expression levels or purification of nuclei. Nuclear labeling could also be achieved by co-expressing a nuclear GFP construct with existing TaG-EM lines in analogy to the use of hexameric GFP described above. In summary, combined with the large collections of Gal4 and split-Gal4 lines that have been established in Drosophila that enable precise targeting of a high proportion of cell types ( Ariyapala et al., 2020; Aso et al., 2014; Davis et al., 2020; Gohl et al., 2011; Kanca et al., 2022; Namiki et al., 2018; Pfeiffer et al., 2010; Pfeiffer et al., 2008; Venken et al., 2011; Zirin et al., 2024 ), TaG-EM provides a means to target and label cells in vivo for subsequent detection in single-cell sequencing

. Currently, up to 176 conditions can be multiplexed in a single pooled experiment with existing TaG-EM lines, but because sequencing indices can be added after amplification in a separate indexing PCR step, many hundreds or even thousands of such experiments can be multiplexed in a single-sequencing run. While the utility of TaG-EM barcode-based quantification will vary based on the number of conditions being analyzed and the ease of quantifying the behavior or phenotype by other means, we demonstrate that TaG-EM can be employed to cost-effectively streamline labor-intensive behavioral assays such as photaxis, fecundity, and motility.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Understanding the origins of novel, complex phenotypes is a major goal in evolutionary biology. Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the novel ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times. However, taxon sampling for alkaloids has been biased towards colorful species, without similar attention paid to inconspicuous ones that are often assumed to be undefended. As a result, our understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group is incomplete. Here, we provide new data showing that, in contrast to previous studies, species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids. We confirm that undefended dendrobatids regularly consume mites and ants, which are known sources of alkaloids. Thus, our data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. Our data support the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration — passive accumulation — that differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation. We discuss the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms. In light of ideas from pharmacokinetics, we incorporate new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and provide insight into the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins.

   . Some appear to lack specific transport and storage mechanisms for consumed alkaloids ( ‘sequestration’ ), yet they have detectable levels of alkaloids in their skin; we refer to this phenotype as passive accumulation and suggest that it is an evolutionary intermediate between toxin consumption ( with no sequestration ) and sequestration ( Figure 3 ). We predict that the ancestral state of poison frogs and potentially other clades with alkaloid-sequestering species ( e. g. Bufonidae: Melanophryniscus, Eleutherodactylidae: Eleutherodactylus, and Mantellidae: Mantella ) is alkaloid consumption and low levels of alkaloid resistance, accompanied by passive alkaloid accumulation ( e. g. see Figures 1 and 3 ). Alternatively, passive accumulation may have arisen in an even earlier ancestor. That we detected alkaloids in two genera of bufonid toads could reflect a single origin of passive accumulation in the ancestor of the clade that includes Dendrobatidae and its sister group ( the clade comprised of the Terranana [including Eleutherodactylidae], Bufonidae, Leptodactylidae, and Odontophrynidae; AmphibiaWeb, 2023; Blackburn and Wake, 2011; Feng et al., 2017; Streicher et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2019 ). Further sampling for alkaloids within Eleutherodactylidae and Leptodactylidae could reveal whether passive accumulation has persisted in these clades. Discriminating a single origin — no matter the timing — from multiple ones would require more extensive alkaloid surveys, as we only assessed four non-dendrobatid species. Here, we propose and discuss three additional predictions arising from the passive-accumulation hypothesis that would help further evaluate the validity of a four-phase model. Many animals occasionally or frequently consume toxins, and a multitude have evolved toxin resistance. Some invertebrate pests resist pesticides ( Andreev et al., 1999; Chiu et al., 2008; Daborn et al

., 2014; Santos et al., 2003 ), making them a suitable group to study complex phenotypic transitions like the evolution of chemical defense. In total, we surveyed 104 animals representing 32 species of Neotropical frogs including 28 dendrobatid species, 2 bufonids, 1 leptodactylid, and 1 eleutherodactylid ( see Methods ). Each of the major undefended clades in Dendrobatidae ( Figure 1, Table 1 ) is represented in our dataset, with a total of 14 undefended dendrobatid species surveyed. Next, we review old and new evidence from poison frogs in the context of the four-phase model ( Phases 1 and 2: Consistent exposure to toxins may select for resistance in poison frog and Phases 3 and 4: Evidence for passive accumulation and sequestration in poison frogs ). Then we describe major predictions that need further testing to validate and/or revise the proposed model ( Predictions arising from the passive-accumulation hypothesis ). Finally, we discuss other factors that might influence the evolution of chemical defenses ( Other factors that may shape the evolution of acquired chemical defenses ), the passive accumulation phenotype in a broader evolutionary context ( The passive-accumulation phenotype in a broader evolutionary context ), and possible limitations of this study ( Limitations ). Overall, we propose that further integrating ideas from pharmacokinetics into studies of acquired chemical defenses will lead to new insight in the field, with clear applications to human and ecosystem health. In that vein, we suggest that evolutionary changes in toxin resistance and metabolism are critical physiological shifts that facilitate origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals.

., 2023 ) and saxiphilin ( Abderemane-Ali et al., 2021 ) that might prevent alkaloids from accessing their molecular targets ( e. g. ion channels ). Other mechanisms may also exist. For example, poison frogs may biotransform alkaloids into less toxic forms until they can be eliminated from the body, for example using cytochrome p450s ( Caty et al., 2019 ). The mechanism of resistance employed might differ between undefended and defended species, but more research is necessary to understand these patterns. Although more data are necessary to understand the evolution of toxin resistance in dendrobatids ( Coleman and Cannatella, 2024 ), existing data suggest that all or nearly all dendrobatids are exposed to alkaloids ( Figure 2 ) and that alkaloid resistance varies among lineages. To understand the major evolutionary transition from consuming to sequestering toxins, it is essential to characterize the metabolism and sequestration of alkaloids in defended and undefended dendrobatid lineages ( Gonzalez and Carazzone, 2023 ). However, many of the undefended lineages have not been carefully evaluated for the presence or absence of chemical defense. By reviewing existing data, we found that only 31 of the 245 inconspicuous poison frog species described to date AmphibiaWeb, 2023 have been assessed for toxins, sometimes using methods that would not necessarily detect lipophilic alkaloids ( Supplementary file 2 ). Further, prior studies have sometimes misinterpreted or not fully incorporated these data ( Supplementary file 2, and see below ). Our review and reassessment of these studies suggest that at least 11 undefended species might have lipophilic alkaloids: Allobates femoralis, Allobates kingsburyi, Allobates zaparo, Colostethus ucumari, H. elachyhistus, Hyloxalus nexipus, Hyloxalus vertebralis, Hyloxalus yasuni, Leucostethus fugax, Paruwrobates erythromos, and Silverstoneia punctiventris ( Daly et al., 1987; Darst et al

., 2003 ). The new information helped generate the diet-toxicity hypothesis, which posits that shifts from a generalist to a specialist diet are correlated with origins of alkaloid uptake ( Darst et al., 2005; Santos and Cannatella, 2011 ). Since then, many studies have focused on the diet of poison frogs in an effort to directly connect diet with chemical defense in specific species ( e. g. McGugan et al., 2016; Osorio et al., 2015; Sanches et al., 2023; Sánchez-Loja et al., 2024 ) and to identify sources of poison frog alkaloids ( e. g. Saporito et al., 2007b; Saporito et al., 2004 ). In general, most of the studies of poison-frog ecology since the 1990s emphasize or assume that diet is a primary determinant of defense. Although in the 1990s Daly and his colleagues proposed that an alkaloid uptake system was present in the ancestor of Dendrobatidae and is overexpressed in aposematic species ( Daly, 1998; Daly et al., 1994b; Saporito et al., 2009 ), no details about this purported system were given, and little focus was placed on the physiological processes of alkaloid sequestration in poison frogs for nearly 20 years. Santos et al., 2016 noted that the study of acquired chemical defenses is ‘essentially a study in pharmacokinetics’. Pharmacokinetics ( or toxicokinetics, for toxins; Spurgeon et al., 2020 ) is the study of how bioactive compounds are processed by animals. Organismal processes are often binned into four categories together known as ADME, which stands for Absorption, or movement into the bloodstream, Distribution, or movement into and out of body compartments, Metabolism, or biotransformation of the compound, and Excretion, or elimination from the body ( Ruiz-Garcia et al,202 ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) contributes significantly to chemotherapy resistance and remains a critical challenge in treating advanced breast cancer. The complexity of EMT, involving redundant pro-EMT signaling pathways and its paradox reversal process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition ( MET ), has hindered the development of effective treatments. In this study, we utilized a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) to comprehensively analyze the EMT status of tumor cells. Our findings revealed elevated ribosome biogenesis ( RiBi ) during the transitioning phases of both EMT and MET processes. RiBi and its subsequent nascent protein synthesis mediated by ERK and mTOR signalings are essential for EMT/MET completion. Importantly, inhibiting excessive RiBi genetically or pharmacologically impaired the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells. Combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells under chemotherapies. Our study suggests that targeting the RiBi pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer.

   . Patient samples with a score >1 were denoted as RiBiHigh, while patients with a score <0. 5 were denoted as RiBiLow. The analyses of the survival data showed a significantly worse prognosis in the RiBiHigh group compared to the RiBiLow group ( Figure 6—figure supplement 4 ). In summary, these results suggest that inhibition of RiBi activities diminished EMT/MET transitioning capability of tumor cells. In combination with chemotherapy drugs, RiBi inhibition significantly reduced the outgrowth of chemoresistant metastasis. These results suggested that targeting the RiBi-mediated EMT/MET process may provide a more effective therapeutic strategy for advanced breast cancer.

. Interestingly, most tumor cells under BMH21 treatment kept their EMT phenotypes as RFP+/Epcam+ or GFP+/Epcam- ( Figure 6C ), indicating the impaired EMT/MET transitioning by RiBi inhibition. Importantly, the combination of BMH21 and CTX eliminated most tumor cells including both RFP + and GFP + cells, and significantly inhibited the outgrowth of metastatic nodules under chemotherapy ( Figure 6B and C ). We further established an experimental lung metastasis model with human breast cancer cells ( MDA-MB231-LM2 ). The LM2 cells predominantly exhibited a mesenchymal phenotype in vitro and gained Ecad expression during the outgrowth of lung nodules in vivo ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ), indicating the involvement of the MET process. Consistent with the Tri-PyMT model, BMH21 synergized with CTX, leading to a significantly lower metastatic LM2 tumor burden than the mock or mono-treatment groups ( Figure 6D ). To further investigate the potential association of RiBi activity with EMT status of tumor cells in human breast cancer, we analyzed scRNA-seq data of primary tumor cells from two breast cancer patients ( GSE 198745 ). A trend of relatively higher RiBi activity was detected in tumor cells with lower EMT pseudotime ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ). Interestingly, a pattern showing the highest RiBi activity in EMT/MET transitioning phase was detected in the sample of patient B ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3F ), indicating the similar role of RiBi upregulation in EMT status of breast cancer patients. To examine whether RiBi activity is associated with clinical outcomes of breast cancer patients, we analyze the RNAseq data in cBioPortal databases ( https://www. cbioportal. org ), including the TCGA PanCancer Atlas ( 1084 samples ) and METABRIC ( 2500 samples ). RiBi activities of tumors were quantified by the average z-scores of genes in the RiBi pathway ( 303 genes )

Targeting EMT for cancer therapy has been challenging due to the complexity of the EMT process and controversies of promoting MET which also favors tumor progression. Using the EMT-lineage-tracing model, we found an upregulation of the RiBi pathway at the transitioning phase of both EMT and MET ( Figure 7 ). The transient activation of the RiBi pathway during the EMT process has been reported previously. Prakash et al. found that elevated rRNA synthesis/RiBi pathway was concomitant with cell cycle arrest induced by TGFβ, fueling the EMT program in breast tumor cells ( Prakash et al., 2019 ). Using the Tri-PyMT model, we found that the EMT transitioning ( Doub+ ) cells had higher percentages of cells in the S and G2/M phases compared to the RFP + and GFP + cells. This is inconsistent with the observation that RiBi activity was higher in G1-arrested cells treated with TGFβ ( Prakash et al., 2019 ). This discrepancy may be due to the different EMT stimuli used in the experiment systems. Additionally, further investigations are needed to determine whether a cell could complete the EMT process within a single cell cycle or requires multiple cell divisions. A more recent study identified a subpopulation of circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) in which high RiBi activities persisted to maintain their high metastatic potentials ( Ebright et al., 2020 ). Interestingly, the RiBi activity was associated with epithelial phenotypes rather than mesenchymal ones in CTCs ( Ebright et al., 2020 ). Indeed, EMT induction by TGFβ primarily suppressed ribosome gene expression and global translational activity ( Ebright et al., 2020 ). By employing our unique EMT-lineage-tracing model, we discovered that the RiBi pathway was transiently elevated during the transitioning phases of EMT/MET program. The enhanced activation of the RiBi pathway diminished as tumor cells accomplished phenotype changes

. Together, these results suggested that the upregulated RiBi pathway is equally needed for mesenchymal tumor cells to undergo MET during their outgrowth in the lungs. Ribosome biogenesis was recognized as a crucial factor in cancer pathogenesis a century ago ( Pelletier et al., 2018 ). To further investigate the signaling pathways responsible for RiBi upregulation in the EMT/MET process, we sorted RFP+, Doub+, and GFP+ Tri-PyMT cells and probed the signaling activations in these cells. In response to serum stimulation, Doub+ cells exhibited significantly higher levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( p-ERK ) and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 ( p-mTORC1 ) compared to either RFP+ or GFP+ cells ( Figure 3A ). The phosphorylation of Rps6, an essential ribosome protein of the 40 S subunit, is regulated by synergistic crosstalk between mTORC1 and ERK signaling ( Roux et al., 2007; Biever et al., 2015 ). We thus explored the status of p-Rps6 and observed a significantly higher level of p-Rps6 in Doub+ cells ( Figure 3A ). These results imply a connection between differential signaling transductions and ribosome activities in EMT transitioning phase cells. The primary function of ribosomes is to synthesize proteins to support essential biological functions ( Ruvinsky and Meyuhas, 2006 ). Indeed, enhanced ribosome activity in Doub+ cells translated into distinct phenotypes in cell growth and nascent protein synthesis. Flow cytometry analysis showed that Doub+ cells possessed enlarged cell sizes compared to RFP+ or GFP+ cells ( Figure 3B ). Using the O-propargyl-puromycin ( OPP ) incorporation assay, we found that Doub+ cells exhibited an increased rate of nascent protein synthesis ( Figure 3C ). Another hallmark of ribosome activity is rRNA transcription, which occurs in nucleoli. By immunostaining Fibrillarin, a nucleolar marker ( Ochs et al

., 1985 ), we found that the Doub+ cells had significantly more nucleoli compared to cells in epithelial ( RFP+ ) and mesenchymal ( GFP+ ) states ( Figure 3D ). Consistently, using the EU incorporation assay, we found significantly higher transcription activity in Doub+ cells than in RFP + and GFP + cells ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). Collectively, these results suggest that the elevation of the RiBi pathway in cells at the EMT transitioning phase is associated with aberrant activation of ERK and mTOR signalings, which may, in turn, confer nascent protein synthesis capability to tumor cells for completing phenotypic changes. The transcription of ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) is mediated by RNA polymerase I ( Pol I ) in eukaryotic cells ( Moss and Stefanovsky, 2002 ). Small molecules such as BMH21 and CX5461 are specific Pol I inhibitors, which inhibit rRNA transcription and disrupt ribosome assembly ( Haddach et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2018 ), providing a specific RiBi targeting strategy. We then evaluated whether these Pol I inhibitors would affect the EMT/MET process. Fluorescence switches from RFP + to GFP + of TriPyMT cells were employed to investigate the impact of Pol I inhibitors on EMT ( Figure 4 ). In the presence of BM21 or CX1, the RFP+ cells failed to undergo EMT to GFP+ ( Figure 4A ), indicating impaired EMT transitioning by RiBi inhibition. Furthermore, the combination of BM21 and CT eliminated RFP and GFP cells and significantly reduced metastatic outgrowth ( Figure 4B and C ). These results suggest that targeting the Ri pathway is a promising strategy for treating advanced breast cancer, especially when combined with chemotherapies.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Seedling root traits impact plant establishment under challenging environments. Pearl millet is one of the most heat and drought tolerant cereal crops that provides a vital food source across the sub-Saharan Sahel region. Pearl millet’s early root system features a single fast-growing primary root which we hypothesize is an adaptation to the Sahelian climate. Using crop modeling, we demonstrate that early drought stress is an important constraint in agrosystems in the Sahel where pearl millet was domesticated. Furthermore, we show that increased pearl millet primary root growth is correlated with increased early water stress tolerance in field conditions. Genetics including genome-wide association study and quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) approaches identify genomic regions controlling this key root trait. Combining gene expression data, re-sequencing and re-annotation of one of these genomic regions identified a glutaredoxin-encoding gene PgGRXC9 as the candidate stress resilience root growth regulator. Functional characterization of its closest Arabidopsis homolog AtROXY19 revealed a novel role for this glutaredoxin ( GRX ) gene clade in regulating cell elongation. In summary, our study suggests a conserved function for GRX genes in conferring root cell elongation and enhancing resilience of pearl millet to its Sahelian environment.

   ., 2009 ). Pearl millet embryonic root system development is characterized by the formation of a fast-growing primary root that is the only architectural component of the root system for the first 6 days after germination ( DAG ) ( Passot et al., 2016 ). No seminal roots are present in pearl millet and crown and lateral roots were only observed 6 DAG ( Passot et al., 2016 ). We hypothesized that the fast-growing primary root might be an adaptation to the Sahelian environment ( Passot et al., 2016 ). Here, we show that early drought stress after germination is a major constraint in Sahelian environments and that primary root growth is correlated with increased tolerance to this stress under field conditions in pearl millet. Differences in root growth seem to be mainly regulated by changes in cell elongation. A combination of genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) and bulk segregant analysis ( BSA ) on a bi-parental population identified one genomic region controlling this trait. Combining RNAseq, re-sequencing, and re-annotation of this region, we identified a glutaredoxin-encoding gene, PgGRXC9 as a potential candidate regulator. Functional characterization of the closest homolog in Arabidopsis reveals a new role for GRX in the regulation of root growth through cell elongation in the root apical meristem.

. The crop faced early stress at a frequency of 24% over the 21 years, which resulted in an average 43% grain yield penalty compared to years without stress. Biomass production ( an important source of fodder for livestock ) was also reduced by 44% on average. Late-stress occurred in 19% of the years and resulted in 25% and 12% of yield and biomass penalty, respectively. No-stress was observed in 57% of the years. Hence, our analysis confirms that early drought episodes are a major constraint in Sahelian agrosystems of West Africa affecting crops during the vegetative stage. In order to test if a fast-growing primary root after germination might be an adaptive trait to early drought stress, we first phenotyped a diversity panel of pearl millet inbred lines representative of the genetic diversity of the crop ( Debieu et al., 2018 ). As primary root growth is linear in the first days of growth ( Passot et al., 2016 ), root length was measured as a proxy of growth on a paper-based hydroponic system 6 DAG in 122 pearl millet inbred lines ( 5 plants/line in average for a total of 853 plants ). Primary root length ranged from 21. 1 to 193. 2 mm with an average of 94. 4 mm and a standard deviation of 32. 5 mm, thus showing that a large diversity was available for this trait ( Figure 1B ). The importance of early root growth for plant tolerance to early drought stress was then evaluated in field trials in 2 independent years using nine inbred lines with contrasted root growth ( slow, intermediate, and fast primary root growth ). Field trials were set up during the hot dry season ( March–June ) in 2018 and 2020. Seeds were sown and irrigation equivalent to a 30-mm rainfall was applied. Irrigation was then stopped to mimic an early drought stress episode and plant growth and ecophysiological parameters were analyzed for the following 6 weeks ( Supplementary file 1, Table S1 )

. We then analyzed the correlations between primary root length, measured in the lab, and plant performance measured in field conditions. Principal component analyses revealed a covariation of early primary root growth and stay-green ( the % of leaves that remained green ) as well as the performance index of photosynthesis ( PI ) measured both in 2018 and 2020 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). Correlations between variables adjusted means across the two field trials showed a strong and significant relationship between early primary root growth and stay-green at the vegetative stage, an indicator of plant tolerance to drought stress ( R = 0. 95, p <0. 01; Figure 1C, D ). Hence, our field experiments support the hypothesis that rapid growth of the primary root is beneficial for pearl millet plants to cope with early drought stress episodes after germination. We next studied the genetic determinants of primary root growth in pearl millet. First, the heritability of early primary root growth was analyzed using our paper-based phenotyping data on the panel of inbred lines. Heritability of 0. 53 was computed indicating that early primary root growth is under strong genetic control in pearl millet. We therefore conducted a GWAS. Genotyping by sequencing of the panel of pearl millet inbred lines provided 392, 493 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) for association, after filtering on quality, with an average density of 2. 5 SNPs per 10 kb ( Debieu et al., 2018 ). For the current study, a set of 392, 216 SNPs polymorphic for the 122 inbred lines with a phenotype was selected to conduct GWAS ( de la Fuente Cantó et al., 2022 ). GWAS was performed using the ridge latent factor mixed model ( LFMM ) algorithm ( Caye et al., 2019 ). In addition, we considered other GWAS methods to contrast the results ( analysis of variance [ANOVA], efficient mixed model association [EMMA], or mixed linear model [MLM]; Figure 2—figure supplement 1 )

. Our analysis revealed a total of 447 significant SNPs across the pearl millet genome associated with primary root growth from which, 109 SNPs were found highly significant with at least two other methods for association analysis at p-value <10−4 ( Supplementary file 1, Table S2 ). Only two of these markers, located on chromosomes 1 and 3, were above the 0. 05 false discovery rate significance threshold ( Figure 2A ). To validate our GWAS analysis, we generated a bi-parental population from two inbred lines with contrasting early primary root growth. The two lines, ICML-IS 11155 ( low primary root growth ) and SL2 ( high primary root growth ), were selected based on our initial paper-based root phenotyping experiment. The difference in primary root growth between these two lines was confirmed 7 DAG in a paper roll phenotyping system ( p <0. 001; Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ), as well as in soil using X-ray microCT 10 DAG ( p = 0. 058 but with a low number of samples analyzed; Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ), thus demonstrating their contrasting primary root phenotypes were robust and independent of the experimental system. Lines SL2 and ICML-IS 11155 were crossed and 737 F2 plants were phenotyped for early root growth together with their parents ( 33 ICML-IS 11155 and 30 SL2 plants ). The phenotypes of F2 plants showed a normal distribution encompassing the range of phenotypes from the two parents ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ). 75 F2 plants were selected for each extreme phenotype ( 75 highest and 75 lowest growth ) and were used for bulk DNA extraction. The corresponding DNA was then used for genotyping by sequencing. Mean average sequencing depth in the bulks corresponded to 1028X ( high growth ) and 814X ( low growth ). After filtering, a group of 33, 582 SNP variants ( 2. 1 SNP per 100 kb in average ) identified between the bulks was used to assess the differences in allele frequency linked to the root length phenotype

Pearl millet evolved and was domesticated in the Sahel. Its seeds are small ( 8 mg on average, about 5 and 20 times lighter than wheat or maize seeds, respectively, for example ) with limited reserves available for early seedling growth. It invests the available seed reserves toward the growth of a unique primary root to rapidly colonize deeper soil layers rather than forming more root axes ( seminal roots for example ) as seen in other cereals. Based on our results, we speculate that this specific root trait is an adaptation to the Sahelian environment where early drought is a major constraint. The fast-growing primary root allows pearl millet seedlings to access water and nutrients in deeper layers of soil before the soil surface dries out. Our results suggest a conserved function of glutaredin GRX genes in regulating root elongation in pearl millet and Arabidopsis.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Language is acquired and processed in complex and dynamic naturalistic contexts, involving the simultaneous processing of connected speech, faces, bodies, objects, etc. How words and their associated concepts are encoded in the brain during real-world processing is still unknown. Here, the representational structure of concrete and abstract concepts was investigated during movie watching to address the extent to which brain responses dynamically change depending on visual context. First, across contexts, concrete and abstract concepts are shown to encode different experience-based information in separable sets of brain regions. However, these differences are reduced when multimodal context is considered. Specifically, the response profile of abstract words becomes more concrete-like when these are processed in visual scenes highly related to their meaning. Conversely, when the visual context is unrelated to a given concrete word, the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing. These results suggest that while concepts generally encode habitual experiences, the underlying neurobiological organisation is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information.

   . Second, the reviewed work also suggests that these habitual representations are not necessarily stable and might change during naturalistic processing depending on the specific contextual information available. We specify two context conditions: a concept is displaced if its context offers little or no visual information related to the concept’s external sensory-motor features. In contrast, a concept is situated, if its visual context contains objects related to its meaning. We predict that when a concrete concept is processed in displaced situations ( e. g. ‘cat’ processed when discussing the general character traits of cats vs dogs ), response profiles will shift towards more internalized processing shared with abstract concepts. In contrast, when an abstract concept is processed in a situated context ( for example the word ‘love’ processed in a scene with people kissing ), its representation will more heavily draw on regions involved in processing external, visual information that otherwise characterize more concrete concepts. We propose that this erosion of the concrete/abstract dichotomy for contextualized processing shows that both concrete and abstract concepts draw on information related to experience ( external and internal ) as well as linguistic association. Which associated neurobiological structures are engaged during processing depends dynamically on the contextual information available. This way of thinking about the representational nature of conceptual knowledge may help reconcile contradictory evidence concerning the involvement of different brain areas during conceptual processing ( for example as discussed in Patterson et al., 2007; Hoffman et al., 2018 ).

. Overlap between activation for abstract concepts in situated conditions and concrete concepts across context ( Figure 5B ) can be found in fusiform and the occipital lobe ( bilateral ). We propose that this is because an abstract concept processed in a situated context relates more to external visual information, which is usually encoded by concrete concepts. A consequence of this finding is that the concrete/abstract distinction is neurobiologically less stable than might be assumed. Brain regions ’switch alliance' during concrete or abstract word processing depending on context. What is the neurobiological mechanism behind contextual modulation of conceptual encoding in the brain? Our results indicate that variance in visual context interacted with word-type ( both concrete and abstract ) in regions commonly defined as the DMN, as well as a set of prefrontal regions associated with semantic control ( Ralph et al., 2017; Hoffman et al., 2018; Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2 ). Recent literature on the role of the DMN suggests that these regions reactivate memories ( Crittenden et al., 2015; Konishi et al., 2015; Murphy et al., 2018; Sormaz et al., 2018; Yee and Thompson-Schill, 2016; Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014, Vatansever et al., 2017 ) and contexts-specific information ( Hahamy et al., 2023 ), possibly to form contextually relevant situation models ( Chen et al., 2015; Raykov et al., 2020, Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012, Smith et al., 2021, Smith et al., 2017 ), in order to guide semantic cognition ( Binder et al., 1999; Fernandino et al., 2016; Yeshurun et al., 2021; Tong et al., 2022 ). Breaking up the interaction between word_type and context, we find that the DMN is especially involved in displaced conditions for both concrete and abstract conceptual processing ( see Figure 4A, B ( blue ) )

. This is furthermore evidence against hypotheses in which the mouth is specifically associated with abstract concepts ( Borghi and Zarcone, 2016 ). Though results across contexts presumably represent a form of experiential central tendency, the behavioral, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological literature suggests that conceptual representations might not be stable and may vary as a function of context ( Elman, 1995; Spivey and Dale, 2006; Cai and Vigliocco, 2018; Kutas and Federmeier, 2011; Yee and Thompson-Schill, 2016; Deniz et al., 2023 ). For this reason, we conducted a second set of analyses with the goal of understanding the extent to which representations associated with concrete or abstract conceptual processing in the brain change as a function of context ( Barsalou et al., 2018 ). We find that brain activation underlying concrete and abstract conceptual processing fundamentally changes as a function of visual context. We compared the activation profiles of concrete and abstract concepts in displaced and situated contexts with the activations obtained when collapsing across contexts. Our results show that concrete concepts become more abstract-like in displaced contexts with less relevant visual information ( Figure 4B ). Overlap between activation for concrete concepts in displaced conditions and abstract concepts across context ( Figure 5A ) can be found in ACC, thalamus, and large swaths of the anterior, middle, and posterior temporal lobe. We propose that this is because, when a concrete concept is processed in a displaced context, its representation will relate more to internal/interoceptive variables and linguistic associations, which are usually encoded by abstract concepts. Conversely, abstract concepts become more concrete-like when they are highly situated ( Figure 4A )

First, we asked where in the brain concrete and abstract concepts are processed across different contexts as well as the type of information they encode. Given the hypothesis that conceptual representations reflect contextual information, we expected a set of regions that correspond to the most typical set of experiences ( e. g. as encountered during word learning in development ) to activate across different contexts. Specifically, we expected concrete conceptual encoding to activate regions more involved in sensory and motor processing and abstract conceptual encoding to activate regions associated with more internal/interoceptive/affective as well as general linguistic processing ( Anderson et al., 2019; Meteyard et al., 2012; Binder et al., 2005 ). Indeed, we found a general tendency for concrete and abstract words to activate regions associated with different experiences ( Figure 1 ). Consistent with prior work, concrete words were associated with multiple regions involved in sensory and motor processing ( Mkrtychian et al., 2019 ), including most of the visual system ( Gao et al., 2019 ) and the right frontal motor system ( Pulvermüller, 2005 ). In contrast, abstract words engaged regions typically associated with internal/interoceptive/affective processing ( anterior thalamus, somatosensory cortex ) ( Harpaintner et al., 2018; Villani et al., 2021 ), autobiographical memory ( anterior medial prefrontal regions ) ( Conca et al., 2021a ), and emotional processing and regulation ( anterior medial prefrontal regions, orbital prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and amygdala ) ( Vigliocco et al., 2014; Conca et al., 2021b ). Consistent with this, both meta-analytic and peak and valley analyses showed that concrete regions were more associated with sensory-motor properties ( e. g

Humans acquire, and process language in situated multimodal contexts, through dynamic interactions with their environment. For example, children may learn what the word ‘tiger’ means primarily via sensory-motor experience: they see one on TV, or they are told that a tiger looks like a big cat. Conversely, the experience required for understanding the more abstract concept of ‘good’ will likely include an evaluation of the rational and emotional motives underscoring intentional actions. Consequently, while more concrete concepts have external physical references ( they refer to objects or actions that are easily perceived in the world ), more abstract concepts do not necessarily have such references ( they generally refer more to cultural and societal constructs or peoples' inner states of mind ) ( Villani et al., 2019 ). Is this difference reflected in concrete and abstract representations in the brain during naturalistic processing? And are these static or can they change as a function of the multimodal contexts in which processing occurs? Most studies of concrete and abstract processing are not naturalistic in that they present words or sentences isolated from the rich contexts in which we usually process them. Collectively, these studies suggest that concrete and abstract concepts engage separate brain regions involved in processing different types of information. ( Bedny and Thompson-Schill, 2006; Binder et al., 2009; Sabatier et al,2011; et al. 2018 ). However, these studies do not account for the dynamic nature of language processing in real-world contexts. Here, we investigate how concrete and abstract concepts are encoded in the brain during real-world processing and the extent to which responses change as a function of multimodal context. Our results show that concrete and abstract concepts encode different information in separable sets of brain regions. However, these differences are reduced when multimodal context is considered. Specifically, the response of abstract words becomes more concrete when processed in scenes highly related to their meaning. Conversely, when visual context is unrelated to given word the activation resembles that of abstract processing. These results suggest that while concepts encode experiences, the neurobiological organisation is not fixed but depends dynamically on contextual information.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Despite exciting developments in cancer immunotherapy, its broad application is limited by the paucity of targetable antigens on the tumor cell surface. As an intrinsic cellular pathway, nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) conceals neoantigens through the destruction of the RNA products from genes harboring truncating mutations. We developed and conducted a high-throughput screen, based on the ratiometric analysis of transcripts, to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells. This screen implicated disruption of kinase SMG1’s phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potential disruptor of NMD. This led us to design a novel SMG1 inhibitor, KVS0001, that elevates the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo. Most importantly, KVS0001 concomitantly increased the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens ( HLA ) class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells. KVS0001 provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which NMD plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases.

   . Treatment of KVS0001 not only increased levels of transcripts and proteins from genes with truncating mutations, but also increased the levels of corresponding peptide bound–HLA complexes on the cell surfaces. We developed a new bispecific antibody, KVS-B043, which could recognize these pHLA complexes when the truncating mutations were present in the TP53 gene and destroy cancer cells harboring such mutations. In syngeneic mouse models, KVS0001 slowed the growth of some tumors containing multiple truncating mutations, but only when the mice were immunocompetent. This dependence on an intact immune system supports the idea that the slowed growth of the treated tumors was due to recognition of neoantigens. Despite these encouraging data, the potential utility of KVS0001 for therapeutic purposes remains speculative, for several reasons. First, we do not understand why KVS0001 ( and other NMD inhibitors ) increase the expression of many, but not all, genes with truncating mutations. We also do not systematically address the changes to splicing that are undoubtedly occurring when NMD is disrupted in either normal or tumor tissue. More research on the biochemistry of NMD will undoubtedly be required for such understanding, and perhaps the tools described here may facilitate that effort. Second, treatment with KVS0001 reduced the growth of some but not all syngeneic tumor types tested in mice. There appeared to be a correlation between the ability of KVS0001 to inhibit growth and the number of truncating mutations in the tumor. Likewise, recent evidence has been presented showing that cells deficient in known splicing factors are sensitive to subsequent NMD inhibition ( Cheruiyot, 2021 ). This situation is reminiscent of that encountered with immune checkpoint inhibitors, in which there is a positive but imperfect correlation with loss of microsatellite instability-related proteins and tumor mutation burden ( Yarchoan et al., 2017; Ma et al

. In cancer cells, however, NMD may aid immuno-evasion by eliminating RNA transcripts coming from genes that carry truncating mutants ( Nogueira et al., 2021 ). This prevents translation and presentation of peptides from these proteins on major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I complexes, rendering them invisible to immune cells ( Dalton et al., 2019 ). Previous work has shown knockdown of the NMD pathway with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) enhances the anti-tumor immune response ( Pastor et al., 2010; Castle et al., 2014 ). Analysis of cell lines with loss of the UPF1 RNA helicase and ATPase gene ( UPF1 ), a key mediator of NMD degradation, also showed increased levels of aberrant transcripts and mutant proteins in the alleles targeted by NMD ( Oka et al., 2021 ). This is reminiscent of the pharmacological modulation of splicing, which has also been shown to increase the number of neoantigens present on the cancer cell surface due to similar underlying mechanisms ( Lu et al., 2021 ). Despite early studies showing little toxicity with NMD inhibition, there is as of yet no reports of a specific chemical inhibitor of the pathway with good bioavailability ( Martin et al., 2014; Durand et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2022; Gotham et al., 2016; Gopalsamy et al., 2012 ). In this work, we create a cell-based high-throughput assay to query the effects of a curated library of small molecules on NMD function. From this screen, we identify a lead compound capable of inhibiting NMD and ascertain its protein target as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) -related kinase ( SMG1 ), a kinase that is a critical mediator of NMD. As the lead compound produced unacceptable toxicity in animal models, we then designed a specific and bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of SMG1 ( KVS0001 ) that is well-tolerated in vivo

. Cancer cells may evade immune surveillance by downregulating genes with truncating mutations as a result of NMD ( Nogueira et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2017 ). Indeed, previous studies with non-specific or toxic NMD inhibitors have shown an increase in selected antigens from tumor-specific mutations when NMD is inhibited ( Becker et al., 2021 ). We therefore investigated whether KVS0001 could similarly alter the cell surface presentation of proteins from genes harboring truncating mutations in NCI-H358 and LS180 cells. Using quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) –mass spectrometry ( MS ) we observed a striking ( 45- to 90-fold ) increase in the EXOC1- and RAB14-derived neoantigens, and a significant ( twofold ) increase in the ZDHHC16-derived neoantigen ( Figure 4A, B, Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 2; Wang et al., 2019 ). This is consistent with the re-expression of mutant transcript and protein shown previously in this study ( Figure 3D, E ). These three peptides were chosen based on an in silico review of potentially presented peptides and a preliminary experiment that looked at qualitative ( present or not present ) presentation of the predicted peptides ( Reynisson et al., 2020; Schmidt et al., 2021 ). To test whether cancer cell neoantigens presented as a result of NMD inhibition could be targeted, we evaluated two cancer cell lines, NCI-H716 and NCI-H2228 ( Supplementary file 1 ). Both lines contain homozygous mutations in TP53 which produce transcripts downregulated by NMD, with each exhibiting RNA levels less than 20% of the median level of expression among 675 cancer cell lines ( Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 3; Lindeboom et al., 2016; Klijn et al., 2015 ). Treatment with KVS0001 increased the expression of TP53 protein in both lines, while the commonly used therapeutic agents 5-fluorouracil and etoposide did not affect TP53 abundance ( Figure 4D and Figure 4—figure supplement 4 )

. We then demonstrate that targeted inhibition of SMG1 by KVS0001 leads to the presentation of novel neoantigens identifiable by T-cells leading to tumor growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo.

. To investigate the mechanism of NMD inhibition by LY3023414, we evaluated the six kinases with the highest reported inhibition by LY3023414 ( Smith et al., 2016 ). siRNA-mediated knockdown of each of these kinases in NCI-H358 and LS180 cancer cell lines was performed for this purpose ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). Only knockdown of SMG1 resulted in significant changes in the amount of truncating mutant transcript relative to wild-type transcript in all four genes evaluated ( Figure 3A, top ). RNF43 and DROSHA contain heterozygous coding region SNPs and served as controls in these experiments and as expected showed no changes despite siRNA treatment ( Figure 3A, bottom ). SMG1 is known to regulate the NMD pathway by activating UPF1, an enzyme with RNA helicase and ATPase activity ( Yamashita et al., 2001; Yamashita, 2013 ). We therefore knocked down UPF1 with siRNA and found that it restored expression of the NMD-downregulated transcripts, at levels similar to those observed after the knockdown of SMG1 ( Figure 3B ). Additionally, treatment of NCI-H358 and LS180 cancer cell lines with a previously reported SMG1-specific small molecule inhibitor, SMG1i-11, resulted in specific increases in the transcripts and proteins from genes with truncating mutations, just as did LY3023414 ( Figure 3—figure supplements 2 and 3; Gopalsamy et al., 2012 ). Although SMG1i-11 displayed considerable SMG1 specificity and marked inhibition of NMD, it was highly insoluble. While we had no difficulty getting it into solution, we were able to solubilize and purify SM1 from E. coli overexpressing the protein ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ) and used it to crystallize the structure of SM1 in complex with SM1-11 ( Figure 3—figure 5 ). The structure revealed that SM1 binds to the kinase domain of SM1 ( Figure 3—figure 5 ), which is critical for its activation of UP1 ( Yamash et al.,2013 ). We used this information to design and synthesize a novel SM1 inhibitor, KVS1 ( Figure 3—figure 6 ) that specifically binds to the kinase domain of SM1 and inhibits its activation of UP1 ( Figure 3— figure 7 and 8 ). KVS1 inhibited NMD and increased the expression of transcripts and proteins from genes with truncating mutations in vitro ( Figure 3— figure 9 and 10 ) and in vivo ( Figure 3— figure 11 and 12 ). KVS1 also increased the presentation of neoantig on the surface of human cancer cells ( Figure 3— figure 13 and 14 ) and inhibited the growth of tumors in syngenic mice ( Figure 3— figure 15 and 16 ).
A study of 374,463 participants from the UK Biob examined the association between phenotypic age (Pheno) and cancer risk. Pheno was calculated using chronological age and nine biomarkers, and Phenoacceleration subtracting the effect of chronological age by regression, and incidence-weighted overall polygenic risk score (CPRS) based on 20 site-specific polygenic scores. Compared to biologically younger participants, those older had a higher risk of overall cancer, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.22 (95% CI, 1.18-1.27) in men and 1.26 (1.22-1.31) in women. A joint effect of genetic and Phenoaccel was observed on overall risk, with HR of 2.29 (2.10-2.51) for men and 1.94 (1.78-2.11) women with high genetic and oldereno compared to low risk and youngereno. Phenoaccel was negatively associated with number of healthy factors (Beta -0.01 in men, p<0.001; -0.98 in women, p<0.001). Within genetic groups, oldereno was related to increased risk of cancer, adjusting for chronological age, which could be retarded by adherence to a healthy lifestyle. The study supported the National Science Foundation of China and Excellent Foundation of Jiangsu Province. 

Pheno was calculated in accordance with previous method and evaluated effectiveness in predicting overall risk in UKob. Accelerated was associated with increased risk across groups with different risk defined by CPR. Phenoaccel was calculated to explore effect on risk and demonstrated positive association with increased risk after adjusting chronological in UKob. Oldereno was consistently associated with increased risk within genetic groups, and high risk and oldereno had greatest risk. Findings provided evidence for Pheno to be used for cancer stratification, independent of genetic. Participants older biologically reached screening threshold 2 years in advance and healthy lifestyle slowed aging.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Comprehensive biodiversity data is crucial for ecosystem protection. The Biome mobile app, launched in Japan, efficiently gathers species observations from the public using species identification algorithms and gamification elements. The app has amassed >6 million observations since 2019. Nonetheless, community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. Species distribution models ( SDMs ) estimate species distribution while accommodating such bias. Here, we investigated the quality of Biome data and its impact on SDM performance. Species identification accuracy exceeds 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but seed plants, molluscs, and fishes scored below 90%. Our SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan revealed that incorporating Biome data into traditional survey data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional survey data required >2000 records for accurate models ( Boyce index ≥ 0. 9 ), while blending the two data sources reduced this to around 300. The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by Biome data, compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas, may explain this improvement. Combining multiple data sources better estimates species distributions, aiding in protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment. Establishing a platform for accumulating community-sourced distribution data will contribute to conserving and monitoring natural ecosystems.

   ., 2023 ). For example, users can earn ‘points’ by contributing in various ways such as submitting records and suggesting species identifications to others, and their levels are determined based on the total points earned. The inclusion of networking and gamification elements can attract a wider user base, including those who may not typically engage in community science ( Bowser et al., 2013; Groom et al., 2021 ). Consequently, Biome has accumulated data rapidly. Since its launch, 6 million records have been collected through the app ( by 17 October 2023 ). This is more than four times greater than the number of records accumulated by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ( GBIF ) from any data sources including iNaturalist and eBird during the same period in Japan ( ca. 1. 3 million ). The data gathered through the app has been used for conservation planning and facilitating companies' financial disclosures by supplying and analysing species occurrence records. Species distribution models ( SDMs ) are effective statistical tools for assessing biodiversity at specific sites while accounting for biases in survey efforts. SDMs use species occurrence records and environmental conditions to estimate the potential geographic ranges and suitable habitats for species ( Booth et al., 2014; Box, 1981; Elith et al., 2011; Hutchinson, 1957; Phillips et al., 2006 ). These models play a crucial role in conservation and restoration planning by helping predict how changes in land use and climate impact species distributions ( Kindt, 2023; Porfirio et al., 2014; Urban et al., 2016 ). While species presence/absence data—which needs extensive surveys by experts—is limited, presence-only data—which can be obtained from communities’ observations—is much more available. MaxEnt ( Phillips et al

. As pseudo-absences are selected based on search effort, our models utilise numerous pseudo-absences from these areas. Consequently, this might lead to better estimation of species absence in such areas, not just presence, resulting in an overall increase in model accuracy across a wider range of species. A balanced distribution, along with the natural-urban gradient, is noteworthy because community science data is typically biased towards human population centres ( Kendal et al., 2020; Reddy and Dávalos, 2003 ). This could be influenced by the distribution of users' residencies, although we do not have specific information about the users' locations. The app has collaborated with numerous local governments across Japan, including 9 prefectures and 29 local municipalities such as cities and towns. Through these collaborations, the user base may be widely dispersed, enriching the geographical coverage of Biome data. The Biome data also can improve SDM accuracy by simply increasing the overall amount of data. Essentially, SDM accuracy is enhanced with an increased amount of data ( Figure 3; Erickson and Smith, 2023; Stockwell and Peterson, 2002 ). In our analysis, we maintained a fixed proportion of 50% for Biome data within the Biome + Traditional dataset, which in turn restricted the amount of available Biome + Traditional data. However, our preliminary analysis ( Appendix 1 ) demonstrates that the enhancement of SDM accuracy occurs across a range of proportion variations for Biome data blending. This implies that the proportion of Biome data does not necessarily need to be controlled. Therefore, in practical application scenarios, the incorporation of Biome data predominantly serves to augment the overall volume of training data. The impact of community-sourced data on SDMs has primarily been investigated using birds, with a limited focus on plants ( Feldman et al., 2021 )

. This finding highlights the importance of community-sourced data not only for monitoring the dynamics of endangered species ( Chandler et al., 2017; Zapponi et al., 2017 ) but also for modelling purposes. Considering the rapid accumulation of Biome data, Biome data would make a significant contribution to the more effective distribution modelling of endangered species. In assessing data quality, reidentification was impossible for records that did not photograph key traits for species identification. To address this limitation, further app improvements can include allowing users to submit multiple images. Encouraging users to document various body parts of organisms through multiple images would make capturing key identification traits much easier. This will make reidentification easier and possibly improve automatic species identification accuracy. Given the absence of a comprehensive, environmentally unbiased occurrence dataset spanning a wide range of taxa, we assessed SDM accuracy not relying on an independent test dataset. In this evaluation, the test data was meticulously crafted to include 25% Biome data, serving as an intermediary proportion between Biome + Traditional ( 50% ) and Traditional survey data ( 0% ). By leveraging the distinct distribution patterns of Biome and Traditional survey data along environmental variables ( Figure 2C ), the test data would better encapsulate the actual species distribution compared to datasets composed solely of either Biome or Traditional survey data. It is noteworthy that, even when the test data exclusively consisted of Traditional survey data ( i. e. unfavourable conditions for Biome + Traditional data SDMs ), the accuracy of SDMs derived from Biome + Traditional and Traditional survey data did not differ ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 )

. Firstly, the vigilant oversight of the user community through the ‘suggest identification’ feature plays a crucial role. Biome encourages users to participate in suggesting identifications by offering ‘points’ as rewards for their contributions. Secondly, the species identification AI algorithm leverages past occurrence data from nearby areas, resulting in increasingly accurate automatic identifications as the data accumulates. Given these, as a community science app, the data quality of Biome is decent. Yet, rare species generally showed lower identification accuracy, which would require identification by experts and further improvement of species identification AI algorithm. The inclusion of Biome data resulted in improved accuracy of SDMs ( Figure 3 ). The most accurate model predictions were obtained when the training data consisted of 50–70% Biome data ( Appendix 1 ), highlighting the necessity of incorporating both traditional surveys and citizen observations for a comprehensive understanding of species distributions ( Miller et al., 2019; Pacifici et al., 2017; Robinson et al., 2020 ). The improvement can be attributed to introducing data with different biases compared to the Traditional survey data. Indeed, when controlling for the number of occurrence records, the model performance was higher in the Biome + Traditional data compared to the Traditional survey data. The variation in performance can be attributed to the distribution of data in relation to environmental conditions. Traditional survey data exhibits a strong bias towards natural areas, whereas Biome data is well balanced across the natural-urban habitat gradients ( Figure 2C ). Therefore, incorporating Biome data could significantly enhance modelling accuracy in urban and suburban landscapes, which are typically underrepresented in traditional survey data

. For instance, estimated distributions will be useful in selecting new protected areas or areas with Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures ( OECMs ) : allowing a wider range of land use as long as biodiversity and ecosystem services are sustained/improved. Using estimated distributions of each species, hotspots of species or evolutionary diverse taxa can be inferred. Such sites will be good candidates for protected areas ( Jones et al., 2016 ) or OECMs ( Shiono et al., 2021 ). Further, estimated distributions can be used as input for spatial conservation prioritisation tools ( e. g. Marxanl Ball et al., 2009 ). In our experience, stakeholders—including corporate social responsibility managers and conservation practitioners—often seek the list of species potentially inhabiting their locations. Due to the uncertainty of SDMs and their thresholding into presence/absence, on-site surveys remain essential for assessing biodiversity status. Yet, SDMs can make such surveys cost-effective by screening important locations for on-site assessment ( e. g. Locate phase in TNFD framework ) and narrowing down the target species for surveying. Improved estimation through SDMs can mitigate the risks associated with their use in society and enable more informed decision-making for conservation efforts. The rapid accumulation of data from diverse locations holds the potential to unveil valuable ecological patterns. The accumulated data enables early detection capabilities for range shifts in species distributions. This is especially important in the face of climate change and land use changes. In conclusion, the incorporation of community-sourced data Biome into traditional survey data enhances the accuracy of species distribution models (SDMs). This is due to the balanced distribution of data across natural-urban gradients and the increased volume of data. The Biome app has accumulated a large number of species records since its launch and has been used for conservation and planning. Establishing a platform for accumulating community-sourced data will contribute to conserving and monitoring natural ecosystems.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Abnormal lung development can cause congenital pulmonary cysts, the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. Although the cystic lesions are believed to result directly from disrupted airway epithelial cell growth, the extent to which developmental defects in lung mesenchymal cells contribute to abnormal airway epithelial cell growth and subsequent cystic lesions has not been thoroughly examined. In the present study using genetic mouse models, we dissected the roles of bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) receptor 1a ( Bmpr1a ) -mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development and discovered that abrogation of mesenchymal Bmpr1a disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers were found in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. In addition, ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. However, deletion of Smad1/5, two major BMP signaling downstream effectors, from the lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs, suggesting that a Smad-independent mechanism contributes to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. These findings reveal for the first time the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts.

   . This aberrant epithelial growth may also contribute to airway cyst formation, as multiple mouse models have suggested that loss of Sox2+ or expansion of Sox9+ in airway epithelia are associated with altered epithelial differentiation and branching, as well as cystic pathology in fetal lungs ( Wang et al., 2013; Liberti et al., 2019; Rockich et al., 2013 ). In summary, mesenchymal Bmpr1a is essential for lung development, particularly airway branching morphogenesis. Disruption of Bmpr1a-mediated mesenchymal signaling causes prenatal airway malformation and cystic lesions. Multiple mechanisms, including deficiency of airway smooth muscle, airway elastin fiber defect, and perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 epithelial progenitor axis, may contribute to the congenital airway cystic pathogenesis. In addition, the downstream Smad-independent p38 pathway appears to be critical in mediating BMP-regulated airway smooth muscle development. Our study helps to understand both normal lung development and the mechanisms of related airway malformation and congenital pulmonary diseases.

Our current study provides solid in vivo evidence for the first time that Bmpr1a-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchymal cells is indispensable in lung development. Lung mesenchymal deletion of Bmpr1a at an early developmental stage causes abnormal branching morphogenesis and then severe lung cysts at late gestation in mice. Interestingly, congenital pulmonary cysts are reported in human CPAM patients as a result of abnormal prenatal lung development ( Stocker, 2009 ). Reduction of airway SMCs and decreased subepithelial elastin fibers are also found to be the common pathological changes in the cystic airways of human CPAM samples ( Jiang et al., 2019 ). Although the congenital pulmonary cysts in CPAM patients can be identified by a prenatal ultrasound examination, the tissue specimens for pathological analysis are only available from postnatal surgery, when advanced airway cysts have already developed. This makes it difficult to study the pathogenic molecular mechanisms that trigger early cyst formation during fetal lung development in human subjects. Studies in mouse models suggest that altered growth factor signaling in a prenatal time window is sufficient to cause cyst formation ( Miao et al., 2021 ). The abnormal BMP signaling pathway may be involved in the initiation of CPAM, but not in the later stage when cystic lesions have formed. Interestingly, integrated suppression of BMP signaling pathway was recently found in human CPAM specimens by an RNA-seq approach ( Zhang et al., 2022 ). Therefore, the lung mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout model developed here is a potentially useful tool for studying the pathogenic process of CPAM. It has been reported that epithelial overexpression of Bmp4 appears to induce extensive mesenchymal SMC differentiation in vivo ( Badri et al., 2008 ), and that BMP4 promotes myocyte differentiation and inhibits cell proliferation in cultured human fetal lung fibroblasts via the Smad1 pathway ( Jeffery et al

., 2014 ). BMPs bind to the receptor complex of BMP receptor II ( Bmpr2 ) and BMP receptor I ( Bmpr1a or Bmpr1b ), which in turn activates the intracellular Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways ( Shi and Massagué, 2003 ). Mice with conventional Bmpr1a gene deletions are early embryonic lethal ( E7. 5–9. 5 ) before lung organogenesis ( Mishina et al., 1995 ). As reported by us and other groups, both hyperactivation and inhibition of BMP signaling in fetal lung epithelial cells result in lung malformation, which is primarily due to the defects in distal lung epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation/maturation ( Luo et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2008; Weaver et al., 1999; Bellusci et al., 1996 ). However, the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in regulating fetal lung development has not been studied due to the lack of lung mesenchyme-specific targeting tools in the past. We recently generated a lung mesenchyme-specific Tbx4 lung enhancer-driven loxP/Cre mouse driver line ( Zhang et al., 2013 ) which enables us to manipulate BMP signaling specifically in lung mesenchymal cells in vivo and to study its role in the lung development. Although Bmpr1a is expressed predominantly in fetal mouse lung airway epithelial cells at the early gestation stage ( embryonic day [E]12. 5 to E14. 5 ), its expression in fetal lung mesenchyme is also evident during mid-gestation ( Sun et al., 2008 ). Herein, we specifically deleted Bmpr1a in fetal lung mesenchymal cells, which resulted in abnormal airway development and subsequent prenatal cystic malformation. This pathological phenotype resembles the features observed in pediatric patients diagnosed with congenital pulmonary airway malformation ( CPAM ). Therefore, investigating the abnormal lung phenotypes caused by lung mesenchyme-specific Bmpr1a knockout and revealing the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms will significantly enhance our understanding of congenital lung diseases

. The isolated fetal lung mesenchymal cells of Bmpr1a CKO mice also showed increased Bmp4 expression as compared to the WT lung cells. This might be due to an autoregulatory feedback loop between Bmp ligand expression and intracellular BMP signaling. Previous studies have shown that disruption of BMP signaling by LDN-193189 can substantially improve Bmp4 production ( Kim and Lee, 2019 ), and that deletion of Bmpr1a and Acvr1 in the lens-forming ectoderm increases Bmp2, -4, and -7 transcripts ( Huang et al., 2015 ). These in vitro and in vivo studies clearly suggest the inverse relationship between mesenchymal BMP signaling activity and Bmp ligand expression. Misexpression of BMP4 results in a decrease of Sox2+ proximal progenitors and an expansion of Sox9+/Id2+ distal progenitors in fetal mouse lungs, leading to malformed airways ( Wang et al., 2013 ). Consistently, overexpression of Bmp antagonist Xnoggin or gremlin in fetal distal lung epithelium leads to a severe reduction of distal epithelial cell types and a concurrent expanded expression of the proximal epithelial cell markers CC10 and Foxj1 ( Weaver et al., 1999; Lu et al., 2001 ). In our Bmpr1a CKO lungs, the proximal-distal patterning of lung airways is also substantially disturbed, as indicated by the aberrant distribution of proximal and distal epithelial cells. Evidence increasingly suggests that the lung mesenchyme is closely involved in respiratory lineage specification and epithelial differentiation by producing many critical signaling molecules, such as Bmp ligands, that direct endodermal expression of specific cell markers in a temporal and spatial fashion ( McCulley et al., 2015; Morrisey and Hogan, 2010 ). Therefore, the decrease in proximal cell types and ectopic expression of distal cell markers ( Sox9 ) in the Bmpr1a CKO lungs may be subsequently caused by abnormal increase of Bmp ligands

. Additionally, the role of the BMP4-Bmpr1a-p38 pathway in regulating SMC-related gene expression was assessed in cultured fetal lung mesenchymal cells. As previously reported ( Young et al., 2020 ), Myocd is a key transcription co-factor in controlling airway SMC differentiation. Myh11 and Acta2, major contractile proteins, are two prominent SMC markers. Treatment of lung mesenchym cells with LD-193, an inhibitor of BMP signaling, significantly reduced Myd and Act2 expression. In contrast, Bmpra overexpression increased Myd and Act2 in mesenchym cells. These results suggest that the BMP4-Bmpra-p38 pathway promotes SMC differentiation in fetal lungenchym cells, which is consistent with the decreased SMCs in the cystic airways of B1 CKO lungs.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Anionic lipid molecules, including phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate ( PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 ), are implicated in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ). However, the role of the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 in the regulation of EGFR activity in living cells is not fully understood, as it is difficult to visualize the local lipid domains around EGFR. Here, we visualized both EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells using super-resolution single-molecule microscopy. The EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains aggregated before stimulation with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) through transient visits of EGFR to the PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains. The degree of coaggregation decreased after EGF stimulation and depended on phospholipase Cγ, the EGFR effector hydrolyzing PI ( 4, 5 ) P2. Artificial reduction in the PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 content of the plasma membrane reduced both the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after stimulation with EGF. Inhibition of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 hydrolysis after EGF stimulation decreased phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654. Thus, EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 around EGFR molecules were found to be mutually regulated. 

    Supporting Text:
    We examined the dynamics and functional roles of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 as the boundary and/or neighboring lipid of EGFR in the activation of EGFR by EGF stimulation. Superresolution microscopy revealed that EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 form nanodomains that partially overlap before EGF stimulation. The nanodomains also form domain clusters and the extent of coaggregation of EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 molecules in a higher-order domain structure decreases after EGF stimulation. Single-molecule imaging confirmed these results, detecting the transient colocalization of EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2. The expression of a PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 phosphatase reduced the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after EGF stimulation. These findings are consistent with previous in vitro and in silico observations that PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 interacts strongly with the arginine residues in the JM-A region of EGFR, stabilizing the active conformation of EGFR ( Abd Halim et al., 2015; Matsushita et al., 2013 ). Together with these observations, our biochemical analyses suggest that the local distribution of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 around EGFR before EGF stimulation not only acts as the substrate of EGFR effectors, including PI3K and PLCγ, after EGF stimulation, but also plays a crucial role in enhancing the dimerization and kinase activation of EGFR immediately after EGF stimulation ( Figure 7E, left ). We found that PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 is also involved in a specific pathway of EGFR deactivation after EGF stimulation. Tyr-phosphorylated EGFR recruits PLCγ, degrading PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 and producing DAG. DAG activates protein kinase C, which phosphorylates Thr654 of EGFR, deactivating EGFR ( Figure 7E, right ). We have reported previously that Thr654 phosphorylation causes the JM-A dimer to dissociate in the presence of acidic lipids ( Maeda et al., 2018; Maeda et al., 2022 ). This constitutes the negative feedback regulation of the EGFR kinase function

. We found that the PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains and EGFR nanoclusters aggregate together before EGF stimulation. After stimulation, the degree of coaggregation decreases, which depends on PLCγ but not on phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ). The local PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 around EGFR stabilizes EGFR dimers to increase EGFR autophosphorylation upon stimulation with EGF. The subsequent hydrolysis of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 by PLCγ plays a crucial role in the deactivation of EGFR. Our results suggest that autogenous remodeling of the lipid environments regulates EGFR activity.

., 2013; McLaughlin et al., 2005 ). Multiscale molecular dynamic simulations have suggested that phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate ( PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 ) interacts specifically with the basic residues in the JM-A region, stabilizing the JM-A helices in an orientation away from the membrane surface by binding to PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 ( Abd Halim et al., 2015; Matsushita et al., 2013 ). In addition to these in silico analyses, our recent in vitro study using nanodisc techniques suggested that phosphatidylserine ( PS ) and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 stabilize the conformation of the JM-A dimer ( Maeda et al., 2018; Maeda et al., 2022 ). Apart from these in silico and in vitro studies, the localization and roles of PS and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 during EGFR activation have not been fully investigated experimentally in living cells due to the difficulty of visualizing the local lipid domains around EGFR in the plasma membrane. The main difficulty is that the proposed size of the lipid domain is below the diffraction limit of light. Therefore, conventional fluorescence microscopy cannot image the structure in detail. Superresolution imaging techniques that break the diffraction limit have become a powerful tool for visualizing cellular structures with unprecedented resolution ( Pujals et al., 2019 ). Among these techniques, single-molecule localization microscopy ( SMLM ), which includes photoactivated localization microscopy, fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy, stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ), ground-state depletion microscopy followed by individual molecular return, and direct STORM, allows the construction of super resolved images with high-precision localization of individual fluorophores ( Rust et al., 2006 ). Here, we visualized both the EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane with SMLM

. Therefore, EGFR may be localized in PI ( 4, 5 ) P2-enriched nanodomains mediated by tetraspanins. Further studies are required to reveal the relationships between these molecules. PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains may suppress EGFR signaling in the resting state despite their stabilizing effect on the JM-A dimer of EGFR during its kinase activation. Several reports have suggested that membrane cholesterol prevents EGFR phosphorylation before EGF stimulation ( Chen and Resh, 2002; Ringerike et al., 2002 ). A biochemical analysis suggested that EGFR is associated with the detergent-resistant membrane fraction, which is enriched with cholesterol and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 ( Brown and London, 1998; Hope and Pike, 1996; Laux et al., 2000 ). We previously showed with SMLM that PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains appear in the inner leaflet just beneath the sphingomyelin/cholesterol nanodomains located in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane ( Abe et al., 2012; Makino et al., 2017 ). Together with the results of the present study, this suggests that cholesterol- and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2-rich membrane domains exist in the plasma membrane, form higher-order aggregates, and transiently colocalize with EGFR clusters before EGF stimulation. Such membrane structures may prevent EGFR from activation because cholesterol exerts an inhibitory effect on EGFR. However, after EGF stimulation, rapid EGFR activation is induced by the positive effect of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 on the dimerization of EGFR kinase. Transient complex of EGFR dimers with PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 may be required to leave the cholesterol nanodomains to allow kinase activation. The transient mobilization of EGFR clusters immediately after EGF stimulation that we have observed previously ( Hiroshima et al., 2018 ) may reflect this process. SMT analysis revealed that EGFR monomers decreased and dimers increased in the immobile fraction of control CHO-K1 cells after EGF stimulation ( Figure 4A )

., 2018; Yasui et al., 2018 ), which is consistent with EGF-induced EGFR clustering. In conclusion, PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 plays a crucial role as a molecular switch for EGFR functions. PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 is involved in the complicated remodeling of the boundary lipids and higher-order membrane structure around EGFR. To detect whole these processes directly, further observations are required using cholesterol and DAG probes under SMLM or electron microscopy. 

The final answer is: 

In this study, researchers used super-resolution microscopy to visualize the dynamics of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in living cells. They found that PI(4,5)2 nanodomains and EGFR nanoclusters aggregate before stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EG), but the degree of coaggregation decreases after EG stimulation, depending on phospholipaseγ, EG effector hydrolyzing PI(4,5)2. Artificial reduction in PI(4,5)2 of the plasma membrane reduced the dimer and autophosphorylation of EG after stimulation. Inhibition PI(4,5)2 hydrolysis after stimulation decreased phosphorylation of EG-Th654. The study suggests that PI(4,5)2 around EG stabilizes EG dimers to increase EG autophosphorylation upon stimulation with EG, and subsequent hydrolysis PI(4)2 by PLC plays a role in deactivation EG.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Stramenopiles form a clade of diverse eukaryotic organisms, including multicellular algae, the fish and plant pathogenic oomycetes, such as the potato blight Phytophthora, and the human intestinal protozoan Blastocystis. In most eukaryotes, glycolysis is a strictly cytosolic metabolic pathway that converts glucose to pyruvate, resulting in the production of NADH and ATP ( Adenosine triphosphate ). In contrast, stramenopiles have a branched glycolysis in which the enzymes of the pay-off phase are located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. Here, we identify a mitochondrial carrier in Blastocystis that can transport glycolytic intermediates, such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the mitochondrial inner membrane, linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis. Comparative analyses with the phylogenetically related human mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier ( SLC25A11 ) and dicarboxylate carrier ( SLC25A10 ) show that the glycolytic intermediate carrier has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate. Blastocystis lacks several key components of oxidative phosphorylation required for the generation of mitochondrial ATP, such as complexes III and IV, ATP synthase, and ADP/ATP carriers. The presence of the glycolytic pay-off phase in the mitochondrial matrix generates ATP, which powers energy-requiring processes, such as macromolecular synthesis, as well as NADH, used by mitochondrial complex I to generate a proton motive force to drive the import of proteins and molecules. Given its unique substrate specificity and central role in carbon and energy metabolism, the carrier for glycolytic intermediates identified here represents a specific drug and pesticide target against stramenopile pathogens, which are of great economic importance. 

    Supporting Text:
    The last enzyme of the cytosolic phase of glycolysis in Blastocystis is triosephosphate isomerase ( Río Bártulos et al., 2018 ). Consequently, dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate need to be transported into the mitochondrial matrix for the pay-off phase of glycolysis. Given the presence of mitochondrial glycolysis in stramenopiles, we searched for a transporter that is not only ubiquitous in stramenopiles, but also absent in other eukaryotes. As glycolysis in Blastocystis would be critically dependent on this transporter, we used this parasite as a model organism. We focussed on mitochondrial carboxylate carriers because of their ability to transport phosphorylated three-carbon substrates ( Castegna et al., 2010; Fiermonte et al., 2001; Palmieri et al., 1972 ) and compared the sequences of carboxylate carriers from all major eukaryotic supergroups. Our analyses revealed four well-defined groups of carriers: dicarboxylate carriers ( DIC, SLC25A10 ), oxoglutarate/malate carriers ( OGC, SLC25A11 ), di/tricarboxylate carriers ( DTC ), and a new stramenopile-specific group, the putative glycolytic intermediate carriers ( GIC ) ( Figure 1 ). At least one copy of the putative GIC carrier was identified in each stramenopile species. In Blastocystis ST7-B, there are four copies of the putative GIC protein, but two of them are truncated and lack crucial mitochondrial carrier elements ( Ruprecht et al., 2019; Ruprecht and Kunji, 2020; Ruprecht and Kunji, 2021 ), possibly rendering these proteins non-functional ( XP_012899519. 1 has an N-terminal truncation; XP_012896318. 1 has a C-terminal truncation ) ( Ruprecht and Kunji, 2020 ). Another important criterion is that the putative GIC localize to mitochondria in Blastocystis. Specific ( peptide ) rabbit antibodies were raised against the two putative GIC bGIC-1 and bGIC-2 as well as an orthologue of the Blastocystis oxoglutarate carrier bOGC ( Figure 2B )

Glycolysis is a crucial metabolic pathway that most organisms use to obtain energy from the oxidation of sugars, which consists of 10 enzymatic reactions in total, divided into two phases. The first ‘preparatory’ phase consists of five reactions, the products of which are the triose phosphates dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The second ‘pay-off’ phase leads to the production of ATP, NADH, and pyruvate, which is transported into the mitochondrial matrix by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier ( Bricker et al., 2012; Herzig et al., 2012 ). In most eukaryotes, glycolysis is a cytosolic process with the exception of trypanosomes, where it is localized in the glycosomes ( Opperdoes and Borst, 1977 ). However, it was recently discovered that a large group of eukaryotes, the stramenopiles, have a branched glycolytic pathway in which the pay-off phase is duplicated and also localized in mitochondria ( Abrahamian et al., 2017; Río Bártulos et al., 2018 ). The stramenopiles are an extremely diverse eukaryotic group consisting mainly of protist algae, which are among the most important primary oxygen producers in the oceans ( Burki et al., 2020 ). The group also includes multicellular algae ( kelps ) and the economically devastating oomycetes, such as Phytophthora infestans ( Jiang and Tyler, 2012 ), which causes potato blight, one of the major contributing factors of the Great Famine in Ireland in the late 19th century. The human gut protozoan Blastocystis also belongs to the stramenopiles. Despite more than 1 billion infected individuals worldwide ( Andersen and Stensvold, 2016 ), the public health significance of Blastocystis is debated. Blastocystis is often linked to patients with diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome ( Poirier et al., 2012 ), or inflammatory bowel disease ( Dogruman-Al et al., 2009 )

Glycolysis is a textbook example of a well-conserved cytosolic pathway. However, the discovery that glycolysis is branched and also mitochondrial in stramenopiles ( Abrahamian et al., 2017; Río Bártulos et al., 2018; Nakayama et al., 2012 ) raises questions about how glycolytic intermediates are transported across the tightly controlled mitochondrial inner membrane. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a mitochondrial carrier protein unique to stramenopiles that transports the glycolytic intermediates dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and PEP, providing the heretofore missing transport link. Since mitochondrial glycolysis is found exclusively in stramenopiles, we searched for a transporter that is ubiquitous in these species, but not in other eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analyses identified a new class of mitochondrial carboxylate carriers in stramenopiles that are most closely related to plant DTC ( Figure 1 ). The plant carriers catalyse the transport of tricarboxylates ( citrate, isocitrate, and aconitate ) in exchange for dicarboxylates ( oxoglutarate, oxaloacetate, malate, maleate, succinate, and malonate ) ( Picault et al., 2002 ) and are also present in Alveolata, Rhizaria, and Haptophyta ( Toleco et al., 2020 ), which share a common evolutionary ancestor with stramenopiles ( Burki et al., 2020 ). Therefore, the GIC of stramenopiles is probably derived from a common ancestor with DTC and does not exist in any other eukaryote outside of the stramenopile clade. Blastocystis was used in this study as a stramenopile model organism, as it relies solely on glycolysis for its energy demands and does not have a second branch of glycolysis in the cytosol. We characterized human and Blastocystis carboxylate carriers and demonstrated that the stramenopile GIC proteins have a unique substrate specificity that is distinct from the human carriers ( Figure 6 )

. We characterized one of these unique Blastocystis carriers, which has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate. Instead, this carrier can transport several glycolytic intermediates, including dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, and phosphoenolpyruvate ( PEP ), thus providing a previously undiscovered transport link between cytosolic and mitochondrial glycolysis. Since Blastocystis relies solely on mitochondrial glycolysis, the inhibition of this carrier might represent a promising way to combat stramenile pathogens, such as Blastyst and Phytophthora, which are of great economic importance.
Researchers have proposed a new framework for genetic association studies called the Haplotype Score (HFS), which calculates the functional activity of haplotypes at each locus using a deep learning model. They applied this framework to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank and identified 361 independent FS-trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8. Fine-mapping revealed 269 causal associations, corresponding to a median of 63 causal findings per trait compared to single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis. The FS-based analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait and 153-tissue associations with biological interpretability, including 'circadian-chronotype' and 'aridic acid-intelligence. Integrating FS with SNP-based polygenic scores using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression showed an improvement of 16.1-39.8% in cross-ance polygenic prediction. The study suggests that FS is a promising for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits.

The FS framework has several advantages over SNP, including lower linkage disequilibrium (LD) between FS, which enhances precision of fine-mapping. FS-based fine-mapping had high statistical power and enrichment capable of revealing biologically interpretable mechanisms. FS integrates effects of all variants within a locus, regardless of frequency, capturing rare variants overlooked by classic studies and improving polygenic prediction. The FS could extend to whole-genome sequencing and capture mutations as rare as singletons, addressing the'missing heritability'. However, the current FS carries substantial computational cost and limitations.

The FS was applied to 14 polygenic traits in the UKB ancestry set, identifying 16,597 FS-trait associations at p <5 ×10-8, equating to 361 independent associations. The most significant associations were between 'prom' of chr:121898-121994 (W16) and bone density (BMD; beta -0.02, p10-300) and 'prom of chr:095-504 (3) plate count (beta 3.20, 2.79 ×10-2). Comparing FS with SNP-GWAS on the same data, 98 FS loci harbored significant SNPs, with FS association-value higher than GWAS-value in 95 loci. The genomic inflation factor (GC) for FS test varied between 0.99 for asthma and 1.50 for height, resembling SNP-GW. The study demonstrates that incorporating FS in genetic studies offers improvements in biological and poly prediction of complex traits, suggesting its application in future studies.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The hippocampus is a central modulator of the HPA-axis, impacting the regulation of stress on brain structure, function, and behavior. The current study assessed whether three different types of 3 months mental Training Modules geared towards nurturing ( a ) attention-based mindfulness, ( b ) socio-affective, or ( c ) socio-cognitive skills may impact hippocampal organization by reducing stress. We evaluated mental training-induced changes in hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic functional connectivity, by combining longitudinal structural and resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis in 332 healthy adults. We related these changes to changes in diurnal and chronic cortisol levels. We observed increases in bilateral cornu ammonis volume ( CA1-3 ) following the 3 months compassion-based module targeting socio-affective skills ( Affect module ), as compared to socio-cognitive skills ( Perspective module ) or a waitlist cohort with no training intervention. Structural changes were paralleled by relative increases in functional connectivity of CA1-3 when fostering socio-affective as compared to socio-cognitive skills. Furthermore, training-induced changes in CA1-3 structure and function consistently correlated with reductions in cortisol output. Notably, using a multivariate approach, we found that other subfields that did not show group-level changes also contributed to changes in cortisol levels. Overall, we provide a link between a socio-emotional behavioural intervention, changes in hippocampal subfield structure and function, and reductions in cortisol in healthy adults.

   . To conclude, using a longitudinal model, we investigated how different types of mental training differentially result in changes in hippocampal subfield volume, resting-state functional networks, and stress-related markers of diurnal cortisol and hair cortisol. We find that only the 3 months Affect training module cultivating compassion and care, rather than attention-based ( Presence ) or socio-cognitive ( Perspective ) training, related to an increase of hippocampal CA1-3 subfield volume, with corresponding alterations in functional connectivity and a reduction in total diurnal cortisol output. Across analyses we observed consistent alterations between cortisol change and CA1-3 volume and function, pinpointing this region as a potential target for further investigations on stress and the human brain. Lastly, our multivariate analyses also point to a circuit level understanding of latent diurnal stress scores. Our results may be informative for the development of targeted interventions to reduce stress, and inspire the update of models on the role of different hippocampal formations for human socio-emotional and stress-related processes.

., 2010; Lupien et al., 1999; Lupien et al., 1998; Sudheimer et al., 2014 ) and, again, samples with psychiatric conditions ( Gold et al., 2010; Mondelli et al., 2010 ). While such inconsistencies in previous neuroimaging work may reflect the fact that different indices of diurnal cortisol tap different facets of HPA axis regulation, the samples studied have been diverse in terms of health status, small in size, and largely cross-sectional. In addition, associations between stress and hippocampal structure and function over time are incompletely understood. Thus, longitudinal studies, such as mental training studies aimed at stress reduction that repeatedly assess both brain and cortisol release, may help to better understand the dynamic relationships between stress, cortisol, and hippocampal structure and function. In recent years, contemplative mental training interventions, such as the mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) program ( Kabat-Zinn, 1982 ) or compassion-focused therapy ( Gilbert, 2014 ), have gained in popularity as potential therapeutic tools to improve mental and physical health ( Goldberg et al., 2018 ) and reducing stress ( Khoury et al., 2015 ). These mental training interventions can have a positive impact on the practitioner’s stress sensitivity, making them a suitable model to investigate the interrelationship between training-related changes in hippocampal structure, function, and cortisol output. Next to reductions in reactive measures following acute psychosocial stress induction in the laboratory ( Engert et al., 2017 ), reduced subjective-psychological stress load is the most widely reported outcome ( for a review, see Khoury et al., 2015 ). Evidence for lower diurnal cortisol output stems mainly from mindfulness-based interventions, notably MBSR, for which reductions in CAR and afternoon/evening cortisol levels have been reported in healthy and diseased individuals ( Brand et al

The goal of the current work was to investigate the effects of different types of mental training regimens on stress-related changes in the human hippocampus. The hippocampal formation is a highly plastic allocortical structure implicated in stress and emotional reactivity ( Chrousos, 2009; Sapolsky, 2000a; McEwen, 1999 ). In this study, we used automated segmentation to examine if the volumes of hippocampal subfields ( SUB, CA1-3, CA4/DG ) change in a large healthy sample over a 9-month longitudinal mental training study, the ReSource project ( Singer et al., 2016 ). We investigated whether three different interoceptive and social mental Training Modules could lead to changes in hippocampal subfield volume. Additionally, we explored if these changes were associated with alterations in both intrinsic brain function and stress-related physiological changes, as indicated by shifts in diurnal and hair cortisol levels due to training. When comparing the differential efficiency of the 3 months mental Training Modules Presence, Affect, and Perspective against each other and a retest-control group on hippocampal subfield structure, we observed consistent increases in bilateral CA1-3 volume following socio-emotional Affect training relative to socio-cognitive Perspective training and no training in retest controls. Moreover, alterations in structure were mirrored by changes in functional connectivity of right CA1-3 following Affect versus Perspective training. In particular, we observed relative increases of functional connectivity between right CA1-3 and mPFC, and decreases between left CA1-3 and posterior insula, mainly driven by changes in connectivity following Perspective training

. The results regarding changes in functional connectivity profiles were not as straightforward, but they did reveal a distinction between Affect and Perspective mental training in the CA1-3 region. Moreover, CA1-3 intrinsic functional change was associated with changes in diurnal cortisol slope and release, and long-term cortisol exposure. While the experimental nature of our training study allows concluding that CA1-3 structure changed as a function of Affect training, and that individual differences in CA1-3 structural change corresponded to cortisol release change, we cannot make any claims about which training-induced change caused the other. Thus, it is possible that, owing to the Affect module, the activation of emotion/motivation-related functional processes is key to reducing the daily stress load and associated cortisol release ( Klimecki et al., 2013; McCall and Singer, 2012 ). Such reduction in cortisol levels may then explain the observed downstream brain alterations. According to this interpretation, changes in CA1-3 volume may come secondary to stress reduction and consequently alterations in cortisol release following compassion training. Alternatively, emotion/compassion training may specifically targets CA volume and function, and, as per its role as the central break of the HPA axis, improves its capacity to inhibit cortisol release. This explanation could explain the lack of average diurnal cortisol ( i. e., AUCg ) change following Affect training per se ( Engert et al., 2023 ), as it may be relevant for individual variations in brain change and thus be more difficult to detect based only on average change per module. In sum, it is likely that observed alterations in hippocampal structure and function, as well as their associations with diurnal cortisol change, are not explained by a single mechanism, but rather result as a combination of different factors

. To close these gaps, we here investigate the differential efficiency of three types of mental training ( attention-based, socio-affective and socio-cognitive ) on their ability to induce structural as well as functional plasticity of hippocampal subfields and reduce diurnal cortisol levels. The hippocampus has a high glucocorticoid receptor density ( Herman and Cullinan, 1997; Herman et al., 1995; Jacobson and Sapolsky, 1991; McEwen, 2013 ), making this region a target of investigations into stress-related brain changes. Having a three layered allocortex, the hippocampal formation consists of multiple subfields, or zones, starting at the subiculum ( SUB ) and moving inward to the hippocampus proper, the cornu ammonis ( CA1-3 ), and dentate gyrus ( CA4/DG ) ( Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2020; Wisse et al., 2017; Yushkevich et al., 2015; DeKraker et al., 2018 ). These subfields have unique microstructure ( Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2020; Wisse et al., 2017; Yushkevich et al., 2015; DeKraker et al., 2018; Paquola et al., 2020 ) and participate differently in the hippocampal circuitry ( de Flores et al., 2017 ), likely implicating different functional contributions ( Hodgetts et al., 2017; Berron et al., 2016; Plachti et al. 2017 ) to stress-related processes. In this study, we focused on the CA-3 subfield, as it has been implicated in stress-related memory and emotional processes ( McEwen,1999; Sapols,200a; Chos,2009 ) and has been shown to be responsive to training ( Singer et al,2016 ). We used longitudinal resting-state fMRI to examine changes in intrinsic functional connectivity of CA-3 following training, as well as diurnal and chronic cortisol levels. We found increases in CA-3 volume following socio-affective training compared to socio-cognitive training and waitlist controls, paralleled by increases in functional connectivity of CA-3. Moreover, changes in CA-3 structure and function correlated with reductions in diurnal and chronic cortisol. Our results provide a link between socio-emotional intervention, hippocal subfield structure and function, and reductions in cortisol in healthy adults.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Local adaptation commonly involves alleles of large effect, which experience fitness advantages when in positive linkage disequilibrium ( LD ). Because segregating inversions suppress recombination and facilitate the maintenance of LD between locally adapted loci, they are also commonly found to be associated with adaptive divergence. However, it is unclear what fraction of an adaptive response can be attributed to inversions and alleles of large effect, and whether the loci within an inversion could still drive adaptation in the absence of its recombination-suppressing effect. Here, we use genome-wide association studies to explore patterns of local adaptation in three species of sunflower: Helianthus annuus, Helianthus argophyllus, and Helianthus petiolaris, which each harbour a large number of species-specific inversions. We find evidence of significant genome-wide repeatability in signatures of association to phenotypes and environments, which are particularly enriched within regions of the genome harbouring an inversion in one species. This shows that while inversions may facilitate local adaptation, at least some of the loci can still harbour mutations that make substantial contributions without the benefit of recombination suppression in species lacking a segregating inversion. While a large number of genomic regions show evidence of repeated adaptation, most of the strongest signatures of association still tend to be species-specific, indicating substantial genotypic redundancy for local adaptation in these species.

   . If most alleles have small effects relative to migration rate and can only contribute to local adaptation via the benefit of the recombination-suppressing effect of an inversion, then we would expect little repeatability at the site of an inversion – other species lacking the inversion would not tend to use that same region for adaptation because selection would be too weak for alleles to persist. On the other hand, if some loci are particularly important for local adaptation and regularly yield mutations of large effect, with these patterns being conserved among species, repeatability within regions harbouring inversions may be substantial. Thus, studying whether adaptation at the same genomic region harbouring an inversion is observed in other species lacking the inversion can give insights about the underlying architecture of adaptation, and the evolution and maintenance of inversions. Here, we explore the repeatability of local adaptation in three species of sunflowers, Helianthus annuus, Helianthus argophyllus, and Helianthus petiolaris ( Figure 1 ), which harbour large regions of suppressed recombination ( ‘haploblocks’ ), most of which are inversions, and are often associated with adaptive traits ( Todesco et al., 2020 ). H. annuus, the common sunflower, is the closest wild relative of cultivated sunflower, which was domesticated from it around 4000 years ago ( Blackman et al., 2011 ). Populations of H. annuus are distributed throughout the central and western United States and generally found on mesic soils, but can grow in a variety of disturbed or extreme habitats, such as semi-desertic or frequently flooded areas, as well as salt marshes. H. petiolaris, the prairie sunflower, prefers sandier soils, and ecotypes of this species are adapted to sand sheets and sand dunes ( Ostevik et al., 2016 ). Here we include samples from two subspecies: H. petiolaris ssp

. Taken together, our results show that local adaptation in sunflowers tends to involve both strong repeatability at a small number of genes, often associated with inversions, coupled with high redundancy and non-repeated responses across a much larger number of loci.

. If there is variation across the genome in the density of loci with the potential to be involved in local adaptation, then the establishment and maintenance of inversions would be biased towards regions harbouring a high density of such loci under this model. If the genomic basis for local adaptation is conserved amongst species, then these same regions are more likely to have high repeatability. Thus, our observation of genomic regions harbouring inversions also being enriched for WRAs is consistent with this general model for inversion evolution. Unfortunately, our observations do not provide much insight into whether inversions evolve through the capture ( e. g. Kirkpatrick and Barton, 2006 ) or accumulation ( e. g. Schaal et al., 2022 ) type of model as either model would be consistent with our results. Most of the sunflower inversions are >1 My old, and therefore predate any current local adaptation patterns, but likely do not predate the genes underlying local adaptation ( which appear to be shared among the species we studied ). As for the alleles underlying local adaptation, they may be younger than the inversions, but as our work suggests, these regions are prone to harbouring locally adaptive alleles, so it is possible that they also harboured other ancestral locally adaptive alleles. While many studies have demonstrated the importance of inversions for adaptation ( Wellenreuther and Bernatchez, 2018; Hager et al., 2022 ), to our knowledge only two other studies have documented the involvement of the same loci making contributions in the absence of the recombination-suppressing effect of the inversion ( Lee et al., 2017; Coughlan and Willis, 2019 )

. Inversions can facilitate local adaptation by suppressing recombination between locally adapted alleles within the inverted vs. ancestral haplotypes ( Kirkpatrick and Barton, 2006 ). If a given species exhibits a signature of association to environment at a segregating inversion, it is interesting to test whether similar signatures of association are found in other species that lack a segregating inversion at the same region of the genome. This would suggest that particularly strong selection is acting on loci in this region, as signatures of association can still evolve even without the recombination suppressing effect of the inversion. While not all of the low-recombination haploblocks identified by Todesco et al., 2020 have been validated as inversions, for simplicity we treat each haploblock as representative of a segregating inversion. The majority of these haploblocks are present as segregating variation in only one of the three species, but when they occur in H. petiolaris, they tend to be found as segregating variation within both subspecies. Thus, if we find significant enrichment of the regions of repeated association ( WRAs and CRAs ) within haploblocks, this suggests that both the species with a segregating inversion and the species lacking an inversion are using this region of the genome to drive local adaptation. As a first test of this relationship, we assessed two-way contingency tables for whether top candidate windows within a species were also significant WRA ( WRA/non-WRA ) and whether they fell within haploblocks ( yes/no ). This approach controls for the potential enrichment of top candidate windows within haploblocks relative to the rest of the genome and asks if the proportion of WRAs within haploblocks is even higher than non-WRA top candidate windows

Despite its critical importance in shaping the architecture of adaptation, little is known about the extent of genotypic redundancy underlying different traits ( Barghi et al., 2020; Láruson et al., 2020; Yeaman, 2022 ). Here, we have shown evidence of significant repeatability in the basis of local adaptation ( Figures 4 and 5 ), but also an abundance of species-specific, non-repeated signatures ( Figure 3; Appendix 1—figure 14 ). In particular, we find that regions of the genome that harbour inversions in one species also tend to be strongly enriched for signatures of association in other species lacking the inversion ( Figure 5 ). Taken together, this suggests that local adaptation in these species is highly flexible – different species apparently use quite different sets of loci to adapt to the same environment – yet still involves some component that has minimal redundancy, with inversions playing a particularly important role. Some of the ‘usual suspects’ show up in the set of significantly repeated loci identified by PicMin: in addition to the homologs of the FT ( FLOWERING LOCUS T ) gene reported by Todesco et al., 2020, we also found hits for several other genes involved in circadian regulation and flowering time, including PRR3 ( Para et al., 2007 ), TOE1 ( Aukerman and Sakai, 2003 ), and PHYC ( Takano et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2014 ), which is known to regulate photoperiodic responses in Arabidopsis accessions ( Balasubramanian et al., 2006 ). Other top hits included genes involved in plant development and auxin transport ( PIN3 [Keuskamp et al., 2010], ARF4 [Pekker et al., 2005], and MN [Bhatia et al., 2016] ), and plant immunity ( CRK13 [Acharya et al., 2007] and PRR2 [Cheval et al., 2017] ). The increased repeatability found in regions of the genome that harbour inversions in only one species is particularly interesting

Local Adaptation commonly involves alleles of large effect which experience fitness advantages in linkage disequilibrium (LD). Segregating inversions suppress recombination and facilitate the maintenance of LD between locally adapted loci, they are commonly found to be associated with adaptive divergence. However, it is unclear what fraction of an adaptive response can be attributed to inversions of alleles of effect and the loci within an inversion could drive adaptation in the absence of recombination-suppressing effect. Here, we genome-wide association studies explore patterns of local adaptation in three species of sunflower: Helianthus annus, Helthus argyllus, and Helthus petolar, which harbour large of species-specific inversions. We find evidence of genome-wide repeatability signatures of association to phenotypes and environments, which are enriched regions of the genome harbouring an inversion in species. This shows that inversions may facilitate local adaptation, at least of the loci can still make substantial contributions without benefit recombination in species lacking segregating inversion. While large of genomic regions show evidence of adaptation, most the strongest signatures of association tend to be species-specific, indicating genic redundancy for local adaptation in these species.

    Abstract: Effects from aging in single cells are heterogenous, whereas at the organ- and tissue-levels aging phenotypes tend to appear as stereotypical changes. The mammary epithelium is a bilayer of two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages: luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Mammary luminal epithelia exhibit substantial stereotypical changes with age that merit attention because these cells are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers. We hypothesize that effects from aging that impinge upon maintenance of lineage fidelity increase susceptibility to cancer initiation. We generated and analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from younger <30 ( y ) ears old and older >55 y women. In addition to age-dependent directional changes in gene expression, we observed increased transcriptional variance with age that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. Age-dependent variant responses were common to both lineages, whereas directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and involved altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SATB1. Epithelial expression variance of gap junction protein GJB6 increased with age, and modulation of GJB6 expression in heterochronous co-cultures revealed that it provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells. Age-dependent luminal transcriptomes comprised a prominent signal that could be detected in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers. A machine learning classifier based on luminal-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was highly predictive of breast cancer subtype. We speculate that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue, and that their emergent phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and represents a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility.

    Our studies show how directional and variant responses that contribute to aging biology are integrated in breast tissue of older women. We show that increased variances in the transcriptomic profiles of mammary epithelial lineages across individuals is a significant outcome of the aging process and is likely central to our understanding of the increased susceptibility to breast cancers with age. Strikingly, LEPs can integrate age-dependent signals from MEPs and almost exclusively exhibit the stereotyped, directional changes seen in aging epithelia that comprise a prominent signal detected in bulk tissue. Age-dependent directional and variant changes in LEPs even shape the tissue-level expression of predictive biomarkers that classify normal tissue and breast cancer subtypes, illustrating how age-dependent dysregulation in LEPs may play a key role in tissue transformation into frank cancers. We also demonstrate how increased molecular noise during aging may lead to significant variances in the transcriptomes between aged individuals and propose that this mechanism could underlie differences in susceptibility to development of breast cancers, particularly luminal breast cancer subtypes. Because cancer susceptibility indicates a state that could be more easily pushed towards cancer initiation, we can consider the variances between aged individuals to occupy multiple metastable states, some of which represent susceptible phenotypes that can be perturbed towards development of specific cancers. We speculate that these variance-driven changes are examples of age-dependent priming events that push epithelial cells towards metastable states susceptible to malignant transformation. Therefore, the degree to which breast-cancer associated genes are variably expressed across the different cell populations of the breast and across different individuals may explain why breast cancers develop in only a subset of women in a subtype-specific manner.

., 2010 ). Luminal epithelial cells ( LEPs ) are apically located and include subpopulations of estrogen receptor negative ( ER- ) secretory cells, which represent 80–95% of luminal cells in breast tissue, and ER positive cells ( ER+ ) ( Booth and Smith, 2006 ). We previously demonstrated loss of lineage fidelity in breast epithelia as an aging phenomenon—in which the faithfulness of expression of established lineage-specific markers diminishes with age without loss of the lineage-specificity of other canonical markers nor of the gross phenotypic and histological differences between LEPs and MEPs ( Miyano et al., 2017 ). Although our earlier work focused on a few select LEP-specific and MEP-specific markers, we hypothesized that the aging mechanisms we observed could impinge upon genome-wide maintenance of lineage fidelity and could thus be potential drivers of susceptibility to cancer initiation in breast tissue. Here, we demonstrate how age-dependent directional and variant transcriptional responses integrate in breast epithelia and explain how these changes could lead to increased susceptibility to cancer initiation. Directional responses reflect stereotyped changes associated with upregulation or downregulation of gene expression between younger and older cohorts; variant responses reflect increases in gene expression variance within a cohort associated with the heterogeneity of individuals within a group. Through transcriptomic profiling of primary LEPs and MEPs, we found that loss of lineage fidelity in gene expression with age was a genome-wide phenomenon. We identified two models mediating loss of lineage fidelity in breast epithelia with age: ( i ) via directional changes identified through differential expression ( DE ) analysis; and ( ii ) via an increase in variances identified through differential variability ( DV ) analysis

. Age-dependent DE explained part of the observed loss of lineage fidelity, while our model of the overall increase in variances with age also accounted for a comparable fraction of this loss. Directional changes in expression with age strikingly occurred almost exclusively in luminal cells, whereas changes in variance were found in both lineages. Genome-wide directional changes in gene expression in LEPs involved dysregulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SATB1 with age. We also detected this dysregulation in bulk tissue that consist of all lineages of the stroma and epithelia. Loss of lineage fidelity led to enrichment of genes and biological processes commonly dysregulated in cancers, and altered the LEP-MEP interactome that was significantly modulated by apical cell-cell junction proteins, such as GJB6. Modulating GJB6 expression via shRNA in MEPs was sufficient to reduce the rate of molecular aging of adjacent LEPs as determined with a breast-specific biological clock. Using machine learning, we showed that genes that had age-dependent directional and variable changes in normal LEPs had predictive value in distinguishing normal breast tissue from breast cancers and in classifying breast cancer PAM50 subtypes. Age-dependent changes in LEPs reflected dysregulation of biological processes that are convergent with breast cancer. The degree and variability of age-dependent changes across individuals may explain the differential susceptibility between individuals to breast cancer initiation, and to the development of specific breast cancer subtypes.

. The breast is an excellent model system for examining aging at the cellular and molecular levels because normal tissue from individuals spanning the adult lifespan is available from common cosmetic and prophylactic surgeries. Cultured pre-stasis human mammary epithelial cells ( HMEC ) support growth of breast epithelial cell lineages from women across the lifespan ( Garbe et al., 2009; Labarge et al., 2013 ) and enable detailed, reproducible molecular studies of cancer progression ( Stampfer et al., 2013 ). Moreover, there are well-established lineage-specific markers and cell-sorting protocols that facilitate experimentation at lineage-specific resolution. Furthermore, breast tissue provides an ideal model for studying aging-associated cancer susceptibility as 82% of new breast cancers are diagnosed in women ≥ 50 y ( DeSantis et al., 2019 ). Directional changes in gene expression with age have been reported in whole breast tissue, including changes associated with biological processes involved in breast cancer ( Lee and Lee, 2017; Yau et al., 2007 ). However, aging is also associated with significant shifts in proportions of breast cell lineages, including epithelial and stromal populations ( Benz, 2008; Garbe et al., 2012 ). Thus, it is unclear how tissue-level molecular changes during normal aging reflect changes in cell-intrinsic and microenvironment states. Lineage-specific analyses are needed to unravel such mechanisms. The mammary epithelium, the origin of breast carcinomas, is a bilayer of two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages—myoepithelial cells ( MEPs ) and luminal epithelial cells ( LEPs ). MEPs are basally located and contractile and have tumor suppressive properties ( Pandey et al., 2010 )

. p<0. 05 ). Expanding our criteria to include genes with at least a two-fold change in DE due to age, we found that these age-related changes accounted for only 21% of the observed loss in lineage-specific expression. This led to a notable reduction in the difference in expression levels between LEP- and MEP-specific genes in older cells ( Figure 3E ). Further analysis showed that the age-related DE genes in LEPs and MEPs did not overlap with genes associated with obesity, parity, or time since full-term pregnancy in breast tissue ( Burkholder et al., 2020; Santucci-Pereira et al., 2019; Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B ). Collectively, although these results indicate that age-dependent DE changes do contribute to the loss of lineage fidelity, they do not fully account for it. Next, we explored the alternate model that incorporated measures of variance as an explanation for the loss of lineage-specific expression in older epithelia ( Figure 3Aii ). Gene expression means and variances of LEPs and MEPs from younger cells were categorized and compared to those from older cells. We found that age-related variances in LEP and MEP were significantly higher than those in younger cells ( Figure 3C ), indicating increased variance in gene expression with age in both lineages. Variance in LEP was higher than in MEP ( Figure 3D ), consistent with the notion that Ls are more susceptible to age-related changes. Variance in MEP was also higher than in Ls ( Figure 3 ), suggesting that MEPs are also affected by age-related changes, but to a lesser extent. Variance in both lineages increased with age ( Figure 3 ), consistent with the notion that age-related variances contribute to loss of lineage fidelity. Variance in LEP and MEP were positively correlated ( Figure 3 ), indicating that changes in one lineage are associated with changes in the other. Variance in L and MEP were negatively correlated ( Figure 3 ), suggesting that changes in one lineage are not associated with changes in the other. Variance in L and MEP were positively correlated with age ( Figure 3 ), indicating that age-related changes in one lineage are associated with age-related changes in the other. Variance L and MEP were negatively correlated with age ( Figure 3 ), suggesting that age-related changes in one are not associated with age-related changes the. Variance in L and MEP were positively correlated ( Figure 3 ) indicating that age-related changes in one are associated with age-related changes the. Variance L and MEP were negatively correlated ( Figure 3 ) suggesting that age-related changes one are not associated age-related changes. Variance in L and MEP were positively correlated ( Figure 3 ) indicating age-related changes one are associated age-related changes. Variance L and MEP were negatively correlated ( Figure 3 ) suggesting age-related changes are not age-related. Variance in L and MEP were positively ( Figure 3 ) indicating age-related changes are age-related. Variance L MEP were negatively ( Figure 3 ) suggesting age-related are not age. Variance L and MEP were positively ( Figure 3 ) indicating age-related are age. Vari L and MEP were negatively ( Figure 3 ) suggesting age are not.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Understanding the genomic basis of natural variation in plant pest resistance is an important goal in plant science, but it usually requires large and labor-intensive phenotyping experiments. Here, we explored the possibility that non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing can serve as phenotyping proxies for addressing such questions. We used data from a whole-genome and -epigenome sequencing study of 207 natural lines of field pennycress ( Thlaspi arvense ) that were grown in a common environment and spontaneously colonized by aphids, mildew, and other microbes. We found that the numbers of non-target reads assigned to the pest species differed between populations, had significant SNP-based heritability, and were associated with climate of origin and baseline glucosinolate contents. Specifically, pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, presumably less favorable to aphids, showed higher aphid DNA load, i. e., decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants at known defense genes but also novel genomic regions associated with variation in aphid and mildew DNA load. Moreover, we found several differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads, in particular differential methylation at transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure, likely induced by pathogens. Our study provides first insights into the defense mechanisms of Thlaspi arvense, a rising crop and model species, and demonstrates that non-target whole-genome sequencing reads, usually discarded, can be leveraged to estimate intensities of plant biotic interactions. With rapidly increasing numbers of large sequencing datasets worldwide, this approach should have broad application in fundamental and applied research.

   ., 2019; Zhao et al., 2021 ). In a previous study, we investigated natural epigenetic variation in a collection of 207 Thlaspi lines from across Europe ( Galanti et al., 2022 ). Prior to their whole-genome ( WGS ) and -epigenome sequencing these lines had been grown in a common environment, an open glasshouse where the plants were spontaneously colonized by aphids and powdery mildew, as well as by other microbes. At the time of sequencing, pathogen contamination was still very limited but appeared highly variable, and preliminary analyses showed that it resulted in sizeable amounts of non-target reads assigned to the pest species, i. e., contamination of the DNA samples. Inspired by other recent studies on non-target reads ( Sangiovanni et al., 2019; Roman-Reyna et al., 2020; Gathercole et al., 2021 ), we asked if there was systematic variation in the numbers of aphid and pathogen reads among different T. arvense lines, and whether these data, together with our whole-genome plant sequencing data, could provide insights into the genomic basis of plant resistance variation. The goals of our study were thus twofold: ( i ) to contribute to a mechanistic understanding of pest resistance in T. arvense, and ( ii ) to explore whether non-target reads from plant sequencing can be used as proxies for studying plant biotic interactions. Considering that we are moving toward an increasingly sequencing-prone world, with more and larger datasets being generated for many species ( Kajiya-Kanegae et al., 2021; Colgan et al., 2022; Habyarimana et al., 2022; Mekbib et al., 2022; Metheringham et al., 2022; Nocchi et al., 2022; Friis et al., 2024 ), the use of non-target reads has very broad potential.

Plant pests are a major threat to food safety, causing large yield losses, and new crops such as the potential biofuel plant T. arvense must be able to resist pathogen and herbivore attacks. A powerful source for obtaining resistant varieties is natural variation in plant defenses, but phenotyping large collections can be very time-consuming and error-prone. Here, we describe how an unplanned pest infestation in a glasshouse experiment, together with available WGS data, can be used to estimate aphid, mildew, and microbial loads, and thus variation in plant resistance. The approach is straightforward, makes use of WGS data without microbiome-specific DNA extraction, and can in principle be applied to many other situations such as field experiments. It is not error-free, but we highlight some potential pitfalls, show how to reduce noise, and illustrate its potential to detect associations with climatic, genetic, and epigenetic variation. An important first step in our analyses was the identification and classification of pest-related reads in the plant WGS data. We began by classifying all reads as target ( only mapping to T. arvense ), ambiguous ( mapping to T. arvense and at the same time to at least one of the pest genomes ), or exogenous ( not mapping to T. arvense ) ( Figure 1A ). We demonstrated the importance of removing ambiguous reads prior to variant calling, as this prevented calling false positive variants caused by exogenous DNA that also mapped to highly conserved or repetitive sequences in the T. arvense genome. We then classified the exogenous reads using MG-RAST ( Meyer et al., 2008; Keegan et al., 2016 ) or by confident mapping to specific pest genomes, and selected the 11 most relevant and/or abundant taxonomic groups to focus our analyses on. To obtain unbiased pest/microbe loads we also corrected the read counts for the total number of deduplicated reads of each sample

. e., possibly reflecting heritable variation in plant resistance, we next tested for population differences and SNP-based heritability in pest and microbiome read counts. Prior to these analyses, to avoid biases caused by different sequencing depths, we corrected the read counts for the total numbers of deduplicated reads in each library and used the residuals as unbiased estimates of aphid, mildew, and microbe loads ( see Materials and methods ). For most of the nine taxonomic groups, there were significant population effects, with 20–40% of the variance in read counts explained, as well as significant SNP-based heritability, typically in the range of 0. 18–0. 30 ( Table 1 ). The highest heritability of 0. 47 was for read counts of Erysiphales, indicating particularly strong variation for resistance to mildew. Both SNP-based heritability and population differences tended to be stronger for aphid and Buchnera data based on read mapping to the reference genomes than for those based on MG-RAST, demonstrating that the former method is more informative and thus preferable if high-quality genome assemblies are available. An alternative explanation for different aphid and mildew loads in the greenhouse could be that variation in enemy densities in the field was transmitted to the greenhouse, through maternal carry-over effects, or even as seed contamination. However, we had recorded aphid and mildew occurrence during seed sampling in the field and found no significant differences in the glasshouse between the offspring of plants that had been attacked in the field vs. those that had not ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Having established that our method most likely captured variation in plant resistance, we were interested in the ecological drivers of this variation. As climate is known to be a major influence on many biotic interactions as well as plant defenses ( Züst et al., 2012; Gao et al

Starting from our previously published sequencing data ( Galanti et al., 2022 ), the first step of our analysis was to separate the WGS reads of each sample into the ~99. 5% mapping to the T. arvense reference genome ( Nunn et al., 2022 ) and the ~0. 5% that did not, hereafter called ‘exogenous reads’ ( Figure 1A ). Initially, we used all mapped reads for calling variants in Thlaspi, but after some difficulties with genome-wide association ( GWA ) analyses ( see below ) we suspected that some plant reads were false and mapped to the T. arvense genome only because of the high cross-taxa similarity of some genomic regions. We therefore remapped all reads to the genomes of the aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, its endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola and the powdery mildew Blumeria graminis, and found that, on average, 7. 4% of the reads mapped to both T. arvense and at least one of the pests. We removed these ambiguous reads from our analyses and used only the T. arvense target reads, 92. 1% on average, for variant calling ( Figure 1A, Supplementary file 1 ). We next attempted a taxonomic classification of the exogenous reads, in multiple steps. First, we used MG-RAST ( Meyer et al., 2008; Keegan et al., 2016 ) to assign reads to taxonomic groups based on public sequencing databases. Out of the 78% of the exogenous reads that passed the MG-RAST quality control ( Supplementary file 1 ) the majority belonged to bacteria and smaller fractions to fungi, plants, and animals ( Figure 1B and Supplementary file 2 ). For subsequent group-level analyses, we then focused on nine taxonomic groups that occurred consistently within our samples ( Figure 1B and Supplementary file 2 ) and selected the 11 most abundant and/or relevant for further analysis. To obtain unbiased estimates of pest/micro loads, we corrected the read counts for the total number of deduplicated reads in each sample ( see Materials and methods ) and used the residuals as unbiased estimates of aphid, mild, and microbe loads. For the nine taxonomic groups, there were significant population effects, with 20–40% of the variance in counts explained, as well as SNP-based heritability typically in the range 0.18–.30 ( Table 1 ) The highest heritability 0.47 was for counts of Erysales indicating strong variation in resistance to mild. SNP-based herit and population tended to be stronger for aph and Bucha data based on mapping to reference genomes than those based on MGST demonstrating that the former is more informative if high-quality assemblies are available. An alternative explanation for aphid and mild loads in greenhouse could be variation in enemy densities in field transmitted to greenhouse through maternal carry-over or seed contamination. However, we recorded aph and mild during sampling in field and found no differences in glasshouse between offspring that had attacked field vs not ( Figure 1— supplement ) Having established our method likely captured variation plant resistance, we interested ecological drivers of variation As climate known major influence many biotic plant defenses ( Z et al 2012 Gao et al 2013 ) we examined climate origin of T arse lines and found that those from cold thermally fluctuating habitats presumably less favorable to aph showed higher aphid load i. e decreased resistance Genome-wide association analyses identified variants known defense genes but novel regions associated with aphid and mildew load.

Here is a clear and concise summary of the research article:

The study aimed to investigate the genomic basis of natural variation in plant resistance to pests using non-target reads from plant sequencing data. The researchers used whole-genome and epigen sequencing data from 207 lines of the plant species Thlas arse that were grown in a common environment and colonized by aphids, mildew, and microbes. They found that the number of non-target reads assigned to the species differed between populations, had significant SNP-based heritability, and were associated with climate origin and glucosinolate content. The lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, presumably less favorable to aphids, showed higher aphid load, i.e., decreased resistance. Genome-wide analyses identified genetic variants at defense genes and novel regions associated with aphid and mildew load. Differentially methylated regions were associated with pathogen loads, particularly methylation of transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure likely by pathogens. The study demonstrates that non-target whole-genome sequencing, usually discarded, can be leveraged to estimate intensities of plant biotic interactions.

Key findings:

* Non-target reads from plant sequencing can be used as proxies for studying plant biotic interactions
* Significant variation in numbers of aphid and pathogen reads among T. arse lines
* SNP-based heritability and population differences in pest and microbiome counts
* Climate origin and glucosolate content associated with aphid load
* Genome-wide analyses identified variants defense genes and novel regions associated with aphid and mildew load
* Differentially methylated regions associated pathogen loads, particularly methylation transpos and hypethylation in promoter of gene involved in stomatal closure

    Title: 
    Abstract: Drug resistance remains a major obstacle to malaria control and eradication efforts, necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat this disease. Drug combinations based on collateral sensitivity, wherein resistance to one drug causes increased sensitivity to the partner drug, have been proposed as an evolutionary strategy to suppress the emergence of resistance in pathogen populations. In this study, we explore collateral sensitivity between compounds targeting the Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( DHODH ). We profiled the cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity phenotypes of several DHODH mutant lines to a diverse panel of DHODH inhibitors. We focus on one compound, TCMDC-125334, which was active against all mutant lines tested, including the DHODH C276Y line, which arose in selections with the clinical candidate DSM265. In six selections with TCMDC-125334, the most common mechanism of resistance to this compound was copy number variation of the dhodh locus, although we did identify one mutation, DHODH I263S, which conferred resistance to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265. We found that selection of the DHODH C276Y mutant with TCMDC-125334 yielded additional genetic changes in the dhodh locus. These double mutant parasites exhibited decreased sensitivity to TCMDC-125334 and were highly resistant to DSM265. Finally, we tested whether collateral sensitivity could be exploited to suppress the emergence of resistance in the context of combination treatment by exposing wildtype parasites to both DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 simultaneously. This selected for parasites with a DHODH V532A mutation which were cross-resistant to both compounds and were as fit as the wildtype parent in vitro. The emergence of these cross-resistant, evolutionarily fit parasites highlights the mutational flexibility of the DHODH enzyme.

    Antimicrobial resistance threatens our ability to combat multiple infectious agents, and is widely recognized as one of the greatest public health threats of the 21st century ( Jee et al., 2018 ). Globally, drug resistance is a recurring obstacle in efforts to control many endemic infectious diseases, and malaria is no exception. The emergence of resistance in Plasmodium parasite populations and subsequent treatment failure has been documented for all antimalarial drugs in clinical use, including frontline artemisinin combination therapies ( Haldar et al., 2018 ). Thus, there is an ongoing need to develop a next generation of drugs targeting distinct vulnerabilities of Plasmodium parasites. Additionally, understanding the pathways and susceptibility to drug resistance is important to assess next-generation antimalarials, ideally while they are still early in the development process. Inhibitors targeting the Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( DHODH ) offer an illustrative example. DHODH is an electron transport chain protein that catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate in orotic acid, which is the rate-limiting step of pyrimidine biosynthesis. In Plasmodium, this reaction is dependent on flavin mononucleotide and ubiquinone cofactors and is coupled to mitochondrial respiration. Because Plasmodium lacks pyrimidine scavenging pathways, this enzyme is essential for parasite growth and survival ( Phillips and Rathod, 2010 ). Multiple high-throughput screens have identified DHODH as a drug target in Plasmodium falciparum ( Baldwin et al., 2005; Pavadai et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2008; Ross et al., 2018; Phillips et al., 2008 ), and the triazolopyrimidine-based DHODH inhibitor DSM265 was developed as a clinical antimalarial candidate ( Phillips et al., 2015 ). While the clinical DHODH inhibitor candidate DSM265 showed promising activity in pre-clinical and clinical studies ( Llanos-Cuentas et al., 2018; McCarthy et al

The main conclusion of our study is that combining two DHODH inhibitors, DSM265 and TCDC-125334, based on their collateral sensitivity profiles fails to prevent the emergence of resistance in P. falciparum in vitro. Although all previously identified mutations that we tested exhibited sensitivity to TCMDC-125334, we identified the point mutation DHODH I263S in selection with TCMDC-125334 alone, which was resistant to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265. We found that sequentially treating a collaterally sensitive mutant line with TCMDC-125334 selected for parasites with additional genetic changes in dhodh, including the DHODH F227Y mutation, which alone also confers resistance to TCMDC-125334. While the DHODH C276Y/F227Y double mutant is less sensitive than the DHODH C276Y parent, it is still more sensitive to TCMDC-125334 compared to wildtype parasites. Finally, we found that treatment with DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 in combination selected for cross-resistant parasites with a DHODH V532A mutation. We also demonstrated that the DHODH V532A mutation does not exhibit a fitness cost in in vitro competitive growth assays. While we identified three point mutations in this study that confer resistance to TCMDC-125334, the majority of dhodh mutations tested thus far are sensitive to this molecule. CNV was a common mechanism of resistance to TCMDC-125334 across multiple independent selections. Three of four populations of wildtype 3D7 A10 selected with TCMDC-125334 exhibited increased copy number of dhodh. When we selected the collaterally sensitive DHODH C276Y line with TCMDC-125334, clones isolated from two of three independent populations exhibited two- to fourfold CNV of dhodh. In contrast to this, the majority of in vitro selections with DSM265 and DSM267 selected for point mutations in the dhodh locus, with CNVs occurring only seldomly ( Mandt et al., 2019 )

., 2022 ). Collateral sensitivity has also been observed between compounds targeting different subunits of the Plasmodium proteasome Pf20S ( Kirkman et al., 2018; Stokes et al., 2019 ), between different chemotypes targeting the P-Type Cation-Transporter ATPase 4 ( PfATP4 ) ( Flannery et al., 2015 ), and between compounds targeting the Qo and Qi sites of cytochrome b ( Lukens et al., 2015 ). We have also previously shown that collateral sensitivity occurs during the evolution of resistance to Plasmodium DHODH inhibitors. Mutations in dhodh conferring resistance to one inhibitor can alter the enzyme such that it becomes more sensitive to inhibition by other, structurally distinct compounds ( Lukens et al., 2014; Ross et al., 2014 ). The existence of collateral sensitivity among a wide range of antimalarial inhibitors suggests a promising opportunity to exploit this phenomenon to block the emergence of resistant parasites ( Lukens et al., 2014 ). In an effort to expand this work, we screened antimalarial libraries from GSK, and successfully identified several compounds with increased activities against DHODH mutants relative to wildtype parasites ( Ross et al., 2018 ). In this study, we test the hypothesis that combining two DHODH inhibitors based on their collateral sensitivity profiles would suppress the emergence of resistant parasites. We focused on the compound TCMDC-125334, a DHODH inhibitor that exhibited increased activity against all mutant lines tested, including those that arose during selection with the clinical candidate DSM265. We used in vitro resistance selections to characterize the pathways to resistance for TCMDC-125334 and then tested whether parasites develop resistance in the context of combined treatment with DSM265 and TCMDC-125334.

Previously, we screened GSK chemical libraries from the Tres Cantos Antimalarial Set for activity against either wildtype or DHODH mutant parasites ( Supplementary file 1a; Ross et al., 2018 ). In an extended cross-resistance analysis, we characterized the activity of 17 compounds against three additional DHODH mutant lines, DHODH C276Y, DHODH F227L, and DHODH F227L/L531F ( Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 1—source data 1 ). We visualized the log-transformed fold change in EC50 of each mutant relative to its parental line on a heatmap ( Figure 1B, Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 1—source data 1 ). Hierarchical clustering of this data reveals broad patterns of cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity. The DHODH C276Y, F227I, F227I/L527I, F227L, and F227L/L31F mutant lines have similar dose-response phenotypes. The DHODH E182D and I263F mutant lines also share similar cross-resistance profiles, as we previously reported ( Ross et al., 2018 ). In contrast, the DHODH L531F mutant line has a unique sensitivity phenotype ( Figure 1B ). This analysis also suggests some structure-activity relationships. Five related triazolopyrimidine-based compounds ( DSM265, DSM267, TCMDC-124402, TCMDC-124417, and TDC-125 ) have similar cross-resistance profiles ( Figure 1B ), while TDC-125 and TDC-124 are more active against DHH C276 than DSM and DSM ( Figure 1— supplement 1, Figure 1—source 1 ). The triazopyrimidine TDC-125 exhibited increased activity against all mutant lines tested, including DH C276 ( Figure 1, Figure— supplement 1, Figure— 1source 1 ).
A novel compartmental model was developed to investigate the relationship between malaria transmission intensity and drug resistance. The model tracks sensitive and resistant strains, as well as host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity. Results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance, regardless of resistance cost or efficacy. Validation using chloroquine-resistant data supports this trend. Post-discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions, while decreasing in high-divers, high-trans regions. The study underscores the critical role of malaria diversity in biogeographic patterns of resistance.

 The model predicts an equilibrium of resistance under persistent drug usage, which cannot be extrapolated to transient dynamics of drug introduction. A fast phase is associated with new resistant genotypes in both low and high-divers regions. Empirical comparison to Pfc 76, a mutation essential for chloro resistance, supports this. The model implies control protocols should vary by region and there is no one-size-fits cure for malaria worldwide. Regions of low prevalence, such as Southeast, long-term goals will not be aided by intensive treatment. In these, elimination through vector measures could proceed with little effect on resistance, whereas drug will cause fixation or fixation for prolonged time. In high-prevalence regions, such as sub-Saharan, prompt switching first-line and therapies will be robust against increases and resistance.

 The model links selection from drug usage with transmission through interaction between strain immunity, immunity, and host response. It relies on macaras modeling suitable for diseases with variation in co-infections and divers. Hosts are not tracked as infected or susceptible, but distribution of infections in classes is followed for within-host dynamics. Dynamics of genotypes are governed by opposing forces: selective from usage and cost. Both emerge from transmission, contrary to earlier models that set as fixed. A fraction of hosts is assumed treated upon infection, frequency is unrelated to intensity or requires other mechanisms for resistance in low-trans regions. Strain diversity has not been considered in models of resistance, yet orders differentiate antigen diversity among bioge zones drive differences epidemiological features.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Cannabis, the most consumed illicit psychoactive drug in the world, is increasingly used by pregnant women. However, while cannabinoid receptors are expressed in the early embryo, the impact of phytocannabinoids exposure on early embryonic processes is lacking. Here, we leverage a stepwise in vitro differentiation system that captures the early embryonic developmental cascade to investigate the impact of exposure to the most abundant phytocannabinoid, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ9-THC ). We demonstrate that Δ9-THC increases the proliferation of naive mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) but not of their primed counterpart. Surprisingly, this increased proliferation, dependent on the CB1 receptor binding, is only associated with moderate transcriptomic changes. Instead, Δ9-THC capitalizes on ESCs’ metabolic bivalence by increasing their glycolytic rates and anabolic capabilities. A memory of this metabolic rewiring is retained throughout differentiation to Primordial Germ Cell-Like Cells in the absence of direct exposure and is associated with an alteration of their transcriptional profile. These results represent the first in-depth molecular characterization of the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early stages of germline development.

    With greater social acceptance and legalization, cannabis use has increased worldwide ( Mennis et al., 2023; U. N Office on Drugs and Crime, 2022 ). Yet, the impact of such heightened use on reproductive functions, and in particular, on the earliest developmental stages is not well understood. Cannabis use directly alters adult male fertility and causes abnormal embryo implantation ( Lo et al., 2022 ). Using a well-characterized in vitro model of early embryonic differentiation events culminating in the differentiation of PGCLCs, our study is the first to shed light on the impact of Δ9-THC at these stages which unfold during the first trimester in humans ( Chabarria et al., 2016; Volkow et al., 2019; Young-Wolff et al., 2018 ). Our data revealed the differential effects of Δ9-THC on naïve and primed pluripotent stem cells, respectively represented by mouse ESCs and EpiLCs. In particular, exposure to Δ9-THC increased ESC proliferation which was in a similar range to what has been previously reported for human breast carcinoma cell lines ( about 30–50% between 10 nM and 1 µM of Δ9-THC ) ( Takeda et al., 2008 ). Differential expression and use of cannabinoid receptors on the surface of exposed cells have been shown to correlate with Δ9-THC proliferative phenotypes ( Galve-Roperh et al., 2013; Preet et al., 2008; Takeda et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2016 ). However, our experiments demonstrated that despite being required for Δ9-THC-induced proliferation in ESCs, CB1 expression did not significantly differ at the surface of ESCs and EpiLCs. Because Δ9-THC is a known perturbator of mitochondrial function as previously described in the central nervous system ( Bartova and Birmingham, 1976; Bénard et al., 2012 ), we studied the metabolic impact of its exposure in ESCs and EpiLCs. Our data indicate that, at 100 nM, Δ9-THC exposure increased the glycolytic rate in both ESCs and EpiLCs

., 2022 ). Data shows CB1 expression in the male and the female reproductive tracts, in the pre-implantation embryo and in the placenta ( Lo et al., 2022; Paria et al., 1995 ). In animal models as well as in humans, exposure to cannabis is associated with reduced fertility, decreased testis weight and sperm count, and impairment of embryo implantation ( Lo et al., 2022 ). In males, these effects are correlated with an alteration of the sperm transcriptome and epigenome ( Murphy et al., 2018; Osborne et al., 2020; Schrott and Murphy, 2020 ). Epidemiological evidence also indicates that Δ9-THC exposure is associated with long-lasting adverse effects, with exposures in parents affecting the offspring ( Smith et al., 2020; Szutorisz and Hurd, 2018 ). Despite this accumulating evidence, the molecular impact and mechanisms of Δ9-THC exposure at the earliest stages of germ cells development remain to be determined. Progression through states of pluripotency is controlled by metabolic reprogramming in the early mammalian embryo ( Verdikt and Allard, 2021; Zhang et al., 2018 ). Accordingly, cultured pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs ) exhibiting different developmental potentials are marked by specific metabolic signatures, similar to the ones displayed by their in vivo counterparts in the embryo. For instance, mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) are naïve PSCs that are functionally equivalent to the inner cell mass ( ICM ) of the E3. 5 preimplantation mouse blastocyst ( Nichols and Smith, 2009 ). The extended developmental potential of mouse ESCs is associated with their metabolic bivalence, as these cells rely on both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation for energy production

. During the development of the central nervous system, perinatal Δ9-THC exposure has also been associated with alteration in cell adhesion, with an impact on neuronal interactions and morphology ( Gómez et al., 2007; Keimpema et al., 2011; Kittler et al., 2000 ). Cell-cell adhesion is crucial in PGCs’ formation both in cell culture systems ( Okamura et al., 2003 ) as well as in vivo where it controls PGCs motility during their migration towards the developing somatic gonad ( Barton et al., 2016 ). Our results thus show that exposure to Δ9-THC prior to specification affects embryonic germ cells’ transcriptome and metabolome. This in turn could have adverse consequences on cell-cell adhesion with an impact on PGC normal development in vivo. Despite epidemiological evidence of cannabis exposure in parents being associated with adverse effects in the offspring ( Smith et al., 2020; Szutorisz and Hurd, 2018 ), the molecular mechanisms involved in the inheritance of exposure have not been extensively studied. In vitro models for germ cell development offer a unique opportunity for such studies ( Verdikt et al., 2022 ) and our work in mouse PGCLCs identifies metabolites as relevant carriers of information across developmental stages. While in vitro gametogenesis, up to the reconstitution of fully functional spermatozoa and oocytes, is a reality in mouse ( Hikabe et al., 2016; Komeya et al., 2018; Luo and Yu, 2021; Yamashiro et al., 2018 ), transposition to humans has been hindered by ethical and technical considerations ( Luo and Yu, 2021 ). For instance, protocols for human PGCLCs have been developed ( Gell et al., 2020 ) but proper induction to viable, fertile offspring cannot be verified ( Luo and Yu, 2021 ). Nevertheless, our preliminary results in hESCs show that Δ9-THC exposure negatively impacts their global energy metabolism ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 )

To model the impact of early Δ9-THC exposure on early embryonic events, we first tested three distinct developmental windows: ( 1 ) exposure of ESCs, ( 2 ) exposure of EpiLCs, and ( 3 ) combined ESCs +EpiLCs exposure ( Figure 1A ). Cells were either exposed to the vehicle ( mock ) or exposed to Δ9-THC in a wide dose range of 0. 1 nM-100µM, corresponding to the reported physiologically-relevant concentrations of Δ9-THC in cannabis users ( Fuchs Weizman et al., 2021; Hunault et al., 2009; Pacifici et al., 2020 ). The viability of ESCs exposed to increasing concentrations of Δ9-THC for 48 hr was not significantly altered until the maximal dose of 100 µM, subsequently serving as a positive control, at which only 13. 17% of cells remained alive ( Figure 1B, p=5. 10–15, unpaired T-test ). While no significant changes in viability were observed between 10 nM and 1 µM Δ9-THC, the number of viable ESCs significantly increased by 1. 69, 1. 52 and 1. 28-fold, respectively, compared to the mock-treated condition ( Figure 1C, p=0. 002, p=0. 01 and p=0. 03 for 10 nM, 100 nM and 1 µM of Δ9-THC, unpaired T-test ). Of note, the number of viable ESCs significantly increased for doses of Δ9-THC as low as 1 nM ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and, 0. 59-fold increase, p= 0.01 unpaired T-test ). In contrast, the number of Epi cells was not affected by Δ-TH exposure ( Figure 1C, p= 0. 5 unpaired T-test ). The increase in number of ESCs exposed to Δ-TH was dependent on the presence of CB receptor ( Figure 1D, p= 0.01 unpaired T-test ), whereas the number of Epi was not ( Figure 1, p= 0.5 unpaired-test ). The expression of CB on the surface of ESC and Epi did not differ ( Figure 1, p= 0.5 unpaired-test ), indicating that CB is not required for Δ-TH-induced proliferation in Epi. 

The impact of Δ-TH on ESC and Epi metabolism was studied by measuring glycolytic and anabolic rates ( Figure 2 ). Exposure to 100 nM Δ-TH increased glycol rate in both ESC and Epi ( Figure 2A, p= 0.01 and= 0.01 unpaired T-test ) and anabolic rate in ESC ( Figure 2, p= 0.01 unpaired-test ) but not in Epi ( Figure 2, p 0.5 unpaired-test ). The increase in glycol and anabolic rates in ESC exposed to 100M Δ-TH was not associated with significant changes in CB expression ( Figure 2,= 0.5 unpaired-test ), indicating that CB is not required for Δ-TH-induced metabolic rewiring in ESC. The increase in glycol and anabolic rates in ESC exposed to 100M ΔTH was associated with changes in transcriptome ( Figure 2, p 0.01 unpaired-test ). The transcriptome of ESC exposed to 100M ΔTH was distinct from that of mock-treated ESC ( Figure 2, p 0.01 unpaired-test ) and Epi ( Figure 2, 0.5 unpaired-test ). The transcriptome of ESC exposed 100 ΔTH was also distinct from that of Epi ( Figure 2, 0. unpaired-test ) indicating that Δ-TH exposure induces a unique transcriptome in ESC. The transcriptome of ESC exposed 100TH was associated with anabolic ( Figure 2, p 0.01 unpaired ) and glycol ( Figure 2, 0.01 unpaired ) but not with oxidative phosphorylation ( Figure 2, 0.5 unpaired ) The transcriptome of ESC exposed 100TH was associated with anabolic ( Figure 2, 0.01 ) and glycol (2, 0.01 ) but not oxidative phosphorylation (2,0.5 ) The transcript of ESC exposed 100TH was associated anabolic (2,0.01 ) and glycol (2,0.01 ) but not oxidative phosphorylation (2.5 ) The transcript of ESC exposed 100 was anabolic (0.01 ) glycol (0.01 ) but not oxidative phosphorylation (.5 ) The transcript of ESC 100 was anabolic (.01 gly. but not phosphorylation. The transcript of ESC 100 was anabolic gly but not phosphorylation The transcript of 100 was anabolic but not phosphorylation The transcript 100 was anabolic but not phosphorylation The transcript was anabolic but not phosphorylation The transcript was an but not phosphorylation The transcript an but phosphorylation was not The transcript but phosphorylation was not The but phosphorylation was not The but phosphorylation was not but The but was not phosphorylation but The was not but The was not but The was but The was but The was but The but The was The but The but The but The but The but The but The but The but The but The but The but The but The but The but The

    Title: 
    Abstract: Copy number variation in large gene families is well characterized for plant resistance genes, but similar studies are rare in animals. The zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) has hundreds of NLR immune genes, making this species ideal for studying this phenomenon. By sequencing 93 zebrafish from multiple wild and laboratory populations, we identified a total of 1513 NLRs, many more than the previously known 400. Approximately half of those are present in all wild populations, but only 4% were found in 80% or more of the individual fish. Wild fish have up to two times as many NLRs per individual and up to four times as many NLRs per population than laboratory strains. In contrast to the massive variability of gene copies, nucleotide diversity in zebrafish NLR genes is very low: around half of the copies are monomorphic and the remaining ones have very few polymorphisms, likely a signature of purifying selection.

    We have previously demonstrated a substantial reduction in single-nucleotide variation in zebrafish laboratory strains compared to wild populations ( Suurväli et al., 2020 ). Here, we showed that the copy numbers of the NLRome and their variation are also heavily reduced. The most obvious explanation for this observation is the recent population bottleneck which marks the establishment of laboratory strains. The reduction in copy number variation in the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) locus in a population of greater prairie-chicken was attributed to a recent bottleneck as well ( Eimes et al., 2011 ). Additionally, the reduced amount of pathogenic challenges in a laboratory environment could lead to a steady loss of expendable genes. For these reasons, one has to exercise caution when extending conclusions from immune-related studies on laboratory zebrafish to wild zebrafish. The same caution should also be exercised when extending results from laboratory organisms to other species, including human. Studies have shown that even mammals have hundreds of genes with diverse molecular functions that are affected by copy number variation, even though it rarely involves full genes ( Kooverjee et al., 2023; Zarrei et al., 2015 ). One example of the latter is the MHC locus, which harbors varying numbers of gene copies between closely related species of ruminants ( He et al., 2024 ) and has haplotype-specific copies in mice ( Lilue et al., 2018 ). However, the vast number of NLRs in zebrafish combined with presence/absence variation ( McConnell et al., 2023 ) and high rates of duplication exceeds what has been found in other animals so far. A comparable situation can be found in the NLR genes of the thale cress ( A. thaliana ). Our predicted number of NLRs in a zebrafish population is on the same scale as the 2127 NLRs found in the thale cress NLRome ( Van de Weyer et al., 2019b )

., 2019b ). Moreover, copy numbers also vary greatly between A. thaliana accessions ( Lee and Chae, 2020 ). A total of 464 conserved, high-confidence orthogroups were identified in A. thaliana, 106–143 of which were defined as the core NLRome because they were found in a subset comprising at least 80% of the accessions ( Van de Weyer et al., 2019b ). In wild zebrafish, we found a set of 880 NLR genes which were detected in at least one individual from three wild populations, but only 58 NLRs were found in the vast majority ( more than 80% ) of wild individuals. Although structural similarities of NLRs in plants and animals are thought to be the result of convergent evolution ( Yue et al., 2012 ), it appears that the similarities extend to their evolutionary trajectories. However, the overall number of gene copies as well as the variation in copy numbers within populations and in individual gene repertoires are more extreme in zebrafish than in A. thaliana. We postulate that as immune genes, many NLR genes are likely shared between populations because they provide a fitness advantage in the defense against common pathogens. The additional NLRs shared among only some of the wild populations and the population-specific NLRs may represent local adaptations to ecological niches. Additionally, there could be functional redundancy within the NLRome, so that different individuals have different NLRs with the same functional role. In general, the fact that hundreds of NLR gene copies are maintained in zebrafish, together with a signature of purifying selection, suggests that the evolution of these genes is far from neutral. Although the expression of fish NLRs is often induced by pathogen exposure ( reviewed in Chuphal et al., 2022 ), the exact function of most zebrafish NLR-C genes remains unclear. It is possible that some of them participate in the formation and activity of inflammasomes ( Li, 2018a; Valera-Pérez et al

. Most knowledge about NLRs in animals comes from studies of humans and rodents, but their NLR repertoires ( 20–30 genes ) are smaller than those of many other species such as the purple sea urchin, the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica, and many fish ( Hibino et al., 2006; Yuen et al., 2014; Suurväli et al., 2022 ). However, even in mice one NLR ( Nlrp1 ) has different copy numbers in different laboratory strains, ranging from 2 to 5 ( Lilue et al., 2018 ). In many fishes, studies have reported NLR repertoires in the range of 10–50 genes ( e. g., Rajendran et al., 2012; Li et al., 2016 ). In others, hundreds of NLRs are present, including in the model species zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) ( Stein et al., 2007; Laing et al., 2008; Tørresen et al., 2018; Adrian-Kalchhauser et al., 2020; Suurväli et al., 2022 ). The zebrafish reference genome contains nearly 400 NLR genes, two-thirds of which are located on the putative sex chromosome ( chromosome 4 ), in a genomic region associated with extensive haplotypic variation ( Howe et al., 2013; Howe et al., 2016; McConnell et al., 2023; Anderson et al., 2012 ). The majority of fish NLRs represent a fish-specific subtype that was originally labeled NLR-C ( Laing et al., 2008 ), although they can be further divided into at least six groups based on structural similarities and sequence of conserved exons ( Howe et al., 2016; Adrian-Kalchhauser et al., 2020 ). A schematic structure of proteins encoded by zebrafish NLR-C genes is presented in Figure 1A. All of them possess a FISNA domain ( fish-specific NACHT-associated domain ), which precedes the nucleotide-binding domain NACHT and is encoded by the same large exon near the N-terminus of the protein ( Howe et al., 2016 ). FISNA-NACHT is in some cases preceded by the effector domain PYD, but this is encoded by a separate exon ( Howe et al., 2016 ). Additionally, many NLR-C proteins have a B30

., 2019; Lozano-Gil et al., 2022, Kuri et al., 2017 ), but we only found the N-terminal effector domains ( CARD or PYD ) that are typically involved in this function ( Petrilli et al., 2005 ) in a small subset of NLR-C genes. Although we mainly used the counts of FISNA-NACHT orthogroups to estimate total numbers of NLRs, we also analyzed the B30. 2 exons of NLR-C genes. In general, NLR-associated B30. 2 exons exhibit patterns of copy number variation that are similar to those seen for FISNA-NACHT. For example, about half of the B30. 2 sequences are found in all wild populations, similar to the set of 880 FISNA-NACHT exon sequences conserved among populations. There are at least two mechanisms which could contribute to the extensive copy number variation seen among zebrafish populations: first, it could be attributed to a high degree of haplotypic variation. Large DNA fragments contain different sets of genes and gene copies, similar to the zebrafish MHC loci ( McConnell et al., 2014 ). Extensive haplotypic variation occurs on the long arm of chromosome 4, the location containing over two-thirds of all NLRs in zebrafish ( McConnell et al., 2023 ). Such segregating haplotype blocks would explain the existence of the core NLRome, but not the frequent presence of genes that occur only in a single individual or a few populations. Second, it is possible that NLR genes are duplicated and then lost in different populations, a process known as gene duplication-deletion. This is supported by the fact that many zebish NLR genes are paralogous, that is they share high sequence similarity with other NLR genes ( Howe et al, 2016 ). The duplication-deletion process would explain the presence of population-specific NLR, but not the core NLR found in all wild populations. We propose that both mechanisms contribute to the copy variation of NLR in zebish, with hapypic variation and duplication-deletion playing a role in the presence of population-specific NLR and core NLR, respectively.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The ovules or seeds ( fertilized ovules ) with wings are widespread and especially important for wind dispersal. However, the earliest ovules in the Famennian of the Late Devonian are rarely known about the dispersal syndrome and usually surrounded by a cupule. From Xinhang, Anhui, China, we now report a new taxon of Famennian ovules, Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov. Each ovule of this taxon possesses three integumentary wings evidently extending outwards, folding inwards along abaxial side and enclosing most part of nucellus. The ovule is borne terminally on smooth dichotomous branches and lacks a cupule. Alasemenia suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cupule evolved functions in probable photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal. It indicates that the seed wing originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms such as seed plume and pappus, and that three- or four-winged seeds were followed by seeds with less wings. Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two or four wings under the same condition.

    Since plants colonized the land, wind dispersal ( anemochory ) became common with the seed wing representing a key dispersal strategy through geological history ( Taylor et al., 2009; Ma, 2009; McLoughlin and Pott, 2019 ). Winged seeds evolved numerous times in many lineages of extinct and extant seed plants ( spermatophytes ) ( Schenk, 2013; Stevenson et al., 2015 ). Lacking wings as integumentary outgrowths, the earliest ovules in the Famennian ( 372–359 million years ago [Ma], Late Devonian ) rarely played a role in wind dispersal ( Rowe, 1997 ). Furthermore, nearly all Famennian ovules are cupulate, i. e., borne in a protecting and pollinating cupule ( Prestianni et al., 2013; Meyer-Berthaud et al., 2018 ). Warsteinia was a Famennian ovule with four integumentary wings, but its attachment and cupule remain unknown ( Rowe, 1997 ). Guazia was a Famennian ovule with four wings and it is terminally borne and acupulate ( devoid of cupule ) ( Wang et al., 2022 ). This paper documents a new Famennian seed plant with ovule, Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov. It occurs in Jianchuan mine of China, where Xinhang fossil forest was discovered to comprise in situ lycopsid trees of Guangdedendron ( Wang et al., 2019 ). The terminally borne ovules are three-winged and clearly acupulate, thus implying additional or novel functions of integument. Based on current fossil evidence and mathematical analysis, we discuss the evolution of winged seeds and compare the wind dispersal of seeds with different number of wings.

. New ovule Alasemenia in this paper terminates leafless branches, bears three wings and lacks cupules. It represents the second acupulate ovule in the Famennian. Besides protective and pollinating functions, Alasemenia suggests photosynthetically nutritive and anemochorous functions of early ovules. It indicates the diversity of Famennian winged ovules and the evolutionary sequence of ovule wings. Compared to Famennian four-winged ovules of Warsteinia and Guazia, Alasemenia with three distally outwards extending wings shows advantage in anemochory. Mathematical analysis implies that three-winged ovules could be efficiently dispersed by wind.

Except few taxa including Guazia ( Wang et al., 2022 ), Dorinnotheca ( Fairon-Demaret, 1996 ), Cosmosperma ( Liu et al., 2017 ), Elkinsia ( Serbet and Rothwell, 1992 ) and Moresnetia ( Fairon-Demaret and Scheckler, 1987 ), the earliest ovules in the Late Devonian ( Famennian ) have not been preserved to be connected to the branches. These ovules are usually surrounded by cupules. Now, as in Guazia, the ovules of Alasemenia terminate the dichotomous branches and are transversely sectioned to show the ovular structures. The ovules of these two genera provide rare evidence for acupulate ovules in the earliest seed plants. Both cupule and integument of an early ovule perform the protective and pollinating functions ( Meyer-Berthaud, 2022 ). The integument of Alasemenia is adnate to most part of the nucellus and its three lobes extend long distance above the nucellar tip and then evidently outwards. Such structure leads to efficient protection of nucellus and adaptation for pollination. In early seed plants, the fertile branches terminated by cupulate ovules consistently lack leaves and thus the cupules probably serve a nutritive function as in photosynthetic organs; this function may be transferred to the integuments of acupulate ovules such as Guazia ( Meyer-Berthaud, 2022 ). Regarding Alasemenia, the nutritive function would also apply to the integuments since the acupulate ovules are terminal on various orders of naked branches and ultimate axes. The surface of integuments is enlarged through the outgrowths of wings and thus promotes the photosynthesis. Little is known about the dispersal function of Famennian ovules, because the integumentary wings as a derived character have been rarely documented. Warsteinia ( Rowe, 1997 ), Guazia ( Wang et al., 2022 ) and now Alasemenia indicate that the anemochory originated in the Famennian

. Other wind dispersal mechanisms including plumes, pappi and parachutes of seeds appeared later in the Permo-Carboniferous and Mesozoic, respectively ( Axsmith et al., 2013 ). Current evidence indicates that seeds with three or four wings occurred first in the Late Devonian. They were followed by two- or three-winged seeds in the Carboniferous ( Long, 1960; Long, 1969 ), and then by single-winged seeds in the Permian ( Stevenson et al., 2015; Prevec et al., 2008 ). Relating to wind dispersal, the diaspores ( seeds/fruits ) of living spermatophytes possess multiple mechanisms and variable number of wings ( Ma, 2009 ). The rate of diaspore descent in still air is an important indicator of the potential ability of modern samaras dispersal ( Augspurger et al., 2016; Augspurger et al., 2017 ). In examining samaras, it has been demonstrated that the value of angular velocity is smaller than that of terminal velocity ( Green, 1980 ), and the relationship between the samaras’ wing loading and terminal velocity vter is:vter∝wAw where w is the weight of samaras, AW is the surface area of the wing, w/AW is defined as the samaras’ wing loading. As for ovules, we also use terminal velocity as an indicator of dispersal ability. Since the broad integumentary wings well extend outwards, the wing loading of Alasemenia is obviously less than that of Guazia. When the winged seeds fall in the air, the predictable spinning can lead to the reduction of fall rate, and result in the increase of the horizontal dispersal distance. This has been observed in the field experiments or proved in the modelling reconstruction experiments ( Green, 1980; Habgood et al., 1998 ). However, the tiny asymmetry of ovules will be amplified in the running geometry by centrifugal and aerodynamic loads, result in vibrations and thus significantly reduce the efficiency ( Lu et al., 2019 )

. However, the ovule of Warsteinia remains unclear in attachment to branches and possession of a cupule. Alasemenia confirms that, like Guazia, the integuments of acupulate ovules developed a new function in wind dispersal. In the Late Devonian ovules, besides Alasemenia, both Warsteinia ( Rowe, 1997 ) and Guazia ( Wang et al., 2022 ) possess integumentary lobes forming radially arranged wings. Their integumentary wings illustrate diversity in number ( three or four per ovule ), length, folding or flattening, and being straight or curving distally. As in Alasemenia ( Figure 5a ), the integumentary wings of acupulate ovule of Guazia are broad, thin and fold inwards along the abaxial side, but their numbers are four in each ovule and their free portions usually arch centripetally ( Figure 5c; Wang et al., 2022, Figure 5 ). In contrast to Alasemenia, Warsteinia has four integumentary wings without folding and their free portions are short and straight ( Rowe, 1997, TEXT-FIGURE 4 ). Ovules of Warstein and Guia are cupulate and aculate, but Alasiania is acupulate without cupule. The diversity of ovules in the Famenn indicates the evolution of wind dispersal mechanisms and the sequence of winged ovules. The winged ovules in the Famenn were followed by wingless ovules in the Carboniferous ( Long,196; Long,196 ) and single-winged ovules in the Perm ( Stevenson et al,2015; Pre et al,2008 ). The winged ovules in the Famenn were followed by wingless ovules in the Carboniferous ( Long,196; Long,196 ) and single-wing ovules in the Perm ( Stevenson et al,201; Pre et,200 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Philadelphia chromosome-positive ( Ph+ ) leukemia is a fatal hematological malignancy. Although standard treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) have achieved remarkable success in prolonging patient survival, intolerance, relapse, and TKI resistance remain serious issues for patients with Ph+ leukemia. Here, we report a new leukemogenic process in which RAPSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph+ leukemia, and RAPSYN mediates the neddylation of BCR-ABL. Consequently, neddylated BCR-ABL enhances the stability by competing its c-CBL-mediated degradation. Furthermore, SRC phosphorylates RAPSYN to activate its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity, promoting BCR-ABL stabilization and disease progression. Moreover, in contrast to in vivo ineffectiveness of PROTAC-based degraders, depletion of RAPSYN expression, or its ligase activity decreased BCR-ABL stability and, in turn, inhibited tumor formation and growth. Collectively, these findings represent an alternative to tyrosine kinase activity for the oncoprotein and leukemogenic cells and generate a rationale of targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia.

   . Given the fact that the increase of BCR-ABL expression can affect the sensitivity to TKIs and eventually determine the rate of TKI resistance and LIC population in patients with Ph+ leukemia ( Issaad et al., 2000; Barnes et al., 2005 ), effective degradation of BCR-ABL is an alternative opportunity for the treatment. Although recent studies have greatly advanced our understanding of the regulation of BCR-ABL degradation ( Burslem et al., 2019; Shibata et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2021a ), most reported modulatory proteins are not ideal for translation to clinical settings because of their pivotal roles in sustaining normal hematological functions. In contrast, RAPSYN was nearly unexpressed in the blood of healthy donors. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that the inhibition of RAPSYN expression could lead to cytotoxicity in Ph+ leukemia with high specificity and marginal side effects. Furthermore, our present results showed that knockdown of RAPSYN significantly increased the sensitivity of leukemia cells to saracatinib, implying that a combination of RAPSYN inhibition and TKI treatment can effectively control mutations and LIC-derived TKI resistance in Ph+ leukemia. In summary, our work has uncovered the pivotal role that RAPSYN exerts its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity in neddylating and stabilizing BCR-ABL in the pathogenesis of Ph+ leukemia and thus delineate it as a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia. More importantly, our results shed a light on future investigations that may help to extend to other cancer types for broadening our understanding of RAPSYN’s involvement in hematology and oncology.

In this study, we identified a novel role of RAPSYN in hematology. Indeed, RAPSYN inhibition significantly suppressed the survival of Ph+ leukemia. This phenotype was found to be linked to the NEDD8 E3 ligase activity of RAPSYN, which mediated BCR-ABL neddylation to enhance its stability for promoting leukemogenesis. Balanced protein synthesis and degradation are pivotal for maintaining protein homeostasis and normal cellular function. Neddylation is a type of important PTMs that mainly modulates protein stability. Accumulating evidence has shown that targeting the neddylation process could be an appealing strategy for anticancer therapy, with a particular efficacy shown in hematologic malignancies ( Bhalla and Fiskus, 2016; McGrail et al., 2020; Norton et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2021 ). On the other hand, neddylation is a specific PTM that modifies multiple Lys residues in BCR-ABL, shielding this oncoprotein to compete ubiquitination-mediated degradation, which provides a reasonable explanation on the poor in vivo efficacy of PROTAC-based degraders for BCR-ABL ( Li and Song, 2020 ). MLN4924, a NEDD8-activating E1 enzyme inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit the survival of both wild-type ( WT ) and T315I-BCR-ABL leukemia cells as well as LICs ( Liu et al., 2018; Bahjat et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2019 ). Moreover, clinical trials of MLN4924 in combination with anticancer agents in acute myeloid leukemia have progressed to phase II ( NCT03745352 and PEVENAZA [NCT04266795] ) and III ( PANTHER [NCT03268954] and PEVOLAM [NCT04090736] ). However, the neddylation system works in a substrate- and context-dependent manner, which essentially defines its role in tumorigenesis as anti or pro, particularly relying on the substrate specificity of the NEDD8 E3 ligase. Neddylation can either facilitate ubiquitination-dependent degradation of its substrates, such as EGFR ( Oved et al., 2006 ) and c-SRC ( Lee et al

. Clearly, the specific phosphorylation of RAPSYN at Y336 by SRC led to its increased stability by preventing the proteasomal degradation, thereby maintaining the high levels of RAPSYN in Ph+ leukemia. To dissect the role of SRC-mediated phosphorylation of RAPSYN, we tested whether phosphorylation of RAPSYN at Y336 affects its ligase activity. Immunoblotting revealed saracatinib treatment or SRC silencing reduced BCR-ABL neddylation and its protein expression, while exogenous expression of SRC cDNA strongly increased it ( Figure 5A–C ). Additionally, co-expression in HEK293T cells showed that Y336F mutation had no impact on BCR-ABL neddylation compared to co-transfection with SRC ( Figure 5D ). These results were supported by stronger neddylation of endogenous BCR-ABL in cells overexpressing WT RAPSN, but not in the Y336F mutant ( Figure 5E ). Furthermore, protein turnover rates of BCR-ABL were determined in Ph+ leukemia cells and the cells with exogenous RAPSNY336F expression displayed larger decrease in BCR-ABL level than those expressing RAPSNWT ( Figure 5F ). Therefore, RAPSYN phosphorylation at Y336 by SRC was a major contributing factor to its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity and BCR-ABL stability in Ph+ leukemia cells. To assess the extent to which SRC-mediated phosphorylation of RAPSYN at Y336 contributes to the enhanced viability of RAPSYN-dependent Ph+ leukemia cells, we first identified a specific shSRC by screening five candidates using toxicity tests and then performing rescue experiments with SRC cDNA. Toxicity tests revealed that, albeit to varying degrees, shSRC #2-, #4-, and #5-induced cytotoxicity in all Ph+ leukemia cell lines ( Figure 6A, Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ). However, exogenous SRC cDNA expression only restored the growth of Ph+ leukemia cells transduced with shSRC #2 ( Figure 6B, Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C )

Philadelphia chromosome-positive ( Ph+ ) leukemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, t ( 9;22 ) ( q34. 1; q11. 2 ) ( de Klein et al., 1982; Deininger et al., 2000 ). This cytogenetic abnormality results in a BCR-ABL fusion gene, which encodes the chimeric protein BCR-ABL with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity ( Cortes et al., 2021 ). Based on its oncogenic role in Ph+ leukemia, BCR-ABL has been regarded as the most pivotal target for Ph+ leukemia therapy, especially for chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) have been the main treatment option for Ph+ leukemia, remarkably prolonging the patients’ lifespan and improving their quality of life ( Hochhaus et al., 2020; Jabbour and Kantarjian, 2020 ). However, most patients develop TKI resistance and relapse after long-term treatment ( Braun et al., 2020 ). It is worth noting that the increase of BCR-ABL expression can affect the sensitivity to TKIs and eventually determine the rate of TKI resistance in patients with Ph+ leukemia in addition to the mutations in the kinase domain ( Jabbour et al., 2007 ). Mutations in the kinase domain can change the conformation of BCR-ABL, thus interfering with the binding between TKIs and BCR-ABL and resulting in decreased therapeutic efficacy ( Lussana et al., 2018 ). In parallel, the increase of BCR-ABL expression can affect the sensitivity to TKIs and eventually determine the rate of disease progression and TKI resistance in patients with Ph+ leukemia ( Barnes et al., 2005 ). Therefore, effective degradation of B-ABL is an alternative for the treatment of Ph leukemia. Recent studies have greatly advanced our understanding of the regulation of B- degradation ( Burs et al, 2019; Shibata et al,2020; Jiang et al,202a ), but most modulatory proteins are not ideal for translation to clinical settings because their pivotal roles in sustaining hematological functions. In contrast, RSY was nearly unexpressed in blood donors. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that inhibition of RSY could lead to cytotoxic in Ph leukemia with specificity and marginal effects. Our results showed that knockdown of RSY significantly increased the sensitivity of leukemia to saratin, implying a combination of RSY inhibition and TK treatment can effectively control mutations-derived TK resistance in Ph leukemia.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases ( i. e. lysins ) are considered promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to their direct peptidoglycan degradation activity and low risk of resistance development. The discovery of these enzymes is often hampered by the limited availability of phage genomes. Herein, we report a new strategy to mine active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes by lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening. As a proof-of-concept, five peptidoglycan hydrolases from the Acinetobacter baumannii proteome ( PHAb7-PHAb11 ) were identified using PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template. Among them, PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr, while the other three were thermosensitive. We solved the crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 and unveiled that hyper-thermostable PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by a dimer-monomer transition, while thermosensitive PHAb8 formed a monomer. Two mouse models of bacterial infection further demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PHAb10. In conclusion, our antimicrobial peptide-primed strategy provides new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs.

   ., 2020 ). Additionally, the discovery of phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases has also been hampered by limited sources of published phage genome data. Although not yet tested extensively, recent progress in lysins targeting Gram-negative bacteria have demonstrated a clue linking antibacterial activity to their internal antimicrobial peptides ( Vázquez et al., 2021 ), by which lysins cross the bacterial outer membrane and contact its underlying peptidoglycan substrates ( Lood et al., 2015; Thandar et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021 ). These observations prompted us to consider whether antibacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases or their homologs could be mined from bacterial proteomes using lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide as template. As a proof-of-concept, we here used the antimicrobial peptide P307 derived from PlyF307 lysin ( Lood et al., 2015 ) as a template to search for peptidoglycan hydrolases from the A. baumannii proteome database ( PHAbs, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Two of them ( PHAb10 and PHAb11 ) were found to be hyperthermally stable even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr, which is mediated by a unique monomer-dimer swapping. Furthermore, both were active against a wide variety of clinically relevant bacteria in vitro and in mouse infection models. This observation supports our hypothesis that antimicrobial peptide-primed mining strategy is feasible for discovering new peptidoglycan hydrolases with high bactericidal activity and desirable physicochemical properties from bacterial proteomes.

Since a variety of lysins active against Gram-negative bacteria are shown to harbor an N- or C-terminal antimicrobial peptide, this led us to speculate that antimicrobial peptide could be used as template to mine new peptidoglycan hydrolases. To prove this hypothesis, P307, a well-documented antimicrobial peptide against A. baumannii from PlyF307 lysin ( Lood et al., 2015; Thandar et al., 2016 ), was used as the template to mine putative peptidoglycan hydrolases from A. baumannii ( PHAb ) proteome databases publicly available in NCBI ( Figure 1a ). Finally, 204 hits were identified and further divided into five clades based on phylogenetic analysis. Clade I contained 162 hits with high similarity ( >85% ) to the AcLys lysin from A. baumannii 5057UW prophage ( Figure 1b ), and clade II–V contained 42 hits with relatively lower homology ( 40–77% ) to each other ( Figure 1b; Figure 1—figure supplement 2a ). Due to the high similarity of amino acid sequences within each clade, we selected a putative peptidoglycan hydrolase from each clade for further characterization by analyzing the selectivity priority in evolution and the overall physicochemical properties ( water solubility, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, charge, flexibility, and rigidity ) of each sequence in silico. Finally, WP_065188953. 1 from clade I, WP_038349544. 1 from clade II, KCY28522. 1 from clade III, WP_000109885. 1 from clade IV, and WP_032023242. 1 from clade V were shortlisted and renamed as PHAb11, PHAb10, PHAb9, PHAb8, and PHAb7, respectively, for further investigation ( Figure 1b ). Further homology analysis revealed that these five peptidoglycan hydrolases showed great diversity with the structured AcLys lysin and the original PlyF307 lysin ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2b ). To test the activity of these PHAbs, their coding sequences were chemically synthesized, cloned into a vector, and expressed in E. coli cells

The uncontrollable spread and emergence of antimicrobial resistance requires the discovery of new antimicrobial agents with different targets or mechanisms of action than traditional antibiotics. Bacteriophage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases ( i. e. lysins ) have been investigated as promising alternatives to combat resistant bacteria due to their unique mechanism of action, potent bactericidal activity, low risk of drug resistance development. However, for Gram-negative bacteria, the effects of phage-derived lysins were often hampered by their outer membranes, which requires more strategies to overcome this additional barrier. Although some engineered lysins ( especially Artilysins, Innolysins, and Lysocins ) have shown promising performance, clinically promising lysins capable of destroying Gram-negative bacteria remain inadequately addressed. Considering the fact that lysins from Gram-negative bacteria usually contain antimicrobial peptide-like regions ( Vázquez et al., 2021 ), in the present work, we report a new strategy to mine active bactericidal peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes through lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-priming screening. As a proof-of-concept, we successfully discovered the two peptidoglycan hydrolases PHAb10 and PHAb11 from the proteome of A. baumannii using the PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template, highlighting the utility of this strategy in mining antimicrobial agents from bacterial database. Notably, PHAb10 and PHAb11 exhibited high bactericidal activity against a variety of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microbes. Unlike other Gram-negative lysins that act in an outer membrane permeabilizer-dependent manner ( Briers et al., 2011; Walmagh et al., 2013; Oliveira et al., 2014; Plotka et al., 2019 ), PHAb10 and PHAb11 exhibited intrinsic activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens via different mechanisms of action

. Altogether, these results suggested that the killing of Gram-negative bacteria by PHAb10 and PHAb11 might be a combination of lysozyme-mediated peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity and antimicrobial peptide-mediated outer membrane-disruption activity. However, their bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria was primed solely by their internal antimicrobial peptides ( Figure 3f ). To understand the catalytic mechanism and thermal stability of these peptidoglycan hydrolases, we attempted to decipher their structures and eventually obtained the crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 by X-ray crystallography ( Supplementary file 1b ). Results showed that PHAb8 was a monomer ( Figure 4a; Figure 4—figure supplement 1a ), while PHAb10 ( Figure 4b ) and PHAb11 ( Figure 4c ) formed an asymmetric dimer. Specifically, the two asymmetric units of PHAb10 formed an antiparallel dimer with a rotation angle of 177. 2° along the rotation axis and a distance of 10. 5 Å between them. Further, PHAb10 dimer adopted a circularly permuted architecture, in which the N-terminus of one chain and the C-terminus of another chain formed a cavity, which might be the binding site of the peptidoglycan substrate ( Figure 4b ). The two subunits of PHAb11 formed a tail-to-tail dimer with a rotation angle of –179. 4° along the rotation axis and a distance of 37. 1 Å between them. Each PHAb11 monomer contained an independent substrate-binding cavity around its catalytic triad ( Figure 4c ). Notably, the N-terminal 36 amino acids, P11-NP, were missing in our PHAb11 dimer ( Figure 4c; Figure 4— supplement 2 ), which might contribute to the thermosensitivity of PH11. In contrast, PH10 was thermally stable even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr ( Figure 5 ), which was mediated by a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic process ( Figure 6 ). The dimerization of PH10 was triggered by a monomer-monomer transition ( Figure 6a ), while PH8 formed a monomer ( Figure 6b ). The thermosensitivity of PH11 was due to the absence of N-terminal 36 amino acids ( Figure 6; Figure 4— supplement 2 ), which were crucial for the dimerization of PH11 ( Figure 6c ). To evaluate the efficacy and safety of PH10 in vivo, two mouse models of bacterial infection were used ( Figure 7; Figure 7 ). PH10 significantly reduced the bacterial load of A. baumanni in both models ( Figure 7a; Figure 7a ) with no toxicity observed ( Figure 7b; Figure 7 ), indicating the potential of PH10 as an antimicrobial drug. In conclusion, our antimicrobial peptide-prim strategy provides clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs with bacteridal activity and desirable physicochemical properties from bacterial proteomes.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancer types with poor treatment options. Better detection of early symptoms and relevant disease correlations could improve pancreatic cancer prognosis. In this retrospective study, we used symptom and disease codes ( ICD-10 ) from the Danish National Patient Registry ( NPR ) encompassing 6. 9 million patients from 1994 to 2018,, of whom 23, 592 were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The Danish cancer registry included 18, 523 of these patients. To complement and compare the registry diagnosis codes with deeper clinical data, we used a text mining approach to extract symptoms from free text clinical notes in electronic health records ( 3078 pancreatic cancer patients and 30, 780 controls ). We used both data sources to generate and compare symptom disease trajectories to uncover temporal patterns of symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis for the same patients. We show that the text mining of the clinical notes was able to complement the registry-based symptoms by capturing more symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis. For example, ‘Blood pressure reading without diagnosis’, ‘Abnormalities of heartbeat’, and ‘Intestinal obstruction’ were not found for the registry-based analysis. Chaining symptoms together in trajectories identified two groups of patients with lower median survival ( <90 days ) following the trajectories ‘Cough→Jaundice→Intestinal obstruction’ and ‘Pain→Jaundice→Abnormal results of function studies’. These results provide a comprehensive comparison of the two types of pancreatic cancer symptom trajectories, which in combination can leverage the full potential of the health data and ultimately provide a fuller picture for detection of early risk factors for pancreatic cancer.

    This study uncovered statistically significant disease and symptom trajectories prior to pancreatic cancer that may be further assessed as early risk factors for pancreatic cancer for screening purposes. We complemented pancreatic cancer symptoms from hospital diagnosis codes with symptoms extracted by text mining using free text in EHRs. We observed that symptoms were more abundant in the EHRs opposed to the NPR. For example, more than 2000 patients out of 3078 text-mined pancreatic cancer cases had ‘Pain’ according to the free text clinical notes but in the registry, it was less than 500 patients out of the 18, 523 pancreatic cancer cases. On the contrary, there were some symptoms identified more abundantly in the NPR compared to the clinical notes. From our trajectory analysis, we detected mainly symptom trajectories for patients in the longer survival group ( >90 days ). This could be because patients in the short survival group ( ≤90 days ) have fewer symptoms detected and thus will not show up in the symptom trajectories. For the text-mined symptom trajectories, we could detect more symptoms prior to the cancer diagnosis than in the registry-based trajectories using the NPR, despite the text-mining cohort being much smaller. ‘Jaundice’ can in some cases be a symptom of a late-stage cancer and thus poor survival ( Strasberg et al., 2014 ), but in other cases contribute as a clearer cancer symptom compared to the other more generic pancreatic cancer symptoms. Studies have found the diagnostic interval to be shorter for jaundice compared to for example weight loss for pancreatic cancer patients ( Walter et al., 2016; Gobbi et al., 2013 ). It could therefore indicate a faster diagnosis but not necessarily a longer survival

The Danish National Patient Registry ( NPR ) data spans the period 1994–2018, while the electronic health records ( EHRs ) used here are from 2006 to 2016. The NPR includes 6. 9 million patients where 23, 592 patients are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Of these we used 18, 523 patients which also were confirmed by the Danish Cancer Registry. ( Table 1 ). For a subset of 3078 patients, we extracted their corresponding EHRs. Almost as many females as males are identified with pancreatic cancer both in NPR and the EHRs ( Table 1 ). We text-mined the pancreatic cancer patient symptom history in clinical notes five years prior to the cancer. We compared these symptoms to the most frequent symptoms in the NRP ( Figure 1 ). These are counts and show an overview of identified symptoms, which could also be present in the control population. The text mining approach was able to identify 16 unique symptoms in the clinical notes, not registered in NPR ( Figure 1A ). The most frequent symptoms exclusively found in the clinical notes were conditions related to ‘Intestinal disorders’, ‘Dorsalgia’ and ‘Embolisms’ ( Figure 1B ). NPR contained 24 ICD-10 symptoms not found by text mining ( Figure 1A ). Frequent symptoms exclusively identified in the NPR data comprised findings related to ‘Functional capacity’, ‘Dysphagia’, ‘Abnormal laboratory findings’, ‘Oedema’, and ‘Abnormal findings on medical images’ ( Figure 1C ). In NPR and free text clinical notes, 57 symptoms were identified that occurred in both sources. Of these, the 15 most frequent symptoms from the free text clinical notes and the NPR were compared ( Figure 1D ). Amongst these, we could identify ‘Pain’, ‘Nausea and vomiting’, ‘Abnormal blood-pressure reading’, ‘Abdominal and pelvic pain’, and ‘Symptoms and signs concerning food and fluid intake’. From the hierarchical structure of the ICD-10 chapters, different levels of coding detail can be retrieved

. 0 - Acute abdomen’ in NPR which essentially would mean the same. Our text mining procedure had a sensitivity error of 83. 4% which is in the expected range for the program Tagcorpus ( Pafilis et al., 2013; Pafilis et al., 2015 ). Also, information bias may exist in the coding procedure within NPR and it might not always be trivial to code the correct symptom or diagnosis ( Schmidt et al., 2015; Lynge et al., 2011 ). From our study, we show that the inclusion of symptoms text-mined from clinical notes largely complemented ICD-10-coded symptoms from the patient registry. This study showed that deep phenotypical information stored in registry data and free text EHRs can be useful for detecting temporal patterns prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, our study reveals a notable increase in the prevalence of early symptoms within EHRs suggesting the possibility of harnessing the complete potential of health data by incorporating multi-modality symptom trajectories derived from both EHRs and registry-based codes. This integrated approach provides a comprehensive representation of the symptomatology, enabling a more accurate assessment of disease trajectories and potentially facilitating early detection and intervention. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of comprehensive symptom assessment for improved prediction and patient outcomes in pancreatic cancer. The sequence of events that leads up till the pancreatic cancer diagnosis supports that symptoms may appear in a messy and complex order. Patients start experiencing general and unspecific symptoms, which then become more specific and severe as the cancer advances. Future applications could leverage this knowledge and use AI and advanced text mining techniques to build longitudinal multi-modal trajectories for improved symptom extraction and early prediction of pancreatic cancer in the clinics

., 2014; Siggaard et al., 2020, Lademann et al., 2019 ). Recent examples are the characterization of multimorbidity correlations across cancer types ( Hu et al., 2019 ) and the detection of pancreatic cancer using artificial intelligence ( Placido et al., 2023 ). However, much of the deeper phenotypic patient information resides within the free text of the electronic health records ( EHRs; Jensen et al., 2012; Eriksson et al., 2014; Soguero-Ruiz et al., 2016; Delespierre et al., 2017 ). A small-scale study using 4080 mixed types of cancers attempted to build more general ‘event trajectories’ using text mining and pooled analysis ( Jensen et al., 2017 ). A prospective study investigating initial symptoms and diagnostic interval ( time from onset to diagnosis ) for known pancreatic cancer symptoms found no difference between pancreatic cancer patients and patients suspected of having pancreatic cancer ( Walter et al., 2016 ). It has also been suggested that symptoms appear sporadically, adding to the complex nature of the disease manifestation ( Evans et al., 2014 ). Other studies used primary care EHRs to detect pancreatic cancer symptoms and found jaundice ( Stapley et al., 2013 ), back pain, lethargy, and new-onset diabetes to be linked to pancreatic cancer ( Keane et al., 2014 ). These studies detected pancreatic cancer symptoms using a single-disease approach, not considering the temporal ordering of symptoms or diseases. In this paper, we present a large-scale study to investigate pancreatic cancer symptoms longitudinally. We cover all symptoms included in the International Classification of Disease ( ICD-10 ) terminology symptom chapter 18. Additionally, we also include in the text mining vocabulary other known or suggested pancreatic cancer symptoms

For the generation of the trajectories, we used disease codes from the hierarchical International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ) system. ICD version 10 codes at level 3 were used for this study. The case cohort of pancreatic cancer patients was defined based on the pancreatic cancer code C25. We only included pancreatic cancer patients that had a confirmed diagnosis in the Danish Cancer Registry. From the Danish NPR, all patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer between 1994 and 2018 were included. We used a total of 23,592 patients. Of these, 18,523 were confirmed by the Danish Cancer Registry. We extracted the corresponding EHR for a subset of 307 patients with pancreatic cancer and 30,780 controls. From the EHR, we text-mined the symptoms in clinical notes five years prior to cancer diagnosis. We compared these to the most frequent symptoms in the NPR ( Figure 1 ). The text-mining was able to identify 16 symptoms not registered in the NPR ( Figure 1 ). The most frequent exclusively found in clinical were related to ‘Int disorders’, ‘algia’ and ‘bolism’ ( Figure 1 ). NPR contained 24 ICD-10 symptoms not by text ( Figure 1 ). Frequent exclusively in NPR comprised related ‘Functional’ ‘ysagia’ ‘Abnormal findings’ ‘edema’ and ‘normal on images’ ( Figure 1 ) In both NPR and text notes 57 symptoms occurred. Of these 15 most frequent from text and NPR ( Figure 1 ) were ‘Pain’ ‘ause and vomiting’ ‘normal blood reading’ ‘dom and ‘pelvic pain’ and ‘ and concerning fluid intake’ From the hierarchical of I-10 chapters different levels can be retrieved.0 Acute’ in NPR essentially means the same Our mining had sensitivity 83.4 which in expected for program ( Pafil et al. 2013; P et al 2015 ) also bias may exist in procedure NPR and not always code symptom or diagnosis ( Schmidt et 201; Lynge 1 ) From study we show inclusion texted clinical largely complemented I- coded from registry This showed phenotypic stored data and free EHRs useful detecting patterns prior cancer diagnosis Furthermore our reveals increase prevalence EHR suggesting possibility harnessing complete data multi-mod symptom trajectories both EHR and registry codes integrated comprehensive representation symptom enabling accurate disease trajectories facilitating early intervention Overall findings importance comprehensive assessment prediction patient outcomes cancer sequence events leads cancer supports symptoms appear complex patients unspecific severe advances future leverage knowledge AI techniques longitudinal trajectories extraction early cancer clinics Sig et al 202 Lann et 2019 Hu et 201 Plido 3 Jensen et 2012 Eriksson 2014 Su-Riz 201 Deles 7

    Title: 
    Abstract: The synchronization of canonical fast sleep spindle activity ( 12. 5–16 Hz, adult-like ) precisely during the slow oscillation ( 0. 5–1 Hz ) up peak is considered an essential feature of adult non-rapid eye movement sleep. However, there is little knowledge on how this well-known coalescence between slow oscillations and sleep spindles develops. Leveraging individualized detection of single events, we first provide a detailed cross-sectional characterization of age-specific patterns of slow and fast sleep spindles, slow oscillations, and their coupling in children and adolescents aged 5–6, 8–11, and 14–18 years, and an adult sample of 20- to 26-year-olds. Critically, based on this, we then investigated how spindle and slow oscillation maturity substantiate age-related differences in their precise orchestration. While the predominant type of fast spindles was development-specific in that it was still nested in a frequency range below the canonical fast spindle range for the majority of children, the well-known slow oscillation-spindle coupling pattern was evident for sleep spindles in the adult-like canonical fast spindle range in all four age groups—but notably less precise in children. To corroborate these findings, we linked personalized measures of fast spindle maturity, which indicate the similarity between the prevailing development-specific and adult-like canonical fast spindles, and slow oscillation maturity, which reflects the extent to which slow oscillations show frontal dominance, with individual slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns. Importantly, we found that fast spindle maturity was uniquely associated with enhanced slow oscillation-spindle coupling strength and temporal precision across the four age groups. Taken together, our results suggest that the increasing ability to generate adult-like canonical fast sleep spindles actuates precise slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns from childhood through adolescence and into young adulthood.

    In the first step, we aimed at identifying age-specific patterns of sleep spindles. To obtain evidence for two distinct dominant oscillatory spindle rhythms within all four age groups ( 5- to 6-, 8- to 11-, 14- to 18-, 20- to 26-year-olds ), we firstly determined individual spindle peak frequencies ( between 9–16 Hz ) of background-corrected power spectra during non-rapid eye movement sleep ( NREM, N2 and N3 ) at averaged frontal ( F3, F4 ) and centro-parietal ( C3, C4, Cz, Pz ) electrodes, where slow and fast sleep spindles typically dominate, respectively ( Cox et al., 2017; for background-corrected power spectra, see Figure 1A; see Supplementary file 1a and b for statistical comparisons of peak frequencies ). Based on the individual frontal and centro-parietal spindle peak frequencies, we then detected sleep spindle events in frontal and centro-parietal sites which represent the person- and age-specific dominant spindle rhythms per individual ( see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 for examples of averaged EEG signals time-locked to the occurrence of these dominant sleep spindles ). We then compared features of these individually identified sleep spindles ( i. e., frequency, density, amplitude; Figure 1B–D ) between age groups ( 5- to 6-, 8- to 11-, 14- to 18-, 20- to 26-year-olds ) and topographies ( frontal, centro-parietal ) using linear mixed-effects models ( LMM ) :spindlefeature∼1+agegroup∗topography+ ( 1|ID ) The results from the LMMs were further specified using pairwise comparisons for which p-values were corrected using the Bonferroni method ( padj; Bland and Altman, 1995 ). For all features of individually identified, dominant sleep spindles, all main effects and the interaction between age group and sleep spindle topography reached significance ( Ffrequency ( 3, 134. 73 ) = 4. 04, pfrequency = 0. 009; Fdensity ( 3, 136. 76 ) = 11. 73, pdensity < 0. 001; Famplitude ( 3, 140. 21 ) = 5. 45, pamplitude = 0

. 5 and 16 Hz ( henceforth, adult-like fast sleep spindles; see Figure 1—figure supplement 2 for an example raw EEG trace with development-specific and adult-like fast spindles and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 for examples of averaged EEG signals time-locked to development-specific and adult-like fast sleep spindles ). Such adult-like fast spindles were shown before to be coupled to SOs in pre-school children, despite lacking evidence for their strong presence ( Joechner et al., 2021; see also Figure 1A, Figure 3, and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). We then compared characteristics ( i. e., frequency, density, amplitude; Figure 1B–D ) of development-specific fast centro-parietal sleep spindles with adult-like fast centro-parietal spindles using LMMs and follow-up pairwise comparisons across the four age groups. In addition to ‘age group’, the factor ‘spindle type’ ( development-specific, adult-like ) was entered as a fixed factor:spindlefeature∼1+agegroup∗spindletype+ ( 1|ID ) Results indicated that all main effects and the interaction between the factors ‘age group’ and ‘spindle type’ were significant for frequency, density, and amplitude ( for a summary of all analyses and all post-hoc comparisons see Supplementary file 1i–n ). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that the frequency of adult-like fast sleep spindles was consistently higher as compared to the development-specific fast centro-parietal spindles within all age groups, except the 20- to 26-year-olds ( t5-6 ( 135. 85 ) = 18. 70, padj 5-6 < 0. 001; t8-11 ( 135. 85 ) = 12. 48, padj 8-11 < 0. 001; t14-18 ( 135. 85 ) = 5. 37, padj 14-18 < 0. 001; t20-26 ( 135. 85 ) = 2. 73, padj 20-26 = 0. 199 ). In line with a generally higher frequency, in 5- to 6- and 8- to 11-year-olds, adult-like fast spindles had a lower amplitude compared to development-specific fast centro-parietal spindles ( t5-6 ( 142. 56 ) = –4. 34, padj 5-6 < 0. 001; t8-11 ( 142. 56 ) = –4

. 001 ) and from 900 to 1200 ms ( p = 0. 004; SO up peak at ≈ 559 ms ). Critically, and somewhat unexpectedly for the two younger age groups, the previous analysis of spectral power differences in the sleep spindle frequency range along the SO cycle suggested temporal SO-spindle alignment specifically for events in the adult-like fast spindle range ( Joechner et al., 2021; Piantoni et al., 2013a ). Hence, we repeated the PETH analyses for adult-like fast sleep spindles. As can be inferred from Figure 4B, we observed a clear coupling of adult-like fast spindle occurrence rates to specific phases of the SO cycle within all age groups— although temporally less precisely during the SO down and up peaks in the younger age groups. For 5- to 6-year-olds, we identified one positive cluster ( p < 0. 001 ) from 100 to 500 ms and two negative clusters ( both p < 0. 001 ) from –500 to 0 ms and from 700 to 1200 ms for adult-like fast centro-parietal spindles ( SO up peak at ≈ 465 ms ). For the 8- to 11-year-olds, we found two positive clusters from –1000 to –600 ms ( p < 0. 001 ) and from 200 to 600 ms ( p = 0. 001 ) and two negative clusters ( both p < 0. 001 ) from –400 to 100 ms and from 800 to 1200 ms ( SO up peak at ≈ 488 ms ). For the 14- to 18-year-olds, we identified one positive cluster ( p < 0. 001 ) from 200 to 800 ms and two negative clusters from –600 to 200 ms ( p < 0. 001 ) and from 900 to 1200 ms ( p = 0. 004 ) for adult-like fast centro-parietal spindles ( SO up peak at ≈ 532 ms ). Lastly, for the 20- to 26-year-olds, analyses revealed one positive cluster ( p = 0. 003 ) from 200 to 700 ms and two negative clusters. One cluster ( p < 0. 001 ) from –500 to 200 ms and another one ( p = 0 0 004 ) from 900 to 1200 ms for adult fast-pariet sples ( SO peak at 559 ms ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: Present-day publications on human genes primarily feature genes that already appeared in many publications prior to completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003. These patterns persist despite the subsequent adoption of high-throughput technologies, which routinely identify novel genes associated with biological processes and disease. Although several hypotheses for bias in the selection of genes as research targets have been proposed, their explanatory powers have not yet been compared. Our analysis suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results. Understudied genes remain abandoned by studies that cite these -omics experiments. Conversely, we find that publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of citations. Among 45 biological and experimental factors previously proposed to affect which genes are being studied, we find that 33 are significantly associated with the choice of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of -omics studies. To promote the investigation of understudied genes, we condense our insights into a tool, find my understudied genes ( FMUG ), that allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits. We demonstrate the utility of FMUG through the identification of genes that remain understudied in vertebrate aging. FMUG is developed in Flutter and is available for download at fmug. amaral. northwestern. edu as a MacOS/Windows app.

    Efforts to address the gaps in detailed knowledge about most genes have crystallized as initiatives promoting the investigation of understudied sets of genes, an approach to gene scholarship recently termed ‘unknomics’ ( Rocha et al., 2023 ). The insight that understudied genes are lost to titles and abstracts of research articles in a leaky pipeline between genome-wide assays and reporting of results, and FMUG, have already been useful in guiding our own unknomics research ( Figure 4B ). As our present analysis is correlative, it also is tempting to propose controlled trials where published manuscripts on high-throughput studies randomly report hit genes in the abstract even if not investigated further by the authors. This intervention would need to be carefully designed since abstracts are limited in their size. Further, the observed discrepancy between the popularity of hits highlighted by GWAS versus other technologies suggests that some -omics technologies may be more powerful than others for characterizing understudied genes. This possibility merits further research and researchers participating in unknomics should consider the relative strengths of each technology toward providing tractable results for follow-up. We believe that enabling scientists to consciously engage with bias in research target selection will enable more biomedical researchers to participate in unknomics, to the potential benefit of their own research impact and toward the advancement of our collective understanding of the entire human genome.

We sought to identify at which point in the scientific process understudied genes are ignored as research targets in investigations using -omics experiments ( Figure 1A ). To receive scholarly attention, a gene must travel through a pipeline from biological reality to experimental results to write-up of those results. These results must be extended by subsequent research by other scholars. Understudied genes do not progress all the way through the pipeline, but it is unclear where this leak primarily occurs. The first possibility is that some genes are less studied because they are rarely identified as hits in experiments. Prior studies have, however, shown that understudied genes are frequent hits in high-throughput experiments ( Riba et al., 2016; Haynes et al., 2018; Stoeger and Nunes Amaral, 2020 ), suggesting that this is not the case. The second possibility is that understudied genes are frequently found as hits in high-throughput experiments but are not investigated further by the authors. The final possibility is that subsequent studies do not continue work on understudied genes revealed by the initial study. To evaluate these three possibilities, we gathered high-throughput experimental results and the titles and abstracts of articles reporting on these results, as well as the titles and abstracts of articles citing these reporting articles ( focus studies ). We then quantified the attention that ‘hit’ genes from these experiments had received by counting their occurrences in titles of abstracts within the entire biomedical literature excluding these high-throughput experiments. For example, the results for transcriptomics were obtained from 148 focus studies ( original research ) and 1678 subsequent studies ( articles citing focus articles; green boxes Figure 1B )

. Our literature review revealed several tools and resources aiming to promote research of understudied genes by publicizing understudied genes ( Duek et al., 2018; Crow et al., 2019; Perdigão and Rosa, 2019; Essegian et al., 2020; Sheils et al., 2021; Higgins et al., 2022; Wainberg et al., 2021; Rocha et al., 2023 or by providing information about hit genes Stoeger et al., 2018; Rebhan et al., 1998; Tan et al., 2017; Kustatscher et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2022 ). However, we noted the absence of tools enabling scientists to actively engage with factors that align with gene selection. Although such factors are largely correlated when considering all genes ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ), some factors cluster together and the influence of specific factors could vary across laboratories. For instance, scientists could vary in their ability to perform proteomics, or ability to explore orthologous genes in C. elegans, or ability to leverage human population data, or perform standardized mouse assays. Our tool makes selection bias explicit, while acknowledging that different laboratories vary in their techniques and capabilities for follow-up research. Rather than telling scientists about the existence of biases, FMUG aims to prompt scientists to make bias-aware informed decisions to identify and potentially tackle important gaps in knowledge that they are well-suited to address. For this reason, we believe that FMUG will not be of value only to scientists engaging in high-throughput studies, but also by scientists wishing to mine existing datasets for hit genes that they would be well-positioned to investigate further. FMUG takes a list of genes from the user ( ostensibly a hit list from a high-throughput -omics experiment ) and provides the kind of information that will allow a user to select genes for further study

. 01 ( Supplementary file 2 ), of which 16 showed a negative association and only 4 showed a positive association. Notably, MeSH terms representing high-throughput techniques ( e. g. D055106:Genome-Wide Association Study and D020869:Gene Expression Profiling ) showed no significant association. This finding suggests that authors of high-throughput studies have little to gain or lose citation-wise by highlighting understudied genes. To summarize, our investigations are reminiscent of the previously described separation between ‘large-scale’ and ‘small-scale’ biological research ( Knorr Cetina, 1999; Alberts, 1985; Richardson and Stevens, 2015 ). Authors of high-throughput studies do not highlight understudied genes in the title or abstract of their publications, the sections of the publication most accessible to other scientists. While, overall, understudied genes ( and high-throughput assays themselves [Stoeger and Nunes Amaral, 2022] ) correlate with increased citation impact, for high-throughput studies any potential gain in citations is either absent or too small to be significant. Thus, there may not be any incentive for authors of high-throughput studies to highlight understudied genes. To illuminate why understudied genes are abandoned between experimental results and the write-up of results, we performed a literature review to identify factors that have been proposed to limit studies of understudied genes ( Supplementary file 3 ). These factors range from evolutionary factors ( e. g. whether a gene only has homologs in primates ), to chemical factors ( e. g. gene length or hydrophobicity of protein product ), to historical factors ( e. g. whether a gene’s sequence has previously been patented ) to materialistic factors affecting experimental design ( e. g. whether designed antibodies are robust for immunohistochemistry )

. If this were the case, preemptively avoiding understudied hits would be the rational decision for authors of -omics studies. We thus decided to complement our preceding analysis by an analysis explicitly focused on citation impact. Notably, we found that the concern of publications on understudied genes receiving fewer citations does not hold for present-day research on human genes; in biomedical literature at-large, articles focusing on less-investigated genes typically accumulate more citations, an effect that has held consistently since 2001 ( Figure 2 ). Further, since 1990, articles about the least popular genes have at times been three to four times more likely to be among the most cited articles than articles on the most popular genes whereas articles on the most popular genes have been slightly less to be highly cited than lowly cited ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). To rule out that these macroscopic observations stem from us having aggregated over different diseases, we separately analyzed 602 disease-related MeSH terms ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ). We found 29 MeSH terms with a statistically significant Spearman correlation using Benjamini-Hochberg FDR <0. 01 ( Supplementary file 1 ), of which 27 showed a positive correlation and 2 showed a negative correlation.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides were suggested as healthier alternatives to sugar-sweetened beverages. Nevertheless, the potential detrimental effects of these noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function remain inadequately understood. We have established a zebrafish model that exhibits significant excessive angiogenesis induced by high glucose, resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ). Utilizing this model, we observed that glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides could induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels ( ISVs ). The excessively branched vessels were observed to be formed by ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells ( ECs ) into tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis of the ECs in the embryos exposed to high glucose revealed an augmented ratio of capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and a series of upregulated proangiogenic genes. Further analysis and experiments validated that reduced foxo1a mediated the excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides via upregulating the expression of marcksl1a. This study has provided new evidence showing the negative effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on the vascular system and the underlying mechanisms.

   ., 2016; Andrade et al., 2021 ). Moreover, it also plays an important role in diabetic microvascular complications, including DR ( Parmar et al., 2023; Behl et al., 2022 ). Here, by combining the single-cell transcriptomic sequencing data analysis and experimental validation, we identified the transcription factor Foxo1a, which was significantly downregulated in the embryos treated with high glucose, responsible for the excessive angiogenesis. Additionally, our result further revealed that Foxo1a exerts its regulatory function during this process by downregulating its target gene marcksl1a, regardless of whether the embryos were treated with D-glucose or L-glucose. Taken together, our results suggested that both caloric and noncaloric monosaccharides treatment could lead to excessive angiogenesis by promoting the differentiation of quiescent ECs into tip cells through the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway. Previous studies have linked the consumption of ASB to the occurrence and development of cardiovascular disease ( Fung et al., 2009; de Koning et al., 2012; Fagherazzi et al., 2013; Gardener et al., 2012; Drouin-Chartier et al., 2019; de Koning et al., 2011; Hirahatake et al., 2019; Mossavar-Rahmani et al., 2019; Vyas et al., 2015 ). However, the potential mechanisms underlying the association have not been well documented. In recent years, positive associations between ASB and cardiovascular disease have been proposed, possibly due to several plausible factors, including the potential impact of ASBs on central nervous system circuits, gut hormone secretion, and gut microbiota ( Blundell and Hill, 1986; Pepino, 2015; Nettleton et al., 2016 ). Additionally, it has been hypothesized that the ASBs might stimulate appetite and increase calorie intake ( Blundell and Hill, 1986; Pepino, 2015 )

In this study, we successfully established a new zebrafish model with significant excessive angiogenesis, resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in PDR more closely than previously established models ( Jung et al., 2016; Jörgens et al., 2015 ). Jung et al. have described a short-term zebrafish model for diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) induced by high glucose, which exhibited blood vessel defects ( Jung et al., 2016 ). However, these defects were limited to the disruption of tight junctions and dilation of hyaloid-retinal vessels ( Jung et al., 2016 ), without the excessive angiogenesis and vascular blockage observed in PDR and our established model. Additionally, although Jörgens et al. have observed the hyperbranching of small vessel structures originating from the upper part of ISVs, growing horizontally toward and partially connecting to the neighboring ISVs field ( Jörgens et al., 2015 ), the angiogenic sprouts did not form a more complex structure that was observed in our research. The excessive development of immature blood vessels represents a significant pathological condition in the progression of DR and nephropathy ( Wilkinson-Berka, 2004; Osterby and Nyberg, 1987 ). Hyperglycemia has been considered one of the most causal factors causing vascular damage, including excessive angiogenesis. However, the exact mechanism through which hyperglycemia impairs the blood vessels is not well determined. We analyzed single-cell transcriptomic sequencing data of the ECs isolated from D-glucose-treated embryos to gain more insights into it. The findings revealed an increased ratio of tip cells and proliferating ECs, accompanied by the altered expression of various angiogenic genes in the ECs of D-glucose-treated embryos. Foxo1 has been validated to be essential for sustaining the quiescence of ECs, with involvement in metabolism regulation ( Wilhelm et al., 2016; Andrade et al., 2021 )

. Wondering whether the effects of glucose and fructose on vascular development were mediated by metabolic events, we then conducted the same tests by using other noncaloric monosaccharides, including L-glucose, D-mannose, D-ribose, and L-arabinose, which animals could not digest. Interestingly, we observed that all these noncaloric monosaccharides could induce excessive angiogenesis, among which the L-glucose purchased from two companies resulted in a similar phenotype as efficiently as D-glucose did ( Figure 2a–h ). To rule out the effect of osmotic pressure, we treated zebrafish embryos with isotonic disaccharides, including lactose, maltose, and sucrose, which did not cause a significant excessive angiogenic phenotype ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4d and h; Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ). However, higher concentration disaccharide treatment can also cause excessive angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ). In addition, we also tested the effects of pyruvic acid but did not observe the excessive angiogenic phenotype in the embryos treated with pyruvic acid solution at 50 nM to 50 μM concentration ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ). Furthermore, we examined the arterial and venous identity of the hyperbranched vessels via live imaging analysis of the high glucose-treated Tg ( flt1:YFP::kdrl:ras-mCherry ) line, in which the YFP expression in the artery was relatively higher than that in the vein ( Krueger et al., 2011 ). The result revealed that the hyperbranched ectopic vessels comprised arteries and veins ( Figure 2i and j ). Given that a high glucose shock has been observed to induce excessive angiogenesis in 48 hpf embryos, it was hypothesized that the shock might play a crucial role in regulating the differentiation of quiescent endothelial cells ( ECs ) into active tip cell-like cells and their subsequent behaviors

To establish the short-term zebrafish hyperangiogenenic model induced by high glucose treatment, we immersed the Tg ( fli1aEP:EGFP-CAAX ) ntu666 embryos, a transgenic line wherein the endothelial cells were labeled with membrane-bound GFP ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ), in glucose solution within a wide range of concentrations and time windows ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). We subsequently measured the glucose concentration in the embryos. We found that the glucose concentration in the embryos treated with high glucose was significantly higher than that in the control group ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ). We observed that exposing zebrafish embryos at either 24 hr post fertilization ( hpf ) or 48 hpf to a 6% D-glucose treatment for a duration exceeding 48 hr led to dramatically increased formation of blood vessels ( Figure 1, Videos 1 and 2 ), especially intersegmental vessels ( ISVs ) in the indicated area ( Figure 1b ). The hyperbranched endothelial cells were observed to sprout from existing vessels, including the ISVs, dorsal aorta ( DA ), and dorsal lateral anastomotic vessel ( DLAV ) ( Figure 1 ) in embryos treated with high glucose. Additionally, these ectopically branched angiogenic sprouts were not perfused by blood flow. Despite the abnormal vessel formation, no significant developmental defects were observed in these treated embryos when examined under a bright-field microscope ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4a–c ). Moreover, no excessive angiogenic phenotype was observed in the embryos treated with 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% D-glucose within the corresponding time frame ( Figure 1—figure supplement 5 ). Fructose is a ketonic monosaccharide that is an energy source for living organisms. Therefore, our study investigated the potential effects of fructose on vascular dysfunction in comparison to glucose. The results showed that fructose also induced excessive angiogenesis in zebraf embryos ( Figure 2a–e ), similar to D-glucose. However, fructose was less potent than D-gl in inducing angiogenesis ( Figure 2f ). We also tested the effects of other noncal monoscharides including Dribose, Labinose, and Driose on zebraf embryos and observed excessive angiogenesis ( Figure 2a–h ), similar to D-gl and fructose ( Figure 2f ). To rule out the effect of osmotic pressure, we treated zraf embryos with isotonic dischar lactose, maltose, and sucrose, which did not result in excessive angiogenic phenotype ( Figure 1— supplement 4 and Figure 2— supplement ) However, higher dischar treatment also caused excessive angiogenesis in zraf embryos ( Figure 2— supplement 3 ) In addition, we tested the effects of pyvic acid and did not observe excessive angiogenic phenotype in embryos treated with pyvic solution at 50M to 50 μM ( Figure 2— supplement ) Furthermore, examined arterial and venous identity of hyperbrched vessels via live imaging of high-treated T ( fl1:FPkd:rlrasCherry ) line, which YFP in artery was higher than in vein ( Krger et al,2011 The result that hyperbrched vessels comprised arteries and veins Figure 2i and j Given high glucose has been shown to induce excessive angiogenesis in 48 hpf embryos it was hypothesized that might play a role in regulating differentiation quies endothelial cells into tip-like cells and their behaviors To establish short-term zraf hyperangiogenic model by high treatment we immersed T ( f1:EGFP:CA n666 embryos transgenic wherein endothelial labeled membrane GFP Figure 1— supplement in glucose range concentrations and time windows Figure— supplement We measured glucose in embryos found that in treated high significantly higher than control Figure— supplement observed zraf at 24 hpf or 48pf 6 D-gl treatment exceeding hr dramatically increased formation blood especially IS in area Figure 1 Videos 1 2 hyperbrched endothelial sprouted from existing including IS DA DL Figure 1 not perfused by flow despite abnormal formation significant defects observed under microscope Figure— supplement a–c Moreover excessive observed in treated 1 2 3 4 D within frame Figure— supplement Fructose energy source organisms therefore investigated effects fructose vascular comparison glucose showed also excessive in zraf Figure 2– similar D However fr less potent inducing Figure 2 tested other noncal monosides Dri Labin Dose Dose zraf observed excessive Figure 2 rule effect osmotic isotonic lactose malt suc did not excessive phenotype Figure— supplement Figure— supplement higher dischar also excessive zraf Figure— supplement tested pyvic did not observe excessive in pyvic solution 50 50M Figure— supplement examined arterial venous hyperbrched live imaging high T fl1FPkdrlrasCh line YFP artery higher vein Krger et al201 result comprised arteries veins Figure 2 j hypothesized high regulating differentiation quies endothelial tip-like behaviors

I'll provide a clear and concise summary of the research article.

**Background:** Artificially sweetened beverages containing non-caloric monosacides, such as sugar substitutes, have been suggested as healthier alternatives to sugar-sweetened beverages. However, the potential effects of these non-caloric monacides on blood vessel function remain inadequately understood.

**Research:** The researchers established a zebraf model that exhibits excessive angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) induced by high glucose, resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (DR). They observed that glucose and non-caloric monacides induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels (ISVs). The branched vessels were formed by
Researchers investigated whether shared structures across different domains are employed to facilitate memory of multiple sequences and its neural correlates. They manipulated the consistency between location and color trajectories in a sequence task where participants memorized a sequence of items with different colors and locations and reproduced the color and location sequences one after. Sequences with consistent trajectories demonstrated improved memory performance and a correlation between reproduced color and location sequences. Sequences with consistent showed neural reactivation of trajectories and spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations. Neural reactivation correlated with behavior. The findings suggest a common structure is leveraged for the storage of multiple sequences through compressed and replay, facilitating information in working memory (WM). 

The study aimed to identify the underlying structure for efficient storage in WM and investigated whether shared structures across domains are employed to facilitate memory of multiple sequences and neural. Location and color features were characterized along a continuous ring, and the consistency between sequences manipulated. Color-location alignment was associated with better performance than misaligned, and the benefit attributed to structure constraints on items representing uncertainty. EEG recordings provided evidence for a compressive strategy, reactivation of shared during encoding and replay of sequences during recall. Structure reactivation related to behavior and replay. The results demonstrate subjects realign trajectories across features to facilitate memory of two sequences. 

The study extended the role of cognitive map in organizing information across domains in WM and revealed compress encoding and replay in multiple storage. Neural replay refers to sequential reactivation in the same or reversed as previous experience. It was observed in the hippocampus for navigation but found in higher-level tasks in human brains. Replay was posited to represent structure, inference, and generalization. When recalling sequences, replay occurred for color but not location, supporting its spontaneous nature. The results excluded other interpretations, such as motor, attention, rehearsal. Replay appeared for color-aligned sequences but not misaligned, implicating consolidation of shared structure. The findings demonstrate roles of replay in representation, mediating alignment in WM. Structure and content are factorized, represented. Confirming location and representations during encoding, the neuronal correlates of sequence during retrieval were examined. The recall period, subjects needed to remain without responses but prepare subsequent recall. Memories were converted to sequences during this period. Analysis indicated correlation between recalled and trajectories for aligned condition, suggesting combination across features. Neural evidence for reintegration between sequence and location for aligned during this period was sought. The condition displayed strong decoding for first location but weak for third, not second. The misaligned showed similar profiles for first and third. The primacy might be due to the first recalled, most-relevant or preparation 

Thirty participants performed a WM task with EEG recordings. Disks with locations and colors were presented, and participants remembered locations and orders. After a delay, a ring instructed preparation for recall without responses. A cursor appeared, and participants clicked locations in order. The consistency between location and color was manipulated. In the aligned condition, despite occupying different positions, their distances were the same. In the misaligned, they had distinct trajectories. It was hypothesized humans combine shared structure to facilitate memory, though unsupervised. The results provided behavioral and neural for leveraging structures. Sequences with aligned trajectories showed memory and correlation reproduced color location. Sequences aligned demonstrated reactivation during encoding and retention, replay color recalling.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Mutations in the human PURA gene cause the neurodevelopmental PURA syndrome. In contrast to several other monogenetic disorders, almost all reported mutations in this nucleic acid-binding protein result in the full disease penetrance. In this study, we observed that patient mutations across PURA impair its previously reported co-localization with processing bodies. These mutations either destroyed the folding integrity, RNA binding, or dimerization of PURA. We also solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA and combined them with molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The observed unusually high dynamics and structural promiscuity of PURA indicated that this protein is particularly susceptible to mutations impairing its structural integrity. It offers an explanation why even conservative mutations across PURA result in the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome.

   . Furthermore, NMR measurements with the 15N- and 1H-labeled N-terminal PUR domain yielded many spectral differences between the wild-type and K97E variants in particular within their β-sheets ( Figure 5F and Figure 5—figure supplement 3A ). Despite these considerable structural changes, the NMR data also confirmed that the K97E-variant protein remains folded in solution and indicates that PUR domains may be able to partially compensate for mutations by folding promiscuity. These findings were further supported by molecular dynamics simulations, indicating high intrinsic motions of the N-terminal PUR domain ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3B ). Instead of hot-spot regions for disease-causing mutations, as reported for other genetic disorders such as neurodevelopmental Rett syndrome ( Lombardi et al., 2015 ), pathogenic variations in PURA syndrome patients are found along the entire protein sequence ( Johannesen et al., 2021; Reijnders et al., 2018 ). Also, in contrast to disorders such as the Rett syndrome, most of these variations cause the full spectrum of disease symptoms. Our findings suggest that the flexibility and promiscuity of hsPURA domain folding render this protein particularly susceptible to mutations, even when amino-acid substitutions impose only moderate changes to the local charge and stereochemistry. This property of PUR domains might offer a structural explanation for why so many genetic variations across the sequence of hsPURA result in the full disease spectrum. Not in all cases is the pathogenic effect of a given genetic alteration as clear as in the case of K97E. For instance, the replacement of arginine 140 by proline in hsPURA was initially reported to cause PURA syndrome ( Lee et al., 2018 ). Even though the corresponding patient did show symptoms, the severity and type of symptoms raised doubts about this initial diagnosis

., 2015 ), no hot-spot regions could be identified in the protein sequence that trigger the PURA syndrome. With the exception of the unstructured N-terminal region and the very C-terminus, almost all mutations across the protein sequence appear to result in the full disease spectrum ( Johannesen et al., 2021; Reijnders et al., 2018 ). To date, we fail to understand why there is such an underrepresentation of mild phenotypes in patients with PURA syndrome. In this study, we experimentally assessed the structure and function of human PURA as well as the impact of representative PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the protein’s integrity. When studying the impact of patient mutations on PURA’s subcellular localization, we observed impaired processing body ( P-body ) association but close-to normal localization to stress granules, indicating a potential importance of P-bodies for PURA syndrome pathology. Two particularly interesting disease-causing variants, K97E and R140P, were further analyzed by structural means. The results indicated that the N-terminal PUR domain is unusually flexible in its fold and prone to misfolding upon mutation. In summary, we provide a structure-based explanation for the underrepresentation of genetic variations with mild symptoms in patients and a rational approach for predicting and functionally testing genetic variations of uncertain significance.

., 2014; Lalani et al., 2014 ). Hallmarks of this so-called PURA syndrome are developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, epileptic seizures, and feeding difficulties, among others ( Reijnders et al., 2018; Johannesen et al., 2021 ). Mutations causing PURA syndrome are often frame-shift events but also point mutations distributed over the entire sequence. Based on the crystal structures of PURA from Drosophila melanogaster ( dmPURA ), three conserved sequence regions termed PUR repeats I, II, and III were identified to fold into globular domains ( Graebsch et al., 2010; Graebsch et al., 2009; Weber et al., 2016 ). Whereas PUR repeat I and II assemble into an N-terminal PUR domain via intramolecular interactions, two C-terminal PUR repeats III from different molecules interact with each other and thus mediate dimerization of PURA. All these PUR domains belong to the class of the PC4-like protein family, which mainly bind single-stranded nucleic acids and can unwind double-stranded DNA and RNA ( Janowski and Niessing, 2020 ). Although both PUR domains possess the typical PC4-like β-β-β-β-α- ( linker ) -β-β-β-β-α topology, the N-terminal domain has been suggested to be the main RNA/DNA interaction entity ( Weber et al., 2016 ). In a previous study, homology models based on the dmPURA crystal structures ( Graebsch et al., 2009; Weber et al., 2016 ) were used to predict in silico the effects of PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the structural integrity of the human PURA protein ( Reijnders et al., 2018 ). While these mutations could be classified into groups that likely either do or do not impair the structural integrity of PURA, these predictions remained speculative ( Reijnders et al., 2018 ). Surprisingly, in contrast to phenotypically related genetic diseases such as the Rett syndrome ( Lombardi et al

. We expect that our experimentally determined structures of the human N- and C-terminal PUR domains offer more physiological structural reference points for future assessments of novel hsPURA mutations and their potential pathogenicity in patients. In summary, this study provides the first functional and experimental structural assessment of the effects of PURA syndrome-causing variants on folding, nucleic acid binding, and unwinding, as well as on subcellular localization to stress granules and P-bodies. Some of the selected patient variants of hsPURA were previously predicted to have folding defects ( Reijnders et al., 2018 ). Of note, for all these cases expression tests with recombinant proteins resulted in insoluble samples, indicating that these variant proteins indeed have impaired folding ( Supplementary file 1a ). Whereas predictions of such misfolding events appear reliable, the examples of R140P ( benign ) and K97E ( pathogenic ) indicate that structural predictions of surface-exposed residues seem more complicated. In fact, the observed great promiscuity of folding of PUR domains indicates that also moderate surface mutations such as K97E can result in promiscuous folding and the full spectrum of disease symptoms. Our study may serve as proof-of-principle that in vitro and structural studies are suitable tools to classify genetic variants in the hsPURA gene as potentially pathogenic or benign.

. In this study, we show that both, the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA can separate double-stranded nucleic acids ( Figures 3D and 4E, F ) and to bind single-stranded nucleic acids ( Figures 3B, C, 4C, D ). We also tested patient-derived variants of hsPURA to find out whether they exhibit impaired interaction with nucleic acids. For the K97E variant, we observed in EMSAs a reduced affinity to RNA ( Figure 4C, D ). Similar behavior of the K97E variant was observed in the strand-separation assay where it showed an almost complete loss of activity ( Figure 4E, F ). The latter is of interest since previous experiments had demonstrated that strand separation contributes to the neuroprotective activity of PURA in a Drosophila FXTAS disease model ( Weber et al., 2016 ). It is therefore also probable that loss of strand-separation activity contributes to cellular abnormalities in hsPURA patie nts harboring the K97E mutation. To establish a structural framework for these observations, we solved the crystal structures of hsPURA III ( Figure 3A ) and of hsPURA I–II ( Figure 4A ). These human structures were overall very similar to previously published crystal structures from dmPURA ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A; Figure 4—figure supplement 1; Graebsch et al., 2009; Weber et al., 2016 ). Based on the crystal structures of hsPURA III ( Figure 3A ), we were able to predict folding defects in the C-terminal PUR domain ( hsPUR III ) that are caused by the patient-derived genetic variations F233del and R245P ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ). Deletion of the N-terminal domain hsP ( Figure 3— supplement 2 ) resulted in loss of dimerization of hsP ( Figure 3— supplement 3 ). In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal hsP ( Figure 4— supplement ) did not affect dimerization of hs ( Figure 4— supplement 3 ). These results indicate that the N-terminal domain is crucial for the dimerization of PUR. We also observed that the N-terminal domain hsP ( Figure 3— supplement 2 ) is more flexible than the C-terminal hs ( Figure 4— supplement 2 ) as shown by molecular dynamics simulations ( Figure 3— supplement 3, Figure 4— supplement 3 ) and NMR measurements ( Figure 3— supplement 4, Figure 4— supplement 4 ). The high flexibility of the N-terminal domain hs may explain why mutations in this region result in full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PUR syndrome. In contrast, mutations in the C-terminal hs ( Figure 4— supplement ) do not result in full penetrance ( Reijers et al,2018; Johannes et al,202 ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: Reports indicate that an interaction between TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 ( ANO1 ) could be widely involved in water efflux of exocrine glands, suggesting that the interaction could play a role in perspiration. In secretory cells of sweat glands present in mouse foot pads, TRPV4 clearly colocalized with cytokeratin 8, ANO1, and aquaporin-5 ( AQP5 ). Mouse sweat glands showed TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases that were inhibited by menthol. Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type, but not in TRPV4-deficient mice and was inhibited by menthol both in wild-type and TRPM8KO mice. The basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by an ANO1 inhibitor. Sweating could be important for maintaining friction forces in mouse foot pads, and this possibility is supported by the finding that wild-type mice climbed up a slippery slope more easily than TRPV4-deficient mice. Furthermore, TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis ( AIGA ) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA. Collectively, TRPV4 is likely involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with ANO1, and TRPV4 itself or the TRPV4/ANO 1 complex would be targeted to develop agents that regulate perspiration.

   . TRPV4 was absent in myoepithelial cells. Conspicuous co-labeling of TRPV4 and ANO1 or AQP5 with filamentous actin ( F-actin ) was seen at the apical site ( luminal side ) of the secretory cells ( Figure 1E ). These close topological relationships clearly suggest that TRPV4, ANO1, and AQP5 would be able to form a complex that promotes sweat secretion in eccrine glands of mouse foot pads. These results also suggest that TRPV4-expressing secretory cells are involved in the secretion of macromolecular components as well as the secretion of water and ions. We previously showed the functional interaction of TRPV4 and ANO1 in the heterologous expression with HEK293T cells and mouse native exocrine gland acinar cells ( Takayama et al., 2014; Derouiche et al., 2018 ). Then, we examined functional TRPV4 expression in sweat glands in mouse foot pads. WT mouse sweat glands responded to the TRPV4 agonist, GSK ( 500 nM ), and to Ach ( 10 μM ) ( Figure 2A ). No cytosolic Ca2+ increase induced by GSK was observed in sweat glands from TRPV4KO mice ( Figure 2B ). Interestingly, the GSK-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was significantly inhibited by menthol ( 5 μM ) in WT mouse sweat glands, suggesting that menthol inhibited TRPV4 function. Meanwhile, menthol alone caused no change in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ( Figure 2C ). These data indicate functional expression of TRPV4 in mouse secretory cells. To examine the functional interaction between TRPV4 and ANO1 in mouse sweat glands in vivo, stimulated sweating induced by Ach ( 100 μM, 2 min ) in mouse hind paws at 25 and 35°C was investigated using an iodine and starch reaction to measure secreted amylase ( Nejsum et al., 2002 ). At 25°C, no difference in stimulated sweating was seen both in WT and TRPV4KO mice while sweating was increased at 35°C in WT, but not in TRPV4KO mice ( Figure 3A )

. The parameters that they examined are different from ours, and the authors examined human healthy volunteers while we used the sample of patients with AIGA. More investigation would be needed in the future. The application of menthol to the skin produces a cool, comfortable sensation that is generally thought to result from the activation of the menthol receptor TRPM8. However, the finding that menthol inhibits both TRPV4 and ANO1 suggests that transient reduction in sweating by inhibiting TRPV4 and ANO1 also contributes to the cool sensation. On the other hand, patients with hyperhidrosis can sweat enough to soak their clothing or have sweat drip off their hands ( Cohen and Solish, 2003; Schlereth et al., 2009 ). Hyperhidrosis can occur as a primary or secondary effect after infections or with some endocrine diseases. Others can experience hyperhidrosis on the palms of their hands when nervous. Development of chemicals targeting TRPV4, ANO1, or the complex could be a new therapeutic strategy for these conditions, for which there are currently no effective treatments. Many TRP channels have high Ca2+ permeability, suggesting that Ca2+ entering cells through TRP channels in turn activates more Ca2+-activated proteins, including other Ca2+-activated ion channels such as Ca2+-activated K+ channels. This interaction could expand the importance of TRP channels in physiological functions, and complexes between TRP channels and Ca2+-activated proteins would be novel targets for drug development.

. Temperature-dependent basal sweating without Ach stimulation for 15 min was also observed in WT mice, but not in TRPV4KO mice ( Figure 3B ). Menthol, a well-known TRPM8 activator, inhibits ANO1 function ( Takayama et al., 2017 ). The ability of menthol to inhibit both TRPV4 and ANO1 suggests that menthol would inhibit sweating. Accordingly, we compared stimulated sweating with either an ethanol vehicle ( used for menthol dilution ) or menthol treatment for 2 min. Menthol treatment caused a significantly lower degree of sweating than ethanol treatment both in WT and TRPM8KO mice ( Figure 3C and D ). This result could indicate that menthol inhibits sweating by inhibiting the function of ANO1, independently of TRPM8. Next, in order to prove the involvement of ANO1 in basal sweating, we examined the effects of a strong and specific ANO1 antagonist, Ani9. An Ani9 treatment almost completely abolished basal sweating both at 25 and 35°C ( Figure 3E and F ), indicating a pivotal role of ANO1 in sweating. Mice do not sweat to control body temperature, so the physiological significance of hind paw sweating is unclear. In humans, fingertip moisture is known to be optimally modulated during object manipulation through regulation of friction force ( André et al., 2010 ). The same mechanism might promote the traction of hind paws when mice climb slippery slopes. Here, we constructed a slope covered with slippery vinyl ( Figure 4A ) and compared the climbing behaviors of WT and TRPV4KO mice for 1 hr at 26–27°C with 35–50% humidity. The total number of climbing attempts was the same for WT and TRPV4KO mice ( 25. 6 ± 2. 5 for WT, n = 5; 24. 7 ± 3. 9 for TRPV4KO, n = 4 ) ( Figure 4B ), but a higher percentage of WT mice successfully climbed to the top of the slope than did TRPV4KO mice ( 79. 5 ± 6. 4% for WT; 41. 8 ± 2. 8% for TRPV4KO; p<0. 01 ) ( Figure 4C and D, Videos 1 and 2 ). WT mice easily came down the slippery slope

We detected expression of TRPV4, ANO1, and the water channel aquaporin-5 ( AQP5 ) in the eccrine glands of mouse foot pads. The secretory coil is located in the deep dermis and a relatively straight duct opens to the skin surface. We first validated an anti-TRPV4 antibody that we generated. This anti-TRPV4 antibody conspicuously labeled the basal layer of the epidermis, secretory eccrine gland cells, and duct cells only in skin from wild-type ( WT ) mice, but not in skin from TRPV4-deficient ( TRPV4KO ) mice ( Figure 1A ), indicating the antibody specificity. TRPV4 was clearly localized in secretory glands as confirmed by positivity for cytokeratin 8 ( CK8 ), a secretory cell marker ( Figure 1B ). The duct cells were not labeled by ANO1 and CK8 ( Figure 1B ). TRPV4-immunoreactivity was stronger in duct cells near the secretory region and gradually diminished in the distal excretory ducts toward the epidermis. Bilayered sweat ducts showed TRPV4 labeling in basal cells but not suprabasal cells ( Figure 1C ). Secretory cells in human eccrine glands are classified into two types: clear cells that mainly secrete water and electrolytes, and dark cells that secrete macromolecules like glycoproteins. We found that TRPV4-expressing secretory cells were positive for the calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ), a dark cell marker, and were heterogeneously labeled ( Figure 1D ). This result is consistent with earlier studies showing that mouse eccrine secretory cells express TRPV4 ( Takama et al, 2014; Deriche et al, 2018 ) and suggests that TR4-expressing secretory cells are involved in secretion of macromolecular components as well as water and ions.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The cerebral cortex displays a bewildering diversity of shapes and sizes across and within species. Despite this diversity, we present a universal multi-scale description of primate cortices. We show that all cortical shapes can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes. As neighbouring folds are gradually merged, the cortices of 11 primate species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory, that also overlaps with over 70 other mammalian species. Our results indicate that all cerebral cortices are approximations of the same archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of df = 2. 5. Importantly, this new understanding enables a more precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale. To demonstrate the importance of this new understanding, we show a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology. We observe a more than fourfold increase in effect size ( from two standard deviations to eight standard deviations ) at a spatial scale of approximately 2 mm compared to standard morphological analyses. Our new understanding may, therefore, generate superior biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future. 

    Supporting Text:
    Compared to previous literature, we can summarise our main contribution and advance as follows: ( i ) We are showing for the first time that representative primate species follow the exact same fractal scaling – as opposed to previous work showing that they have a similar fractal dimension ( Hofman, 1985; Hofman, 1991 ), i. e., slope, but not necessarily the same offset, as previous methods had no consistent way of comparing offsets. ( ii ) Previous work could also not show direct agreement in morphometrics between the coarse-grained brains of primate species and other non-primate mammalian species. ( iii ) Demonstrating in proof-of-principle that multiscale morphometrics, in practice, can have much larger effect sizes for classification applications. This moves beyond our previous work where we only showed the scaling law across ( Mota and Herculano-Houzel, 2014 ) and within species ( Wang et al., 2016 ), but all on one ( native ) scale with comparable effect sizes for classification applications ( Wang et al., 2016 ). In simple terms: we know that objects can have the same fractal dimension, but differ greatly in a range of other shape properties. However, we demonstrate here, that representative primate brains and mammalian brains indeed share a range of other key shape properties, on top of agreeing in fractal dimension. This suggests a universal blueprint for mammalian brain shape and a common set of mechanisms governing cortical folding. As a practical additional outcome of our study, we could show that our novel method of deriving multiscale metrics can differentiate subtle morphological changes much better ( four times the effect size ) than the metrics we have been using so far at a single native scale. Expressing cortical morphology as a function of scale is more detailed than a list of summary morphometric measures, and more informative than the mere listing of every sulcus and gyrus

. We propose this new syntax as the basis for a more rigorous characterisation of brain morphology and morphological changes. A clear advantage is that some biological processes may only act on a specific spatial scales, leaving other scales untouched ( ageing in our example ). By disambiguation of the spatial scale, it allows for an extra dimension of understanding, and tracking of biological processes. In the future, this approach can also be extended to cortical development and to various degenerative ( Wang et al., 2016 ) and congenital ( Wang et al., 2021 ) neuropathic conditions, especially if combined with a regionalised versions of this method applied to specific cortical regions ( Wang et al., 2019 ) or local patches ( Leiberg et al., 2021 ). Empirically, the main result of this paper is the demonstration of a universal self-similar scaling ( Equation 3 ) for primate, and presumably mammalian cortices. There are two aspects of this universality: first that for each and every cortex the value of Kremains the same for all scales as one removes substructures smaller than a varying length scale ( or equivalently, that the fractal dimension is almost exactly 2. 5 in all cases ). Second, that the value of K for the cortices of different species is approximately the same, as previously observed ( Equation 1 ) across species ( Mota and Herculano-Houzel, 2015 ) and individuals ( Wang et al., 2016 ). One could imagine a set of objects for which one but not the other aspect of the universality in K holds true. However, the fact that both universalities hold true is significant. It suggests the existence of a single highly conserved mechanism for cortical folding, operating on all length scales self-similarly with only a few morphological degrees of freedom. It also hints at the possibility of deriving cortical scaling from some variational principle

., 2022; Díaz Beltrán et al., 2024 ). Most recently published estimates of fractal dimension for the whole cortex are indeed close to 2. 5 ( King et al., 2010; Madan and Kensinger, 2016; Madan and Kensinger, 2017; Marzi et al., 2020 ). Here, for the first time, we propose to directly construct morphologically plausible realisations of cortices at any specified spatial scale, or resolution. This is achieved through a coarse-graining method that removes morphological details smaller than a specified scale while preserving surface integrity. For example, at a set scale of 3 mm, sulcal walls that are less than 3 mm apart would be removed, and the neighbouring gyri would be fused. This method is a new systematic way of obtaining shape properties from the cortex in terms of a sequence of morphometric measurements as spatial scale varies. By examining how areas scale across coarse-grained versions of actual primate cortices, we will be able to directly verify cortical self-similarity.

. Our comparisons here between coarse-grained brains and actual brains is purely on the level of morphometrics across the whole cortex. In contrast, we tested various non-brain objects, and while e. g., the walnut, and bell pepper form ( partially ) straight lines, they vary in both K and S ( see Appendix 5 ). These objects may have a fractal regime, but their fractal dimension is not 2. 5, nor are they similar to primate or mammalian brains in terms of K or S. Furthermore, Appendix 6 underscores the algorithmic and statistical robustness of these results using multiple realisations of the coarse-graining procedure on the same object. In this framework, our main result can thus be expressed simply: for all the cortices we analysed, and for none of the non-cortices, coarse-graining will leave K largely unaffected, while morphological complexity S will decrease. In the final part of our work, we show how our algorithm and the associated new understanding of brain morphology may become useful in applications. As an example, we will focus on how the ageing process affects human cortical morphology across scales. In Figure 4A, we compare the total surface area At ( λ ) as a function of scale λ for a young ( 20- year-old ) vs. an old ( 80- year-old ) group of human brains. The difference in At between the groups takes a U shape, and the strongest effect is seen at approximately 2 millimeters ( greatest effect size of –8. 635 seen at scale 2. 188 mm ), where older subjects have higher At. For scales over ∼5 mm, and under ∼0. 5 mm the differences become relatively small, suggesting the ageing process has less effect on the largest and smallest cortical morphological features. Finally, we reproduced these results in an independent dataset in Appendix 7. 2

., 2019; Valk et al., 2020 ). It thus seems likely that comparative neuroanatomical methods ( Mars et al., 2014; Croxson et al., 2018 ) may be directly used to identify and contrast structures in coarse-grained cortices of more highly gyrified species with their analogues in less-gyrified species. One could then perhaps specify when evolution conserves and when it invents old and new cortical features. From an application perspective, our final result illustrates clearly that the surface area difference between older and younger subjects at the ‘native’ scale ( i. e. original free surfer surfaces ) is negligible ( effect size smaller than two standard deviations ). However, in our analysis across scales, there is a clear optimal scale at ∼2 mm where the effect size is maximised between older and younger subjects ( effect size is –8 standard deviations ). For most classification applications in biology and medicine, the increased effect size and hence separability of groups in the scale-dependent morphometrics represent a huge advance over the native scale. Our work here was limited to summary descriptors of entire cortical hemispheres, but future work will explore extensions of these methods to lobes and cortical areas, similarly to Wang et al., 2019; Leiberg et al., 2021. This will generate precise characterisations of the morphological differences between phylae and across developmental stages, and perhaps pinpoint the time and location of morphological changes leading to congenital and neurodegenerative conditions. Ultimately, we hope this new framework for expressing and analysing brain morphology as a function of scale will lead to a better understanding of brain development, ageing, and disease, as well as new biomarkers for a range of conditions.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The canonical NF-κB transcription factor RELA is a master regulator of immune and stress responses and is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocardinoma ( PDAC ) tumours. In this study, we characterised previously unexplored endogenous RELA-GFP dynamics in PDAC cell lines through live single-cell imaging. Our observations revealed that TNFα stimulation induces rapid, sustained, and non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA. Through Bayesian analysis of single-cell datasets with variation in nuclear RELA, we predicted that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cell lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics. RNA-seq analysis identified distinct clusters of RELA-regulated gene expression in PDAC cells, including TNFα-induced RELA upregulation of the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31. Further, siRNA-mediated depletion of ARHGAP31 and NUAK2 altered TNFα-stimulated nuclear RELA dynamics in PDAC cells, establishing a novel negative feedback loop that regulates RELA activation by TNFα. Additionally, we characterised the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells, identifying how NF-κB/IκB proteins genetically and physically interact with RELA in the absence or presence of TNFα. Taken together, we provide computational and experimental support for interdependence between the F-actin network and the NF-κB pathway with RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC.

   . Although the mechanistic basis for how cell shape regulates RELA remains poorly understood, studies have shown that chemically inhibiting actin or tubulin dynamics can increase RELA binding to DNA and RELA-dependent gene expression ( Rosette and Karin, 1995; Bourgarel-Rey et al., 2001; Németh et al., 2004 ). Despite frequent upregulation of both TNFα and RELA in PDAC tumours ( Weichert et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2016 ), the dynamics and regulation of single-cell RELA translocation, as well as RELA transcriptional output, are poorly understood for PDAC cells. Here, we used CRISPR-CAS9 to tag RELA with GFP in the human PDAC cell lines MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 and identified rapid, non-oscillatory, and heterogeneous RELA dynamics by live imaging. To explore potential cytoskeletal or cell shape regulation of RELA in PDAC, we constructed Bayesian models using single-cell datasets from TNFα-stimulated PDAC cells with variation in RELA, actin, and tubulin measurements for hypothesis generation: one dataset with five PDAC cell lines and another with diverse small molecules targeting cytoskeletal components. Notably, nuclear RELA was statistically predicted as dependent on actin features across Bayesian models. Finally, we used RNA-seq to identify genes with distinct patterns of expression based on dependence on TNFα dose and RELA activation. Using live imaging with knockdown of selected targets, our results uncover novel mechanisms regulating inflammation-associated RELA dynamics in PDAC, including negative feedback loops between RELA and the actin modulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31, and between RELA and the non-canonical NF-κB protein RELB.

. Having observed sustained and non-oscillatory nuclear RELA with TNFα ( Figure 1 ), we considered in more detail how the expression of NF-κB transcription factors and IκB family proteins is affected by TNFα dose and RELA inactivation by IκB-SR in PDAC cells, given that IκB proteins are known regulators of RELA across cell types ( Baeuerle and Baltimore, 1988 ). RNA-seq in MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells revealed that expression of RELA itself did not significantly scale with TNFα dose, while RELB and the transcriptionally incompetent NF-κB proteins NFKB1 and NFKB2 showed increasing expression with increasing TNFα ( left graph in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ). TNFα addition significantly altered the expression of a subset of IκB protein-encoding genes, which display distinct expression dynamics: NFKBIA ( Figure 3: cluster 5 ), NFKBIB ( Figure 3: cluster 4 ), NFKBIE ( Figure 3: cluster 3 ), NFKBID ( Figure 3: cluster 6 ), and NFKBIZ ( Figure 3: cluster 6 ). Of these, NFKBIA has the highest absolute RNA expression in MIA PaCa2 cells and NFKBIB has the highest abundance in PANC1 cells, while NFKBID and NFKBIZ have the lowest RNA expression in both cell lines ( right graph in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ). We compared RNA expression in TNFα-treated cells between cells with or without IκB-SR induction ( Wilcoxon tests with multiple test correction ), which revealed that RELB, REL, NFKB2, and NFKBIE have reduced expression with IκB-SR induction in both MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A’ ). These findings indicate that the expression of these genes relies on nuclear translocation of RELA, while the other NF-κB and IκB genes, including the canonical RELA binding partner NFKB1, do not require RELA activation for expression. We also considered how the expression of NF-κB and IκB genes is affected by the treatment duration of TNFα ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A’’ ), combining data from 0. 01, 0. 1, and 10 ng/ml TNFα

. In general, ARHGAP31 depletion upregulated nuclear RELA localisation in response to TNFα, suggesting that ARHGAP31 suppresses inflammatory activation of RELA. NUAK2 depletion upregulates nuclear RELA following 1 hr TNFα in PANC1 cells, but downregulates nuclear RELA following 12 hr TNFα in MIA PaCa2 cells. These results suggest that the dynamics between RELA with NUAK2 are complex as they are both cell line and time-dependent. In terms of knockdown of NF-κB protein encoding genes, depletion of the non-canonical gene RELB significantly affected the RELA response to TNFα in the MIA PaCa2 cell line, with RELB depletion downregulating nuclear RELA ( fold-change ) at 1 hr and upregulating nuclear RELA ( fold-change ) at 12 hr, suggesting that RELB regulates both the ‘early’ and ‘late’ nuclear translocation responses of RELA to TNFα in MIA PaCa2 cells. While no NF-κB pathway components appear to regulate the fold-change of nuclear RELA in PANC1 cells to 1 hr TNFα, the knockdown of several NF-κB/IκB genes upregulated nuclear RELA in PANC1 cells with 12 hr treatment: NFKBIA, NFKBIB, NFKBIE, and RELB. Finally, the fold-change in nuclear RELA signal with 12 hr TNFα was significantly upregulated by NFKBIB depletion in PANC1 cells, suggesting that IκBβ plays a role specifically in the ‘late’ response of RELA to TNFα in this cell line. Taken together, we characterised the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells and additionally identified that the known actin modulators ARHGAP31/NUAK2 are both RELA targets ( Figure 3 ) and regulators of nuclear RELA with TNFα ( Figure 4 ), providing a potential mechanism mediating the relationship between actin and RELA.

. Only ‘cytoplasmic actin mean’ remained as an influencing variable following drug-treatment, suggesting that actin abundance is a key regulator of RELA nuclear localisation. While other variables ( i. e. tubulin and cell shape ) can indirectly influence RELA, they do so via regulating actin network organisation. As RELA is known to be involved in feedback loops with transcriptional targets, with the best-studied example being IκBα ( Brown et al., 1993; Scott et al., 1993; Sun et al., 1993 ), we sought to identify the transcriptional targets of RELA in PDAC and whether any are known regulators of actin. To this end, we carried out RNA-seq analysis of PDAC cells at an early ( 1 hr ) and late ( 5 hr ) timepoint with varying TNFα doses ( 0. 01, 0. 1, or 10 ng/ml TNFα ), using MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells expressing endogenously tagged RELA-GFP and doxycycline ( dox ) -inducible IκB super repressor ( IκB-SR ). IκB-SR induction was used to determine which genes require RELA nuclear translocation. A total of 254 genes were differentially expressed in high TNFα ( 0. 1 or 10 ng/ml ) versus basal conditions, with the majority of genes ( 186 ) upregulated by TNFα ( Figure 3A and B ) and 68 downregulated by TNα ( Figure 3 and B ). Of the upregulated genes, the top 10 most highly expressed in M PaCa2 cells and top 10 most expressed in P1 cells are shown in Figure 3C and D, respectively. The top 10 most downregulated genes in M Pa2 and P1 cells are shown in Figure 3 E and F, respectively.

    Title: 
    Abstract: A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition ( E/I ) is essential for proper brain function. Disruptions in the GABAergic system, which alter this equilibrium, are a common feature in various types of neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ). Mutations in Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog ( PTEN ), the main negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway, are strongly associated with ASD. However, it is unclear whether PTEN deficiencies can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system, where both excitatory ( cholinergic ) and inhibitory ( GABAergic ) inputs regulate muscle activity, we found that daf-18/PTEN mutations impact GABAergic ( but not cholinergic ) neurodevelopment and function. This selective impact results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. The defects observed in the GABAergic system in daf-18/PTEN mutants are due to reduced activity of DAF-16/FOXO during development. Ketogenic diets ( KGDs ) have proven effective for disorders associated with E/I imbalances. However, the mechanisms underlying their action remain largely elusive. We found that a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate during early development induces DAF-16/FOXO activity, therefore improving GABAergic neurodevelopment and function in daf-18/PTEN mutants. Our study provides valuable insights into the link between PTEN mutations and neurodevelopmental defects and delves into the mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of KGDs.

   . Over the last decade, numerous studies focused on this simple yet highly informative system have significantly contributed to our understanding of the functioning and dysregulation of human genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, epilepsy, and familial hemiplegic migraine ( Huang et al., 2019b; Opperman et al., 2017; Giles et al., 2019; Bessa et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, the substantial conservation of the main components of the PI3K/Akt pathway in C. elegans ( Paradis and Ruvkun, 1998; Ogg and Ruvkun, 1998 ) enhances the applicability of this model system for investigating the role of this pathway in neurodevelopment. We here found that mutations in daf-18 ( the ortholog for PTEN in C. elegans ) result in impairments in GABAergic inhibitory signaling due to decreased activity of the transcription factor DAF-16 ( the ortholog for FOXO in C. elegans ) during neurodevelopment. Interestingly, cholinergic excitatory motor neurons remain unaffected. This targeted impairment of inhibitory signals causes an imbalance between E/I neurotransmission in the animal’s neuromuscular system. In humans, ketogenic diets ( KGDs ), which force fatty acids beta-oxidation into ketone bodies, have been utilized for decades to treat pathologies associated with E/I imbalances, such as refractory epilepsies ( D’Andrea Meira et al., 2019; Neal et al., 2008; Lambrechts et al., 2017 ). More recently, KGDs have also demonstrated effectiveness in alleviating autistic symptoms in humans ( Li et al., 2021 ) and rodent models of ASD ( Castro et al., 2017; Verpeut et al., 2016 ). The mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects remain largely unknown. We demonstrated that exposing daf-18/PTEN mutants to a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate ( βHB ) early in development enhances DAF-16/FOXO activity, mitigates morphological and functional defects in GABAergic neurons, and improves behavioral phenotypes

Maintaining a delicate balance between excitatory and inhibitory ( E/I ) neurotransmission is critical for optimal brain function ( Tao et al., 2014 ). Disruptions in this balance are commonly observed in neurodevelopmental disorders ( Bozzi et al., 2018; Coghlan et al., 2012; Oblak et al., 2009 ). In particular, deficits in inhibitory ( GABAergic ) signaling have been reported in autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) and other related physiopathological conditions ( Oblak et al., 2009; Gogolla et al., 2009 ). PTEN is a classical tumor suppressor gene that antagonizes the highly conserved phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase ( PI3K ) /protein kinase B ( PKB/Akt ) pathway. Several reports using animal models have highlighted the importance of PTEN in neurodevelopment ( Rademacher and Eickholt, 2019; van Diepen and Eickholt, 2008; Kwon et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2016; Clipperton-Allen and Page, 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Clipperton-Allen et al., 2022 ). Moreover, mutations in PTEN were frequently found in human patients presenting ASD ( Butler et al., 2005 ). The molecular events underlying the neurodevelopmental deficits in PTEN mutants remain poorly understood. The Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system, where both excitatory ( cholinergic ) and inhibitory ( GABAergic ) motor neurons regulate muscle contraction and relaxation, provides an excellent platform for studying the function, balance, and coordination between excitatory and inhibitory signals ( Huang et al., 2019b; Vashlishan et al., 2008; Zhou and Bessereau, 2019; Safdie et al., 2016; Stawicki et al., 2011; Opperman et al., 2017; Giles et al., 2019 ). This system has yielded valuable insights into fundamental synaptic transmission mechanisms ( Blazie and Jin, 2018; Calahorro and Izquierdo, 2018 )

. Furthermore, we observed that the hypercontraction observed in daf-18/PTEN mutants after the activation of cholinergic neurons is significantly reduced in animals exposed to βHB ( Figure 4H–J ). These findings suggest that this ketone body can rebalance excitatory and inhibitory signals in the neuromuscular system of daf-18/PTEN C. elegans mutants. We also evaluated the morphology of GABAergic motor neurons in daf-18/PTEN animals exposed to βHB. We found that βHB supplementation reduced the frequency of defects in GABAergic processes ( Figure 4K ). Consistently, βHB exposure did not significantly reduce the defects on GABAergic neurons of either daf-16/FOXO null mutants or daf-18; daf-16 double mutants. Taken together, these results demonstrate that dietary βHB ameliorates the defects associated with deficient GABAergic signaling in daf-18/PTEN mutants. It is noteworthy that we did not observe any improvement in either neuronal outgrowth defects in the AIY interneuron or the migration of the HSN motor neurons ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) in daf-18/PTEN mutants exposed to βHB, even though these defects were shown to depend on the reduction of DAF-16/FOXO activity ( Christensen et al., 2011; Kennedy et al., 2013 ). AIY neurite and HSN soma migration take place during embryogenesis ( Christensen et al., 2011; Hedgecock et al., 1987 ). It is therefore possible that βHB may not go through the impermeable chitin eggshell of the embryo, as has been reported with other drugs ( Sato et al., 2006 ). In the above experiments, animals were exposed to βHB throughout development. We next asked whether there is a critical period during development where the action of βHB is required. We exposed daf-18/PTEN mutant animals to βHB-supplemented diets for 18-hr periods at different developmental stages ( Figure 5A )

Mutations in daf-18/PTEN are linked to neurodevelopmental defects from worms to mammals ( Chen et al., 2015; Christensen et al., 2011; Kennedy et al., 2013 ). Moreover, decreased activity of PTEN produces E/I disequilibrium and the development of seizures in mice ( van Diepen and Eickholt, 2008 ). The mechanisms underlying this imbalance are not clear. Our results demonstrate that reduced DAF-18/PTEN activity in C. elegans generates guidance defects, abnormal branching, incomplete commissural outgrowth, and deficient function of inhibitory GABAergic neurons, without affecting the excitatory cholinergic neurons. daf-18/PTEN-deficient mutants have a shorter lifespan ( Mihaylova et al., 1999 ). One possibility is that the defects in GABAergic processes are due to neurodegeneration associated with premature aging rather than developmental flaws. However, this idea is unlikely given that the neuronal defects in DD neurons are already evident at the early L1 stage. In C. elegans, DAF-16/FOX is a transcription factor required for GABAergic neurodevelopment ( Christensen et al, 2011; Kennedy et al, 201 ). We found that DAF-16/FOX activity is reduced in d-18/EN mutants ( Figure 6A ). This reduction in DAF-16/FOX is likely the cause of the GABAergic defects in d-18/EN, as DAF-16 is required for the expression of GABAergic genes ( Christensen et al 2011; Kennedy et al 201 ). We tested this hypothesis by expressing D-16 in d-18/EN and found rescued the GABAergic defects ( Figure 6B ). This demonstrates that D-16 is necessary and sufficient for GABA neurodevelopment in d-18EN. We also found that D-16 is not required for cholinergic neurodevelopment ( Figure 6C ), consistent with our observation that cholinergic neurons are unaffected in d-EN. Our results indicate that D-FOX is a key regulator of GABAergic neurodevelopment in d-EN, and that its reduction is the primary cause of the GABA defects in d-EN mutants. The PI3K/Akt pathway is conserved in C. elegans and mammals ( Parad and Rkun,1998 Ogg and Rk,199 ). PTEN is a negative regulator of this pathway. We found that D-FOX is a downstream of PT in the PIK/Akt pathway ( Figure 7 ). PT suppresses the PI3K/Akt pathway by dephosphorylating PIP3K and inhibiting its activity. PT also dephosphorylates and inhibits AKT. We found that D-FOX is dephosphorylated in d-EN ( Figure 7 ), indicating that PT suppresses the PI3/Akt pathway in d-EN. This dephosphorylation of D- is likely the cause the reduction of D-FOX activity in d-EN, as dephosphorylation inhibits the activity of FOXO transcription factors. We propose that PT suppresses the PI/Akt pathway by dephosphlating P3K and AKT, and that DFOX is a downstream target of PT in this pathway. This model is supported by the fact that DFOX is deosphorylated in d-EN, where PT is dephosphlating P3 and AKT ( Figure 7 ), and that D- is required for GABA neurodevelopment ( Figure 6 ), which is regulated by the PI/Akt pathway ( Christensen et al 201; Kennedy et al 201 ). Our results suggest that PT suppresses the PI/Akt pathway by deosphlating P3 and AKT, and that DFOX is a target of PT in this pathway. The PI3/Akt pathway is conserved in C elegans and mammals ( Parad and Ruvun,1998 O and Ruv,199 ). PTEN is a negative regulator of this pathway. We found that DFOX is a downstream of PT in the PI/Akt pathway ( Figure 7 ). PT suppresses the PI/Akt pathway by dephosphlating P3 and inhibiting its activity. PT also deosphlates and inhibits AK. We found DFOX is deosphlated in dEN ( Figure 7, indicating that PT suppresses the PIkt pathway inEN. This dephosphlation of D likely the cause the reduction DFOX in dEN, as deosphlation inhibits the activity of FOX transcription factors. We propose that PT suppress the/Akt by deosphlating P and AK, and D is a target of PT in this pathway. This is supported by the fact D is deosphlated dEN where PT deosphlates P and AK ( Figure 7

    Title: 
    Abstract: Innate immune responses triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) infection play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, while host factors including proinflammatory cytokines are critical for viral containment. By utilizing quantitative and qualitative models, we discovered that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in viral-infected cells. Through cytokine screening, we identified that interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ), a key mediator of inflammation, inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1β activates RhoA/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions, thus prevents syncytia formation. Notably, in vivo infection experiments in mice confirmed that IL-1β significantly restricted SARS-CoV-2 spread in the lung epithelium. Together, by revealing the function and underlying mechanism of IL-1β on SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion, our study highlights an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during viral infection.

    In the present study, we explored the function of innate immune factors against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, IL-1β inhibited various SARS-CoV-2 variants and other beta-coronaviruses spike-induced cell-cell fusion. Mechanistically, IL-1β activates and enriches RhoA to the cell-cell junction between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and neighboring cells via the IL-1R-mediated signal to initiate actin bundle formation, preventing cell-cell fusion and viral spreading ( Figure 7—figure supplement 3 ). These findings revealed a critical function for proinflammatory cytokines to control viral infection. Elevated IL-1β levels in severe COVID-19 patients is central to innate immune response as it induces the expression of other proinflammatory cytokines ( Tahtinen et al., 2022 ). In addition, IL-1α is also secreted during SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Xiao et al., 2021 ). Of note, several therapeutic strategies have employed the inhibition of IL-1 signal in an attempt to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Huet et al., 2020; Ucciferri et al., 2020 ). Intriguingly, although anakinra, a recombinant human IL-1RA, improved clinical outcomes and reduced mortality in severe COVID-19 patients ( Cavalli et al., 2020 ), it did not reduce mortality in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients, and even increased the probability of serious adverse events ( Tharaux et al., 2021 ). With another note, IL-1 blockade significantly decreased the neutralizing activity of serous anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in severe COVID-19 patients ( Della-Torre et al., 2021 ). According to our finding that both IL-1β and IL-1α are able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion, inhibition of IL-1 signaling may have abolished the antiviral function of IL-1, thus failing to restrict virus-induced syncytia formation and transmission

., 2020; Hadjadj et al., 2020 ). Thus, identifying other endogenous host factors that regulate syncytia formation is of great significance for harnessing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Of note, a variety of cells are involved in the host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Ren et al., 2021 ). Lung epithelial cells are the primary target of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, which subsequently recruit and activate innate immune cells, leading to COVID-19 pathology ( Barnett et al., 2023 ). In this process, tissue-resident macrophages and circulating monocytes contribute to local and systemic inflammation primarily by releasing inflammatory cytokines ( Sefik et al., 2022 ). Among these cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2, the combination of TNF-α and IFN-γ induces inflammatory cell death, resulting in clear tissue damage, while other cytokines’ function remains obscure ( Karki et al., 2021 ). In addition, when corticosteroids were applied to suppress the inflammatory response in patients infected by SARS-CoV ( Lee et al., 2004 ) or MERS-CoV ( Arabi et al., 2018 ), the clearance of viral RNA was obviously delayed, suggesting the importance of innate immune factors in viral clearance. Innate immune cells express Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ), and TLR-mediated signaling induces robust production of inflammatory cytokines ( Medzhitov, 2001 ). In the current work, we screened the role of soluble proinflammatory cytokines on the SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced cell-cell fusion. Notably, we identified that IL-1β, which is the key factor of inflammatory response, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced syncytia formation in various cells by activating RhoA/ROCK pathway to initiate actin bundle formation at cell-cell interface between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and neighboring cells. Importantly, IL-1β significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission among lung epithelia in experimental mice in vivo

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) infection has spread globally, with at least 755 million people diagnosed and the death toll is over 6. 8 million. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron, continue to evolve and increase transmissibility and the ability to escape host immune responses. These variants have presented significant challenges to the design and development of vaccines and therapeutic agents ( Zhou et al., 2020 ). In order to discover novel strategies to control the virus, it is important to understand host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cell-cell fusion ( also known as syncytia formation ) in multiple cell types including lung epithelial cells, neurons, and glia ( Martínez-Mármol et al., 2023 ). Syncytia formation between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with neighboring cells may contribute to increased viral transmission and pathogenicity in the infected host ( Rajah et al., 2022 ), which also makes the virus insensitive to extracellular neutralizing antibodies ( Li et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2023 ). Moreover, syncytia formation among pneumocytes with long-term persistence of viral RNA has been observed in the lung autopsy of deceased COVID-19 donors, which may contribute to prolonged clearance of the virus and long COVID symptoms ( Bussani et al., 2020 ). Therefore, inhibiting syncytia formation is critical to ensure viral clearance and to control viral transmission. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2-mediated syncytia formation is effectively inhibited by multiple interferon ( IFN ) -stimulating genes ( ISGs ) ( Pfaender et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020 ). However, low IFN levels with impaired ISG responses were observed during early SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may have compromised the antiviral responses of IFN in severe COVID-19 patients ( Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Hadjadj et al

. Intriguingly, when we added both IL-1α and IL-1β, there was no synergistic inhibition on cell-cell fusion compared to either cytokine alone ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2F–H ), suggesting a saturation of IL-1 receptor binding to these homologues. Since both IL-1α and IL-1β activate the downstream pathway through the same receptor IL-1R1, these data suggested that IL-1α or IL-1β may inhibit cell-cell fusion through the same pathway. Considering the higher mRNA level of IL1B than IL1A, as well as the classical release pathway of IL-1β from innate immune cells ( Weber et al., 2010 ), we applied IL-1β for further experiments. In order to validate the effect of IL-1β on cell-cell fusion during authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection, we pre-treated ACE2-expressing cells with IL-1β before inoculating Delta or WT authentic SARS-CoV-2. Cell lysates were used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike and N protein 24 hpi ( Figure 2E ). To this end, it was found that IL-1β reduced S2’ cleavage and N protein levels compared to the control group during such infection both in HEK293T-ACE2 ( Figure 2F and Figure 2—figure supplement 3A ) and in Caco-2 cells ( Figure 2G ). Meanwhile, IL-1β inhibited authentic SARS-CoV-2-induced syncytia formation ( Figure 2H and I and Figure 2—figure supplement 3B and C ). Thus, these results verified that IL-1β inhibits SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Insulin plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis. Drosophila insulin-producing cells ( IPCs ) are functional analogues of mammalian pancreatic beta cells and release insulin directly into circulation. To investigate the in vivo dynamics of IPC activity, we quantified the effects of nutritional and internal state changes on IPCs using electrophysiological recordings. We found that the nutritional state strongly modulates IPC activity. IPC activity decreased with increasing periods of starvation. Refeeding flies with glucose or fructose, two nutritive sugars, significantly increased IPC activity, whereas non-nutritive sugars had no effect. In contrast to feeding, glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity. This was reminiscent of the mammalian incretin effect, where glucose ingestion drives higher insulin release than intravenous application. Contrary to IPCs, Diuretic hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis ( DH44PINs ) responded to glucose perfusion. Functional connectivity experiments demonstrated that these DH44PINs do not affect IPC activity, while other DH44Ns inhibit them. Hence, populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Accordingly, activating IPCs had a small, satiety-like effect on food-searching behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activating DH44Ns strongly increased hyperactivity. Taken together, we demonstrate that IPCs and DH44Ns are an integral part of a modulatory network that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolic state.

   ., 2009; Kréneisz et al., 2010 ). However, the influence of feeding and nutritional state changes on IPC activity in vivo, as well as the nutritional state-dependent response of IPCs to glucose, remain unclear, underscoring the importance of in vivo studies where all nutrient-sensing and sensorimotor circuits are intact. For instance, how does IPC activity differ when glucose is ingested as part of a meal, compared to when glucose is administered directly to the brain or into circulation? In mammalian systems, insulin release is significantly amplified upon glucose ingestion vs. intravenous administration ( Elrick et al., 1964; DeFronzo et al., 1978 ), a phenomenon known as the ‘incretin effect’ ( Creutzfeldt, 1979; Kazafeos, 2011 ). This underlines the complexity of insulin regulation, emphasizing that insulin secretion is not solely dictated by sugar levels but influenced by multiple factors. Here, we investigated the nutritional state-dependent modulation of IPCs in Drosophila using an in vivo electrophysiological approach. We recently demonstrated that IPC activity is strongly modulated by locomotion on fast timescales ( Liessem et al., 2023 ). Whether the converse is true, and IPC activity can directly affect behavior on short timescales, is not clear. To address this, we optogenetically manipulated IPCs and other modulatory neurons while recording the locomotor activity of freely walking flies. In combination, our approaches show that IPC activity is not just nutritional state-dependent, but that IPCs also exhibit an incretin-like effect. We further establish that the nutritional state strongly modulates locomotor activity, and that IPCs play a small but significant role in this. In addition, we confirm that another set of modulatory neurons adjacent to the IPCs, DH44PINs, are sensitive to glucose perfusion

. This difference in insulin release is partially driven by incretin hormones from the gut, for example, glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP ) ( Buchan et al., 1978; Meier et al., 2002; Brown, 1982 ), which are released after the ingestion of food. Hence, insulin release is modulated by enteroendocrine signals. Drosophila IPCs are functionally analogous to mammalian beta cells and presumably sense glucose in the circulating hemolymph to release insulin in response to increases in glucose concentration. Previous ex vivo studies suggested that IPCs, like pancreatic beta cells, sense glucose cell-autonomously ( Fridell et al., 2009; Kréneisz et al., 2010 ). Consistent with this, we observed an increase in IPC activity after the ingestion of glucose ( Figure 2B ). However, IPC activity did not increase during the perfusion of glucose directly over the brain. Importantly, the fly preparations were kept alive for several hours allowing the glucose-rich saline to enter circulation and reach all body parts. Several factors may explain the difference between ex vivo and in vivo preparations. First, in ex vivo studies, certain regulatory feedback mechanisms present in vivo could be absent. For example, the strong inhibitory input IPCs received from DH44Ns we found would likely be absent in brain explants without a VNC. A lack of inhibitory feedback might allow for more direct glucose sensing by IPCs ex vivo, whereas in vivo, the IPC response could be suppressed by more complex systemic feedback. Second, we attempted to use the intracellular saline formulation employed in a previous ex vivo study ( Kréneisz et al., 2010 ). However, we observed that IPCs depolarized quickly using this saline, leading to unstable recordings that did not meet our quality standards for in vivo experiments

To advance our understanding of the neuronal underpinnings of metabolic homeostasis, we analyzed the nutritional state-dependent modulation of IPCs in Drosophila. Our in vivo patch clamp recordings revealed that IPC activity is diminished during starvation and rebounds after glucose feeding. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating an accumulation of DILPs ( Géminard et al., 2009; Ikeya et al., 2002; Rajan and Perrimon, 2012; Bai et al., 2012; Sudhakar et al., 2020; Claessens et al., 2008 ) and a reduction of dilp transcript levels ( Rajan and Perrimon, 2012; Sudhakar et al., 2020; Claessens et al., 2008 ) in IPCs of adult and larval fly brains under starvation and underlines that electrophysiological IPC activity and DILP release are correlated. However, two aspects were surprising about our results. First, the rebound after glucose feeding was relatively slow, and IPC activity built up to baseline levels after over 6 h of refeeding. These slow temporal dynamics are in stark contrast to the behavioral state-dependent modulation of IPC activity, which occurs on a timescale of milliseconds ( Liessem et al., 2023 ). This suggests that IPCs integrate changes in internal states over different timescales and potentially affect metabolism and neuronal networks on both short and long timescales. The second surprising result was that the reduced IPC activity after starvation failed to rebound upon refeeding with high protein and standard diets ( Figure 1H ). Our standard diet contains glucose at very low concentrations ( upper bound of 30 mM, see Methods for details ), which partially explains the lack of an IPC activity rebound. However, the observation that IPC activity in flies refed with SD remained comparable to that of starved flies suggests that starvation had a long-lasting effect on IPC activity, which could specifically be restored by feeding nutritive sugars ( glucose and fructose )

. Another possible explanation for the lack of an effect of glucose might have been that the dominant circulating sugar in flies is trehalose ( Wyatt and Kalf, 1957; Elbein et al., 2003 ) which is derived from glucose. When we extended our experiments, we found that trehalose perfusion did not affect IPC activity either, strengthening the idea that IPCs do not directly sense changes in hemolymph sugar levels. Therefore, our findings suggest that, similar to mammals, IPC activity and hence, insulin release, is not simply modulated by hemolymph sugar concentration in Drosophila. Several pathways could contribute to this. First, although an incretin effect has not been reported in flies before, recent studies provided evidence of incretin-like hormones such as the midgut-derived neuropeptide F in flies ( Yoshinari et al., 2021; Malita et al., 2022 ), suggesting that a similar signaling pathway could underlie the incretin effect across species. Second, a subset of IPCs was shown to express the mechanosensitive channel piezo and innervate the crop ( Wang et al., 2020 ), suggesting that an increase in crop volume during feeding could contribute to the increase in IPC activity after feeding. However, the fact that we observed strong responses of IPCs to glucose intake but not the ingestion of regular food during refeeding suggests this is not the core mechanism underlying the incretin-like effect we observed. Third, taste pathways converge onto IPCs ( Yao and Scott, 2022 ) and they could increase IPC activity after the ingestion of glucose via serotonergic inputs from taste-responsive cells in the gnathal ganglion. Here, however, we would expect faster responses on the scale of seconds, which are unlikely to shift IPC activity over several hours. Hence, gut-secreted neuropeptides are the strongest candidates to mediate the incretin effect in Drosophila

Insulin is a key neuropeptide that controls metabolic homeostasis across the animal kingdom ( Barbieri et al., 2003; Brogiolo et al.,202 ). In Drosila, IPCs are analogous to mammalian pancreatic beta cells and release insulin into the hemolymph in response to increases in glucose concentration ( Fridell et al.,200; Krne et al,2010 ). However, how IPC activity is modulated by the nutritional state in vivo remains unclear. Here, we used in vivo electrophys recordings to show that IPC activity is strongly modulated by the nutritional state and exhibit an incretin-like effect, where glucose ingestion drives insulin release more than intravenous application. This is reminiscent of the mammalian incretin effect, where glucose ingestion drives insulin release more than intravenous administration ( Elrick et al,196; Deonzo et al,1978 ). In contrast, another set of modulatory neurons, DH44s, responded to glucose perfusion but not ingestion. Functional experiments demonstrated that DH44s do not affect IPC activity while other DHNs inhibit them. Hence, populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain homeostasis. Activating IPC had a satiety effect on food-search behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity whereas activating DHNs increased hyperactivity. Together, we demonstrate that IPC and DHNs are integral of a modulatory network that orchestrates homeasis and adaptive response to shifts in metabolic state.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Endogenous tags have become invaluable tools to visualize and study native proteins in live cells. However, generating human cell lines carrying endogenous tags is difficult due to the low efficiency of homology-directed repair. Recently, an engineered split mNeonGreen protein was used to generate a large-scale endogenous tag library in HEK293 cells. Using split mNeonGreen for large-scale endogenous tagging in human iPSCs would open the door to studying protein function in healthy cells and across differentiated cell types. We engineered an iPS cell line to express the large fragment of the split mNeonGreen protein ( mNG21-10 ) and showed that it enables fast and efficient endogenous tagging of proteins with the short fragment ( mNG211 ). We also demonstrate that neural network-based image restoration enables live imaging studies of highly dynamic cellular processes such as cytokinesis in iPSCs. This work represents the first step towards a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells.

   . Since most of our knowledge of human cell cytokinesis is derived from diseased and/or transformed cell lines, the field will benefit greatly from studying iPSCs before and after differentiation in an isogenic context, particularly since they represent ‘healthy’ human cells ( Dambournet et al., 2018; Drubin and Hyman, 2017 ). Here, we used the split mNeonGreen system for endogenous tagging in human iPSCs ( Figure 1A ). First, we engineered a human iPS cell line that constitutively expresses the mNG21-10 fragment. We validated this cell line extensively and named it ‘smNG2-P’ ( split mNeonGreen2 parental cell line ). As a proof-of-concept, we efficiently targeted multiple genes for endogenous tagging with mNG211, and clonally isolated several tagged iPS cell lines. To facilitate this process, we developed protocols for efficient single-cell isolation by FACS ( fluorescence-activated cell sorting ) and screening of edited clones by Nanopore sequencing. Finally, we show how the endogenously tagged iPS cell lines can be used for live imaging studies of cytokinesis, which is a highly dynamic cellular process. Timelapse imaging of several weakly expressed cytokinesis genes that were endogenously tagged in iPSCs revealed new insights into how cytokinesis occurs in these cells. Imaging the more weakly expressed genes required the use of an image restoration algorithm to alleviate cell toxicity and obtain high-quality images with high temporal resolution. This work provides the foundation for a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells and provides protocols to efficiently generate and study endogenous tags in human iPSCs.

., 2022 ). However, endogenous tagging with mNG211 was overall more efficient than endogenous tagging with full-length mEGFP in iPSCs ( mostly <0. 1 to 4%, and up to 24% GFP-positive cells; Roberts et al., 2017 ). Although it is difficult to compare editing efficiencies across studies, endogenous tagging by HDR is very inefficient. Our results are consistent with iPSCs being more challenging to edit compared to other cell types, and mNG211 integrating at higher frequency than larger tags. The split mNeonGreen system also enables endogenous tagging on the scale of hundreds to thousands of proteins in parallel. For comparison, endogenous tagging with full-length fluorescent proteins requires the assembly of large repair templates, which limits the number of proteins that can be tagged at once. We also found that low endogenous expression levels can limit the detection of tagged proteins by flow cytometry, similar to previous studies ( Cho et al., 2022; Leonetti et al., 2016; O’Hagan et al., 2021 ), requiring microscopy with highly sensitive cameras or detectors. Alternative methods such as fixation and antibody staining can also be used for more sensitive detection of weakly expressed endogenous tags ( O’Hagan et al., 2021 ). Importantly, the expression levels of 9 mNG211-tagged proteins in iPSCs ( Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1U ) were consistent with RNA-seq data ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A; Iwasaki et al., 2022 ). Since these proteins showed unique localizations patterns consistent with their function, it is unlikely that the mNG211 tag affected their function. Interestingly, Nestin and β–3-tubulin were expressed at low levels in undifferentiated iPSCs, despite being commonly used as ectodermal and neuronal differentiation markers. This result is consistent with a previous report of their expression in some iPS cell lines ( Kuang et al

Recent advances in genetic engineering have accelerated the development of tools for fundamental research. Endogenous tags are particularly valuable as they enable the visualization of protein behavior in live cells at endogenous expression levels. Self-complementing split fluorescent proteins have been used for efficient endogenous tagging, and this approach was recently used for the construction of the first library of endogenous tags in HEK293 cells, with 1310 proteins tagged in mixed populations enriched by FACS ( Cho et al., 2022 ). While this library is a powerful resource for the community, researchers will need to generate single clones of individual tagged proteins before they can be studied. Further, the knowledge generated by this library is restricted to this single-cell type. Given the predicted diversity in mechanisms controlling cellular processes across cell types, there is a need to also generate endogenous tags in stem cells that can be differentiated into multiple cell types. In this study, we generated a fully validated human iPS cell line expressing mNG21-10 for efficient endogenous tagging with mNG211 in human stem cells capable of differentiating into any cell type. The 201B7 smNG2-P cell line is heterozygous for the mNG21-10 expression cassette which was integrated at the AAVS1 safe-harbor locus. Compared to lentiviral delivery, this design minimizes the risk of mNG21-10 silencing and provides a high and consistent expression of mNG21-10 across all cells in the population, even over time and during differentiation ( Oceguera-Yanez et al., 2016 ). We tagged multiple genes with mNG211, with efficiencies ranging from 0. 69% to 37. 5% measured by Nanopore sequencing ( Figure 2B ). Tagging efficiency with mNG211 in iPSCs was lower than in mouse embryos ( 40 to 100% of injected embryos; O’Hagan et al., 2021 ), and lower than tagging with GFP11 in HEK293 cells ( <1 to 56% tagged alleles; Cho et al., 2022 )

. Although several efforts have been made to tag multiple proteins endogenously in various human cell lines ( e. g. Husser et al., 2022; Roberts et al., 2017 ), the generation of a genome-wide library of tagged proteins in human cells requires higher throughput. The recently developed self-complementing split fluorescent proteins can be used as tools for large-scale endogenous tagging ( Feng et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2019; Kamiyama et al., 2016; Tamura et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2020 ). In the split mNeonGreen system, the mNeonGreen protein is expressed as two separate fragments: a large fragment composed of the first ten beta-strands of mNeonGreen ( mNG21-10 ) and a short fragment corresponding to the eleventh beta strand ( mNG211; Feng et al., 2017 ). The two fragments have been engineered to form a functional fluorescent protein when co-expressed ( Feng et al., 2017 ). This interaction is characterized by a high complementation efficiency and is irreversible once the reconstituted protein has folded ( Feng et al., 2019; Köker et al., 2018 ). Moreover, the split mNeonGreen2 protein retains most of the brightness of the original mNeonGreen ( Feng et al., 2017 ). This system allows for easy and efficient endogenous tagging with mNG211 in cells where mNG21-10 is constitutively expressed ( Cho et al., 2022; Leonetti et al., 2016; Mahdessian et al., 2021 ). The mNG211 fragment is only 16 amino acids long, so it can be inserted into the genome by HDR using a repair template with short homology arms ( generally 40–80 bp ), which can be purchased commercially as a single-stranded oligo-deoxynucleotide ( ssODN ). This enables large-scale tagging using commercially synthesized ssODNs and sgRNAs to target multiple proteins in parallel ( Cho et al., 2022; Leonetti et al., 2016 ). However, this approach requires the generation of a parental cell line that constitutively expresses the mNG21-10 fragment

. This data reveals new differences in how cytokinesis occurs in iPSCs and demonstrates the utility of endogenous tags to study cellular processes by live imaging, which also can be done in differentiated cell types with isogenic backgrounds.

    Researchers used the splitNeGreen system for endogenous tagging in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). They engineered an iPS line to constitutively express the large fragment of the splitNeGreen protein (m21-10) and showed it enables efficient endogenous tagging with the short fragment (m211). They demonstrated live imaging of highly dynamic processes such as cytokinesis in iPSC using neural network-based restoration. This is the first step towards a genome-wide endogenous library in human cells. Endogenous tagging with m211 was more efficient than endogenous with full-length GFP in iPSC. The splitNe system enables endogenous on the scale of thousands of proteins in parallel. Endogenous with full-length proteins requires assembly of large templates, limiting the number of proteins that can be tagged once. Low endogenous levels limit detection by flow cytometry, requiring microscopy with sensitive cameras or detectors. Expression of m-tagged proteins in iP were consistent with RNA-seq data. Proteins showed unique localizations consistent with function. Nestin and β-tubulin were expressed low in undifferentiated iP, despite being ectodermal and neuronal markers. Researchers generated a fully human iPS line expressing m21-10 for endogenous with m211 in stem capable of differentiating into cell types. Tagging efficiencies ranged from 0.69 to 37.5% by Nanop sequencing. Tagging with m211 iP was lower than in mouse embryos and HEK cells. The splitNe system enables large-scale endogenous in human cells.
Researchers have developed a novel platform for creating electrolytic lesions through chronically implanted intracortical multielectro probes without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology. A custom current source provides stable current for controlled repeatable lesions in awake animals. Performance of this lesion technique was validated using histology ex vivo and in vivo, current and voltage traces from the device, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesion. This method avoids disruptive procedures, millimeter precision over the extent and submill precision the location of the injury, and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining population after lesion. The technique can be used in many areas, species, and theoretically with multielectrode probes. The low-cost lesion device can be easily adopted into existing electrophiology setup. This is expected to enable causal investigations of the neuronal's role in circuit, while providing insight into reorganization after loss.

The method was tested in porine and ovine brains in vivo and ex, altering current and duration changed the size of the lesion, evidenced by histology. Selection of two electrodes allows spatial localization under 16mm array. Lesions were performed in sedated rhes mac to verify safety, and fourteen in awakehes maca. Read from the device (current and voltage) and electrophys from microarray verify the delivers power and does not damage the array's recording. This technique will improve understanding by lesioning an established technique with spatiemporal measurements intrac electrophiology.

A custom circuit was built to use the microarray to record activity and create lesion. The design is based on feedback circuits using an operational to maintain constant current. This should work with multielectrode, but was tested with Utaharray. Lesion size is controlled by amplitude and duration through two electrodes, although extent will vary due anatomical variation. The circuit supplies voltage to damage while maintaining precision (error 10A). Parameters for rhes mac were tested in vivo and ex sheep, then in vivo anesthet pigs. Hist was collected to understand quality and extent.

This platform is compatible many areas, species, and multielectrode, fulfilling design. The device is small, low-cost, and only connected during lesion, easy into elect setup. This is to facilitate causal explorations between brain and behavior through inactivation and electrophys. It enable studies reorganization population level.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Bees are important pollinators of agricultural crops, but their populations are at risk when pesticides are used. One of the largest risks bees face is poisoning of floral nectar and pollen by insecticides. Studies of bee detection of neonicotinoids have reported contradictory evidence about whether bees can taste these pesticides in sucrose solutions and hence avoid them. Here, we use an assay for the detection of food aversion combined with single-sensillum electrophysiology to test whether the mouthparts of the buff-tailed bumblebee ( Bombus terrestris ) detect the presence of pesticides in a solution that mimicked the nectar of oilseed rape ( Brassica napus ). Bees did not avoid consuming solutions containing concentrations of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, or sulfoxaflor spanning six orders of magnitude, even when these solutions contained lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations of the pesticides altered spiking in gustatory neurons through a slight reduction in firing rate or change in the rate of adaptation. These data provide strong evidence that bumblebees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using information from their mouthparts. As bees rarely contact floral nectar with other body parts, we predict that they are at high risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops.

   . However, we also failed to find evidence that neonicotinoid pesticides in water elicited spikes in any galeal GRNs including the nutrient/sugar sensing neurons. For this reason, we concluded that bees could not taste neonicotinoids in nectar or on their own in water. This conclusion, however, has been challenged by a study in free-flying B. terrestris foragers ( Arce et al., 2018 ). They found that free-flying bumblebees preferred specific concentrations of solutions laced with TMX, but only after a period of at least 10 days of feeding on the solutions ( Arce et al., 2018 ). In this study, the location of the solutions was randomised, forcing a choice at the point of feeding. These authors concluded that the only way bees could solve this problem was if they used their sense of taste to identify the preferred solution, arguing that further work needed to be done to identify the mechanism for sensation. Subsequently, however, another study in a different species of bumblebees ( B. impatiens ) using methods similar to ours reported that bees are neither attracted nor deterred from consuming sugar solutions containing neonicotinoids, consistent with the idea that they cannot detect the pesticides ( Muth et al., 2020 ). Thus, whether or not bumblebees can taste neonicotinoids in food remains unresolved. Bees have highly specialized mechanisms for encoding sugars which are different to those reported for any other insect species. For example, in bumblebee galeal sensilla, stimulation with sugars produces coherent spiking in 2 GRNs which burst in response to stimulation with high-value saccharide compounds ( Miriyala et al., 2018; Parkinson et al., 2022b ). We recently discovered that bumblebees also highly value the monosaccharide, fructose, and have a GRN tuned to detect it ( Parkinson et al., 2022b )

For the first time, we report how populations of GRNs on the bee’s mouthparts respond to stimulation with putatively bitter compounds. We verified that bees do not have mechanisms on their mouthparts that enable them to taste neonicotinoids or sulfoxaflor when these compounds are present in nectar. Neonicotinoids and sulfoxaflor did not change the bursting of sugar-sensing neurons in the galea, nor did they elicit or inhibit spikes in labial palp neurons. Strikingly, we show that bumblebees do not avoid drinking OSR nectar solutions even when very high concentrations of common pesticides are present. Very high concentrations of these pesticides could produce a small but measurable reduction in the spiking of sugar-sensing GRNs, but these compounds never elicited spikes on their own. What’s more, these small changes in the rate of spiking did not translate into features that the clustering algorithm could use to differentiate pesticide laced stimuli from the control OSR solution. From these data, we conclude that the buff-tailed bumblebee’s mouthparts do not have mechanisms for the detection and avoidance of common cholinergic pesticides in nectar. In the present experiments, we expected that if neonicotinoids and sulfoxaflor could be tasted by bees, they would exhibit the same responses in GRNs produced by other non-nutrient compounds ( i. e. bitter responses ). For this reason, we were mainly testing for the reduction of GRN spiking caused by the suppression of sugar-sensing GRNs, as all of the ‘bitter’ compounds we tested were presented to the sensilla in OSR nectar ( a mixture of primarily fructose and glucose ). The known bitter compound, QUI, clearly suppressed the activity of sugar-sensing GRNs in both labial palps and the galea, but it did not measurably alter the burst pattern of firing of the galeal GRNs

., 2022b ). It is possible that changes to the burst pattern of firing could indicate that the presence of a compound such as a neonicotinoid in food. Furthermore, the type of sugar used to stimulate the sensilla could influence whether bees could taste neonicotinoids ( Parkinson et al., 2022b ). We also know that the labial palps are critical to toxin detection in other insect species ( Chapman and Sword, 1993 ), and could house additional GRNs sensitive to bitter compounds like pesticides. Our previous work on neonicotinoid taste used sucrose to stimulate the galeal sensilla and did not analyse how pesticides might alter the burst structure of the galeal GRN response to sugars or test the labial palps. Clearly, deeper investigations could determine whether the mouthparts GRNs possess novel gustatory mechanisms for pesticide detection and provide critical information about the risk to bees of consuming the nectar of pesticide-defended crops in the field. They would also elucidate novel mechanisms for the detection of bitter compounds. Here, we use a combination of sensitive behavioural assays and electrophysiology to test in detail whether bumblebee mouthparts have mechanisms to detect pesticides in nectar. Feeding assays using freely moving foragers make it possible to assess if bees detect and avoid potential toxins in food ( Ma et al., 2016 ). To definitively test whether bumblebees detect neonicotinoids on their mouthparts, we quantified the structure of feeding when the mouthparts of freely-moving bumblebees ( B. terrestris ) were stimulated with nectar-like solutions containing pesticides over a 2 min period ( Ma et al., 2016 ). We specifically tested a mixture of primarily fructose and glucose that mimicked the nectar of oilseed rape ( Brassica napus ) with field-relevant concentrations of neonicotinoids

Insect pollination is a critical ecosystem service. The most economically valuable pollinators are bees ( Calderone, 2012; Garibaldi et al., 2013; Huang and An, 2018 ), especially domesticated bees that secure crop yield and quality ( Meehan et al., 2011 ). In agricultural ecosystems, however, insecticides are widely used to protect crop yields ( Klein et al., 2007 ). Using insecticides impacts the health and survival of bees, contributing to the recent population declines of all bee species ( Goulson et al., 2015; Potts et al., 2016; Van der Sluijs et al., 2013; Vanbergen et al., 2013 ). Hundreds of studies have shown that exposure to sublethal concentrations of neonicotinoid pesticides ( i. e. imidacloprid, IMD, thiamethoxam, TMX, and clothianidin, CLO ) in food impairs foraging behaviour, homing and orientation behaviour, and olfactory learning and memory ( e. g. Gill et al., 2012; Henry et al., 2012; Parkinson et al., 2022a; Schneider et al., 2012b; Williamson et al., 2014; Wright et al., 2015 ). Most studies administer pesticides in sugar solutions; bees consume the solution, and then a change in behaviour or performance is recorded. If bees could detect and avoid pesticides in food, however, these substances could be used to defend crops against pests without risk to bees. Only a few have explicitly tested whether bees can taste and avoid neonicotinoid pesticides in nectar ( Arce et al., 2018; Kessler et al., 2015; Muth et al., 2020 ), but the conclusions of these studies are contradictory. In addition, other compounds that affect cholinergic signalling in the insect nervous system, such as sulfoxaflor, have been proposed as alternatives to neonicotinoids, but whether or not these compounds can be detected by the bee’s sense of taste has not previously been tested. Insects detect non-nutrient compounds through gustatory sensilla on their mouthparts ( Chapman and Sword,199 ), which are highly specialized in bees ( Mirala et al.,2018; Parkinson et al,202b ). Here, we tested whether the mouthparts of the buffailed bumblebee ( Bombus terreis ) can detect the presence of pesticides in a solution mimicking the nectar of oilseed ( Brassica nap ) using a combination of feeding assays and electrophysiology. We found that bees did not avoid solutions containing concentrations of imaclopr, thiamox, clothid, or sulfofl spanning six orders of magnitude, even when these contained lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations of pesticides altered spiking in gustatory neurons through slight reduction or change in the rate of adaptation. These data provide strong evidence that bumblees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using their mouthparts. Bees rarely contact nectar with other body parts, we predict they are at risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in nectar of pesticide-treated crops.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Zoonotic disease dynamics in wildlife hosts are rarely quantified at macroecological scales due to the lack of systematic surveys. Non-human primates ( NHPs ) host Plasmodium knowlesi, a zoonotic malaria of public health concern and the main barrier to malaria elimination in Southeast Asia. Understanding of regional P. knowlesi infection dynamics in wildlife is limited. Here, we systematically assemble reports of NHP P. knowlesi and investigate geographic determinants of prevalence in reservoir species. Meta-analysis of 6322 NHPs from 148 sites reveals that prevalence is heterogeneous across Southeast Asia, with low overall prevalence and high estimates for Malaysian Borneo. We find that regions exhibiting higher prevalence in NHPs overlap with human infection hotspots. In wildlife and humans, parasite transmission is linked to land conversion and fragmentation. By assembling remote sensing data and fitting statistical models to prevalence at multiple spatial scales, we identify novel relationships between P. knowlesi in NHPs and forest fragmentation. This suggests that higher prevalence may be contingent on habitat complexity, which would begin to explain observed geographic variation in parasite burden. These findings address critical gaps in understanding regional P. knowlesi epidemiology and indicate that prevalence in simian reservoirs may be a key spatial driver of human spillover risk.

   . Systematic tools developed for epidemiological studies of disease prevalence in human populations are rarely applied to the study of wildlife disease prevalence; however, such tools can be used to capture the scale and contrast required in macroecological studies to quantify disease burdens regionally. Furthermore, while recent research has shown the impact of deforestation on the distribution of macaques in the context of P. knowlesi ( Moyes et al., 2016; Stark et al., 2019 ), associations between landscape and variation in the prevalence of simian Plasmodium spp. in primates have not been explored. We aimed to ( 1 ) assemble a georeferenced dataset of P. knowlesi in NHPs; ( 2 ) evaluate variation in NHP P. knowlesi prevalence by geographic region; and ( 3 ) assess environmental and spatial risk factors for P. knowlesi prevalence in NHPs across Southeast Asia.

. Emergence of Plasmodium knowlesi infections has been linked to changes in land cover and land use ( Fornace et al., 2021 ). While sporadic cases have been reported across Southeast Asia, including in Indonesia ( Setiadi et al., 2016 ), the Philippines ( Fornace et al., 2018 ), Vietnam ( Maeno et al., 2015 ), Brunei ( Koh et al., 2019 ), and Myanmar ( Ghinai et al., 2017 ), the majority of P. knowlesi cases are found in East Malaysia ( Borneo ) with hotspots in the states of Sabah and Sarawak ( Jeyaprakasam et al., 2020 ), areas that have seen extensive deforestation and landscape modification. In Sabah, human prevalence of P. knowlesi infection has recently been shown to be specifically associated with recent loss of intact forest, agricultural activities, and fragmentation across multiple localised spatial scales ( Brock et al., 2019; Fornace et al., 2019b; Fornace et al., 2016 ). Prevalence of the pathogen in reservoir hosts is one of three crucial factors determining the force of infection in zoonotic spillover events ( Murray and Daszak, 2013 ). Despite this, very little is known of the impact of rapid landscape change on the distribution of P. knowlesi in NHPs. Literature on the impacts of fragmentation on primates tends to focus on primate density and abundance ( Link et al., 2010; Zunino et al., 2007 ). What is known is that effects of land cover changes on primate-pathogen dynamics are highly variable and context-specific. Although the vector species responsible for sylvatic transmission remain unknown, the Anopheles leucospryphus group, the only vector group implicated in P. knowlesi transmission, is widely associated with secondary, disturbed forest ( Brant, 2011; Hawkes et al., 2019; Wong et al., 2015 ). Macaques have been known to preferentially rely on fringe habitat, a behaviour that may be exaggerated in response to habitat fragmentation and facilitate exposure to vectors ( Lehman et al

Strong links have been identified between land use and land cover change and ecosystem perturbation that favours the transmission of vector-borne diseases ( Loh et al., 2016 ). Prevalence of P. knowlesi in macaques is likely to be a crucial determinant of human infection risk, and more representative estimates of P. knowlesi prevalence derived here can better inform regional transmission risk models. This study also characterises landscape risk factors for heightened prevalence of P. knowlesi in NHPs. Findings provide evidence that P. knowlesi in primate hosts is partly driven by landscape modification across Southeast Asia. While the full complexity is not captured by the covariates used, it is clear that P. knowlesi infection in NHPs is not restricted to densely forested areas. This study also demonstrates the utility of systematic meta-analysis tools and remote-sensing datasets in the investigation of macroecological disease trends, in conjunction with methods to standardise a spatially heterogeneous dataset and data-driven selection of spatial scales. Gaps identified in data reporting should inform more systematic and localised primatological surveys to disentangle precise mechanisms. Notwithstanding limitations, this study highlights the marked spatial heterogeneity and role of landscape complexity in driving P. knowlesi infection rates in NHPs. Given the clear intersection between human epidemiology and wildlife ecology, it is essential that infection dynamics within wildlife reservoirs are considered in future public health interventions.

., 2021 ). Although macroecological studies that utilise geospatial data are often confounded by issues of matching temporal and spatial scales, as well as by the quality and accuracy of available georeferencing, measures can be taken to account for this when examining the role of environmental factors in modulating disease outcomes. Furthermore, ecological processes occur and interact over a range of distances, or ‘spatial scales’ ( Brock et al., 2019; Fornace et al., 2016; Loh et al., 2016 ). This applies to determinants of vector-borne disease ecology, from larval breeding microclimate to wildlife host foraging behaviour. As multiple influential variables are rarely captured by a single scale ( Cohen et al., 2016 ), data-driven methods can be applied to examine risk factors over multiple scales and identify covariates at their most influential extent ( Byrne et al., 2021 ). We hypothesise that prevalence of P. knowlesi in primate host species is spatially heterogeneous and that higher prevalence is partially driven by forest loss and fragmentation, contributing to the strong associations described between land use, land cover and human P. knowlesi risk. This study is the first to systematically assess P. knowlesi prevalence in NHPs at a regional scale, and across a wide range of habitats. In conceptual frameworks and transmission models, it is often assumed that P. knowlesi infections in NHPs are chronic ( low level, persistent infection ) and ubiquitous ( uniformly distributed across populations; Brock et al., 2016; Jeyaprakasam et al., 2020 ). No studies have systematically assessed the extent and quality of all available data on P. knowlesi in NHPs. Independent studies investigating P. knowlesi in primates are typically constrained by small sample sizes and confined geographic areas, limiting inference that can be made about relationships between infection dynamics and landscape characteristics

., 2006; Stark et al., 2019 ). Changes to land composition can also create the biosocial conditions for higher rates of parasitism in primates. Under conditions of limited resources and reduction in viable habitat, conspecific primate density may increase as troops compete for available space. In turn, this can favour transmission via intra-species contact or allow the exchange of pathogens between troops dwelling in interior forest versus edge habitat ( Faust et al., 2018; Stark et al., 2019 ). Habitat use may also become more intensive, preventing parasite avoidance behaviours ( Nunn and Dokey, 2006 ). Land cover change is also known to favour more adaptable, synanthropic species such as M. fascicularis ( McFarlane et al., 2012 ). Considering the spillover risk posed by wildlife reservoirs of P. knowlesi, clarifying any relationships between environmental factors and parasitaemia in key host species may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of P. knowlesi transmission patterns. Earth Observation ( EO ) data provides novel opportunities to investigate epidemiological patterns of diseases which are linked to environmental drivers ( Kalluri et al., 2007 ). In relation to P. knowlesi, utility of fine-scale remote-sensing data has been demonstrated: examples include satellite-derived data used to examine household-level exposure risk in relation to proximate land configuration ( Fornace et al., 2019b ), UAV-imagery used to link real-time deforestation to macaque host behavioural change ( Stark et al., 2019 ), and remote-sensing data used to model P know prevalence in relation to land cover ( Forn et al,202 ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: The rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic marked major transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. To elucidate how contemporary trophic interactions were influenced by host plant shifts and palaeogeographical events, we integrated molecular data with information from the fossil record to construct a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae. Our analyses indicate that crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 Ma ago in Gondwana, associated with Pinopsida ( conifer ) host plants, with larvae likely developing in dead/decaying branches. Belids tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gondwana’s breakup, surviving on distant, disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to Angiospermae and Cycadopsida when and where conifers declined, evolving new trophic interactions, including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms. Extant radiations of belids in the genera Rhinotia ( Australian region ) and Proterhinus ( Hawaiian Islands ) have relatively recent origins.

   . Gondwana split into South America, Africa, Australia, Antarctica and the Indian subcontinent, while Laurasia became North America and Eurasia. On account of their extraordinary taxonomic diversity and varied trophic interactions with contemporary gymnosperms and flowering plants, beetles ( order Coleoptera; >400, 000 described extant species ) have been widely used as models to study the evolution of diversity at the insect-plant interface ( e. g. Farrell, 1998; McKenna et al., 2009; McKenna et al., 2019 ). The present paper addresses a significant gap in our understanding of the biogeography and evolution of host plant associations in the family Belidae ( belid weevils ), an ancient group of phytophagous beetles whose extant species exhibit specialized trophic associations with gymnosperms and flowering plants. By reconstructing the evolutionary history of belid weevils and examining the dynamics of their host plant associations and geographical distributions over time, this paper seeks to yield new insights into the evolution of modern insect-plant interactions. Belidae, with approximately 360 described extant species in 40 genera and two subfamilies ( Marvaldi and Ferrer, 2014; O’Brien and Tang, 2015 ), comprise an early branch of Curculionoidea ( Oberprieler et al., 2007; McKenna et al., 2009; McKenna et al., 2018; McKenna, 2011; Figure 1 ). Belidae are indicated to have originated during the Jurassic in association with gymnosperms and subsequently colonized angiosperms, as the latter diversified and rose to ecological dominance during the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene ( e. g. Farrell, 1998; McKenna et al., 2009; Shin et al., 2018 )

. Belidae were reconstructed as having a Gondwanan origin, with the two extant subfamilies Belinae and Oxycoryninae originating in the Australian and Neotropical regions, respectively ( Figure 2 ). The most likely ancestral host plants of Belidae were reconstructed as Pinopsida ( 0. 53 ) or Angiospermae ( 0. 43 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Supplementary file 2 ). In Belinae, Pinopsida were the most likely ancestral host plants ( 0. 79 ), with a shift to Angiospermae occurring in Belini ( 0. 65 ) and two independent colonizations of Polypodiopsida ( if indeed these are larval hosts and the two genera are not as closely related as indicated by morphology; see Discussion below ). The ancestral host plants of Oxycoryninae were recovered as Angiospermae ( 0. 76 ) or Pinopsida ( 0. 21 ). Extant Oxycraspedina are today associated with Pinopsida and Allocorynina with Cycadopsida ( Figure 2 ). Based on the ASR analysis, branches of the host plants were used for larval development by ancestral Belidae with the high possibility ( 0. 87 ), with a single shift to flowers and fruits ( of Angiospermae ) in Oxycorynina and at least three shifts to strobili, two to strobili of Pinopsida in Pachyurini and Oxycraspedina and one to ( pollen ) cones of Cycadopsida in Allocorynina ( Figure 2 ).

The evolutionary interplay between plant-feeding ( phytophagous ) insects and vascular plants has fundamentally shaped terrestrial biodiversity for over 400 million years ( e. g. Ehrlich and Raven, 1964; Farrell et al., 1992; Wilf, 2008; Misof et al., 2014; Swain et al., 2022 ). The fossil record has provided insights into the historical context and evolutionary processes that have shaped modern insect-plant interactions ( Labandeira and Currano, 2013 ). However, ( 1 ) the degree to which contemporary trophic interactions reflect those in the past, e. g., representing relatively ancient primary associations versus more recent secondary associations, and ( 2 ) the relative roles of vicariance ( including major palaeogeographical events ) and dispersal in the evolution of host shifts, remain unclear. Gymnosperms ( cycads, conifers and relatives ), the dominant plant group during the Mesozoic Era, thrived from the Permian to the Cretaceous period, dominating most terrestrial ecosystems and forming intimate associations with many groups of phytophagous insects ( Anderson et al., 2007 ). The transition to the Cretaceous marked the rise of angiosperms ( flowering plants ), which gradually replaced gymnosperms in many ecological settings to become the dominant plant group ( Anderson et al., 2007 ). This transition was not only a botanical shift but also marks a critical period in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. Angiosperms introduced novel ecological niches and resources, leading to the diversification of phytophagous insects and a reconfiguration of insect-plant associations ( e. g. Farrell, 1998; Wilf, 2008; McKenna et al., 2009; Mckenna et al., 2015; Swain et al., 2022 ). By the end of the Mesozoic, the continents had rifted into nearly their present forms, though their positions would continue to change

. As mentioned above, Homalocerus and Trichophthalmus might form the earliest-branching lineage of Belini. Therefore, the more plausible scenario for host plant shifts is a single shift to ferns from conifers during the Early to Middle Paleogene, perhaps tracking the radiation of ferns in the late Cretaceous ( Schneider et al., 2004; Schuettpelz and Pryer, 2009 ). In Oxycoryninae, the South American genus Oxycraspedus ( the only extant genus of Oxycraspedina ) retains the reconstructed ancestral host association with Pinopsida. Its current hosts, Araucariaceae, were widely distributed in Mesozoic times, and when the oxycorynines diverged by the Lower Cretaceous according to our dated phylogeny estimate, Araucaria still constituted an abundant and widely distributed host for beetles ( Sequeira et al., 2000 ). It is plausible, then, that the ancestors of the remaining oxycorynine tribes/subtribes were originally associated with these conifers before their decline by the Eocene ( Kershaw and Wagstaff, 2001 ) and that these oxycorynine lineages adapted to this decrease in conifer availability by host-shifting to various distantly related taxa of Angiospermae and Cycadopsida. As is true for weevils generally, the association of Metrioxenini with palms ( Arecaceae ) may date to the Upper Cretaceous, given our dating and the fossil record of the family ( Marvaldi et al., 2002; Matsunaga and Smith, 2021 ). However, extant Metrioxenina may only be associated with the genus Arenga ( Marvaldi et al., 2006 ) — though possible associations with other members of the tribe Caryoteae and the subfamily Coryphoideae have not been explored. The Aglycyderini evidently shifted onto angiosperms as well, but their pattern of host associations is complex and indeterminate as the larvae of most species develop in dead bark and twig tissues of a variety of plants

., 2017 ) and both have lineages that still develop on their ancestral host plant. In the East Gondwana clade, Belinae, the divergence time between Agnesiotis and Dicordylus was estimated at 44. 7 Ma ( 55. 9–34. 5 Ma ), during the Paleocene–Eocene separation of South America and Australia ( Lawver et al., 1992; Briggs, 1995; McIntyre et al., 2017 ). Thus, the host shift to angiosperms in Agcytini likely occurred after the separation of these landmasses. In the Australian clade, the divergence between Rhin and Prohin was estimated at 23. 5 Ma ( 34.5– 12. 5 ) during the Oligocene–Miocene separation of Australia and New Zealand ( Law et al. 1992; Briggs 1995; McIntyre et al 2017 ). Thus, the host shift to angios in Rhin likely occurred after the separation of these landmasses. In the Hawaiian clade, the divergence of Prohin was estimated at 5. 5 Ma (.5–2. 5 ) during the Miocene–Pliocene separation of Hawaii and New Zealand ( Law et al 2; Briggs 5; McIntyre 7 ) Thus, the shift to angios in Pro likely occurred after the separation of these landmass.

    Title: 
    Abstract: In growing cell populations such as tumours, mutations can serve as markers that allow tracking the past evolution from current samples. The genomic analyses of bulk samples and samples from multiple regions have shed light on the evolutionary forces acting on tumours. However, little is known empirically on the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution. Here, we leverage published data from resected hepatocellular carcinomas, each with several hundred samples taken in two and three dimensions. Using spatial metrics of evolution, we find that tumour cells grow predominantly uniformly within the tumour volume instead of at the surface. We determine how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumour and how cell death contributes to the overall tumour growth. Our methods shed light on the early evolution of tumours in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology.

   . Our results are based on three well-encapsulated hepatocellular tumours, resected and sampled in two and three dimensions ( Ling et al., 2015; Li et al., 2022 ). Potentially, different types of tumours or tumours at different stages may exhibit other growth modes. For instance, tumours that are not encapsulated might have a more heterogeneous environment, and evolve under surface growth. Also, the spatial and genomic resolution of any data set imposes limits on how late stage events can be observed. We estimate that the data analysed here capture the evolutionary dynamics up to 80, 000 cells. Increasing the genomic and spatial resolution will allow to identify mutations of lower frequency and thus characterize the in-vivo evolution beyond the early stages. Future techniques to sequence resected tumours at higher spatial and genomic resolution than currently possible will allow to trace key later-stage evolutionary changes like angiogenesis, effects of the tumour microenvironment, or the development of genetic instability.

We have used genetic data taken from hepatocellular tumours at high spatial resolution ( Ling et al., 2015; Li et al., 2022 ) to analyse the early evolution of a tumour in vivo. We are not the first to link spatial tumour sampling with evolution: on a larger spatial scale, phylogenetic comparison of samples from primary and metastatic tumours has elucidated the dynamics of metastasis ( Jones et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2016; Alves et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2020 ). Analyses of multiple samples from the same tumour have established intra-tumour heterogeneity and found neutral evolution in many cases ( Gerlinger et al., 2012; Sottoriva et al., 2015; Ling et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2017; see Tarabichi et al., 2018 for a critique ), as well as instances of selection ( Williams et al., 2018; Caravagna et al., 2018 ). The mode of growth of a tumour affects the resulting genetic diversity of a tumour ( Noble et al., 2022; Fu et al., 2022 ). Here, we have used the spatial information contained in data based on hundreds of samples from single tumours. We found that the tumour evolved under uniform volume growth; there was no evidence of spatial constraints leading to radially outward growth. We also found a substantial turnover of cells with a rate of cell death comparable to the rate of cell division. The rate of cell death being comparable to that of cell division implies that the tumour grew much more slowly than suggested by the rate of cell division. Instead, in its early stage, the tumour was balanced precariously between continued growth to macroscopic size and shrinkage: A small increase in the rate of cell death, or a small decrease in the growth rate would have caused the small net growth rate to become negative, possibly even leading to the extinction of the tumour

The evolution of a solid tumour is governed by the division, motion, and death of cancer cells. Genetic mutations arising during cell divisions can serve as cell markers to track this dynamics. From the observed spatial distribution of mutations, it should in principle be possible to infer the spatio-temporal principles of tumour evolution: Is the growth rate uniform across the tumour, or does growth predominantly take place near the edge of the tumour? What is the interplay between the tissue dynamics of the tumour and its genetic evolution? These broad modes of tumour evolution affect for instance the signature of neutral evolution, the response to selection, or the number of low-frequency mutants which can confer therapy resistance ( Waclaw et al., 2015; Chkhaidze et al., 2019 ). However, to answer such questions on the basis of genetic tumour data is challenging because only partial information is available: ( i ) The sequencing depth ( average number of reads covering a nucleotide in NGS sequencing ) is finite. This means that only high-frequency mutations are observed. ( ii ) Usually only a small number of samples are taken from different parts of a solid tumour, which limits the information on mutations present in the full tumour ( Gerlinger et al., 2012; McGranahan and Swanton, 2015 ). ( iii ) Longitudinal data from ctDNA measurements are highly limited in the observable range of mutations and provide noisy frequency estimates. Over the next years, some of these restrictions will be lifted by the advent of spatial genomics ( Takei et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022; Lomakin et al., 2021 ). These techniques allow assaying the genomic information almost at single-cell level in intact tissue sections. Currently, the attainable sequencing depth is too low to identify point mutations across different parts of the tumour

. Under surface growth and neutral evolution, the number of cell divisions since tumorigenesis, and hence the number of mutations found in a cell, increases with distance from the tumour centre. However, we do not find this signature of surface growth in the tumour data. Instead, we find that the number of mutations at different distances from the centre is compatible with volume growth ( see Appendix 3—figure 4 ). Similarly, the dataset of Li et al., 2022 with three-dimensional sampling also shows the signature of volume growth, both in the distribution of direction angles ( Appendix 2. 2 ) and in the number of mutations as a function of distance from the tumour centre, see Appendix 3. 3. This result is at variance with a recent spatio-phylogenetic analysis performed by Lewinsohn et al., 2023, which finds a signal of surface growth on the same data. In Appendix 3, we show that the findings of Lewinsohn et al., 2023 are compatible with volume growth; on artificially generated volume-growth data sampled like in Li et al., the algorithm used in Lewinsohn et al., 2023 also returns a spurious signal of surface growth. Another aspect where surface and volume growth lead to qualitatively different behaviour is the spatial dispersion of mutations. Cells carrying a particular mutation can in principle form a tightly spaced colony or be dispersed throughout the tumour mass, see Figure 3A. It turns out this dispersion of mutants differs between surface and volume growth. To quantify the spatial dispersion of a mutation, we define the dispersion parameter σ: For a given mutation, we compute the average distance of all pairs of samples carrying that mutation and divide by the average distance these cells would have if they were arranged next to one another in a spherical shape ( the tightest configuration possible )

. However, it is clear that the coming-of-age of spatial genomics will bring new opportunities to understand the past evolution of a population of tumour cells from a late-stage snapshot. This implies a need for new tools to analyse spatio-temporal evolution, since standard tools of population genetics, like the site-frequency spectrum, are designed for spatially mixed populations and disregard spatial information. One particular question concerns two different modes in which a tumour can grow; surface growth and volume growth. Under surface growth, the cancer cells divide predominantly at the border with healthy tissue. The potential reasons for this spatial dependence include higher nutrient levels near normal tissue, higher levels of metabolic waste products in the tumour bulk, or mechanical stress in the tumour centre ( Shraiman, 2005; Montel et al., 2011 ). A faster growth rate at the edge of the tumour leads to a radially outward growth of the cell population. The surface growth mode is well-known from bacterial growth ( Hallatschek et al., 2007 ). In tumours, some evidence for surface growth comes from histological stainings, which show an enhanced level of the Ki-67 protein ( a cellular marker for proliferation ) near a tumour surface ( Brú et al., 2003; Waclaw et al., 2015; Hoefflin et al., 2016 ). However, the reverse situation has been found as well ( Zhao et al., 2022 ), with elevated Ki-67 levels near the centre of a renal carcinoma. The surface growth mode also has a long history in the modelling of tumour evolution ( Greenspan, 1972; Ward and King, 1997; Baish and Jain, 2000; González-Garcia et al,2011 ). In contrast, volume growth is less studied. In volume growth, the tumour cells divide throughout the tumour mass. The reasons for this mode are unclear, but may include the lack of mechanical stress in the tumour centre, lower levels of waste in the tumour, or higher levels of nutrients in the tum. The growth mode of a tum affects the genetic diversity of the tumour ( Noble et al,202; Fu et al,202 ). In this study, we find that tumours grow predominantly in volume, not at the surface. This is in contrast to surface growth, where the number of mutations increases with distance from the tumour centre. In volume growth, the number of mutations at different distances from centre is compatible with a uniform growth, see Appendix 3—figure 4. The data of Li et al,202 with three-dimensional sampling also shows the signature of volume, in the distribution direction of angles ( Appendix 2.2 ) and the number of mutations as a function of distance from tumour, see Appendix 3.3. This result is at variance with a spatio-phylogenetic analysis by Lewsohn et al,202 which finds a signal of surface on same data. In Appendix 3, we show that findings Lewso et al,202 are compatible with volume; the algorithm used in Lewso et,202 also returns spurious signal of surface. Another where surface and volume lead to qualitatively different behaviour is the dispersion of mutations. Cells carrying a particular mutation can form tightly spaced or dispersed throughout tum mass, see Figure 3. turns this dispersion differs between surface and volume. To quantify dispersion of mutation, we define parameter: for given mutation, compute average of all pairs carrying mutation and divide by average these would if arranged next one another in spherical ( tightest configuration ). 

Here is a summary of the article in 300-400 words:

Researchers have used data from hundreds of samples of hepatocellular carcinomas to study the evolution of tumours in vivo. They found that tumours grow uniformly throughout the tumour volume, rather than at the surface. This is in contrast to surface growth, where the number of mutations increases with distance from the centre. The researchers also found that the rate of cell death is comparable to the rate of cell division, implying that the tumour grows more slowly than suggested by the rate of division. The study sheds light on the early evolution of tumours in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the field of spatial biology.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Seasonal polyphenism enables organisms to adapt to environmental challenges by increasing phenotypic diversity. Cacopsylla chinensis exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism, specifically in the form of summer-form and winter-form, which have distinct morphological phenotypes. Previous research has shown that low temperature and the temperature receptor CcTRPM regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis by impacting cuticle content and thickness. However, the underling neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. Bursicon, also known as the tanning hormone, is responsible for the hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle. In this study, we report for the first time on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis. Firstly, we identified CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β as two typical subunits of Bursicon in C. chinensis, which were regulated by low temperature ( 10 °C ) and CcTRPM. Subsequently, CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing the cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CcBurs-R acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the up-stream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Finally, we discovered that miR-6012 directly targets CcBurs-R, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis. In summary, these findings reveal the novel function of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor.

   . This result is consistent with the report on gypsy moths, where transcript levels of Ldbursicon in adult stages were higher than in larvae ( Zhang et al., 2022b ). The transcript levels of both subunits were higher in the head and cuticle of winter-form compared to summer-form, implying a potential role of Bursicon in seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3E–F; Luan et al., 2006 ). As the transition of C. chinensis from summer-form to winter-form is regulated by a low temperature of 10 °C and CcTRPM, we next determined the effect of 10 °C treatment and CcTRPM RNAi on the expression of CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β. As expected, 10 °C treatment significantly increased the expression of CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β, while CcTRPM RNAi markedly decreased their mRNA levels ( Figure 1E–H ). This is the first report on the relationship between the neuropeptide Bursicon and low temperature. Further results from RNAi-mediated knockdown of CcBurs-α, CcBurs-β, or both showed that Bursicon prominently regulates the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis by affecting cuticle pigment content, cuticle chitin content, and cuticle thickness ( Figure 2C–I ). Moreover, the presence of both thin and thick chitin layers observed in the dsEGFP treatment of Figure 2D could potentially be ascribed to the chitin content in the insect midgut or fat body as previously discussed ( Zhu et al., 2016 ). It is notable that during the process of cuticle staining, the chitin located in the midgut and fat body of C. chinensis may exhibit green fluorescence, leading to the appearance of a thin chitin layer. In many insects, such as Drosophila and T. castaneum, Bursicon is believed to be the main hormone responsible for cuticle tanning ( Luo et al., 2005; Bai and Palli, 2010 )

. Therefore, studying the molecular mechanism of miRNA regulation of the Bursicon receptor at the post-transcriptional level would be highly innovation. In this study, we conducted bioinformatics analysis, qRT-PCR, and western blot to identify two Bursicon subunits ( CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β ) and their association with low temperature of 10 °C. We then employed RNAi, cuticle staining, and transmission electron microscopy to study the effects of CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β on cuticle content, cuticle thickness, and the transition percent from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis. Furthermore, we identified CcBurs-R as the Bursicon receptor and investigated its role in the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Finally, through in vivo and in vitro assays, we discovered that miR-6012 targets CcBurs-R and is involved in the seasonal polyphenism. These efforts not only shed light on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in mediating the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis, but also enhance our understanding of the neuroendocrine basis of insect seasonal polyphenism.

. Activation of endogenous CcBurs-R through feeding of the α+β heterodimer protein results in an increase in CcBurs-R expression, with the effectiveness of the rescue effect contingent upon the dosage of the α+β heterodimer protein. Consequently, the capacity of the α+β heterodimer protein to effectively mitigate the impacts of CcBurs-R knockdown on the conversion rate is clearly demonstrated. Therefore, these findings strongly support our hypothesis that Bursicon and its receptor are essential for the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis. Actually, seasonal polyphenism is a complex process that may be regulated by multiple cascade reactions. Further studies are needed to clarify the regulatory mechanism of Bursicon and its receptor in mediating the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis. In animals, miRNAs are essential for tissue development and behavioral evolution ( Lucas and Raikhel, 2013 ). Previous studies have reported that many miRNAs function upstream of the neurohormone signaling pathway in insect polyphenism ( Suderman et al., 2006 ). For example, miR-133 controls behavioral aggregation by targeting the dopamine synthesis gene in Locusts ( Yang et al., 2014 ), and miR-9b targets insulin receptors to mediate dimorphism and wing development in aphids ( Shang et al., 2020 ). In this study, we identified miR-6012 as a regulator of CcBurs-R in the Bursicon hormone signaling pathway for the first time. We found that miR-6012 was inhibited by a low temperature of 10 °C and targeted CcBurs-R by binding to its 3’UTR. When nymphs were treated with agomir-6012, they exhibited lower cuticle pigment content, reduced cuticle chitin content, and thinner cuticle thickness compared to the agomir-NC control under 10 °C condition. In addition, agomir-6012 treatment markedly decreased the transition percent from summer-form to winter-form and affected the morphological phenotype compared to the control

. The significant decreased in CcTre1 and CcCHS1 expression after agomir-6012 treatment suggested that miR-6012 also functions as the upstream regulator of chitin biosynthesis signaling. In conclusion, our study uncovered a novel role of Bursicon and its receptor in regulating the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis, in addition to their known functions in cuticle-hardening of nymphs and wing expansion of adults. In Figure 7, we proposed a molecular working model to describe this novel mechanism. Under 10 °C conditions, the Bursicon signaling pathway is first activated in the head of C. chinensis by low temperature and CcTRPM. Then, CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β form a heterodimeric neuropeptide that acts on its receptor CcBurs-R to mediate the transition from summer-form to winter-form by affecting cuticle pigment content, cuticle chitin content, and cuticle thickness. Moreover, miR-6012 targets CcBurs-R to modulate the function of the Bursicon signaling pathway in this seasonal polyphenism. As a result, the first instar nymphs of summer-form develop into third instar nymphs of winter-form to better adapt to low-temperature adversity. Future research will focus on: ( 1 ) studying the combined effect of Bursicon with other neuro-hormones on the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis, ( 2 ) identifying the down-stream signaling of Bursicon in mediating this phenomenon through multi-omics and RNAi approaches.

Polyphenism is a conserved adaptive mechanism in species ranging from insects to mammalian, and evidence is mounting that it also extends to many nematode and fish species ( Stockton et al., 2018; Yang and Andrew Pospisilik, 2019 ). Seasonal polyphenism can provide overwintering species with better adaptability to extreme climates through beneficial shifts in morphology, physiology, or behavior ( Simpson et al., 2011 ). Physiological studies have shown that seasonal polyism is regulated by neurohormone signaling pathways in many species, such as Drosophila, T castum, and Locust ( Zhang et al, 202b ). However, the underlying neuroendocrine mechanism of seasonal polyism remains largely unknown in many species, including C. chinensis. In this study, we investigated the function of Bicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter in C. chinensis. We identified Cursα andcursβ as two subunits of Bicon in C. chin, which were regulated by low temperature 10 °C and CTR. Cursα andcβ formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition from summer to winter by influencing cuticle content and cut thickness. Furthermore, we demonstrated Curs acts as the Bicon receptor and plays a role in up-stream of chitin biosynthesis regulating the transition from summer to winter. Finally, we discovered mi-2 targets Curs, contributing to regulation of Bicon in seasonalism of C. chin. Our findings reveal the novel function of neuroendocrine mechanism underlying seasonalism and provide insights into insecticon and its receptor.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Diffuse midline gliomas ( DMGs ) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatments. Lysine to methionine substitution of residue 27 on histone H3 ( H3-K27M ) is a driver mutation in DMGs, reshaping the epigenetic landscape of these cells to promote tumorigenesis. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. In search of effective treatment, we examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting of histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) and MYC in these tumors. Treatment of H3-K27M patient-derived cells with Sulfopin, an inhibitor shown to block MYC-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, resulted in substantial decrease in cell viability. Moreover, transcriptome and epigenome profiling revealed synergistic effect of this drug combination in downregulation of prominent oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. Finally, in vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the drug combination. These results highlight the combined treatment with PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach for these aggressive tumors.

   . Indeed, pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACi ), such as Vorinostat and Panobinostat, were found to inhibit growth and to restore gene expression alterations observed in H3-K27M malignant gliomas ( Grasso et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2007; Su et al., 2022 ). However, recent studies demonstrated that H3-K27M cells develop resistance to HDACi treatment ( Grasso et al., 2015; Su et al., 2022 ), stressing the importance of identifying novel drug combinations to induce synergistic inhibition of oncogenic pathways. The MYC oncogenic pathway is frequently deregulated in diverse cancers, and thus stands as a prominent therapeutic target ( Chen et al., 2018 ). High-level gene amplification of MYC is recurrently observed in pediatric high-grade gliomas ( Buczkowicz et al., 2014; Mackay et al., 2017 ). H3-K27M gliomas show high expression of MYC and MYC target genes, due to both epigenetic alterations and structural variants, resulting in a viability dependency on MYC signaling ( Krug et al., 2019; Pajovic et al., 2020; Dubois et al., 2022 ). Unfortunately, directly targeting MYC in tumors is extremely challenging ( Wang et al., 2021 ). Dubiella et al., 2021 have recently developed a unique inhibitor targeting peptidyl-prolyl isomerase NIMA-interacting-1 ( PIN1 ), an upstream regulator of MYC activation ( ). PIN1 itself is frequently upregulated in many types of cancers, resulting in sustained proliferative signaling and tumor growth ( Farrell et al., 2013; D’Artista et al., 2016 ). The PIN1 inhibitor, Sulfopin, was shown to downregulate MYC target genes in vitro and to block MYC-driven tumors in murine models of neuroblastoma ( Dubiella et al., 2021 ). To address the increasing need for an effective combination therapy for H3-K27M DMGs, we tested whether dual targeting of histone acetylation and MYC activation, using Vorinostat and Sulfopin, would yield beneficial outcome

. While treating cells with Vorinostat alone increased H3K27ac levels, as expected, the combined treatment attenuated the accumulation of this mark on promoters and enhancers of prominent oncogenes, resulting in their decreased expression. This Sulfopin-mediated attenuation could potentially result from downregulation of MYC targets, as it was recently shown that MYC overexpression results in H3K27ac gain on super-enhancers ( See et al., 2022 ). In summary, we propose a novel therapeutic strategy targeting epigenetic and transcriptional pathways in H3-K27M-mutant DMG tumors. HDAC inhibition, in combination with the novel MYC inhibitor, inhibited oncogenic transcriptional signatures and reduced tumor growth in vivo. Our findings emphasize epigenetic dependencies of H3-K27M-driven gliomas and highlight the therapeutic potential of combined treatments for this aggressive malignancy.

Diffuse midline gliomas ( DMGs ) are fatal tumors of the central nervous system that occur primarily in children ( Johung and Monje, 2017; Hayden et al., 2021 ). Years of clinical trials have revealed that conventional chemotherapy is ineffective, and with no option for complete resection, DMG is now the leading cause of brain tumor-related death in children ( Ostrom et al., 2015; Srikanthan et al., 2021 ). Sequencing studies showed that up to 80% of the diagnosed children exhibit a lysine 27 to methionine ( H3-K27M ) mutation in one of the genes encoding histone H3. 3 and H3. 1 ( clinically classified as DMG, H3 K27M-mutant ). Numerous subsequent studies revealed pronounced alterations in the epigenetic landscape driven by this histone mutation ( Castel et al., 2015; Fontebasso et al., 2014; Schwartzentruber et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012 ). Among these global epigenetic alterations are a drastic loss of H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation ( H3K27me3 ), concomitant with an increase in H3 lysine 27 acetylation ( H3K27ac ). These epigenetic alterations were shown to affect transcriptional programs and support tumorigenesis ( Bender et al., 2013; Chan et al., 2013; Lewis et al., 2013; Krug et al., 2019; Piunti et al., 2017; Harpaz et al., 2022 ). Detailed characterization of the modes of chromatin deregulation in these tumors pointed toward targeting epigenetic pathways as a promising therapeutic approach ( Filbin and Monje, 2019 ). Specifically, pervasive H3K27 acetylation patterns observed in H3-K27M DMGs, along with enrichment of H3K27ac specifically on mutant nucleosomes ( Lewis et al., 2013; Krug et al., 2019; Piunti et al., 2017; Furth et al., 2022 ), underscored the histone acetylation pathway as a potential drug target for this cancer

. Taken together, our results indicate that PIN1 inhibition by Sulfopin downregulated MYC target genes, reduced H3K27me3 levels at CGIs, and led to reduce viability of DMG cells in an H3-K27M-dependent manner. Inspired by the positive outcome of combinatorial drug therapy in H3-K27M DMG models ( Grasso et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2019 ), we aimed to explore whether combining Sulfopin treatment with an epigenetic drug will further reduce cell viability. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of epigenetic pathways affecting post-translational modifications of lysine 27 ( methylation and acetylation ) and lysine 4 ( methylation ) on histone H3 ( Bender et al., 2013; Chan et al., 2013; Lewis et al., 2013; Krug et al., 2019; Furth et al., 2022; Harutyunyan et al., 2019 ). Thus, we explored the effects of combining sub-IC50 concentration of Sulfopin with four epigenetic inhibitors targeting critical components associated with these modifications: ( 1 ) EPZ-6438, an inhibitor of EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex that deposits H3K27me3 ( Schuettengruber et al., 2017 ). H3-K27M cells were reported to be sensitive to EZH2 inhibition as they rely on the residual H3K27me3 levels to suppress key tumor suppressor genes ( Piunti et al., 2017; Mohammad et al., 2017; Stafford et al., 2018; Jain et al., 2019 ) ; ( 2 ) GSK-J4, an inhibitor of the H3K27me3 demethylase JMJD3 ( Agger et al., 2007 ), shown to rescue H3K27me3 levels in H3-K27M gliomas ( Grasso et al., 2015; Hashizume et al., 2014 ) ; ( 3 ) MM-102, an inhibitor of the H3K4me3 methyltransferase MLL1 ( Schuettengruber et al., 2017 ), shown to reduce viability of H3-K27M-mutant cells ( Grasso et al, 2015 ) ; and ( 4 ) Vorinostat, a pan-HDACi that blocks H3acetylation ( Grasso et al,201; Yin et al,2007; Su et al,202 ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: The white-footed deermouse Peromyscus leucopus, a long-lived rodent, is a key reservoir in North America for agents of several zoonoses, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and a viral encephalitis. While persistently infected, this deermouse is without apparent disability or diminished fitness. For a model for inflammation elicited by various pathogens, the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) was used to compare genome-wide transcription in blood by P. leucopus, Mus musculus, and Rattus norvegicus and adjusted for white cell concentrations. Deermice were distinguished from the mice and rats by LPS response profiles consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages. LPS-treated P. leucopus, in contrast to mice and rats, also displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower magnitude fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes. These characteristics of P. leucopus were also noted in a Borrelia hermsii infection model. The phenomenon was associated with comparatively reduced transcription of endogenous retrovirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors in the deermice. The results reveal a mechanism for infection tolerance in this species and perhaps other animal reservoirs for agents of human disease.

   . As an alternative, we study P. leucopus with a non-reductionist approach that is comparative in design and agnostic in assumptions ( Balderrama-Gutierrez et al., 2021 ). The genome-wide expression comparison for P. leucopus is with M. musculus and, added here, the brown rat Rattus norvegicus. Given the wide range of pathogenic microbes that deermice tolerate, we use the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) as the primary experimental treatment because the inflammation it elicits within a few hours has features common to different kinds of serious infections, not to mention severe burns and critical injuries ( Xiao et al., 2011 ). We previously reported that a few hours after injection of LPS, P. leucopus and M. musculus had distinguishing profiles of differentially expressed genes ( DEG ) in the blood, spleen, and liver ( Balderrama-Gutierrez et al., 2021 ). In brief, the inflammation phenotype of deermice was consistent with an ‘alternatively activated’ or M2-type macrophage polarization phenotype instead of the expected ‘classically activated’ or M1-type polarization phenotype that was observed for M. musculus ( Murray et al., 2014 ). The deermice also differed from mice in displaying evidence of greater neutrophil activation and degranulation after LPS exposure. The potentially damaging action from neutrophil proteases and reactive oxygen species appeared to be mitigated in part in P. leucopus by proteins like secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor, encoded by Slpi, and superoxide dismutase 2, encoded by Sod2. Here, we first address whether the heightened transcription of neutrophil-associated genes in P. leucopus is attributable to differences in numbers of white cells in the blood. To better match for genetic diversity, we substituted outbred M. musculus for the inbred BALB/c mouse of the previous study. We retained the experimental protocol of short-term responses to LPS

. In the deermice, the ratio in control animals was midway between the two groups of mice but there was a marked decrease in the LPS-treated deermice ( Figure 7 ). This was not associated with a fall in the absolute numbers or percentages of monocytes in the blood of these animals ( Table 1 ). Taken together, the Nos2/Arg1, Il12/Il10, Akt1/Akt2, and Cd14/Fcgr3 relationships document a disposition toward alternatively activated macrophages and nonclassical monocytes in P. leucopus both before and after exposure to LPS. This contrasts with profiles consistent with a predominance of classically activated macrophages and classical monocytes in mice. For mice the Ifng transcript was one of the top ranked DEGs by both fold-change and adjusted p value by genome-wide RNA-seq ( Supplementary file 1 ). In contrast, for P. leucopus Ifng was far down the list, and the comparably ranked DEG instead was Il1b. This inversion of relationships between two pro-inflammatory cytokines was confirmed by analysis of the individual animals of both species ( Figure 8 ). There was little or no detectable transcription of Ifng in the blood of deermice in which Il1b expression was high. There was also scant to no transcription of Ifng in the blood of P. leucopus 12 hr after injection of LPS ( Table 3 ). The up-regulation of the interferon-gamma gene within 4 hr of exposure to LPS was not limited to the species M. musculus. In an experiment with the rat R. norvegicus, we used two different LPS doses ( 5 µg/g and 20 µg/g ), but the same 4 hr endpoint and whole blood as the sample. Both groups of LPS-treated rats had lowered total white blood cells and, like the mice, lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios compared to controls ( Table 4; Table 4—source data 1 ). There were also elevations of interferon-gamma, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 proteins from undetectable levels in the blood of the treated rats

How does the white-footed deermouse Peromyscus leucopus continue to thrive while sustaining infections with disease agents it serves as reservoir for ( Barbour, 2017 )? The diverse tickborne pathogens ( and diseases ) for humans include the extracellular bacterium Borreliella burgdorferi ( Lyme disease ), the intracellular bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum ( anaplasmosis ), the protozoan Babesia microti ( babesiosis ), and the Powassan flavivirus ( viral encephalitis ). Most deermice remain persistently infected but display scant inflammation in affected tissues ( Cook and Barbour, 2015; Long et al., 2019; Moody et al., 1994 ), and without apparent consequence for fitness ( Schwanz et al., 2011; Voordouw et al., 2015 ). A related question—conceivably with the same answer—is what accounts for the two-to-three fold longer life span for P. leucopus than for the house mouse, Mus musculus ( Labinskyy et al., 2009; Sacher and Hart, 1978 )? The abundance of P. leucopus across much of North America ( Hall, 1979; Moscarella et al., 2019 ) and its adaptation to a variety of environments, including urban areas and toxic waste sites ( Biser et al., 2004; Levengood and Heske, 2008; Munshi-South and Kharchenko, 2010 ), indicates successful adjustment to changing landscapes and climate. Peromyscus species, including the hantavirus reservoir P. maniculatus ( Morzunov et al., 1998 ), are more closely related to hamsters and voles in family Cricetidae than to mice and rats of family Muridae ( Bradley et al., 2014 ). As a species native to North America, P. leucopus is an advantageous alternative to the Eurasian-origin house mouse for study of natural variation in populations that are readily accessible ( Bedford and Hoekstra, 2015; Long et al., 2022 ). A disadvantage for the study of any Peromyscus species is the limited reagents and genetic tools of the sorts that are applied for mouse studies. As an alternative, we study P

. P. leucopus does not fit well with this model. Instead of the prominent interferon-gamma response observed in mice and rats, there were prominent responses of interleukin-1 beta and genes associated with neutrophil activation. Instead of the much heightened expression of ISGs, like Mx2 and Isg15, in mice treated with LPS, the deermice under the same condition had a more subdued ISG transcription profile. Instead of increased expression of ERV Env protein sequences in blood of mice and rats treated with LPS, there was decreased transcription of the homologous ERV env in like-treated P. leucopus. This suppression in the deermice may be attributable to defensive adaptations of Peromyscus to repeated invasions of endogenous retroviruses, as Gozashti et al. has proposed for P. maniculatus ( Gozashti et al., 2023 ). This includes expanding the repertoire of silencing mechanisms, such as Kruppel-associated box ( KRAB ) domain-containing zinc finger proteins ( Yang et al., 2017 ). Like P. maniculatus, P. leucopus has an abundance of Long Terminal Repeat retrotransposons, several named for their endogenous retrovirus heritages ( Long et al., 2019 ). Our initial analysis of the P. leuc transcriptome indicates that these retrotranspos are suppressed in the deerm, which may contribute to reduced expression of interferon-stimulated genes in response to LPS

    Title: 
    Abstract: Caspase ( CASP ) is a family of proteases involved in cleavage and activation of gasdermin, the executor of pyroptosis. In humans, CASP3 and CASP7 recognize the same consensus motif DxxD, which is present in gasdermin E ( GSDME ). However, human GSDME is cleaved by CASP3 but not by CASP7. The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear. In this study, we identified a pyroptotic pufferfish GSDME that was cleaved by both pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3/7. Domain swapping between pufferfish and human CASP and GSDME showed that the GSDME C-terminus and the CASP7 p10 subunit determined the cleavability of GSDME by CASP7. p10 contains a key residue that governs CASP7 substrate discrimination. This key residue is highly conserved in vertebrate CASP3 and in most vertebrate ( except mammalian ) CASP7. In mammals, the key residue is conserved in non-primates ( e. g., mouse ) but not in primates. However, mouse CASP7 cleaved human GSDME but not mouse GSDME. These findings revealed the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrate. These results also suggested that mutation-mediated functional alteration of CASP probably enabled the divergence and specialization of different CASP members in the regulation of complex cellular activities in mammals.

    GSDME is an ancient member of the GSDM family existing ubiquitously in vertebrate from teleost to mammals ( Broz et al., 2020; De Schutter et al., 2021 ). In humans, GSDME is specifically cleaved by CASP3 at the consensus motif DMPD, but it is not cleaved by CASP7, which recognizes the same DxxD motif. CASP3 cleavage releases the pyroptosis-inducing NT fragment from the association of the inhibitory CT fragment and switches cell death from apoptosis to pyroptosis ( Rogers et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017 ). In this study, we found that different from human GSDME, a pufferfish GSDME belonging to the teleost GSDMEa lineage was specifically cleaved by both CASP3 and CASP7 at the site of DAVD to liberate the pyroptosis-inducing NT fragment. In teleost, there generally exist two GSDME orthologs, named GSDMEa and GSDMEb. Comparative study on the functions of GSDMEa and GSDMEb is scarce, and it remains to be explored whether clear physiological roles are played by these two orthologs in fish. As executors of pyroptosis, teleost GSDMEs are activated via different mechanisms. In tongue sole ( Cynoglossus semilaevis ), GSDMEb is preferably cleaved by CASP1 to trigger pyroptosis ( Jiang et al., 2019 ) ; in zebrafish ( Danio rerio ), GSDMEb is activated by caspy2 ( CASP5 homolog ) through the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 ( NLRP3 ) inflammasome signaling pathway ( Li et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a ). These observations indicate that similar to mammalian GSDMD, teleost GSDMEb is activated by inflammatory CASPs. In contrast, teleost GSDMEa is cleaved mainly by apoptotic CASPs. In zebrafish, GSDMEa is cleaved by CASP3 to generate the pyroptotic NT fragment ( Wang et al., 2017 ). In turbot ( Scophthalmus maximus ), GSDMEa is bi-directionally regulated by CASP3/7, which activate GSDMEa, and CASP6, which inactivates GSDMEa ( Xu et al., 2022 )

It has long been observed that although human caspase ( HsCASP ) 3 and 7 share the same consensus recognition motif DxxD, HsCASP3, but not HsCASP7, cleaves human GSDME ( HsGSDME ) ( at the site of DMPD ) ( Poreba et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017 ). The underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. In this study, we found that a pufferfish T. rubripes GSDME ( designated TrGSDME ), which belongs to the GSDMEa lineage of teleost GSDME ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ), was specifically cleaved by both HsCASP3 and 7 ( Figure 1A and B ). This intriguing observation promoted us to explore the mechanism of HsCASP7 substrate discrimination. We first examined whether TrGSDME could be cleaved by pufferfish CASP ( TrCASP ) 3/7. The active forms of TrCASP3/7 were prepared ( Figure 1C ), both exhibited high proteolytic specificity and activity toward the tetrapeptide DEVD ( Figure 1D and E ), which is the conserved recognition motif of HsCASP3/7. When incubated with TrGSDME, both TrCASP3 and TrCASP7 cleaved TrGSDME into the NT and CT fragments, similar to that cleaved by HsCASP3/7, in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1F and G ). Accordingly, TrCASP3/7-mediated TrGSDME cleavage was inhibited by the CASP3 inhibitor ( Z-DEVD-FMK ) and the pan-CASP inhibitor ( Z-VAD-FMK ) ( Figure 1H ). Based on the molecular mass of the cleaved NT and CT products, we inferred that the tetrapeptide motif 255DAVD258 in the vicinity of the linker region of TrGSDME may be the recognition site of CASP3/7. Indeed, the D255R and D258A mutants of TrGSDME were resistant to TrCASP3/7 and HsCASP3/7 cleavage ( Figure 1I and J, Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). Taken together, these results demonstrated that TrGSDME was cleaved by fish and human CASP3/7 in a manner that depended on the specific sequence of DAVD ( Figure 1K ). We next examined whether TrGSDME, like HsGSDME, is a functional pyroptosis inducer

., 2022 ). In common carp ( Cyprinus carpio haematopterus ), GSDMEa is cleaved by CASP3 and induces pyroptosis ( Zhao et al., 2022 ). The complicated scenario of GSDME-mediated pyroptosis signaling in fish is likely due to the reason that, unlike mammals that have multiple GSDM members to induce pyroptosis under different conditions, fish have only GSDME to induce pyroptotic cell death. Regulation by different CASPs may represent a mechanism that enables fish GSDME to execute the orders of different pyroptotic signals. It is intriguing that, although HsCASP3 and 7 were indistinguishable in proteolysis toward the consensus tetrapeptide, they differed remarkably in the cleavage of HsGSDME and TrGSDME. HsCASP3, but not HsCASP7, cleaved HsGSDME, whereas both HsCASP3 and 7 cleaved TrGSDME at the same site. NT/CT domain swapping between HsGSDME and TrGSDME showed that chimeric GSDMEs containing the TrGSDME-CT domain were cleaved by human as well as pufferfish CASP7 regardless of the source of the NT, whereas chimeric GSDMEs containing the HsGSDME-CT domain were resistant to HsCASP7. These results indicate that the CT domain, which is well accepted to exert an inhibitory effect on the pore-forming NT domain ( Liu et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2015 ), is the target of HsCASP7 discrimination, and hence determines the cleavability of GSDME by HsCASP7. Recently, Wang and Liu studied the molecular mechanism of human GSDMD recognition by CASP1/4 and showed that GSDMD-CT interacted with CASP1/4 exosites through binding to a hydrophobic pocket, which enhanced the recognition by CASP1/4 and contributed to tetrapeptide sequence-independent cleavage of GSDMD ( Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b ). Different from GSDMD, we found that for TrGSDME, mutation of either the P4 ( D255 ) or P1 ( D258 ) residue of the consensus motif 255DAVD258 made it resistant to CASP3/7, implying a lack of hydroobic interaction between TrSD and CAS3/7 ( Figure 1 and Figure— supplement 2 ). In contrast, mutation of either P4 (255 ) or P1 (258 ) of HSD made it resistant to CAS3 but not CAS7 ( Figure 1 and Figure— supplement 2 ), suggesting that the hydroobic interaction between HSD and CAS3 is crucial for CAS3 cleavage of HSD, but not CAS7. These findings indicate that the key residue P4 ( D ) of the tetrape motif 255DA258 in TrSD determines CAS discrimination between CAS3 and CAS7. This residue is conserved in vertebrate CAS3 but not in vertebrate CAS7, except in non-primates ( e. g., mouse ) but not in primates. However, mouse CAS7 cleaved HSD but not TrSD ( Figure 1 and Figure— supplement 2 ), suggesting that the residue P ( D ) is not the sole determinant of CAS discrimination between CAS3 and CAS7 in mammals. In conclusion, we identified the molecular mechanism of CAS7 substrate discrimination and divergence of CAS3-mediated GME activation in vertebrate. Our results also suggested that mutation-mediated functional alteration of CAS probably enabled the divergence and specialization of CAS members in the regulation of cellular activities in mammals.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Ketamine has emerged as one of the most promising therapies for treatment-resistant depression. However, inter-individual variability in response to ketamine is still not well understood and it is unclear how ketamine’s molecular mechanisms connect to its neural and behavioral effects. We conducted a single-blind placebo-controlled study, with participants blinded to their treatment condition. 40 healthy participants received acute ketamine ( initial bolus 0. 23 mg/kg, continuous infusion 0. 58 mg/kg/hr ). We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via data-driven global brain connectivity and related it to individual ketamine-induced symptom variation and cortical gene expression targets. We found that: ( i ) both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine are multi-dimensional, reflecting robust inter-individual variability; ( ii ) ketamine’s data-driven principal neural gradient effect matched somatostatin ( SST ) and parvalbumin ( PVALB ) cortical gene expression patterns in humans, while the mean effect did not; and ( iii ) behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine, which were resolvable at the single-subject level. These results highlight the importance of considering individual behavioral and neural variation in response to ketamine. They also have implications for the development of individually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry. This study was supported by NIH grants DP5OD012109-01 ( A.

    Over the last two decades, ketamine has emerged as one of the most promising therapies for treatment-resistant depression ( TRD ) ( Krystal et al., 2019 ). Robust individual differences in response to ketamine have been observed in both healthy controls and patients with TRD ( Murrough et al., 2013; Hack et al., 2021 ). For example, a single ketamine infusion results in a response rate of around 65% in patients with TRD, while individual differences in baseline molecular effects ( e. g. NMDA receptor occupancy ) and brain function predict the degree to which an individual experiences specific acute ketamine-induced symptoms ( Murrough et al., 2013; Stone et al., 2008; Honey et al., 2008 ). Despite these findings, an assumption persists within the fMRI pharmacology literature that the behavioral and neural effects of substances like ketamine are uniform across individuals, and that the central tendency can effectively capture such effects. In this study, we challenge this assumption and instead posit that ketamine’s effects are multi-dimensional, and that these dimensions will capture individual differences in response to ketamine. Ketamine’s effects have been extensively characterised by group studies, which typically involve recruiting a sample of patients, measuring brain activity before and after ketamine infusion, and then averaging the results across the patients ( i. e. relying on the power of central tendency ) to ascertain ketamine’s effects. At subanesthetic doses, ketamine produces transient changes in behavior, perception, and cognition that are comparable to the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms seen in patients with psychosis-spectrum illness ( Krystal et al., 1994 ). Therefore, ketamine’s acute behavioral effects are typically captured using psychosis-related scales such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ), as well as cognitive tasks ( Anticevic et al., 2012 )

., 2017; Abdallah et al., 2018 ). However, this finding failed to replicate in patients with depression 48 hr post-ketamine ( Kraus et al., 2020 ), suggesting a complex relationship between ketamine’s acute and delayed effects. In addition to GBC, graph theoretical approaches have demonstrated ketamine induces a shift from a cortical to a subcortically-centred brain state, particularly the basal ganglia and cerebellum ( Joules et al., 2015 ). Meanwhile, a nodal predictive model found ketamine resulted in reduced connectivity within the primary cortices and the executive network, but increased connectivity between the executive network and the rest of brain ( Abdallah et al., 2021 ). Finally, dynamic resting-state functional connectivity showed that ketamine decreased connectivity both within the left visual network and inter-hemispherically between the visual networks ( Spies et al., 2019 ). However, these studies also fail to account for individual differences in response to ketamine. The main limitation of relying on the power of central tendency is that meaningful differences between individual subjects may be lost through the process of averaging. One method that has been used to successfully address this and uncover individual differences in psychiatric research is a principal component analysis ( PCA ) ( Ji et al., 2020; Halai et al., 2017 ). A PCA is a data-driven method that is able to uncover both group-level and individual-level differences. More specifically, a PCA allows us to test the hypothesis that ketamine’s effects are multi-dimensional: if ketamine’s effects are uniform then we would expect a PCA to result in one principal component on which all the participants can be mapped; however if there are systemic differences between participants, we would anticipate a PCA to generate multiple principle components

. A potential interpretation is that the expression of SST and PVALB cortical genes varies among individuals due to a range of factors, including stress, sleep patterns, medications, and psychiatric diagnoses ( Lin and Sibille, 2015; Perez et al., 2019 ). Overall, this is an important intuition, as the identification of the targets responsible for the different behavioral effects of ketamine seen in specific individuals is critical for the development of novel pharmaco-therapies that may lack the side effects of ketamine or reduce the abuse potential. As with most psychoactive pharmacological neuroimaging studies, despite the single-blind design participants were able to correctly identify whether they received ketamine or saline 100% of the time. Future studies may mitigate this by using an active placebo control. In addition, as the ketamine and saline scans took place on the same day, ketamine’s residual effects ruled out the counterbalancing of the order. Furthermore, neural measures were only collected during ketamine’s peak effects. Given ketamine’s antidepressant effects are shown to peak 24–72 hr post-infusion, future studies may wish to collect additional follow-up scans ( Krystal et al., 2019; Berman et al., 2000 ). While behavioral measures were collected during both peak effects and offset, the use of repetitive questionnaires and tasks introduces potential psychometric confounds such as familiarity and practice effects. In addition, we did not regress out physiological measures. There is a large body of evidence to suggest that heart rate and blood pressure impact resting-state functional connectivity, and sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine and moderate doses of psilocybin and LSD have all been shown to increase heart rate and blood pressure ( Chang et al., 2013; Nikolaou et al., 2016; de la Cruz et al., 2019; Riva-Posse et al., 2018; Bennett et al., 2023; Isbell, 1959 )

., 2005; Czéh et al., 2015 ). Given that many different genes show similar spatial patterns in the brain, with the most common pattern explaining approximately 25% of the total gene expression variance ( Burt et al., 2018 ), it is important to note that by relating ketamine’s neural effects to SST and PVALB cortical gene expression patterns we do not make any claims regarding gene specificity. Instead, we use the established relationship between ketamine and SST/PVALB interneurons to evaluate the relative merits of assessing ketamine’s acute effects using a multi-dimensional vs. uni-dimensional approach. The current study aims to investigate the behavioral and neural effects of acute ketamine administration in 40 healthy controls using a whole-brain data-driven multi-dimensional ( PCA ) approach. We hypothesize that ketamine will result in multiple neural and behavioral axes of variation, reflecting inter-individual variability in response to ketamine. We further hypothesize that using a multi-dimensional vs. uni-dimensional approach to capture ketamine’s acute effects will allow us to more closely relate ketamine’s effects to its hypothesized molecular mechanisms, specifically SST and PVALB cortical gene expression maps. In addition, we investigate the extent to which multi-dimensionality is a property specific to ketamine by directly comparing ketamine’s effects to those of a control substance with known to have a uni-dimensional effects, saline. Our results show that ketamine’s neural and behavioral effects are multi-dimensional, reflecting inter-individual variability, and that ketamine’s data-driven neural gradient matched SST and PVAL cortical expression in humans, while the mean did not, and that behavioral-driven symptom variation mapped onto distinct gradients of ketamine resolvable at the single-subject level. These findings highlight the importance of considering individual and neural variation in response to ketamine and have implications for the development of precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment in psychiatry. 

The final answer is: 

This study aimed to investigate the neural and behavioral effects of ketamine in 40 healthy controls using a whole-brain data-driven multi-dimensional principal component analysis (PCA) approach. The researchers hypothesized that ketamine would result in multiple neural and behavioral axes of variation, reflecting individual differences in response to ketamine. They found that ketamine's effects were multi-dimensional, reflecting individual variability, and that ketamine-driven neural gradient matched somatostatin (SST) and parvalbum (PVAL) cortical expression in humans, while the mean did not. Behavioral-driven symptom variation mapped onto distinct gradients of ketamine resolvable at the single-subject level. These results highlight the importance of considering individual and neural variation in response to ketamine and have implications for the development of precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment in psychiatry.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The RNA world hypothesis proposes that during the early evolution of life, primordial genomes of the first self-propagating evolutionary units existed in the form of RNA-like polymers. Autonomous, non-enzymatic, and sustained replication of such information carriers presents a problem, because product formation and hybridization between template and copy strands reduces replication speed. Kinetics of growth is then parabolic with the benefit of entailing competitive coexistence, thereby maintaining diversity. Here, we test the information-maintaining ability of parabolic growth in stochastic multispecies population models under the constraints of constant total population size and chemostat conditions. We find that large population sizes and small differences in the replication rates favor the stable coexistence of the vast majority of replicator species ( ‘genes’ ), while the error threshold problem is alleviated relative to exponential amplification. In addition, sequence properties ( GC content ) and the strength of resource competition mediated by the rate of resource inflow determine the number of coexisting variants, suggesting that fluctuations in building block availability favored repeated cycles of exploration and exploitation. Stochastic parabolic growth could thus have played a pivotal role in preserving viable sequences generated by random abiotic synthesis and providing diverse genetic raw material to the early evolution of functional ribozymes.

   ., 2011 ). Moreover, practically no study is known to have treated parabolic replication so that physicochemical details and ecological constraints, together with stochastic effects ( that supposedly also have considerable impact on finite systems ), would have been taken into consideration. The present study aims to remedy these deficiencies by quantifying the heritable information-maintaining potential of finite populations of unlinked, RNA-like template replicators displaying parabolic growth modeled as stochastic dynamics. We represent the replicator sequences individually, and copying error as well as energetic constraints in strand separation are also considered explicitly. Using a constant population model version of this framework, we first investigate how the diversity-maintaining mechanisms operate in the parabolic regime in a finite population of replicators. We further demonstrate that parabolic coexistence is resistant to mutation rates assumed for template-directed, enzyme-free replication, thereby proposing a simple biochemical mechanism to relax the error threshold in hypothetical information storage systems of the RNA world. In order for our stochastic simulation results to be comparable with the theoretical error threshold of parabolic dynamics, we analytically calculate the equilibrium master ( i. e. fittest sequence ) concentrations as a function of the copying fidelity and the reproductive superiority of the master sequences relative to the mutants. We also compare the error threshold in case of parabolic dynamics to the case of the exponential dynamics. Finally, in order to validate that Darwinian selection by competitive exclusion is also feasible in this framework, we consider a chemostat model of parabolic replication, in which monomer building block resources are additionally taken into account

We consider populations of oligomer molecules based on nucleotide-like monomer constituents ( to preserve generality for potential informational polymers other than RNA ). Individual molecules are represented by their primary ( monomeric sequence ) structures and are assumed to undergo template-directed, non-enzymatic replication. This replication mode converts a single-stranded plus- or minus-strand template into a template-copy duplex. Strand separation rates of these duplexes are relatively low compared to strand association ( e. g. von Kiedrowski et al., 1991 ). Therefore, replication cycles are strongly inhibited and as a result, the population dynamics displays parabolic characteristics. We define a set of replicators with the highest fitness relative to all mutant genotypes and refer to them as ‘master’ types ( Eigen, 1971 ), representing the genetic information to be maintained. To analyze the diversity-maintaining ability of parabolic dynamics in a competitive setting, the master replicator types are characterized by different replicabilities. This assumption reflects the fact that, at least in case of RNA, the rate of copying of short templates by polymerization of activated monomers inherently varies with template composition ( Szostak, 2012 ). In order to make our model framework to be more suitable for focusing on different aspects of parabolic dynamics, we considered two different model versions of parabolic replication ( Figure 1A and B ). To analyze the diversity-maintaining ability of the system, we generate a T-membered set of master sequences. The ϕi replicability of master sequence type i is: ( 8 ) ϕi=ϕmin+ ( i−1 ) ⋅δ where i=1, 2, …, T. Note that the difference between the lowest and highest replicability is ( T−1 ) ⋅δ, thus, δ can be interpreted as replicability distance. Mutations reduce the replicability of master sequences by a predefined error factor: ϕ=ε∙ϕi, where in case of one mutation, ε=0

. e. cooperative coexistence, see, for example, Epstein, 1979; Mizuuchi and Ichihashi, 2018 ) can considerably broaden the parameter space in which we reported competitive coexistence of different replicator variants. In this study we considered kinetic constants that correspond to the p≈0. 5 growth order. Further investigations into the 0. 5<p<1 interval ( Issac and Chmielewski, 2002; Li and Chmielewski, 2003; Lincoln and Joyce, 2009 ) are expected to show that an increase in the kinetic growth order decreases the scope of competitive coexistence and drives the system more toward the Darwinian regime. Such studies may help gain a deeper insight into the question whether the emergence of an effective strand separation mechanism, or other conditions implying kinetic constants that shift the dynamics toward exponential amplification, allowed for a still sub-exponential diversity-maintaining mechanism during later phases of chemical evolution and thus a gradual evolutionary transition from non-enzymatic replication to ribozyme-aided amplification. The two key components of evolutionary algorithms are exploration and exploitation ( Bäck et al., 2000 ). If diversity decreases too fast under selection, this can lead to premature convergence, resulting in a population getting stuck at a local adaptive peak. In order to avoid premature convergence, various diversity-maintaining mechanisms have been introduced. We call attention to the fact that parabolic growth is an organic form of diversity maintenance. Referring to the chemostat model, we propose that a periodically changing environment with alternating resource abundance and shortage can drive, and in the distant past could have driven, an efficient evolutionary exploration-exploitation algorithm.

., 2021 ). For example, it has been experimentally demonstrated that activated oligonucleotides can act as catalysts for non-enzymatic replication of RNA containing all four nucleotides, with the fidelity sufficient to sustain a genome size large enough to encode active ribozymes ( Prywes et al., 2016 ). If enzyme-free replication of oligomers with a high degree of sequence variability was indeed attainable from prebiotic chemistry, then it becomes a vital issue how a critical level of diversity of the associated genetic information ( Szostak, 2011 ) could be preserved under competition among distinct replicator types with different competitive abilities ( e. g. replicabilities ) ( Eigen, 1971; Szathmáry, 1991; Maynard Smith and Szathmáry, 1995; Jiménez et al., 2013; Ruiz-Mirazo et al., 2017 ). This recognition calls for elucidation of the coexistence mechanisms that could have alleviated the competition among independently replicating information carrying modules. For instance, parabolic growth dynamics, a kinetic behavior observed in non-enzymatic self-replicating systems ( von Kiedrowski, 1986 ), has been proposed as an ideal candidate mechanism to sustain a large amount of prebiotic genetic information ( Szathmáry and Gladkih, 1989; Scheuring and Szathmáry, 2001 ). In this kinetics, the growth order p is equal or close to 0. 5 ( i. e. the dynamics is sub-exponential ) because increased stability of the template-copy complex ( rate of association divided by dissociation ) promotes parabolic growth ( von Kiedrowski et al., 1991; von Kiedrowski and Szathmáry, 2001 ). This is in sharp contrast to exponential growth, where p=1 implies maximum dissociation that allows for fast autocatalysis ( Tjivikua et al., 1990; von Kiedrowski et al., 1991 )

., 1990; von Kiedrowski et al., 1991 ). Thus, replicating individuals in populations displaying parabolic growth kinetics are inherently prone to self-inhibition by duplex formation, a feature that can efficiently damp competition and therefore promote coexistence. Indeed, parabolic population growth can sustain an unlimited number of competing replicator species in the infinite population size limit ( Szathmáry and Gladkih, 1989; Varga and Szathmáry, 1997 ). However, molecular evolution of the Darwinian type is thought to necessitate exponential, rather than parabolic amplification, because in the latter case robust coexistence of the competing replicator species generally limits the efficiency of natural selection ( Sievers and von Kiedrowski, 1998; Szilágyi et al., 2017; Strazewski, 2019 ). Therefore, a major current question is whether parabolic growth could have played a pivotal role in the early evolution of life by providing a mechanism to preserve genetic diversity generated by random abiotic synthesis and providing raw material for the emergence of functional ribymes. In this study, we investigate the information-maint ability of parabolic growth in finite populations of RNA-like replicators under constant population size and chemostat conditions. We find that large population sizes and small differences in replication rates favor the coexistence of the majority of replicator species, while the error problem is alleviated relative to exponential amplification. In addition, sequence properties GC content and strength of competition mediated the rate of resource inflow determine the number of coexisting variants suggesting that fluctuations in block availability favored cycles of exploration and exploitation. Stochastic par growth could have played a role in preserving sequences generated by random synthesis and providing genetic material to the evolution of ribymes.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Nonstructural protein 5 ( Nsp5 ) is the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 that cleaves viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides necessary for viral replication. Here, we show that Nsp5 binds and cleaves human tRNA methyltransferase 1 ( TRMT1 ), a host enzyme required for a prevalent post-transcriptional modification in tRNAs. Human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a decrease in TRMT1 protein levels and TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications, consistent with TRMT1 cleavage and inactivation by Nsp5. Nsp5 cleaves TRMT1 at a specific position that matches the consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites, and a single mutation within the sequence inhibits Nsp5-dependent proteolysis of TRMT1. The TRMT1 cleavage fragments exhibit altered RNA binding activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TRMT1-deficient human cells. Compared to wild-type human cells, TRMT1-deficient human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit reduced levels of intracellular viral RNA. These findings provide evidence that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and perturbation of tRNA modification patterns contribute to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

   . In addition, we provide evidence that TRMT1 expression is required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. These studies uncover TRMT1 as a novel proteolytic cleavage target of Nsp5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest possible pathological mechanisms associated with perturbations in TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications.

. The decrease in m2, 2G levels after SARS-CoV-2 infection was also reproduced in an independent experiment ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). In addition to m2, 2G, more than half of all tested RNA modifications exhibited a decrease in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells compared to mock-infected cells at 24 hr post-infection ( Figure 1D ). At 48 hr post-infection with SARS-CoV-2, most of the tested RNA modifications exhibited a decrease in levels compared to mock-infected cells. The RNA modifications that decrease upon viral infection include modifications that are known to be present in multiple types of RNA, including tRNA, rRNA, and mRNA. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection of human MRC-5 lung fibroblast cells alters the steady-state levels of multiple RNA modifications, including the m2, 2G modification catalyzed by TRMT1. Examination of the primary structure of human TRMT1 revealed an eight amino acid residue sequence between the methyltransferase domain and zinc-finger motif matching the consensus sequence of Nsp5 cleavage sites in SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins ( Figure 2A and B ). The putative cleavage site in TRMT1 includes a glutamine ( Q ) residue conserved at the fourth position that is found in all Nsp5 cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins ( Figure 2B ). Based upon a predicted tertiary structure of TRMT1 using Alpha Fold ( Jumper et al., 2021; Varadi et al., 2022 ), this putative Nsp5 cleavage site is expected to lie in an unstructured linker region exposed on the surface of TRMT1 ( Figure 2C ). To investigate a potential interaction between Nsp5 and TRMT1, we used human 293T cells due to their high transfection efficiency. We transfected human 293T cells with plasmids expressing wild-type ( WT ) Nsp5 from SARS-CoV-2 or Nsp5-C145A. The Nsp5-C145A mutant contains an alanine substitution of the catalytic cysteine residue in the active site of Nsp5 and is proteolytically inactive ( Lee et al., 2020 )

Our findings suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 might self-limit its replication by altering the host translation machinery through TRMT1 degradation and reduced levels of m2, 2G-modified tRNAs. This perturbation of the tRNA pool may further inhibit host translation that is already targeted by Nsp1 blockade of mRNA entry on 40 S ribosomes ( Kamitani et al., 2009; Lapointe et al., 2021; Schubert et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020; Tidu et al., 2020 ). The inhibition of host translation may be beneficial to certain viruses that can locally maintain a tRNA pool optimized for viral translation ( Hernandez-Alias et al., 2021; Pavon-Eternod et al., 2013; van Weringh et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2021 ). Another possibility is that Nsp5-TRMT1 interaction facilitates the packaging of specific tRNAs into viral particles as suggested previously ( Peña et al., 2022 ). The observation that expression of the non-cleavable TRMT1-Q530N variant enhances viral replication and infectivity supports the hypothesis that TRMT1 could facilitate tRNA uptake into viral particles. The packaging of specific tRNAs in viral particles could augment viral translation in the subsequent round of infection, thereby enhancing infectivity and perhaps facilitating the species jump of SARS-CoV-2 towards hosts with incompatible codon bias.

To test the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on TRMT1 and tRNA modifications, we used an MRC-5 human lung fibroblast cell line expressing the ACE2 receptor that is permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Raymonda et al., 2022; Uemura et al., 2021a; Uemura et al., 2021b ). MRC-5 cells were mock-infected or infected with SARS-CoV-2 followed by harvesting at 24- and 48 hr post-infection for sample preparation. We chose the 24- and 48 hr time points since MRC5-ACE2 cells exhibit elevated accumulation of viral RNA at these time points without extreme cell death that occurs at subsequent time points ( Raymonda et al., 2022 ). Immunoblotting for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid ( N ) protein confirmed the infection and expression of viral proteins in MRC-5 cells compared to mock-infected cells ( Figure 1A and N protein, compare lanes 1 and 2 to lanes 3 and 4 ). To probe for TRMT1, we used an antibody that detects the major TRMT1 isoform of ~72 kDa as well as a non-specific band at ~65 kDa in human cell lysates ( Dewe et al., 2017; Perez et al., 2022 ). Using this antibody, we also detected the 72 kDa TRMT1 isoform as well as the non-specific 65 kDa band in MRC-5 cell lysates ( Figure 1A, circle denotes TRMT1, asterisk denotes non-specific band ). In multiple independent replicates, MRC-5 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibited a ~30% reduction in TRMT1 levels at 24- and 48 hr post-infection compared to mock-infected cells ( Figure 1B ). These results provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces cellular levels of TRMT1. We next measured the levels of TRMT1-catalyzed m2, 2G modifications in cellular RNA using quantitative mass spectrometry. While m2, 2G levels did not exhibit a significant change between mock-infected and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells at 24 hr post-infection, m2, 2G levels were decreased by ~15% at 48 hr post-infection in multiple biological replicates ( Figure 1C )

., 2018; Najmabadi et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2020 ). Thus, changes in TRMT1 activity can impact protein synthesis leading to downstream cellular and biological effects. The life cycle of many viruses has been linked to host tRNA biology ( reviewed in Dremel et al., 2023; Nunes et al., 2020 ). In one well-known example, retroviruses such as HIV use cellular tRNAs as primers for reverse transcription and other viral functions ( reviewed in Jin and Musier-Forsyth, 2019 ). DNA and RNA viruses can also impact tRNA synthesis, processing, and charging to modulate infection and pathogenesis ( Dremel et al., 2022; Netzer et al., 2009; Tucker et al., 2020 ). In a recent study, Chikungunya RNA virus infection has been shown to increase the expression of a human tRNA modification enzyme and alter tRNA modification patterns to favor viral protein expression ( Jungfleisch et al., 2022 ). Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 viral particles exhibit an enrichment of specific host tRNAs with distinct modification profiles ( Peña et al., 2022 ). Moreover, analysis of RNA modifications in SARS-CoV-infected cells revealed a decrease in m2, 2 levels and other modifications ( Figure 1D and Figure 1— supplement 1 ). The decrease in m2, 2 levels was reproduced in an independent experiment ( Figure 1— supplement 1 ) In addition to m2, 2, more than half of tested RNA modifications exhibited a decrease in SARSV-2-infected cells compared to mock-infected at 24 post-infection ( Figure 1 ) At 48 post-infection with SARS-2, most tested modifications exhibited a decrease levels compared to mock-infected cells The modifications that decrease upon infection include those present in multiple types RNA, including tRNA, rRNA, and mRNA Thus, SARS-2 of MRC-5 lungroblasts alters the steady-state of multiple modifications including m, 2 catalyzed by TR1.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Many disease-causing microbes are not obligate pathogens; rather, they are environmental microbes taking advantage of an ecological opportunity. The existence of microbes whose life cycle does not require a host and are not normally pathogenic, yet are well-suited to host exploitation, is an evolutionary puzzle. One hypothesis posits that selection in the environment may favor traits that incidentally lead to pathogenicity and virulence, or serve as pre-adaptations for survival in a host. An example of such a trait is surface adherence. To experimentally test the idea of ‘accidental virulence’, replicate populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were evolved to attach to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations. Along with plastic adherence, two multicellular phenotypes— biofilm formation and flor formation— increased; another phenotype, pseudohyphal growth, responded to the nutrient limitation. Thus, experimental selection led to the evolution of highly-adherent, hyper-multicellular strains. Wax moth larvae injected with evolved hyper-multicellular strains were significantly more likely to die than those injected with evolved non-multicellular strains. Hence, selection on plastic adherence incidentally led to the evolution of enhanced multicellularity and increased virulence. Our results support the idea that selection for a trait beneficial in the open environment can inadvertently generate opportunistic, ‘accidental’ pathogens.

   . Here, yeast populations were artificially selected for adherence ability in one context, in order to determine whether it led to an increase in virulence in another. Specifically, yeast were evolved to adhere to a plastic bead ( Poltak and Cooper, 2011 ), then tested against wax moth larvae to estimate virulence. In replicate populations of two genetic backgrounds, the yeast increased in their ability to express multicellularity in numerous forms. Not all multicellular phenotypes responded in the same way, with pseudohyphal growth appearing to evolve independently from plastic adherence, biofilm formation, and flor formation. This phenotypic evolution demonstrates the complexity of the interacting genetic networks underlying yeast multicellularity. Along with these correlated effects of selection, the yeast also became more virulent. Our results experimentally demonstrate that selection on dual-use traits outside of a host environment can inadvertently favor pre-adaptations for virulence.

. Thus, while FLO11 length evolved during the experiment, it does not appear to be the cause of the correlated response to selection on adherence. However, this does not rule out the possibility that FLO11 plays a role. It is possible that expression of the gene, through its complex regulatory network ( Rupp et al., 1999; Octavio et al., 2009; Bumgarner et al., 2009 ), is related to the phenotypic response to adherence selection. To test the coincidental selection-accidental virulence hypothesis, we sought to determine if the evolved changes had an effect on virulence, and were particularly interested in the unexpected evolution of hyper-multicellular clones. Virulence was measured using larvae of the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, an invertebrate model used to study microbial pathogenesis and virulence ( Pereira et al., 2018 ), including in S. cerevisiae ( Phadke et al., 2018 ). Using the phenotyping data and the PCA results as a guide, for each genetic background, we identified six hyper-multicellular clones and six non-multicellular clones ( Figure 5, Supplementary file 1a, b ). We attempted to identify evolved clones that excelled in all measured aggregative traits; therefore, not all were from the final time point, but all were from late in the experiment. In choosing the non-multicellular strains, clones were taken from a variety of time points, including the ancestor, control, and experimental populations at different time points. This allowed us to verify that it was the evolved hyper-multicellular phenotype and not just long-term growth in the evolution medium. Strains were grown in the medium in which they were evolved, then washed, adjusted for density, and injected into larvae. Larval survival and pupation were monitored for the next 7 days

. In 2022, the World Health Organization issued its first-ever report prioritizing 19 fungal pathogens for research and public health awareness ( World Health Organization, 2022 ) ; of these, 11 are known to live in the environment ( i. e. soil, wood, etc. ), including three in the highest priority group ( Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida auris, Aspergillus fumigatus ). In our experiment, it is unclear which trait was associated with increased virulence: plastic adherence, a different multicellular trait, or general hyper-multicellularity. Regardless of the specific trait causing increased virulence, the experiment demonstrated that selection for a dual-use trait in an environment that is entirely devoid of host organisms can still inadvertently lead to virulence and pathogenicity. The experiment also demonstrated the role that sex can have in increasing rates of adaptation in fungi. Whether or not increased virulence caused by adherence selection is a general result in fungal microbes remains to be seen. In bacteria, the results are mixed. In Burkholderia cenocepacia, plastic bead selection led to an increase in biofilm phenotypes and mutations previously associated with chronic infections ( Poltak and Cooper, 2011; Traverse et al., 2013 ). Yet, bead selection in P. aeruginosa led to a decrease in biofilm-related phenotypes. It also led to an increase in antibiotic resistance, thus mimicking changes seen in chronic infections ( Azimi et al., 2020 ). As humans continue to generate novel ecological niches at an unprecedented rate by encroaching on more habitats, using plastics unreservedly ( Iroegbu et al., 2021 ), and especially, as the global climate changes ( IPCC Core Writing Team, 2023 ), the potential for unintended selection grows ( Casadevall, 2020 )

Our results demonstrate that selection on one yeast trait can generate a correlated response in other traits— a common feature of organismal evolution ( Price and Langen, 1992 ) — but here, the correlated traits may have included those associated with virulence. In this experiment, favoring the ability to adhere to plastic, a surface that is common in industrial, medical, and domestic settings ( Geyer et al., 2017 ), led to a suite of aggregative phenotypes and increased virulence. The coincidental selection-accidental virulence hypothesis proposes that selection for survival in harsh conditions may lead to traits that predispose microbes to virulence. However, harsh environmental conditions can also favor traits that favor the collective, or multicellular phenotypes ( Tong et al., 2022 ), so it is perhaps not surprising that other forms of multicellularity increased throughout this experiment. Furthermore, in its long evolutionary history, S. cerevisiae has evolved the genetic capability to express multiple different multicellular phenotypes, most of which are induced in nutrient limiting conditions; the experiment presented here was performed in such conditions ( glucose limited medium ). Other experiments with yeast growing in nutrient limiting conditions have resulted in the unintended evolution of single aggregative behaviors ( Hope et al., 2017 ). In this light, the correlated phenotypic response in this experiment is not entirely unexpected. However, the evolution of multiple multicellular phenotypes in two independent genetic backgrounds was not anticipated. Furthermore, nutrient limiting conditions may have affected PSH in our experiment, but it was not the main driver of the other multicellular phenotypes; rather, it was adherence selection that led to the evolution of hyper-multicellularity

. Aside from serving as a model for genetics and cell biology, and being found in a myriad of ecological niches around the globe ( Peter et al., 2018 ), S. cerevisiae is also an opportunistic pathogen capable of infecting immunocompromised individuals, with reports of infections increasing ( Aucott et al., 1990; Muñoz et al., 2005; Llopis et al., 2014; Enache-Angoulvant and Hennequin, 2005; Hennequin et al., 2000; Pérez-Torrado and Querol, 2015 ). As such, it has been a model for fungal pathogenesis-related traits ( Clemons et al., 1994; Fraser et al., 2012; McCusker et al., 1994a; Phadke et al., 2018 ). Some environmentally derived strains are capable of adhering to surfaces and expressing associated aggregative phenotypes ( Verstrepen and Klis, 2006 ). These range from biofilms on solid and semi-solid agar, to pseudohyphal growth and agar invasion, to floating mats on liquid surfaces ( flors ). Of these multicellular phenotypes, only invasive and pseudohyphal growth have been linked to pathogenicity in S. cerevisiae ( McCusker et al., 1994a; Phadke et al., 2018; Palecek et al., 2002 ), although biofilm formation has been linked to pathogenicity in other fungi ( Fanning and Mitchell, 2012 ). Not all strains are capable of expressing these phenotypes. And while some strains express multiple multicellular traits ( Casalone et al., 2005; Zara et al.,2010 ), not all strains are equally virulent. In this study, hypermultic strains were significantly more virulent than nonmultic strains, indicating that adherence and multicellularity are linked to virulence in S. cerevis.
Researchers used a coarse-grained model, Mp, to study the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of proteins containing prion-like domains (PLDs) from six proteins: hnRNPA, TDP, F, US, ERS, RB14, and T1. The simulations revealed scaling laws that quantify the change in critical temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino sequence mutations. These laws are consistent with physicochemical properties of mutations and extend across the family, suggesting they can be used to predict changes in stability of PL condens. The study also examined the effects of arginine mutations on condens stability, revealing an inverse relationship between the fraction of arginines and critical temperatures. Polar amino acids emerged as subtle modulators of PL phase behavior. The scaling laws presented serve two purposes: to verify the generality of the molecular grammar governing phase across PL proteins and to quantify the extent of critical temperature change in response to amino sequence changes. The work suggests scaling can be used to predict phase behavior of protein families.

The study used residue-resolution coarse-grained models to map emergent properties of protein solutions to chemical make-up of individual biomolecules. The Mp model was used to compute and analyze temperature-density diagrams of a set of PL variants, revealing conserved laws that quantitatively predict change in critical temperatures as function of number and type amino mutations. The data was organized in a table illustrating effect of single mutations on critical temperatures as function of PL length. Interactions involving aromatic residues, π-π and cation-π, were dominant in stabilizing condens formed by PL. The largest decrease in critical temperature occurred when an aromatic was replaced by uncharged, non-aromatic residue. Scaling can reveal relationships between variables, such as composition and parameters, providing a theory to predict and interpret complex phenomena like phase separation.

The study employed systematic approach varying amino sequence of PL to determine phase changes with compositional perturbations. Three types of scaling laws were defined and tested, illustrating relationship between critical temperature changes and number amino mutations. The simplest law is a linear relationship between two quantities, Δc=S1X2X1X2 where Δc is variation in critical between mutated and unmodified sequence, X is amino, and NX2 is number of X mutated to X. SX quantifies variation in solution for mutation of X residue to X. The work presents a data-driven framework for PL behavior, revealing changes in critical temperatures as function of number and type amino sequence can be quantified by scaling, conserved across family. Addition of aromatic yields positive correlation mutation and temperature, consistent dominant role in PL separation. Protein dictates effects when aromatic mutated uncharged, non-aromatic acids.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Predicting an individual’s cognitive traits or clinical condition using brain signals is a central goal in modern neuroscience. This is commonly done using either structural aspects, such as structural connectivity or cortical thickness, or aggregated measures of brain activity that average over time. But these approaches are missing a central aspect of brain function: the unique ways in which an individual’s brain activity unfolds over time. One reason why these dynamic patterns are not usually considered is that they have to be described by complex, high-dimensional models; and it is unclear how best to use these models for prediction. We here propose an approach that describes dynamic functional connectivity and amplitude patterns using a Hidden Markov model ( HMM ) and combines it with the Fisher kernel, which can be used to predict individual traits. The Fisher kernel is constructed from the HMM in a mathematically principled manner, thereby preserving the structure of the underlying model. We show here, in fMRI data, that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach is accurate and reliable. We compare the Fisher kernel to other prediction methods, both time-varying and time-averaged functional connectivity-based models. Our approach leverages information about an individual’s time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction and has broad applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalised medicine.

   . We focus on models of brain dynamics that capture within-session changes in functional connectivity and amplitude from fMRI scans, in this case acquired during wakeful rest, and how the parameters from these models can be used to predict behavioural variables or traits. In particular, we use the Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ), which is a probabilistic generative model of time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity ( FC ) dynamics ( Vidaurre et al., 2017 ). HMMs have previously been shown to be able to predict certain complex subject traits, such as fluid intelligence, more accurately than structural or static ( time-averaged ) FC representations ( Vidaurre et al., 2021 ). We combine the HMM with the Fisher kernel, which allows for the efficient use of the entire set of parameters from the generative model. The Fisher kernel takes the complex relationships between the model parameters into account by preserving the structure of the underlying model ( here, the HMM; Jaakkola et al., 1999; Jaakkola and Haussler, 1998 ). Mathematically, the HMM parameters lie on a Riemannian manifold ( the structure ). This defines, for instance, the relation between parameters, such as: how changing one parameter, like the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another, would affect the fitting of other parameters, like the states’ FC. It also defines the relative importance of each parameter; for example, how a change of 0. 1 in the transition probabilities would not be the same as a change of 0. 1 in one edge of the states’ FC matrices. For empirical evaluation, we consider two criteria that are important in both scientific and practical applications. First, predictions should be as accurate as possible, that is the correlation between predicted and actual values should be high

In this work, we aimed to establish an approach that allows leveraging a rich description of the patterns in which brain activity unfolds over time to predict individual traits. We showed that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach accurately and reliably predicts traits from brain dynamics models trained on neuroimaging data. It preserves the structure of the underlying brain dynamics model, making it ideal for combining generative and predictive models. We compared the Fisher kernel to kernels which ignore the structure of the brain dynamics model ( ‘naïve’ kernels ), to a previously used method based on Kullback-Leibler divergence ( Vidaurre et al., 2021 ), and to methods based on time-averaged functional connectivity. The linear Fisher kernel had an overall higher prediction accuracy than all other time-varying methods and several time-averaged methods, though most comparisons were not statistically significant given the narrow margin for improvements. The linear Fisher kernel was also among the most reliable: It never produced excessive errors and was robust to changes in training sets. Like in the time-varying methods, working in Riemannian space also improved prediction for the time-averaged methods, indicating that respecting the geometry of the space that the predictors lie on is an important factor for predictive modelling in neuroscience. While we here focussed on fMRI, the method can also be applied to other modalities like MEG or EEG. It can also be straightforwardly implemented in any kernel-based prediction model or classifier, including kernel ridge regression, support vector machines ( SVM ), kernel fisher discriminant analysis ( k-FDA ), kernel logistic regression ( KLR ), or nonlinear PCA. Indeed, it can also be applied to other probabilistic generative models aside from the HMM, for example Dynamic network modes ( Gohil et al., 2022 )

. Second, predictions should be reliable, in the sense that a predictive model should never produce excessively large errors, and the outcome should be robust to reasonable variations in the data set, for example the choice of which subjects from the same population are included in the training set. The latter criterion is especially important if we want to be able to meaningfully interpret prediction errors, for example in assessing brain age ( Cole and Franke, 2017; Denissen et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2019 ). Despite this crucial role in interpreting model errors, reliability is not often considered in models predicting individual traits from neuroimaging features. In summary, we show that using the Fisher kernel approach, which preserves the mathematical structure of the underlying HMM, we can predict individual traits from patterns of brain dynamics accurately and reliably. We show that our approach significantly outperforms methods that do not take the mathematical structure of the model into account, as well as methods based on time-averaged FC that do not consider brain dynamics. For interpretation, we also investigate which aspects of the model drive the prediction accuracy, both in real data and in simulations. Bringing accuracy, reliability and interpretation together, this work opens possibilities for practical applications such as the development of biomarkers and the investigation of individual differences in cognitive traits.

. However, since the Fisher kernel defines individuals in reference to the group-level model, we showed in simulations that separating training and test subjects prior to fitting the HMM may result in biased kernels that overestimate dissimilarity of the test subjects. This is an important consideration as it may affect studies with small sample sizes and with heterogeneous training and test sets ( e. g. where a researcher may want to fit a model to healthy controls and subsequently test it on patients ). We here aimed to show the potential of the HMM-Fisher kernel approach to leverage information from patterns of brain dynamics to predict individual traits in an example fMRI dataset as well as simulated data. The fMRI dataset we used ( HCP 1200 Young Adult ) is a large sample taken from a healthy, young population, and it remains to be shown how the exhibited performance generalises to other datasets, for example other modalities such as EEG/MEG, clinical data, older populations, different data quality, or smaller sample sizes both in terms of the number of participants and the scanning duration. Additionally, we only tested our approach for the prediction of a specific set of demographic items and cognitive scores; it may be interesting to test the framework also on clinical variables, such as the presence of a disease or the response to pharmacological treatment. There is growing interest in combining different data types or modalities, such as structural, static, and dynamic measures, to predict phenotypes ( Engemann et al., 2020; Schouten et al., 2016 ). While directly combining the features from each modality can be problematic, modality-specific kernels, such as the Fisher kernel for time-varying amplitude and/or FC, can be easily combined using approaches such as stacking ( Breiman, 1996 ) or Multi Kernel Learning ( MKL; Gönen and Alpaydın, 2011 ). MKL can improve prediction accuracy of multimodal studies ( Vaghari et al

Observing a person’s behaviour over time is how we understand the individual’s personality, cognitive traits, or psychiatric condition. The same should apply at the brain level, where we may be able to gain crucial insights by observing the patterns in which brain activity unfolds over time, that is brain dynamics. One way of describing brain dynamics are state-space models, which allow capturing recurring patterns of activity and functional connectivity ( FC ) across the whole brain. However, although research into brain dynamics has recently gained traction ( Breakspear, 2017; Calhoun et al., 2014; Fox et al., 2005; Hutchison et al., 2013; Liégeois et al., 2017 ), it is still unclear how best to use this spatiotemporal level of description to characterise subject differences or predict individual traits from brain signals. One reason why brain dynamics are not usually considered in this context pertains to their representation: They are represented using models of varying complexity that are estimated from modalities such as functional MRI or MEG. Although there exists a variety of methods for estimating time-varying or dynamic FC ( Lurie et al., 2020 ), like the commonly used sliding-window approach, there is currently no widely accepted way of using them for prediction problems. This is because these models are usually parametrised by a high number of parameters with complex mathematical relationships between the parameters that reflect the underlying structure of the model. Here we propose an approach that combines the Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) with the Fisher kernel, which can be used to predict individual traits. The kernel is constructed from the H in a mathematically principled manner, thereby preserving the structure of the underlying model. We show in fMRI data that the H-Fisher approach is accurate and reliable. We compare the kernel to other methods both time-vary and time-aver functional-based models. Our approach leverages information about an’s time-vary amplitude and functional for prediction and has applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalised medicine.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) variants associated with Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) and Crohn’s disease lead to increased phosphorylation of its Rab substrates. While it has been recently shown that perturbations in cellular homeostasis including lysosomal damage can increase LRRK2 activity and localization to lysosomes, the molecular mechanisms by which LRRK2 activity is regulated have remained poorly defined. We performed a targeted siRNA screen to identify regulators of LRRK2 activity and identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of one of its substrates, Rab10. Using a combination of imaging and immunopurification methods to isolate lysosomes, we demonstrated that Rab12 is actively recruited to damaged lysosomes and leads to a local and LRRK2-dependent increase in Rab10 phosphorylation. PD-linked variants, including LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, lead to increased recruitment of LRRK2 to the lysosome and a local elevation in lysosomal levels of pT73 Rab10. Together, these data suggest a conserved mechanism by which Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates the recruitment of LRRK2 and phosphorylation of its Rab substrate ( s ) at the lysosome.

    Coding variants in LRRK2 can cause monogenic Parkinson’s disease ( PD ), and coding and non-coding variants in LRRK2 are associated with increased risk for developing sporadic PD and Crohn’s disease ( Blauwendraat et al., 2020; Hui et al., 2018; Kluss et al., 2019 ). The majority of pathogenic LRRK2 variants cluster within its Roc-COR ( Ras of complex proteins/C-terminal of Roc ) GTPase tandem domain or kinase domain and contribute to disease risk by ultimately increasing LRRK2’s kinase activity ( Alessi and Sammler, 2018; Kalogeropulou et al., 2022; Sheng et al., 2012 ). LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases, including Rab10 and Rab12. Excessive Rab phosphorylation can perturb interactions between Rabs and downstream effectors, which impairs various aspects of membrane trafficking including lysosomal function ( Pfeffer, 2018; Steger et al., 2017; Steger et al., 2016 ). LRRK2 localizes primarily to the cytosol in an inactive state, and higher-order oligomerization and membrane recruitment appear to be required for LRRK2 activation and Rab phosphorylation ( Berger et al., 2010; Biskup et al., 2006; Greggio et al., 2008; Schapansky et al., 2014 ). Recent work suggests that interactions between LRRK2 and its phosphorylated Rab substrates help maintain LRRK2 on membranes and result in a cooperative, feed-forward mechanism to promote additional Rab phosphorylation ( Vides et al., 2022 ). However, it is not clear what mechanisms promote the initial recruitment of LRRK2 to membranes to trigger Rab phosphorylation or whether increased LRRK2 membrane association is a common driver of the elevated LRRK2 activity observed in PD. Endolysosomal genes that modify PD risk and lysosomal damage can also increase LRRK2 activation and phosphorylation of its Rab substrates ( Bonet-Ponce et al., 2020; Eguchi et al., 2018; Herbst et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2018; Mir et al., 2018; Purlyte et al., 2018 )

. The PD-linked pathogenic LRRK2 variant R1441G, which lies outside of LRRK2’s kinase domain, and the VPS35 D620N variant have been shown in previous studies and confirmed here to increase LRRK2 activity ( Liu et al., 2018; Mir et al., 2018; Purlyte et al., 2018 ). Our results suggest that these variants may also promote LRRK2 activation by increasing Rab12-mediated LRRK2 localization to lysosomes, implying this may represent a general mechanism by which LRRK2 activity is increased by various genetic variants and environmental stressors associated with PD. We cannot rule out the possibility that additional mechanisms beyond increased proximity between LRRK2 and its Rab substrates may contribute to Rab10 phosphorylation following lysosomal damage, as the magnitude of change in Rab10 phosphorylation induced by LLOMe treatment was greater than the extent of LRRK2 recruitment to damaged lysosomes. Additional studies are warranted to determine how lysosomal membrane rupture triggers Rab12 recruitment, to identify other regulatory processes that may contribute to Rab phosphorylation upon lysosomal damage, and to better define how broadly such mechanisms are employed to drive LRRK2 activation in PD. As our work focused on the role of Rab12 in A549 cells, it will also be important to understand whether Rab12 similarly regulates LRRK2 activation and localization to damaged lysosomes in other cell types. Our findings provide key insight into the mechanism by which LRRK2 activity is increased in response to lysosomal damage by demonstrating that Rab12 regulates LRRK2 localization to ruptured lysosomes. While the purpose of LRRK2 recruitment and activation on lysosomes is poorly defined, several hypotheses have been proposed suggesting that LRRK2 activity may be upregulated as a compensatory response to restore lysosomal homeostasis following damage

Increased LRRK2 kinase activity is observed with pathogenic PD-linked variants and in sporadic PD patients, but many questions remain regarding the mechanisms by which LRRK2 activation is regulated basally and in response to endolysosomal stress associated with disease. We identify Rab12 as a novel regulator of LRRK2 activation and demonstrate that Rab12 plays a critical role in mediating LRRK2-dependent Rab phosphorylation in response to lysosomal damage. A recent CRISPR-based genome-wide screen for modifiers of Rab10 phosphorylation also identified RAB12 as a top hit, providing additional validation that Rab12 is a key regulator of LRRK2 activation ( Dhekne et al., 2023 ). Our data show that lysosomal membrane rupture promotes Rab12 localization to lysosomes. We propose a model in which Rab12 recruits LRRK2 to the lysosome and enhances its activity on lysosomal membranes by increasing LRRK2’s local concentration near Rab10 and potentially other Rab substrates ( Figure 4E ). Previous studies suggested that another LRRK2 substrate, Rab29, can regulate LRRK2’s kinase activity and showed that exogenously expressed Rab29 is capable of activating LRRK2 at the trans-Golgi or at additional membranes when artificially anchored there ( Purlyte et al., 2018; Gomez et al., 2019 ). However, these studies relied on overexpression of Rab29 to increase LRRK2 activity, and analyses of RAB29 KO cellular models or mice showed that RAB29 deletion minimally impacted LRRK2-dependent Rab10 phosphorylation ( Kalogeropulou et al., 2020 ). Here, we used endogenous expression conditions to demonstrate that Rab12, but not Rab29, regulates LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10 and that Rab12 regulates the localization and activation of LRRK2 on lysosomes upon lysosomal stress

. Rab10 phosphorylation was increased on lysosomes in response to LLOMe treatment while the levels of LRRK2 were not significantly impacted on lysosomes isolated from LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N KI cells, suggesting additional mechanisms beyond LRRK2 localization may also contribute to LRRK2 activation in response to lysosomal damage in these cells. Together, these results suggest that Rab12 regulates LRRK2 localization to lysosomes upon damage and that this may be a conserved mechanism also employed to contribute to LRRK2 activation in response to PD-linked variants.

. Previous studies have established that pathogenic PD-linked variants and lysosomal membrane disruption can lead to increased LRRK2 kinase activity ( Bonet-Ponce et al., 2020; Eguchi et al., 2018; Mir et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2021 ). We next explored whether Rab12 might mediate LRRK2 activity in the context of either a pathogenic variant in LRRK2 ( R1441G ) or VPS35 ( D620N ). Rab10 phosphorylation was significantly reduced with RAB12 knockdown in LRRK2 R1441G KI and VPS35 D620N KI A549 cells ( Figure 2G, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). Lysosomal membrane damage also increases LRRK2’s kinase activity, as treatment with L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester ( LLOMe ), a lysosomotropic agent that condenses into membranolytic polymers and ruptures the lysosomal membrane, has been shown to increase LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of its Rab substrates ( Bonet-Ponce et al., 2020; Eguchi et al.,2018; Herbst et al,202; Liu et al,2018; Mir et al,2018 Purte et al,2018 ). We found that LO treatment of LRR2 R144G and V35 DNI cells with LMe resulted in increased LRR2 phosphorylation of Rab10 ( Figure 3B ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: Understanding the cell cycle at the single-cell level is crucial for cellular biology and cancer research. While current methods using fluorescent markers have improved the study of adherent cells, non-adherent cells remain challenging. In this study, we addressed this gap by combining a specialized surface to enhance cell attachment, the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 sensor, an automated image analysis pipeline, and a custom machine learning algorithm. This approach enabled precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in non-adherent cells. This method was validated in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have unique cell cycle characteristics, and we tested the impact of cell cycle-modulating drugs on NB4 cells. Our cell cycle analysis system, which is also compatible with adherent cells, is fully automated and freely available, providing detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. This report presents a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive, automated cell cycle analysis in both adherent and non-adherent cells.

    In the last few years, efforts have been made to simplify the cell cycle assessment relying on FUCCI technology, resulting in the development and public availability of software tools and ImageJ plugins ( Roccio et al., 2013; Koh et al., 2017; Ghannoum et al., 2021; Taïeb et al., 2022 ). However, all these methods require human intervention at different points in the analysis workflow, such as the initial selection of cells for analysis ( Taïeb et al., 2022 ) or the manual correction of inaccurate tracks during the analysis ( Roccio et al., 2013; Koh et al., 2017; Ghannoum et al., 2021; Taïeb et al., 2022 ). In this report, we describe a complete protocol for the cell cycle analysis of adherent and non-adherent cells expressing the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 technology in a fully automated manner. The complete experimental workflow is explained in Box 1 and illustrated in Figure 5. It was applied to the analysis of the cell cycle phases of two different AML cell lines, NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have different durations. Hence, detecting this difference was a reliable initial verification strategy for the protocol’s efficiency. As a second quality check step, we decided to treat the relatively fast-cycling NB4 cells with suboptimal concentrations of three different CDK inhibitors ( palbociclib, PF-06873600, and ribociclib ). These CDK inhibitors have different inhibitory impact on various CDKs ( Freeman-Cook et al., 2021; Fassl et al., 2022 ). The effect of the three CDK inhibitors on the cell cycle duration of NB4 cells was evaluated. Up to about 400 cells in one single experimental condition were quantified, for up to 12 different conditions in a single experiment. This entire analysis process took approximately 2 hr of human involvement, for a total execution time that ranges from 12 to 48 hr, depending on dataset size, that is commissioned to a machine ( Figure 5 )

., 2020; Ogana et al., 2024 ). The seeding protocol could also certainly be extended to other types of live-cell imaging experiments, especially when the fluorescence intensity can be monitored for shorter durations, thereby circumventing the need for the addition of MC. Moreover, the image and data analysis pipelines can be easily applied to adherent cells, as shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. The presented image and data analysis workflows rely on two different software, Fiji and R, widely used by the imaging and data analysis community. The scripts were made publicly available, enabling customization to tailor the workflow according to specific requirements. This not only streamlines the cell cycle analysis of cells expressing the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 indicator, but also makes it accessible to researchers with basic programming knowledge. In conclusion, we confirm the efficiency of the optimized conditions in immobilizing the non-adherent cells for long time periods, without affecting their predicted response upon different environmental circumstances. The described work allows researchers in the field to analyze thousands of ( non- ) adherent cells per each experimental condition by using the image and data analysis pipelines to automatically perform image processing, cell tracking, filtering of incorrect tracks, and cell cycle phases identification and characterization.

Cell cycle dynamics coordinate cellular division and proliferation through regulating the different cell cycle phases. Dysregulation in these processes is a hallmark of malignancies such as human cancer, where aberrant activities in cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDKs ), cyclins, and CDK inhibitors often drive uncontrolled proliferation. Consequently, targeting cell cycle components has emerged as a pivotal therapeutic strategy, especially crucial in preclinical drug evaluation ( Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009; Khan and Wang, 2022 ). Traditional methods for assessing cell cycle dynamics have been largely dependent on the quantification of DNA content through flow or image cytometry, providing a static snapshot of cell populations in various cycle phases ( Furia et al., 2013; Ligasová et al., 2023 ). Although valuable, these techniques fall short in capturing intra-population variability and require additional protein markers for precise phase determination ( Ligasová et al., 2023; Rieger, 2022 ). Methods utilizing cells expressing fluorescently labeled reporters and time-lapse microscopy can discriminate cell cycle phases at the level of individual cells, thereby offering valuable insights into the variability of cell cycle and cell cycle phase durations within the overall cell population ( Chao et al., 2019; Hiratsuka and Komatsu, 2019 ). Advanced imaging methods, such as time-lapse microscopy coupled with fluorescently tagged reporters, have shown promise in detailing cell cycle dynamics at the single-cell level. Technologies like the Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator ( FUCCI ) have been employed for this, effectively demarcating cell cycle phases through color-coding ( Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2017 )

., 2017 ). FUCCI ( CA ) 2 express the hCdt1 ( 1/100 ) fused to mCherry fluorescent protein and hGem ( 1/110 ) fused to mVenus, generating a clear and distinct tricolor demarcation, separating G1 ( red ), S ( green ), and G2/M phases ( yellow ) ( Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2017 ). This dynamic insight is particularly crucial in the context of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ), where chromosomal translocations generate fusion genes that disrupt cellular differentiation programs and drive proliferation ( Alcalay et al., 2001 ). The described experimental setup utilizes nanostructured titanium oxide-coated multiwell plates relying on the technology used in the commercially available Smart BioSurface ( SBS ) slides ( Krol et al., 2021 ). Such technology should hypothetically enable us to immobilize non-adherent cells for extended imaging durations. To overcome the limitations of manual data analysis, we introduce an automated image analysis pipeline for time-lapse videos of AML cell lines, exploiting a FUCCI-based probe for visualization. Our data analysis approach combines custom image processing, TrackMate-based cell tracking, and machine learning-based track filtering, thereby automating the entire data analysis workflow. In summary, we present a comprehensive, experimental protocol for cell cycle analysis in adherent and non-adherent cells ( summarized in Box 1 ). The approach leverages routine imaging technologies and advanced data analyses, enhancing the precision and efficiency of drug screening protocols in oncological research.

. It should be taken into consideration that the manual correction of incorrect tracks takes approximately 2 hr per field of view ( FOV ). Hence, in the reported experiments of this study, the analysis of a single well would take about 40–50 hr of manual work. This amount of time would make such analysis unfeasible. Not only the suggested protocol makes these experiments doable, but also the experimental set-up can be scaled up according to the experimental needs. We successfully emphasized alterations of few hours in the duration of cell cycle phases when NB4 cells were subjected to exceedingly low concentrations of inhibitors. Moreover, the set-up pipeline makes possible the quantification of potentially thousands of cells in an automated fashion relying on the crucial contribution of a machine learning algorithm. Various approaches have been documented for imaging non-adherent cells. These range from creating custom supports to confine cell movement within a restricted region enabling extended imaging periods of up to 40 hr ( Day et al., 2009 ), to partially immobilizing cells using substances like gelatin ( Ritter, 2020 ) or low-melting-point agarose ( Strong and Daniels, 2017 ). The capability to track non-adherent cells for up to 72 hr ( almost equivalent to three complete cell cycles in NB4 cells ) was achieved by employing SBS-coated glass in combination with the addition of MC to the culture medium. MC was necessary to limit the movement of single cells or cell clusters after more than 24 hr of observation ( Videos 1 and 5 ). We deduce that this seeding protocol has the potential to be effectively employed with various non-adherent cell types. This is based on the principle that cell adhesion on SBS is facilitated by the nanostructure’s ability to engage with integrins ( Schulte et al., 2016 ), which are widely expressed in many cell types. The protocol can also be applied to adherent cells, as shown in Figure 3— supplement 1. The image and data analysis pipelines are compatible with Fiji and R, widely used in the imaging and data analysis community. The scripts are publicly available for customization to tailor the workflow to specific requirements. This not only streamlines the cycle analysis of cells expressing FU ( CA 2 ) but also makes it accessible to researchers with basic programming knowledge. In conclusion, we confirm the efficiency of immobilizing non-ad cells for long periods without affecting their response to environmental changes. The protocol allows researchers to analyze thousands of non-adherent cells per condition using the image and data pipelines to automatically process images, track cells, filter incorrect tracks, and identify cycle phases and characterize.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The diversity of cognitive skills across primates remains both a fascinating and a controversial issue. Recent comparative studies provided conflicting results regarding the contribution of social vs ecological constraints to the evolution of cognition. Here, we used an interdisciplinary approach combining comparative cognitive neurosciences and behavioral ecology. Using brain imaging data from 16 primate species, we measured the size of two prefrontal brain regions, the frontal pole ( FP ) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ), respectively, involved in metacognition and working memory, and examined their relation to a combination of socio-ecological variables. The size of these prefrontal regions, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by three variables: body mass, daily traveled distance ( an index of ecological constraints ), and population density ( an index of social constraints ). The strong influence of ecological constraints on FP and DLPFC volumes suggests that both metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates. Interestingly, FP volume was much more sensitive to social constraints than DLPFC volume, in line with laboratory studies showing an implication of FP in complex social interactions. Thus, our data highlights the relative weight of social vs ecological constraints on the evolution of specific prefrontal brain regions and their associated cognitive operations in primates.

   . We therefore used several procedures to evaluate the specificity of the effects of socio-ecological factors on FP and DLPFC. First, we compared the influence of socio-ecological variables not only on FP and DLPFC but also on the whole brain. Second, we included the whole brain volume as a covariate along with the socio-ecological variables to account for FP and DLPFC volumes. Altogether, these procedures provide a reliable indication of the specificity of the influence of socio-ecological variables on the FP and DLPFC volumes, used as proxies for inter-species differences in metacognitive and working memory skills, respectively. used as proxies for inter-species differences in metacognitive and working memory skills. Thus, we could evaluate the strength of the relation between specific regions of the prefrontal cortex and specific socio-ecological variables across species, as observed in the wild, thereby complementing laboratory studies and bridging the gap between cognitive neurosciences, behavioral ecology, and primate evolution.

. Rather, we confirm intuitions based on laboratory studies that the FP, through its role in metacognition, belongs to both sets of brain regions defined as the social brain and the ecological brain, respectively. Further work would be needed to capture the metacognitive processes underlying social and foraging processes in the wild, as well as their interactions. The size of the DLPFC, which we used as a proxy for working memory and planning skills, showed a significant relation with daily traveled distance ( proxy for foraging complexity ), and to a lesser extent with population density ( proxy for social complexity ). This suggests that the cognitive functions at play in the DLPFC, i. e., working memory and planning, are critical for foraging in primates, especially when they need to travel long distances, and presumably have to deal with more complex navigation strategies. This is clearly in line with the global idea of the ecological brain hypothesis, but here we provide a critical insight into the specific neuro-cognitive operations associated with foraging strategies. The weaker influence of population density, a marker of social complexity, might be surprising at first sight, because a priori working memory and planning could also be strongly involved in complex social interactions ( Garcia et al., 2021 ). But it is in line with laboratory data showing that social interactions seem to rely much more upon rostro-medial prefrontal regions compared to DLPFC ( Fleming and Dolan, 2012; Frith, 2007; Sallet et al., 2011; Testard et al., 2022 ). In other words, this work confirms the specificity of the ‘social brain’ as defined in laboratory conditions as a set of structures specifically involved in social interactions ( Frith, 2007; Rushworth et al., 2013 )

. Thus, it remains challenging to bridge the gap between ( 1 ) laboratory studies relating brain regions to elementary cognitive operations in individual species and ( 2 ) studies relating brain regions to socio-ecological challenges through an evolutionary scenario ( i. e. across numerous species ). In order to bridge this gap, we designed this study to derive and test predictions where a set of well-identified elementary cognitive operations and their associated brain regions ( as studied in laboratory conditions ) could be involved in more natural functions ( as assessed in wild animals living in their natural environments ). We focused on two well-known cognitive operations, both considered as executive functions, and involving distinct regions of the prefrontal cortex: metacognition, which involves the frontal pole ( FP ), and working memory, which involves the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ), as demonstrated by extensive work in humans and macaques ( Fuster, 2008; Mansouri et al., 2017; Passingham et al., 2012 ). Based on the literature, we hypothesized that FP and metacognition would be associated both with social interactions ( by supporting theory of mind, i. e. the ability of an individual to conceptualize others’ states of mind ) and with foraging ( by enabling complex planning ) ( Devaine et al., 2017; Fleming and Dolan, 2012; Frith, 2007; Mansouri et al., 2017 ). For example, group hunting, which involves both social and foraging functions, only occurs in a few primate species where metacognition is thought to be particularly developed ( Boesch, 1994; Conard et al., 2020; Garcia et al., 2021; Schaik, 2016 ). Concerning the DLPFC, given its very clear implication in working memory and planning, we speculated that it would be critically involved in foraging

., 2013 ). Critically, again, social and ecological functions are tightly intermingled in primates’ natural environment and more specific studies would be needed to clarify how DLPFC-related functions such as working memory are involved in natural conditions, when animals need to face both ecological and social challenges. This new set of results can be integrated in the general framework of the primate mosaic brain evolution, i. e., the different distinct structures varying in size both within and between species, and reflecting selection for cognitive skills. In line with recently published papers ( DeCasien et al., 2022; Smaers et al., 2021; van Schaik et al., 2021 ), we argue that the relation between ecology, neurobiology, and cognition can be better captured with more specific brain measures, and more specific cognitive operations, than by using the cruder measure of brain size. We believe that comparisons between brain regions have the potential to identify which patterns of brain region evolution can provide insights into the evolution of cognition. Our new set of results are in agreement with a previous study we conducted on another brain region, the VMPFC, critically involved in value-based decision-making ( Louail et al., 2019 ). This study was conducted on 29 brain scans from only five species, such that we could not use a PGLS and instead included phylogenetic distance as a co-regressor, along social and ecological variables. As we did here, we also identified the combination of socio-ecological variables that best predicted neuro-anatomical variability across species. Interestingly, the pattern reported for the whole brain was similar to that of the current study, and the weight of the ecological variable ( daily traveled distance ) was one order of magnitude greater than the influence of the social variable ( group size ). As it was the case here, VMPFC and whole brain volumes were strongly correlated ( r=0

. Its potential relation with social interactions, however, was less clear: on one hand, DLPFC is rarely associated with social interactions in laboratory studies ( Frith, 2007; Fuster, 2008; Passingham et al., 2012; Sallet et al., 2013 ). But, on the other hand, working memory and planning could readily be involved in complex social interactions in more natural conditions. To evaluate the relevance of laboratory-based neuro-cognitive concepts for understanding which cognitive operations could be mobilized to overcome specific socio-ecological challenges in the wild and their variability across species, we addressed the following central question: to what extent does the functional mapping between brain regions and specific executive functions in laboratory conditions relate to variability in socio-ecological variables at the interspecific level? For this purpose, it is necessary to go beyond the handful of species usually studied in well-controlled laboratory conditions, not only to evaluate the reliability of the relations between neuro-anatomical measures and socio-ecological factors across primates, but also to quantify the contribution of phylogeny. To address this question, we measured the volume of the two prefrontal regions of interest ( FP and DLPFC ) in 16 primate species and evaluated the influence of key socio-ecological factors on the size of these regions. Based on the known positive relation between the size of a given brain region ( or the number of corresponding neurons ) and the relative importance of its associated function, both within and across species, we assume that the size of each brain region can be used as a proxy for the relative importance of the associated cognitive operation, i. e. FP for metacognition and DFC for working memory.

    Title: 
    Abstract: An increase in mechanical loading, such as that which occurs during resistance exercise, induces radial growth of muscle fibers ( i. e. an increase in cross-sectional area ). Muscle fibers are largely composed of myofibrils, but whether radial growth is mediated by an increase in the size of the myofibrils ( i. e. myofibril hypertrophy ) and/or the number of myofibrils ( i. e. myofibrillogenesis ) is not known. Electron microscopy ( EM ) can provide images with the level of resolution that is needed to address this question, but the acquisition and subsequent analysis of EM images is a time- and cost-intensive process. To overcome this, we developed a novel method for visualizing myofibrils with a standard fluorescence microscope ( fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution [FIM-ID] ). Images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast, and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines for automated measurements of myofibril size and number. After extensively validating the automated measurements, we used both mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading to discover that the radial growth of muscle fibers is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis. Collectively, the outcomes of this study offer insight into a fundamentally important topic in the field of muscle growth and provide future investigators with a time- and cost-effective means to study it.

   . Importantly, during CellProfiler processing, objects in the sham and MOV samples were filtered from analysis at a very similar rate ( 44% vs 46%, respectively ), and as such, the differences between the groups could not be explained by overt differences in the morphological properties of the myofibrils. Thus, the collective results of these analyses indicate that the MOV-induced increase in fiber CSA could be attributed to both myofibril hypertrophy and myofibrillogenesis, with the most robust and consistent effect occurring at the level of myofibrillogenesis. To further address whether the radial growth of muscle fibers that occurs in response to an increase in mechanical loading is mediated by myofibril hypertrophy and/or myofibrillogenesis, we examined vastus lateralis muscle biopsies from humans that were collected before ( Pre ) and after ( Post ) they had performed 7 weeks of progressive RE ( Figure 6A ). As detailed in the Materials and methods, the samples were processed for FIM-ID with a step that allowed for the identification of SERCA1 vs. SERCA2 positive fibers ( i. e. Type II vs. Type I fibers, respectively ) ( Figure 6B ). As shown in Figure 6C, the outcomes revealed that RE led to an 18% increase in the CSA of SERCA1 positive fibers but did not significantly alter the CSA of SERCA2 positive fibers. Similar results were also observed when the SERCA1 and SERCA2 positive fibers were examined for changes in the area per fiber that was occupied by the myofibrils, as well as the area per fiber that was occupied by the intermyofibrillar components ( Figure 6D–E ). Specifically, SERCA1 positive fibers revealed an 18% and 17% increase in these values, respectively, while no significant differences were observed in SERCA2 positive fibers

. Hence, to further test the validity of our method, we directly compared our automated FIM-ID measurements of myofibril CSA with manual EM-based measurements. Specifically, we performed an experiment with four mice in which one plantaris muscle from each mouse was subjected to FIM-ID, and the other was processed for EM-based imaging. With FIM-ID it was determined that all fibers in the plantaris muscles were SERCA1 positive, but during the EM imaging it became apparent that these SERCA1 positive fibers consisted of two clearly discernable fiber types. One type was generally large in CSA and possessed very few intermyofibrillar mitochondria, and we referred to these fibers as glycolytic ( Gly ) ( Figure 4A ). The other type was generally small in CSA and highly enriched with intermyofibrillar mitochondria, and we referred to these fibers as oxidative ( Ox ) ( Figure 4A ). The classification of the two fiber types was important because previous studies have shown that the morphological arrangement of myofibrils in different fiber types can be quite distinct. For instance, previous studies have shown that myofibrils in fibers that are rich in mitochondria typically have a ‘felderstruktur’ appearance ( i. e. field structure ) whereas myofibrils in fibers that lack extensive mitochondria present with a ‘fibrillenstruktur’ appearance ( i. e. fibril structure ) ( Kruger and Gunther, 1955; Shear and Goldspink, 1971; Cheng and Breinin, 1965; Durston, 1974 ). Accordingly, our experimental design was modified so that FIM-ID and EM-based measurements of myofibril CSA could be directly compared in the Ox and Gly fiber types. To begin our comparisons, the average CSA of the myofibrils in the EM images of randomly selected Ox and Gly fibers was manually assessed as detailed in the Materials and methods

. e. myofibrillogenesis ) ( Figures 5–6 ). Moreover, each of these fiber types revealed a significant positive correlation between the magnitude of radial growth and the magnitude of myofibrillogenesis ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ). These points, when coupled with the other data presented in Figures 5 and 6, indicate that radial growth of the muscle fibers was largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis. Importantly, this conclusion was upheld in two very distinct models of increased mechanical loading ( i. e. chronic MOV in mice and progressive RE in humans ). Thus, it appears that the induction of myofibrillogenesis is a conserved component of the radial growth response. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that an increase in mechanical loading can induce myofibrillogenesis. Moreover, the results of this study indicate that myofibrillogenesis is the major driver of the radial growth response. Given these conclusions, one is faced with the question of how an increase in mechanical loading induces myofibrillogenesis. As mentioned several times, one possibility is that the induction of myofibrillogenesis is mediated by hypertrophy and subsequent splitting of the pre-existing myofibrils ( i. e. the myofibril splitting model ) ( Goldspink, 1970; Goldspink, 1971; Patterson and Goldspink, 1976; Goldspink, 1983 ). However, numerous studies have also described a different type of myofibrillogenesis that involves the de novo formation of myofibrils ( Wang et al., 2022; Fenix et al., 2018; Rhee et al., 1994; Sanger et al., 2002 ). Specifically, with de novo myofibrillogenesis, it is thought that new myofibrils are derived from nascent proteins and that these nascent proteins are assembled into new myofibrils via a three-step sequence of events ( for more details, please refer to Wang et al., 2022; Fenix et al., 2018 )

., 2022; Fenix et al., 2018 ). Importantly, the concepts of de novo myofibrillogenesis have largely been studied within the context of myogenesis ( i. e. during the early stages of differentiation, embryonic development, etc. ), but whether de novo myofibrillogenesis can be induced in adult skeletal muscle remains largely unexplored. In our opinion, the concepts of myofibril splitting and de novo myofibrillogenesis are very intriguing, and we consider both models to be worthy of further investigation. In summary, the outcomes of this study have revealed that the induction of myofibrillogenesis plays a major role in the mechanically induced growth of skeletal muscle. The mechanisms via which an increase in mechanical loading induces myofibrillogenesis are not known, but the groundwork for two different models has already been established. Studies aimed at testing the validity of these models should lead to important advancements in the field, and with the advent of FIM-ID, such studies can now be performed in a time- and cost-effective manner.

In this study, we developed FIM-ID as a means for visualizing myofibrils with a fluorescence microscope. As illustrated throughout the study, the images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast, and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines that can perform automated measurements of myofibril size and myofibril number. Importantly, these pipelines were developed in a free open-source program ( CellProfiler ), and our manuscript includes copies of the pipelines along with instructions and test images so that prospective users can easily employ them ( see Source code 1 ). Moreover, the bulk of the FIM-ID workflow utilizes common lab instruments, and essentially anyone who has access to a standard cryostat and a fluorescent microscope with a motorized Z-stage can perform it. Indeed, for first-time users, we suspect that the most complicated part of the workflow will be the implementation of image deconvolution. Fortunately, deconvolution modules are available in many software packages ( e. g. ImageJ, Fiji ) that can be used to deconvolve images, and we provide a tutorial on how to do so in the Materials and methods.

    Title: 
    Abstract: SNAP25 is one of three neuronal SNAREs driving synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We studied three mutations in SNAP25 that cause epileptic encephalopathy: V48F, and D166Y in the synaptotagmin-1 ( Syt1 ) -binding interface, and I67N, which destabilizes the SNARE complex. All three mutations reduced Syt1-dependent vesicle docking to SNARE-carrying liposomes and Ca2+-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and when expressed in mouse hippocampal neurons. The V48F and D166Y mutants ( with potency D166Y > V48F ) led to reduced readily releasable pool ( RRP ) size, due to increased spontaneous ( miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Current, mEPSC ) release and decreased priming rates. These mutations lowered the energy barrier for fusion and increased the release probability, which are gain-of-function features not found in Syt1 knockout ( KO ) neurons; normalized mEPSC release rates were higher ( potency D166Y > V48F ) than in the Syt1 KO. These mutations ( potency D166Y > V48F ) increased spontaneous association to partner SNAREs, resulting in unregulated membrane fusion. In contrast, the I67N mutant decreased mEPSC frequency and evoked EPSC amplitudes due to an increase in the height of the energy barrier for fusion, whereas the RRP size was unaffected. This could be partly compensated by positive charges lowering the energy barrier. Overall, pathogenic mutations in SNAP25 cause complex changes in the energy landscape for priming and fusion.

   . 5, but not in the RRPev. SNAP25 disease missense mutations change the function of the protein without compromising its expression, leading to dominant negative or neomorphic mutations. Missense mutations in the primary SNARE:Syt1 interface ( V48F and D166Y ) result in a complex phenotype characterized by loss-of-function in the priming step and gain-of-function in the fusion step. Missense mutation in the SNARE bundle ( I67N ) leads to an increased amplitude of the energy barrier for fusion. In addition, disease mutations display inefficient rescue of neuronal survival. Overall, SNAP25 encephalopathy caused by single missense point mutations presents with interdependent functional deficits, which must be overcome for successful treatment.

. At the same time, the mutants act as loss-of-function in upstream reactions, through effects on priming. The I67N is a classical dominant-negative mutation, which increases the energy barrier for fusion, but does not change the size of the RRP if probed by a sufficiently high concentration of sucrose, nor does the I67N change the electrostatics of triggering itself. Thus, for V48F and D166Y, loss-of-function and gain-of-function features combine to change the energy landscape for vesicle priming and fusion in a complex way. These findings have consequences for our understanding of the simultaneous role of the primary SNARE:Syt1 interface in vesicle priming and release clamping. It further demonstrates the challenge faced by finding mechanism-based treatments of these disorders in the presence of multiple effects caused by single-point mutations.

., 2018 ). Expression of these mutants in neurons demonstrated reduced evoked release, in some cases an increase in spontaneous release, and a dominant-negative phenotype when co-expressed with wildtype ( WT ) protein ( Bradberry et al., 2020 ). The molecular mechanism was identified as a decrease in Ca2+-dependent lipid binding ( Bradberry et al., 2020 ). In SNAP25, disease-causing mutations are found within the SNARE domains ( Hamdan et al., 2017; Klöckner et al., 2021; Rohena et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2014 ). Alten et al., 2021 studied a selection of SNAP25 mutants, and found no changes in expression levels, but changes in both spontaneous and evoked release. Specifically, mutations in the primary Syt1:SNARE interface ( Zhou et al., 2015 ) caused an increase in spontaneous release rates, and a decrease in evoked release amplitudes. Conversely, C-terminal mutations in the so-called ‘layer residues’, whose side chains point to the center of the SNARE complex and are involved in SNAREpin zippering ( Sutton et al., 1998 ), led to a decrease in both evoked and spontaneous release ( Alten et al., 2021 ). This is expected because the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex is required for both types of release ( Weber et al., 2010 ). Alten et al., 2021 described striking phenotypes for most SNAP25 mutations tested, but the molecular reason for these phenotypes remains incompletely understood, and a few findings were surprising. For instance, Alten et al. reported that the V48F and D166Y mutants supported an unchanged readily releasable pool ( RRP ) of vesicles. The RRP is the pool of vesicles available for immediate release upon invasion of the presynapse by the action potential, and it is often assessed by applying a hyperosmotic solution ( often 0. 5 M sucrose ), which causes primed vesicles to fuse ( Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996 )

., 2016 ) and Syt1 ( Zhou et al., 2015 ). Accordingly, these phenotypes are similar to Syt1 KO, but the effect of V48F and D166Y on total evoked charge was milder than in the Syt1 KO. The preserved overall charge of evoked release in V48F and mild reduction in D166Y might point to a compensatory gain-of-function aspect to these mutations, in addition to the impaired Syt1 interaction. The role of Syt1 and Syt1:SNARE interactions in vesicle priming has been controversially discussed. The RRP is often assessed by applying a pulse of hypertonic solution to the neurons, usually 0. 5 M sucrose ( Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996; Schotten et al., 2015 ). However, in some experiments this did not lead to a change in RRP size in the absence of Syt1 ( Bacaj et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2009 ), whereas experiments both from our laboratories and others showed a decrease in RRP in the absence of Syt1 ( Bouazza-Arostegui et al., 2022; Chang et al., 2018; Courtney et al., 2019; Huson et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2009; Ruiter et al., 2019 ). The reason for this discrepancy is likely partly technical and has to do with how fast sucrose can be applied to the dendritic tree ( see also Discussion ). Using neurons growing on small autaptic islands makes it possible to apply sucrose to the entire dendritic tree ( which is confined to the 30–50 µm island ) within tens of milliseconds, which is fast enough to dissect the RRP with a short ( few s ) sucrose application. We set out to understand whether the V48F and D166Y mutants changed the size of the RRP. Application of 0. 5 M sucrose to neurons with the V48F or D166Y mutation resulted in estimates of the RRP ( denoted RRP0. 5 ) that were significantly reduced compared to the WT condition ( Figure 5A, C, F, H ). Also the co-expressed condition displayed significantly reduced RRP0. 5

. Previously, we concluded that the primary Syt1:SNARE interface is involved in vesicle priming ( Schupp et al., 2016 ), which agrees with the suggestion that Syt1 binds to the SNAREs before Ca2+ arrival ( Zhou et al., 2015 ). Conversely, Alten et al. reported a smaller RRP for the I67N mutant, but the I67 residue is present in the internal of layer +4, which we expected to affect final SNARE complex zippering causing membrane fusion rather than priming ( Sørensen et al., 2006; Weber et al., 2010 ). These discrepancies might be explained by the fact that Alten et al. used mixed cultures and mainly studied GABAergic transmission. Glutamatergic transmission is hard to investigate in mixed cultures due to reverberating activity, but it can be studied using autaptic neurons, which was our approach ( Schupp et al., 2016; Weber et al., 2010 ). Thus, there is a need to further study these disease mutations in glutamatergic neurons. Another open question is whether the phenotype of the mutants in the primary interface ( V48F and D166Y ) is explainable solely by the loss of Syt1 binding, or whether other features of these mutations add to, or detract from, the phenotype. Here, we reexamined three SNAP25 disease mutations using glutamatergic autaptic neurons: I67N, V48F, and D166Y. We confirmed the increase in spontaneous release rate and decrease in evoked release by V48F and D166Y reported previously ( Alten et al., 202 ). The I67 mutant showed a decrease in evoked amplitudes but not in R size of the readily releasable pool ( RRP ). The R is the pool of vesicles available for immediate release upon invasion of the synapse by the action potential and is often assessed by applying a hyperosotic solution ( 0.5 M sucrose ) which causes primed vesicles to fuse ( Rosenmund and Stevens,1996; Schotten et al,201 ). We found that V48 and D166 reduced the R size of the readily releasable pool ( R ) and increased spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic current ( mEPSC ) release and decreased priming rates. These mutations lowered the energy barrier for fusion and increased the release probability which are gain-of-function not found in Sy1 ( KO ) neurons normalized EP release rates were higher ( D166 > V48 ) in Sy1 KO. These mutations ( D >166 V48 ) increased association partner SNAREs resulting in unregulated fusion. In contrast, the I67 mutant decreased EP frequency and evoked EP amplitudes due an increase in the height of the energy for fusion whereas R size was unaffected. This could be partly compensated by lowering the energy. Overall pathogenic mutations in SNAP cause changes the landscape for priming and fusion

**Title:** Understanding the Role of SNAP25 Mutations in Synaptic Vesicle Exocytosis and Epileptic Encephalopathy

**Summary:**

Synaptic vesicle exocytosis, the process by which neurons release neurotransmitters are released into the synapse, is crucial for proper brain function. SNAP25 is a key protein involved in this process. Researchers studied three mutations in SNAP that cause epileptic encephalopathy: V48, D166 in the synotagmin-1 (Sy1) binding interface, and I67, which destabilizes the SNARE complex. These mutations reduced Sy1-dependent vesicle docking to SN-carry liposomes and Ca2-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and when expressed in mouse hippocampal neurons. V48 and D166 mutants led to reduced readily releable pool (RP) size, due to increased spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEP) release and decreased priming rates. These mutations lowered the energy for fusion and increased release, gain-of features not found in Sy1 knockout (KO) neurons. In contrast, I67 decreased EP frequency and evoked EP amplitudes due to increased energy for fusion, whereas RP size was unaffected.

**Key Findings:**

* SNAP disease mutations change protein function without compromising expression, leading to dominant or negative mutations
* Missense mutations in primary SNARE:Sy1 interface (48 and 166) result in loss-function in priming and gain-function fusion
* Miss mutation in SN bundle (67) increases energy for fusion
* disease display inefficient neuronal survival
* mutants act loss-function in upstream, effects on priming
* I67 is dominant-negative, increasing energy for fusion, but not changing RP size or electrostatic triggering

**Conclusion:**

SNAP25 encephal caused by single-point mutations presents interdependent deficits, which must be overcome for treatment. The study highlights the challenge of finding mechanism-based treatments in presence of multiple effects caused by single mutations.
Researchers analyzed data from 30 countries and found that disciplines with a higher proportion of women have lower research quality and funding rates compared to those with a higher proportion of men. This applies to both men and women, and is consistent across various metrics such as research outputs and bibliometric measures. The study builds on previous findings that women's work is undervalued, regardless of who performs it. The researchers found that male-dominated disciplines have higher funding rates and quality scores than female-dominated disciplines. However, when accounting for gender bias, the picture is less clear, suggesting that women in minority groups have higher scores than men with the same number of outputs. A possible explanation is that women do lower quality research, but findings do not support this. In male-dominated fields like physics, women's scores are similar to men's, and women have higher funding rates in some disciplines like ARC. This suggests men and women have similar quality after accounting for discipline. Both men and women in female-dominated disciplines have fewer outputs on average, possibly due to cultural norms or women being attracted to lower-publishing disciplines. Funding datasets like ARC, CI, and E, and pre-allocations could explain some findings, but would be towards male-dominated. The ARC's process does not overtly preallocate by discipline, with similar success rates across five broad fields. If women in minority have same publications as majority, they receive higher scores, but women in majority have lower scores. More men work in male-dominated fields than women, benefiting from higher evaluations. There are fewer women in STEM and more use qualitative research, with interactions between individual and discipline characteristics. Expectations of brilliance relate to lower women entering and funding rates. Women publish less, receive citations, and have lower h-indices, fewer first-authorships, and acknowledgements, and credit for innovations, and awards. Research suggests women react differently to prestige, but our shows correlation between proportion of women and lower quality and funding. We cannot support or reject job choice explanation, but suggest bias against female-dominated disciplines. Perceptions of 'brill' in male and 'hard' in female disciplines could produce bias, or research in female disciplines is lower quality, but findings do not show this.

    Title: 
    Abstract: One of the goals of synthetic biology is to enable the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs. Such circuits bridge the properties of electronic and natural circuits, processing information in a predictable manner within living cells. Genome editing is a potentially powerful component of synthetic molecular circuits, whether for modulating the expression of a target gene or for stably recording information to genomic DNA. However, programming molecular events such as protein-protein interactions or induced proximity as triggers for genome editing remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a strategy termed ‘P3 editing’, which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA. By engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, we demonstrate that various known protein-protein interactions, as well as the chemically induced dimerization of protein domains, can be used to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells. Additionally, we explore how P3 editing can incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, potentially allowing specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit. Our strategy enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells.

   . Modifications of the Cas9 protein have facilitated more precise genome editing ( e. g. base editing, prime editing ) or epigenetic control of gene expression ( e. g. CRISPRa, CRIPSRi ) ( Gilbert et al., 2014; Gilbert et al., 2013 ). A critical feature of CRISPR-based genome editing is its straightforward programmability, as the CRISPR guide RNA ( gRNA ) molecule alone can specifically program the genomic location to be edited. Prime editing ( Anzalone et al., 2019 ) extends this advantage via a prime editing guide RNA ( pegRNA ) that programs both the target locus and editing outcome. However, to fully realize CRISPR’s potential in synthetic molecular circuits, we also require machinery that transduces molecular events into genome editing events. For example, the ENGRAM method transduces the output of transcriptional reporters into signal-specific prime editing events ( Chen et al., 2024 ). However, it remains unclear how to develop sensors that trigger specific genome editing outcomes for a broader range of event classes ( e. g. protein-protein interactions, exposure to small molecules, gene expression, etc. ). RNA engineering is a promising way to construct molecular sensors. RNA aptamers have been developed to sense exposure to small molecules, both outside and inside living cells ( Dykstra et al., 2022 ). Similar approaches have been taken to engineer the CRISPR-gRNA to sense small molecules ( Iwasaki et al., 2020; Kundert et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2017 ) or the presence of specific RNA molecules via RNA-RNA base-pair interactions ( Pelea et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023 ). The main advantage of engineering the CRISPR-gRNA instead of protein components is the possibility of multiplexing, i. e., linking each molecular sensor to a different genome editing target site and/or editing outcome

. We demonstrate that P3 editing can be used in concert with both base editing and prime editing, converting known protein-protein interactions into genome editing events in human cells. Finally, we explore whether P3 editing can be coupled to ADAR-based RNA sensors to control genome editing based on RNA expression, potentially expanding the range of inputs that can be used to drive signal-specific editing in synthetic molecular circuits.

. Finally, molecular sensors can be used to control cellular function as components of synthetic biological circuits. Outputting molecular sensors to genome editing events may facilitate the design of such control structures, particularly as the range of cellular activities that can be programmed by genome editing is rapidly expanding. In P3 editing, molecular interactions are sensed and converted directly into a genome editing output. Here, we demonstrated that specific RNA-RNA ( e. g. annealing of two sequences within crRNA and petracerRNA ), RNA-protein ( e. g. MS2:MCP and BoxB:LambdaN interactions ), and protein-protein ( epitope:antibody or chemically induced dimerization ) interactions can be used to control genome editing. Because the input of P3 editing is at the protein level, one could also chain different sensors with protein outputs upstream ( Chen and Elowitz, 2021 ), although the conversion efficiency and specificity may be compounded and result in higher noise in capturing signals through more relays. The protein-level input also circumvents a key shortcoming of existing signal-specific molecular recording systems, such as DOMINO ( Farzadfard et al., 2019 ), CAMERA ( Tang and Liu, 2018 ), and ENGRAM ( Chen et al., 2024 ), which are limited to recording signal-driven transcription of the gRNA and/or the genome editor. Finally, the sensor elements in the P3 editing strategy are focused on engineering each CRISPR-gRNA while leaving the gene editor ( i. e. prime editor and base editor ) unaltered, potentially facilitating multiplex genome editing within the same cell. For example, one could imagine developing a P3 editing strategy to construct a sensor specific to a cell state and combine it with other molecular signal or lineage recording methods ( Chen et al., 2024; Choi et al., 2022 ) to reconstruct the past history of each cell

. 7%, which further reduced to 0. 3% when the upper part of the Cas9-binding duplex was removed ( Figure 1c and d; short-1 and short-2 designs ). To verify that the observed editing was dependent on RNA-RNA hybridization, if we paired crRNA and petracrRNA with unmatching dimerization sequences, we consistently observed low editing efficiency ( 2–3% ) ( Figure 1e ). In summary, we tested three strategies to split the pegRNA into two molecules ( Figure 1a ). Among these, splitting the pegRNA at the repeat:anti-repeat portion is the most promising strategy, and can be potentially extended to the general gRNA used with CRISPR-Cas9 ( Figure 1a, bottom; Figure 1b–e ). The resulting rates of prime editing are strongly dependent on the complementarity between the repeat:anti-repeat region of crRNA and petracrRNA. Furthermore, our design mimics the functional molecules within the native CRISPR-Cas9 system, initially discovered as the dual-RNA-guided system ( Jinek et al., 2012 ). Therefore, we pursued this strategy in further developing a molecular proximity sensor that drives genome editing. To convert protein-protein interaction events into genome editing events, we reasoned that the RNA dimerization domain within crRNA and tracrRNA could be replaced with an RNA-based protein dimerization domain, such that specific protein-protein interactions or prolonged proximity would aid in the formation of active gRNA that would then bind to Cas9 ( Figure 2a ). To date, many specific protein-RNA interaction parts have been identified, including the MS2 RNA aptamer that binds to the MCP domain ( Johansson et al., 1997 ). Among different RNA-protein pairs, we chose two pairs, MS2-MCP and BoxB-LambdaN ( Katrekar et al., 2022; Legault et al., 1998; Salstrom and Szybalski, 1978 ), which can be used as adaptors for using protein-protein interactions to drive RNA-RNA interactions

. In our view, there are four outstanding challenges for P3 editing to be broadly useful: evaluating additional cellular contexts, the method’s efficiency and specificity, understanding the limit of detectable protein-protein interactions, and the development of sensors compatible with multiplex P3 editing within the same cell. First, we have thus far only conducted P3 editing in HEK293T cells, and obviously needs to be tested in additional cell types. Second, both the efficiency and specificity of the P3 editing need to be improved before it can be used as a selective editing tool in model systems. We have explored how modifying the crRNA and petracrRNA pair sequences can tune the efficiency-vs-specificity tradeoff, but alternative avenues to improvement ( e. g. better docking of RNA aptamers such as MS2, BoxB, or PP7 by testing more linker sequences that place crRNA and petracrRNA for duplex formation ) may be more fruitful in terms of achieving high efficiency and specificity at once ( e. g. >50% editing in the setting of a specific protein-protein interaction, and <1% editing without it ). Second, it is not clear whether weak and transient interactions among proteins can be used to trigger P3 editing. Assuming the genome editing complex formation is reversible, improving P3 editing efficiency may be able to capture different strengths of protein-protein interactions, although some interactions may be too transient to promote functional gRNA formation. Finally, the current P3 editing design uses a pair of RNA aptamers and their corresponding protein binders, limiting the multiplex detection of protein-protein pairs. More orthogonal protein-RNA pairs need to be identified e. g. using a massively parallel platform ( Buenrostro et al., 2014 ) and/or computational prediction ( Baek et al., 2024 ) to allow for large numbers of protein-protein interactions to be used in P3.

    Title: 
    Abstract: In cardiomyocytes, the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex mediates the slow delayed-rectifier current ( IKs ), pivotal during the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential. Mutations in IKs cause long QT syndrome ( LQTS ), a syndrome with a prolonged QT interval on the ECG, which increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. One potential therapeutical intervention for LQTS is based on targeting IKs channels to restore channel function and/or the physiological QT interval. Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) are potent activators of KCNQ1 channels and activate IKs channels by binding to two different sites, one in the voltage sensor domain – which shifts the voltage dependence to more negative voltages – and the other in the pore domain – which increases the maximal conductance of the channels ( Gmax ). However, the mechanism by which PUFAs increase the Gmax of the IKs channels is still poorly understood. In addition, it is unclear why IKs channels have a very small single-channel conductance and a low open probability or whether PUFAs affect any of these properties of IKs channels. Our results suggest that the selectivity filter in KCNQ1 is normally unstable, contributing to the low open probability, and that the PUFA-induced increase in Gmax is caused by a stabilization of the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state.

   ., 2013 ). The mechanisms behind the small conductance and low open probability are not understood. Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ), in particular omega 3, are known to exert a protective effect on sudden cardiac death and are recommended in the diet at least twice a week ( Fernandez et al., 2021 ). PUFAs have been shown to increase IKs currents by a dual mechanism of action, characteristically described as a ‘Lipoelectric mechanism’ ( Elinder and Liin, 2017 ). According to this mechanism, PUFAs can increase IKs currents by shifting the voltage dependence of activation ( ΔV0. 5 ) toward negative voltages and increase the maximum conductance of the channel ( ΔGmax ) ( Bohannon et al., 2019; Bohannon et al., 2020; Yazdi et al., 2021; Larsson et al., 2020; Wu and Larsson, 2020; Figure 1B and C ). The two PUFA effects ( ΔV0. 5 and ΔGmax ) on KCNQ1 are independent of each other and originate from the binding of PUFA to two different sites, conventionally indicated as Site I and Site II ( Yazdi et al., 2021; Liin et al., 2018 ). Site I is found in the VSD, where the PUFA head group interacts with the positive charges in the S4 segment and causes the channel to open at more negative potentials ( Liin et al., 2015 ). Site II is found in the pore domain, where electrostatic interactions between the PUFA head group and the positively charged residue, K326, facilitate an increase in the maximal conductance of the channel ( Liin et al., 2018; Figure 1E and F ). Although previous studies have shown the importance of K326 for PUFA in increasing Gmax through binding at Site II ( Liin et al., 2018 ), the mechanism by which PUFAs increase Gmax is still not understood. In this study, we use a combination of two-electrode voltage-clamp, single-channel recordings, site-directed mutagenesis, and recent cryoEM structures to gain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the Gmax effect following PUFA binding at Site II

The voltage-gated K+ channel KCNQ1, also referred to as Kv7. 1, is expressed in the heart. Here the channel associates with the accessory KCNE1 subunit, generating the so-called slow delayed-rectifier ( IKs ) current, an important contributor to the repolarizing phase of the ventricular action potential ( AP ) ( Barhanin et al., 1996; Sanguinetti et al., 1996; Nerbonne and Kass, 2005 ). Loss-of-function mutations of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex are associated with long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) ( Splawski et al., 2000; Tester and Ackerman, 2014 ). These LQTS mutations cause a reduction of the channel current, leading to a significant prolongation of the ventricular AP waveform that can be seen on the electrocardiogram as a prolonged QT interval ( Nerbonne and Kass, 2005; Figure 1A ). These channel mutations, or dysfunction, increase the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to sudden cardiac death ( Wu and Sanguinetti, 2016 ). At present, treatment of LQTS is mainly based on the usage of β-blockers ( most used are long-lasting preparations such as nadolol and atenolol ) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, especially for patients with high risk of sudden death and frequent syncope ( Roden, 2008 ). However, both approaches do not shorten the QT interval duration. Restoring the physiological duration of the QT interval could be achieved by increasing the activity of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex ( Varshneya et al., 2018; Figure 1 ). Like other Kv channels, KCNQ1 has a typical tetrameric structure of four α-subunits. Each α-subunit is composed of six transmembrane segments, with S1-S4 forming the voltage sensor domain ( VSD ) and S5-S6 forming the pore domain ( PD ) ( Figure 1D ). However, the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex has a very small single-channel conductance and a very low open probability compared to other Kv channels ( Werry et al., 2013 )

We have previously proposed models in which the effect of PUFAs on IKs channels involve the binding of PUFAs to two independent sites: one at the voltage sensor ( Site I ) and one at the pore domain ( Site II ). The result is a potent activation of IKs channels, with an increase in the maximum conductance by binding to Site II and a shift of the voltage dependence of activation of the channel by binding to Site I. The mechanism of the voltage shift effects at Site I, where the PUFA head group electrostatically interacts with positively charged S4 residues and thereby facilitates channel activation, has been investigated in previous studies ( Yazdi et al., 2021; Bohannon et al., 2023; Liin et al., 2018; Jowais et al., 2023 ). However, less is known about the molecular mechanism by which PUFA increases the maximum conductance ( Gmax ) of the channel following binding to Site II. A positively charged lysine at position 326 was suggested to be critical for PUFA-channel interaction, as mutations of K326 completely abolished the Gmax effect ( Liin et al., 2018 ). We have here shown that the interaction at Site II also involves another residue, the aspartic acid 301, as mutagenesis analysis revealed that the effect of Lin-Glycine on Gmax was abolished when the residue was substituted with a glutamic acid. Our single-channel recordings revealed that Lin-Glycine decreases the latency to first opening and increases the Po. The decrease in the latency to first opening is most likely due to the binding of Lin-Glycine to Site I at the VSD and related to the shift in voltage dependence caused by Lin-Glycine ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). In addition, our single-channel recordings revealed that Lin-Glycine did not change the single-channel conductance, but instead increased Gmax by increasing the Po of the channel. This increase in Po was mainly due to an increase in non-empty sweeps when Lin-Glycine was applied in comparison to control solutions

. This high open probability was maintained in control conditions even for longer depolarizing voltage pulses, as if once the channels had opened they stayed open for the remaining of the voltage steps ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ). The 2. 85-fold increase in the number of non-empty sweeps is very similar to the Gmax increase seen in macroscopic currents. The decrease in first latency is most likely due to an effect of Lin-Glycine on Site I in the VSD and related to the shift in voltage dependence caused by Lin-Glycine. In contrast, the increase in the number of non-empty sweeps is most likely an effect on Site II in the pore and related to the Gmax effect. We conclude that the Gmax effect of Lin-Glycine on KCNQ1/KCNE1 is mainly due to an increase in the Po by increasing the number of non-empty sweeps. It was previously shown that PUFAs binding at Site II electrostatically interact with the positively charged residue K326, located just outside the selectivity filter ( Liin et al., 2018 ). We tested whether another residue very close to K326, the aspartic acid at position 301, is also involved in PU-channel interaction by mutagenesis. Substituting aspartic acid with glutamic acid completely abolished the G effect of PU on Gmax ( Figure 3A ). Our single-channel recordings revealed that aspartic acid decreases the latency to first opening and increases the Po. The decrease in latency to opening is likely due to the binding of aspart acid to Site at the V and the shift in voltage caused by as acid ( Figure 2— supplement 1 ). In addition, single-channel recordings revealed that aspart acid did not change single-channel conductance but increased Gmax by increasing Po. The increase in Po was mainly due to an increase in non-empty when as acid was applied in comparison to control. The high Po was maintained in control conditions for longer depolarizing pulses as once channels had opened they stayed open the remaining voltage ( Figure 2— supplement 2 ) The 2. 5-fold increase in non-empty is similar to Gmax seen macroscopic. The decrease in latency is likely an effect of as on Site in the V and related to shift caused by as. In contrast, the increase in non-empty is an effect on Site in pore and related to Gmax. We conclude that G effect as on KCQ/KNE is mainly due an increase in Po by increasing non-empty.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in human brain disorders for decades. Still, the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies remain poorly understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear as well. Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase ( PDXP ), an enzyme that controls levels of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate ( PLP ), the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6, may represent an alternative therapeutic entry point into vitamin B6-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological PDXP inhibitors to test this concept are lacking. We now identify a PDXP and age-dependent decline of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus that provides a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors. Using a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry, we discover, visualize, and analyze 7, 8-dihydroxyflavone ( 7, 8-DHF ) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor. 7, 8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency. In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7, 8-DHF increases PLP in a PDXP-dependent manner. These findings validate PDXP as a druggable target. Of note, 7, 8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models, although its mechanism of action is actively debated. Our discovery of 7, 8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers novel mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding 7, 8-DHF-mediated effects in the brain.

    PLP deficiency has been associated with human brain disorders for decades ( di Salvo et al., 2012 ), yet causal links remain unclear. Aside from vitamin B6 administration, pharmacological strategies to elevate intracellular PLP levels are lacking. Here, we identify 7, 8-DHF as a direct PDXP inhibitor that increases PLP levels in hippocampal neurons, validating PDXP as a druggable target to control intracellular PLP levels in the brain. We also present three high-resolution 7, 8-DHF/PDXP co-crystal structures that will facilitate the design of more potent, efficacious, and selective PDXP inhibitors in the future. Such molecules might improve the control of intracellular PLP levels and help to elucidate a possible contribution of PLP to the pathophysiology of brain disorders. Our observation that the expression of PDXP is substantially upregulated in hippocampi of middle-aged mice suggests that a therapeutic vitamin B6 supplementation alone may not suffice to elevate intracellular PLP levels under conditions where the PLP-degrading phosphatase is hyperactive. The discovery of 7, 8-DHF as a direct PDXP inhibitor was unexpected. Interestingly, numerous in vivo studies have reported the effectiveness of 7, 8-DHF in brain disorder models, including rodent models of Alzheimer’s disease ( Zhang et al., 2014a; Devi and Ohno, 2012; Bollen et al., 2013; Castello et al., 2014; Aytan et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2016; Akhtar et al., 2021; Hsiao et al., 2014 ), depression ( Blugeot et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2014b; Yao et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2022; Amin et al., 2020 ), schizophrenia ( Jaehne et al., 2021; Han et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2014; Han et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2013 ), epilepsy ( Becker et al., 2015; Guarino et al., 2022 ), and autism ( Johnson et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2017; Lee and Han, 2019; Chen et al., 2023 )

. The identification of 7, 8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor reported here indicates that this flavone may modulate vitamin B6-dependent processes and suggests that PDXP could be explored as a pharmacological entry point into brain disorders.

Vitamin B6 is an essential micronutrient that plays an important role in the nervous system ( Bowling, 2011; Wilson et al., 2019 ), with the vitamin B6 status affecting cognitive function at any age ( di Salvo et al., 2012; Mitchell et al., 2014 ). Population studies indicate that low vitamin B6 levels are common among older people ( Malouf and Grimley Evans, 2003 ), and suggest that vitamin B6 deficiency may influence memory performance and may contribute to age-related cognitive decline ( Hughes et al., 2017; Jannusch et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2022; Elias et al., 2006 ). Vitamin B6 deficiency is also associated with other conditions characterized by impaired learning and memory, including neuropsychiatric disorders ( Tomioka et al., 2018; Toriumi et al., 2021; Arai et al., 2010 ), Alzheimer’s disease ( Paul, 2021 ), and inflammation ( Ueland et al., 2017; Danielski et al., 2018 ). Nevertheless, the exact molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies are often insufficiently understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear ( Mitchell et al., 2014; Malouf and Grimley Evans, 2003; Wang et al., 2022b; Behrens et al., 2020; Hassel et al., 2019; Rutjes et al., 2018; Smith and Refsum, 2016; Aisen et al., 2008; Douaud et al., 2013 ). The term vitamin B6 encompasses the enzymatically interconvertible compounds pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal ( collectively referred to as B6 vitamers ), and their phosphorylated forms. Among these, only pyridoxal 5′-phosphate ( PLP ) is co-enzymatically active. In humans, PLP is known to be required for 44 distinct biochemical reactions, including the biosynthesis and/or metabolism of neurotransmitters, amino acids, lipids, and glucose. In addition, B6 vitamers display antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions ( Percudani and Peracchi, 2003; Eliot and Kirsch, 2004; Percudani and Peracchi, 2009; Parra et al., 2018 )

. While the hippocampal levels of non-protein-bound PLP dropped by about 60% over this time span in PDXP-WT mice, they remained elevated in PDXP-KO mice ( ~2-fold higher in younger, and ~5-fold higher in older PDXP-KO compared to the respective PDXP-WT; see Figure 1—source data 3 for exact mouse ages ). We conclude that hippocampi of older mice are characterized by a specific decrease in the levels of non-protein-bound PLP, and that this age-dependent PLP loss is dependent on PDXP activity. These observations establish that PDXP is a critical determinant of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus and suggest that intracellular PLP deficiency may be alleviated by PDXP inhibition. Pharmacological small-molecule PDXP inhibitors are currently lacking. To identify PDXP inhibitor candidates, we screened the FMP small-molecule repository containing 41, 182 compounds for molecules able to modulate the phosphatase activity of recombinant, highly purified murine PDXP ( see Figure 2—figure supplement 1 for a schematic of the screening campaign ). Difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate ( DiFMUP ) was used as a fluorogenic phosphatase substrate in a primary screen. Compounds that altered DiFMUP fluorescence by ≥50% ( activator candidates ) or ≤25% ( inhibitor candidates ) were subjected to EC50/IC50 value determinations. Of these, 46 inhibitor hits were selected and counter-screened against phosphoglycolate phosphatase ( PGP ), the closest PDXP relative ( Seifried et al., 2014; Jeanclos et al., 2022 ). Eleven of the PDXP inhibitor hits ( with an IC50 PDXP < 20 µM, and IC50 PDXP < IC50 PGP or no activity against PGP ) were subsequently validated in a secondary assay, using PLP as a physiological PDXP substrate ( see Figure 2—source data 5 for all 11 inhibitor hits ). Only one PDXP-selective inhibitor hit ( 7, 8-DHF, a naturally occurring flavone ) blocked PDXP-catalyzed PLP dephosphorylation ( IC50 ~ 1.5 µM ) and increased PL levels in hippocal neurons ( Figure 3 ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: Organogenesis requires the proper production of diverse cell types and their positioning/migration. However, the coordination of these processes during development remains poorly understood. The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip cells ( DTCs ), which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors ( SGPs; Z1 and Z4 ). We found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4, which possess mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins ( CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20 ) with distinct functions. In lin-17 mutants, CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while CWN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. In lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1, DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side. Our further analysis demonstrates that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1 ( RNAi ) animals producing ectopic DTCs. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ.

   . p and another VPC P5. p is essential for their mirror-symmetric lineages and the structure of the vulva. The LH polarity of P7. p is instructed by Wnt proteins secreted from the anchor cell located between P5. p and P7. p ( Green et al., 2008 ). In the gonad, at the L1 stage, somatic gonadal precursor ( SGP ) cells, Z1 and Z4 have LH and HL polarity, respectively, creating their mirror-symmetric lineages producing distal tip cells ( DTCs ) from the distal daughters ( Z1. a and Z4. p ) ( Siegfried et al., 2004; Figure 1A and B ). However, it is not known how this mirror-symmetric polarity is established. We have shown previously that SGP polarity is not affected in quintuple Wnt mutants that have mutations in all five Wnt genes in C. elegans, suggesting that Wnts may not be required for SGP polarity ( Yamamoto et al., 2011 ). DTCs, which are the most distal granddaughters of SGPs ( Z1. aa and Z4. pp ), have two functions. First, DTCs function as niche cells for germline stem cells, inhibiting their entry into meiosis by expressing the Notch ligand LAG-2 ( Henderson et al., 1994 ). Additionally, during gonadogenesis, each DTC migrates with a U-shaped trajectory to guide extension of gonad arms, resulting in U-shaped gonad both on the anterior and posterior sides ( Figure 1A ). A recent report suggests that DTCs may not actively migrate by themselves; instead, they are pushed distally by proliferating germ cells ( Agarwal et al., 2022 ). While the quintuple Wnt mutants exhibit normal SGP polarity, we observed a significant impact on polarity when Wnt mutations are present in the background of the lin-17/Frizzled mutation. For example, triple Wnt mutations ( cwn-1 cwn-2 and egl-20 ) combined with the lin-17 mutation disrupt the polarity of both Z1 and Z4

. LIN-17 functions in a Wnt-independent manner, as LIN-17 lacking the Wnt binding domain ( cysteine-rich domain [CRD] ) can rescue gonadal defects in compound mutants containing the lin-17 mutation. In the lin-17 background, the three Wnts have distinct functions. Specifically, cwn-1 promotes HL polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while cwn-2 promotes LH and HL polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, egl-20 inhibits HL polarity induced by cwn-1. In lin-17; egl-20 cwn-2 animals, both Z1 and Z4 show HL polarity disrupting the mirror symmetry of polarity. Notably, in this genotype, we observed that the DTC from Z1 frequently migrates posteriorly similar to that from Z4. We further demonstrated that the ectopic positions of DTCs in the center of the gonad cause mis-migration. Our results suggest that the distal positions of DTCs in the gonad through the mirror-symmetric polarity of SGPs are required for stable distal migration, consistent with the recent report supporting the permissive migration model ( Agarwal et al., 2022 ). However, the posterior migration of ectopically positioned DTCs from Z1 passing through germ cells in the triple mutants, along with DTC migration in germless mes-1 mutants, strongly suggests self-migratory mechanisms of DTCs.

We have previously shown that the polarity of seam cells ( V1-V5 ) is redundantly regulated by cwn-1, cwn-2, and egl-20 ( Yamamoto et al., 2011 ), indicating that all three of these Wnts induce the same polarity orientation ( HL for high-low POP-1 concentration ). In contrast, we show that these Wnts have distinct functions for SGP polarity at least in the lin-17 mutant background ( Figure 7 ). CWN-1 induces HL polarity for both Z1 and Z4. CWN-2 induces the opposite polarity; LH for Z1 and HL for Z4. EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. The distinct responses of Z1 and Z4 to CWN-2 appear to be a key for their opposite polarity orientation and mirror-symmetric gonadogenesis. Since these cells have asymmetry in terms of their contacts with germ cells on their proximal sides and those with the basement membrane on their distal sides, CWN-2 may permissively facilitate this asymmetry to control POP-1 localization. Alternatively, Z1 and Z4 may have intrinsic differences in gene expression, leading to distinct responses to CWN-2. The function of CWN-1 for SGP polarity appears to be the same as for seam cell polarity, inducing HL polarity in both cases. Since it was suggested that CWN-1 is a permissive signal for seam cell polarity ( Yamamoto et al., 2011 ), it may also permissively regulate SGP polarity. In contrast to the role of EGL-20 in seam cells, where it induces HL polarity, it inhibits cell polarization in SGPs. The loss of SGP polarity phenotype in the lin-17; cwn-2 double mutant but not in the lin-17; cwn-1 cwn-2 triple mutants was suppressed by further mutating egl-20. The recovered polarity in lin-17; egl-20 cwn-2 depends on cwn-1, as lin-17; cwn-1; egl-20 cwn-2 mutants showed a strong loss of polarity phenotype. However, cwn-1 cannot efficiently polarize SGPs in lin-17; cwn-2 mutants with normal egl-20 function

. Therefore, egl-20 appears to inhibit the cwn-1 function but not its expression ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ). A similar antagonistic relationship between cwn-1 and egl-20 was reported for later DTC migration when DTCs turn to migrate centrally on the dorsal side ( phase III ) ( Levy-Strumpf and Culotti, 2014 ). egl-20 mutants show a reversal of phase III migration and this phenotype is suppressed by the cwn-1 mutation. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the distinct functions of CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20. We have shown that lin-17/Fzd functions in a Wnt-independent manner to control SGP polarity, since the missing DTC phenotype of lin-17; cwn-2 and lin-17 mom-5 was completely rescued by ΔCRD-LIN-17. In addition, SGP polarity is normal in the quintuple Wnt mutant that has mutations in all the Wnt genes ( Yamamoto et al., 2011 ). In seam cells, Wnt receptors including LIN-17/Fzd and MOM-5/Fzd appear to have Wnt-independent functions for cell polarization, as seam cells are still mostly polarized in the quintuple Wnt mutants, while they are strongly unpolarized in the triple receptor mutants ( lin-17 mom-5 cam-1/Ror ) ( Yamamoto et al., 2011 ). In Drosophila, Fz/Fzd has been primarily considered to function Wnt-independently to coordinate PCP between neighboring cells ( Lawrence et al., 2007 ), though Fz function can still be regulated by Wnt, as PCP orientation can be directed by ectopically expressed Wnt proteins ( Wu et al., 2013 ). In Drosophila, Fz regulates PCP in a Wnt-independent manner, but can be regulated by Wnt ( Lawrence et al, 2007 ). In C. elegans, we show that LIN-17 functions in a W-independent manner for SGP polarity, but can be modulated by Wnts as shown by the distinct functions of C-1, C-2, and e-20 in the lin-17 background. The distinct functions of C-1, C-2, and e-20 in the lin-17 background suggest that these Wnts can modulate LIN-17 activity, but are not required for SGP polarity as shown by the quintuple W mutants ( Yamamoto et al, 201 ). The distinct functions of C-1 C-2 and e-20 in the lin-17 background suggest that these Wnts modulate LIN-17 activity, but are not required for SGP polarity as shown by quintuple mutants ( Yamamoto et al, 201 ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: There is growing interest in designing multidrug therapies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. Tradeoffs are common in evolution and occur when, for example, resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another. Major questions remain about the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable, specifically, whether the mutants that provide resistance to a given drug all suffer similar tradeoffs. This question is difficult because the drug-resistant mutants observed in the clinic, and even those evolved in controlled laboratory settings, are often biased towards those that provide large fitness benefits. Thus, the mutations ( and mechanisms ) that provide drug resistance may be more diverse than current data suggests. Here, we perform evolution experiments utilizing lineage-tracking to capture a fuller spectrum of mutations that give yeast cells a fitness advantage in fluconazole, a common antifungal drug. We then quantify fitness tradeoffs for each of 774 evolved mutants across 12 environments, finding these mutants group into classes with characteristically different tradeoffs. Their unique tradeoffs may imply that each group of mutants affects fitness through different underlying mechanisms. Some of the groupings we find are surprising. For example, we find some mutants that resist single drugs do not resist their combination, while others do. And some mutants to the same gene have different tradeoffs than others. These findings, on one hand, demonstrate the difficulty in relying on consistent or intuitive tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments. On the other hand, by demonstrating that hundreds of adaptive mutations can be reduced to a few groups with characteristic tradeoffs, our findings may yet empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. More generally speaking, by grouping mutants that likely affect fitness through similar underlying mechanisms, our work guides efforts to map the phenotypic effects of mutation.

   ., 2023; Starr et al., 2017 ). The key requirement to being able to implement this approach is having a large collection of barcoded mutants and the ability to re-measure their fitness, relative to a reference strain, in multiple environments, such as the 12 different combinations and concentrations of drugs surveyed here. Across our collection of 774 adaptive yeast lineages, we discovered at least 6 distinct groups with characteristic fitness tradeoffs across these 12 environments. For example, we find some drug resistant mutants are generally advantageous, while others are advantageous only in specific environments. And we find some mutants that resist single drugs also resist combinations of those drugs, while others do not. By grouping mutants with similar tradeoffs, we reduce the number of unique drug-resistant mutants from more than can be easily phenotyped ( 774 ) to a manageable panel of six types for investigating the molecular mechanisms by which mutations impact fitness. With regard to multidrug regimens that exploit tradeoffs ( Figure 1 ), our finding of multiple mutant classes with different tradeoffs suggests this may not be straightforward. The outlook is further complicated by our finding that some classes of FLU-resistant mutant primarily emerge from evolution experiments that did not contain FLU. This, as well as limits on our power to observe mutants with strong tradeoffs, suggest there may be additional types of FLU-resistant mutant beyond those we sampled. These observations suggest multidrug strategies that assume resistant mutants suffer consistent or common tradeoffs will often fail. On the other hand, nuanced strategies to forestall resistance that allow for multiple mutant types are emerging ( Gjini and Wood, 2021; Maltas and Wood, 2019; Wang et al., 2023 ). For example, one idea is to apply a drug regimen that enriches for mutants that suffer a particular tradeoff before exploiting that tradeoff ( Iram et al

Here, we present a barcoded collection of fluconazole ( FLU ) resistant yeast strains that is unique in its size, its diversity, and its tractability. One way we were able to isolate diverse types of FLU-resistance was by evolving yeast to resist diverse drug concentrations and combinations. But the more important tool used to increase both the number and type of mutants in our collection was DNA barcodes. These allowed us to sample beyond the drug resistant mutants that rise to appreciable frequency and to collect mutants that would eventually have been outcompeted by others. Our primary goal in collecting these mutants was to get a rough sense of how many different mechanisms of FLU resistance may exist. This question is relevant to evolutionary medicine ( because more mechanisms of resistance make it harder to design strategies to avoid resistance ), evolutionary theory ( because more mechanisms of adaptation make it harder to predict how evolution will proceed ), and genotype-phenotype mapping ( because more mechanisms makes for a more complex map ). We distinguish mutants that likely act via different mechanisms by identifying those with different fitness tradeoffs across 12 environments, leveraging the mutants’ barcodes to track their relative fitness following previous work ( Kinsler et al., 2020 ). The 774 FLU-resistant mutants studied here clustered into a handful of groups ( 6 ) with characteristic tradeoffs. We confirmed that each group captures mutants with distinct properties using multiple approaches, including whole genome sequencing, growth curve experiments, tracing the evolutionary origins of the mutants in each cluster, and by using two additional independent clustering methods: hierarchical clustering and PCA ( Figures 5—8 ). Some groupings are unintuitive in that they segregate mutations within the same gene ( Figure 6 ) or are distinguished by unexpectedly low fitness in multidrug conditions ( Figure 7 )

., 2020; Li et al., 2018b ). Instead of trying to identify the phenotypic or even the genetic basis of adaptation, here we strive to enumerate different classes of FLU-resistant mutants. We sort evolved FLU-resistant yeast strains into classes based on whether they share similar tradeoffs across 12 different environments. The intuition here is as follows. If two groups of drug resistant mutants have different fitness tradeoffs, it could mean that they provide resistance through different underlying mechanisms. Alternatively, both could provide drug resistance via the same mechanism, but some mutations might also affect fitness via additional mechanisms ( i. e. they might have unique ‘side-effects’ at the molecular level ) resulting in unique fitness tradeoffs in some environments. Previous work is consistent with the idea that mutants with different fitness tradeoffs affect fitness through different underlying mechanisms ( Li et al., 2019; Pinheiro et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2016 ). Our work can be seen as part of a growing push to flip the problem of mechanism on its head ( Kinsler et al., 2020; Li et al., 2019; Petti et al., 2023 ). Instead of using a mechanistic understanding to predict a microbe’s fitness, here we use how fitness varies across environments to distinguish mutants that likely affect fitness via different mechanisms. This inverted approach to investigating the mechanisms by which mutations affect fitness has broad applications; it could be used to characterize dominant negative mutations ( Flynn et al., 2024; Padhy et al., 2023 ), mutations with collateral fitness effects ( Mehlhoff et al., 2020; Mehlhoff and Ostermeier, 2023 ), and in other high-throughput mutational scanning studies ( Flynn et al., 2020; Fowler and Fields, 2014; Hinz et al., 2023; Starr et al., 2017 )

., 2022; Ksiezopolska et al., 2021 ). However, our primary goal is more generic: we seek to explore the utility of a high-throughput evolutionary approach to enumerate classes of drug resistant mutant and their associated tradeoffs. To enhance the diversity of drug resistant mutants in our experiment, we performed multiple laboratory evolutions in a range of FLU concentrations and sometimes in combination with a second drug. We did so because previous work has shown that different drug concentrations and combinations select for different azole resistance mechanisms ( Cowen and Lindquist, 2005; Hill et al., 2015 ). Ultimately, we obtained a large collection of 774 adaptive yeast strains. But how do we know whether we succeeded in isolating diverse types of FLU-resistant mutants? Typical phenotyping methods, for example quantifying expression levels of drug export pumps ( Miyazaki et al., 1998 ) or of the drug targets themselves ( Palmer and Kishony, 2014 ), are low throughput and require some a priori knowledge of the phenotypes that may be involved in drug resistance. Alternatively, many studies focus on identifying the genetic basis of adaptation in order to glean insights about the underlying mechanisms of resistance ( Cowen et al., 2014; Tenaillon et al., 2012; Venkataram et al., 2016 ). However, genotyping lineages from barcoded pools is technically challenging ( Venkataram et al., 2016 ), and further, genotype does not necessarily predict phenotype ( Brettner et al., 2022; Eguchi et al., 2019 ). For example, previous work using the same barcoded evolution platform used here discovered that the mutations that provide an advantage under glucose-limitation are in genes comprising a canonical glucose-sensing pathway ( Venkataram et al., 2016 ). Yet despite this similarity at the genetic level, follow-up work showed that these mutants did not experience the same tradeoffs when exposed to new environments ( Kinsler et al

. 3 C ). Intriguingly, these FLU-resistant lineages that maintain their fitness advantage in the absence of drug ( Figure 3 ) are not necessarily those with the highest fitness in drug ( Figure 2 ). This suggests there may be additional types of FL-resistant mutants beyond those we sampled. Our collection of 774 FL-resistant mutants is unique in its size, diversity, and tractability. We were able to isolate diverse types of FL-resistance by evolving to diverse drug concentrations and combinations. The key tool used to increase the number and type of mutants was DNA barcodes. These allowed us to sample beyond drug mutants that rise to appreciable frequency and collect that would have been outcompeted by others. Our goal was to get a sense of how many mechanisms of FL resistance exist. This is relevant to evolutionary medicine because more mechanisms make it harder to design strategies to avoid, evolutionary because more make it harder to predict how will proceed, and genotype-phenotype because more complex. We distinguish that likely via mechanisms by identifying with different tradeoffs across 12, leveraging mutants’ barcodes to track fitness following work (Kler et al.,202 ) The 774 FL-resistant clustered into a handful (6 ) with characteristic tradeoffs We confirmed each using multiple approaches including genome sequencing, growth experiments tracing origins in each cluster, and independent clustering PCA ( Figures 5—8 ) Some groupings are unintuitive that segregate within same gene ( Figure ) or distinguished unexpectedly low multidrug ( Figure 7 ),202; Li et al,2018 ) Instead of identifying phenotypic or genetic basis adaptation here enumerate classes FL-resistant We sort into based whether share trade 12 environments The intuition follows If groups drug mutants different tradeoffs it mean provide through mechanisms Alternatively both resistance same mechanism some might affect fitness additional ( i. e. have ‘side’ at molecular level resulting unique fitness some environments Previous consistent that mutants fitness different affect underlying ( et al,201; Pin et,202; Rodrigues et,201 ) Our can seen part push problem on head (ler et,202; et,201; Petti,202 ) Instead mechanistic predict micro’s fitness use how varies mutants fitness environments distinguish likely affect This approach investigating mutations fitness broad could characterize negative ( et,202; Pad,202 ) mutations collateral ( et,202; Mehl, ) and high-throughput scanning ( et,202; Fowler,201; Hinz,202; Starr,201 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: The central tendency bias, or contraction bias, is a phenomenon where the judgment of the magnitude of items held in working memory appears to be biased toward the average of past observations. It is assumed to be an optimal strategy by the brain and commonly thought of as an expression of the brain’s ability to learn the statistical structure of sensory input. On the other hand, recency biases such as serial dependence are also commonly observed and are thought to reflect the content of working memory. Recent results from an auditory delayed comparison task in rats suggest that both biases may be more related than previously thought: when the posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) was silenced, both short-term and contraction biases were reduced. By proposing a model of the circuit that may be involved in generating the behavior, we show that a volatile working memory content susceptible to shifting to the past sensory experience – producing short-term sensory history biases – naturally leads to contraction bias. The errors, occurring at the level of individual trials, are sampled from the full distribution of the stimuli and are not due to a gradual shift of the memory toward the sensory distribution’s mean. Our results are consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and provide predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings, delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas. Finally, we validate our model by performing a set of human psychophysics experiments of an auditory parametric working memory task.

    Contraction bias is an effect emerging in WM tasks, where in the averaged behavior of a subject the magnitude of the item held in memory appears to be larger than it actually is when it is ‘small’ and, vice versa, it appears to be smaller when it is ‘large’ ( Algom, 1992; Berliner et al., 1977; Hellström, 1985; Poulton and Poulton, 1989; Ashourian and Loewenstein, 2011; Preuschhof et al., 2010; Olkkonen et al., 2014 ). Recently, Akrami et al., 2018 found that contraction bias as well as short-term history-dependent effects occur in an auditory delayed comparison task in rats and humans: the comparison performance in a given trial depends on the stimuli shown in preceding trials ( up to three trials back ) ( Akrami et al., 2018 ), similar to previous findings in human 2AFC paradigms ( Raviv et al., 2012 ). These findings raise the question: does contraction bias occur independently of short-term history effects, or does it emerge as a result of the latter? Akrami et al., 2018 have also found the PPC to be a critical node for the generation of such effects as its optogenetic inactivation ( specifically during the delay interval ) greatly attenuated both effects. WM was found to remain intact, suggesting that its content was perhaps read-out in another region. Electrophysiological recordings as well as optogenetic inactivation results in the same study suggest that while sensory history information is provided by the PPC, its integration with the WM content must happen somewhere downstream to the PPC. Different brain areas can fit the profile. For instance, there are known projections from the PPC to mPFC in rats ( Olsen et al., 2019 ), where neural correlates of PWM have been found ( Esmaeili and Diamond, 2019 ). Building on these findings, we suggest a minimal two-module model aimed at better understanding the interaction between contraction bias and short-term history effects

. Rather, in our model, contraction bias emerges as a statistical effect of errors in WM, occurring due to the persisting memory of stimuli shown in the preceding trials. The integration of this persisting memory in the WM module competes with that of the stimulus in the current trial, giving rise to short-term history effects. We conclude that contraction biases in such paradigms may not necessarily reflect explicit learning of regularities or an ‘attraction toward the mean’ on individual trials. Rather, it may be an effect emerging at the level of average performance, when in each trial errors are made according to the recent sensory experiences whose distribution follow that of the input stimuli. Furthermore, using the same model, we also show that the biases toward long-term ( short-term ) statistics inferred from the performance of ASD ( DYS ) subjects ( Lieder et al., 2019 ) may actually reflect short-term biases extending more or less into the past with respect to NT subjects, challenging the hypothesis of a double-dissociation mechanism. Last, we show that as a result of neuronal integration of inputs and adaptation, in addition to attraction effects occurring on a short timescale, repulsion effects are observed on a longer timescale ( Fritsche and Spaak, 2020 ). We make specific predictions on neuronal dynamics in the PPC and downstream WM areas, as well as how contraction bias may be altered, upon manipulations of the sensory stimulus distribution, intertrial and interstimulus delay intervals. We show agreements between the model and our previous results in humans and rats. Finally, we test our model predictions by performing new human auditory PWM tasks. The data is in agreement with our model and not with an alternative Bayesian model.

. These effects extend to two trials back and are consistent with the performance of humans and rats on the auditory task ( Figure 2D, panels 3–6, data from Akrami et al., 2018 ). It has been shown that inactivating the PPC in rats performing the auditory delayed comparison task markedly reduces the magnitude of contraction bias without impacting non-sensory biases ( Akrami et al., 2018 ). We assay the causal role of the PPC in generating the sensory history effects as well as contraction bias by weakening the connections from the PPC to the WM network, mimicking the inactivation of the PPC. In this case, we see that the performance of the psychometric stimuli is greatly improved ( yellow curve, Figure 2E, top panel ), consistent also with the inactivation of the PPC in rodents ( yellow curve, Figure 2E, bottom panel, data from Akrami et al., 2018 ). Performance is improved also for all pairs of stimuli in the stimulus set ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ). The breakdown of the network response in the current trial conditioned on the specific stimulus pair preceding it reveals that the previous trial no longer exerts a notable modulating effect on the current trial ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ). Quantifying this bias by subtracting the mean performance over all of the previous pairs reveals that the attractive bias is virtually eliminated ( yellow curve, Figure 2F, left panel ), consistent with findings in rats ( Figure 2F, right panel, data from Akrami et al., 2018 ). Together, our results suggest a possible circuit through which both contraction bias and short-term history effects in a PWM task may arise. The main features of our model are two continuous attractor networks, both integrating the same external inputs, but operating over different timescales. Crucially, the slower one, a model of the PPC, includes neuronal adaptation and provides input to the faster one, intended as a WM circuit

A fundamental question in neuroscience relates to how brains efficiently process the statistical regularities of the environment to guide behavior. Exploiting such regularities may be of great value to survival in the natural environment, but may lead to biases in laboratory tasks. Repeatedly observed across species and sensory modalities is the central tendency ( ‘contraction’ ) bias, where performance in perceptual tasks seemingly reflects a shift of the working memory ( WM ) representation toward the mean of the sensory history ( Hollingworth, 1910; Jou et al., 2004; Berliner et al., 1977; Hellström, 1985; Raviv et al., 2012; Fischer and Whitney, 2014 ). Equally common are sequential biases, either attractive or repulsive, toward the immediate sensory history ( Akrami et al., 2018; Raviv et al., 2012; Kiyonaga et al., 2017; Cicchini et al., 2017; Czoschke et al., 2019; Alais et al., 2018; Manassi et al., 2018; Manassi et al., 2017; Suárez-Pinilla et al., 2018; Fischer and Whitney, 2014; Papadimitriou et al., 2015 ). It is commonly thought that these biases occur due to disparate mechanisms – contraction bias is widely thought to be a result of learning the statistical structure of the environment, whereas serial biases are thought to reflect the contents of WM ( Lieder et al., 2019; Barbosa and Compte, 2020 ). Recent evidence, however, challenges this picture: our recent study of a parametric working memory ( PWM ) task discovered that the rat posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) plays a key role in modulating contraction bias ( Akrami et al., 2018 ). When the region is optogenetically inactivated, contraction bias is attenuated. Intriguingly, however, this is also accompanied by the suppression of bias effects induced by the recent history of the stimuli, suggesting that the two phenomena may be interrelated

PWM tasks involve the sequential comparison of two graded stimuli that differ along a physical dimension, such as loudness or brightness. The stimuli are presented in a sequence and the subject is asked to judge whether the second is greater or less than the first. In such tasks, contraction bias is observed where the magnitude of the second stimulus appears larger than it actually is when it is small and vice versa when it is large ( Akram et al,2018 ; Rav et al. 2012 ). This is thought to be due to a shift of the WM toward the mean of the sensory distribution of the stimuli ( Lieder et al,2019 ). However, our results suggest that this may not be the case : when the PPC is inactivated, both contraction and short history effects are reduced. We propose a model of the circuit that may be involved in the generation of these effects. In our model, contraction emerges as a result of the persisting memory of the stimuli in WM. The integration of this persisting memory with the current stimulus gives rise to short history effects. We show that our model is consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings, delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas. We validate our model by performing a set of psychophysics experiments an auditory parametric working memory task. Our results are consistent with previous findings in humans and rats, suggesting that contraction and short history may be more related than previously thought, and that the PPC plays a key role in modulating these effects.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICIs ) and their combination with other therapies such as chemotherapy, fail in most cancer patients. We previously identified the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 ( PDLIM2 ) as a bona fide tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer to drive cancer and its chemo and immunotherapy resistance, suggesting a new target for lung cancer therapy improvement. In this study, human clinical samples and data were used to investigate PDLIM2 genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer. Using an endogenous mouse lung cancer model faithfully recapitulating refractory human lung cancer and a clinically feasible nano-delivery system, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy, action mechanism, and safety of systemically administrated PDLIM2 expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles ( nanoPDLIM2 ) and its combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs. Our analysis indicate that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration. NanoPDLIM2 showed low toxicity, high tumor specificity, antitumor activity, and greatly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, with complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice by their triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC-I ) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 ( MDR1 ) induction and survival genes and other tumor-related genes expression in tumor cells, and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, turning the cold tumors hot and sensitive to ICIs and rendering them vulnerable to chemotherapeutic drugs and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) including those unleashed by ICIs. These studies established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other cold cancers. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Given the role of PDLIM2 in inhibiting the expression of cell survival and proliferation genes in tumor cells, which contribute to chemoresistance, we tested whether nanoPDLIM2 increases the efficacy of chemotherapy in the mouse model of lung cancer. Treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel, two chemotherapeutic drugs that are often used together as the first-line treatment for lung and many other cancers, led to significant decrease in tumor number and tumor burden ( Figure 4A ). Importantly, combination with nanoPDLIM2 further significantly decreased both tumor number and tumor burden, suggesting a promising synergy between PDLIM2 nanotherapy and chemotherapy in lung cancer treatment. Consistently, significantly higher tumor cell apoptosis was detected in mice treated with the combination therapy, in comparison to those with nanoPDLIM2 or chemotherapy alone ( Figure 4B ). Another important mechanism contributing to the synergy between these two therapies involves nanoPDLIM2 blockade of the acquired chemoresistance of lung cancer cells. Chemotherapy induced strong RelA activation/nuclear expression and MDR1 expression ( Figure 4C and D ). NanoPDLIM2 not only repressed the constitutive activation of RelA in cancer cells but also prevented the strong induction of RelA activation and MDR1 expression by the chemotherapy. Thus, PDLIM2 nanotherapy improves the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy through blocking both intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance of lung cancer cells. High expression of cell survival genes also renders tumor cells resistant to the tumoricidal activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ), including those unleashed by ICIs. PDLIM2 nanotherapy should also enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy, given its ability in suppressing the expression of cell survival genes

. Besides its side effects, epigenetic therapy should have much more limited application, even though it shows better efficacy as a monotherapy or combined with chemotherapeutic drugs or anti-PD-1 in comparison to PDLIM2 nanotherapy ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ). While nanoPDLIM2-based combination therapies could be applicable to all lung tumors with PDLIM2 repression regardless of the mechanisms involved, epigenetic therapy may be used to treat about 26% of lung tumors with PDLIM2 epigenetic repression only. About 58% of lung tumors harboring PDLIM2 LOH are not suitable to epigenetic therapies, although most of them are also with epigenetic alterations of the pdlim2 gene. Of note, the therapeutic efficacy of epigenetic therapy depends on PDLIM2 expression ( Sun et al., 2019 ), and PDLIM2 heterozygous loss causes spontaneous lung and other cancers. Further, the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of epigenetic agents with both anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs has not been examined yet. In summary, the presented data identify genetic deletions as a major mechanism other than epigenetic alterations for PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer, and PDLIM2 as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor particularly important for suppressing lung cancer and therapy resistance. More importantly, these preclinical data establish a novel combination treatment of nanoPDLIM2, anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs that induces complete remission of all lung tumors in most animals and is also with high safety profile. We believe that these knowledges are applicable to other cancers, because PDLIM2 repression has also been linked to numerous human cancers other than lung cancer.

. Also, tumor cells usually express high levels of survival genes against the tumoricidal effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and of CTLs, including those activated by chemotherapy and unleashed by ICIs. On the other hand, PDLIM2 nanotherapy induces MHC-I expression and lymphocyte tumor infiltration but does not up-regulate PD-L1. Moreover, PDLIM2 nanotherapy prevents the induction of MDR1 and the expression of tumor-related genes and in particular cell survival genes, further sensitizing tumor cells to the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs and immune cells including those recruited by chemotherapy and unleashed by PD-1 blockade. Because of these important functions of PDLIM2 nanotherapy, PDLIM2 nanotherapy improved the efficacy of chemotherapy and PD-1 blockade therapy, and in combination with chemotherapy and PD-1 blockade therapy, resulted in complete cancer remission in most of the animals and dramatic tumor reduction in the remaining mice. Another important clinical characteristic of PDLIM2 nanotherapy is its tumor-specificity and high safety profile. It delivered PDLIM2-expression plasmids to lung tumor tissues and showed undetectable toxicity in the animal model. Its combination does not further increase the toxicity of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs. This is in sharp contrast to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved epigenetic drugs, which can restore PDLIM2 expression in cancer cells with PDLIM2 epigenetic repression ( Sun et al., 2019; Guo and Qu, 2021; Qu et al., 2010a; Qu et al., 2010b; Sun et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2009b; Vanoirbeek et al., 2014 ). Epigenetic drug treatment leads to body weight loss of animals ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2A ). The toxicity is much worse when epigenetic drugs are combined with chemotherapy ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 )

. Notably, systemic administration of nanoPDLIM2 reverses the phenotypes caused by PDLIM2 repression and induces complete remission of all lung tumors in most mice without further increasing toxicity when combined with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs. These findings provide a firm basis to combine ICIs and chemotherapeutic drugs with PDLIM2-targeted therapy for the treatment of lung and other cancers.

., 2019 ). The synergy was largely blocked when Pdlim2 was genetically deleted from lung cancer cells ( ΔSPC; Figure 6B and C ), suggesting an important role of PDLIM2 in the combination therapy of chemotherapeutic drugs and anti-PD-1. Whereas PDLIM2 nanotherapy increased MHC-I expression on tumor cells ( Figure 5B ), which is critical for better recognition and killing of tumor cells by CD8+ CTLs, chemotherapy alone or its combination with anti-PD-1 failed to do so ( Figure 6D ). Accordingly, combination of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, like the combination therapies of nanoPDLIM2 and anti-PD-1 or chemotherapeutic drugs, also failed to induce a complete remission of lung tumors in any mice. Given their overlapping roles in increasing TILs and in particular their complement roles in inducing MHC-I and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, which turn tumors hot and more sensitive to PD-1 blockade, combination of nanoPDLIM2 and chemotherapeutic drugs with anti-PD-1 is expected to show better efficacy compared to combining only two of them. Indeed, combination of all three showed the strongest effect on reducing tumor burden and numbers, and caused complete remission of all lung tumors in 60% of mice ( Figure 6E ) and much more shrinkage of lung tumors in remaining mice in comparison to those treated with two combined therapies. In line with the high therapeutic efficacy, the triple combination therapy significantly increased the numbers and/or activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lung, compared to the combination of chemotherapeutic drugs and anti-PD-1 ( Figure 7A and B ) and nanoDL2 and anti-P-1 ( Figure 7 C and D ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: To survive in challenging environments, animals must develop a system to assess food quality and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly. However, the mechanisms that regulate this chronic physiological food evaluation system, which monitors specific nutrients from ingested food and influences food-response behavior, are still not fully understood. Here, we established a low-quality food evaluation assay system and found that heat-killed E. coli ( HK-E. coli ), a low-sugar food, triggers cellular UPRER and immune response. This encourages animals to avoid low-quality food. The physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - Innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) axis, particularly its neuronal function, which subsequently regulates feeding behaviors. Moreover, animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment through sugar supplementation, which inhibits the UPRER -PMK-1 regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. This study reveals the role of the cellular stress response pathway as physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, thereby enhancing survival in natural environments.

    To better survive, animals must evolve a system to recognize and evaluate the quality of their food. This includes the sensory neuron evaluation system for immediate response and feeding decision ( Florsheim et al., 2021 ), as well as physiological food evaluation system for chronic response to ingested food. In our previous study, we discovered that the TORC1-ELT-2 pathway, acting as master regulators in intestine, evaluates vitamin B2 deficiency in low-quality food ( HK-E. coli ) and regulates gut digestive activity to impact animal’s food behavior ( Qi et al., 2017 ). To further identified the mechanism by which animals evaluate low-quality food ( HK-E. coli ), we performed metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses to identify specific nutrition deficiencies in low-quality food and the cellular response pathways that are involved in food evaluation pathway. This study identified a physiological food evaluation mechanism by which animals recognize food quality through UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - Innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) regulated cellular stress response program in neurons that dictates food avoidance and selection behaviors ( Figure 6 ). One of the cellular stress response pathways, the Unfolded Protein Response ( UPRER ), is activated by various stresses, including infection and nutrition deficiency, which disrupt the homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( Hetz et al., 2020 ). The activation of UPRER, specifically in the nervous system, has been shown to promote changes in feeding and foraging behavior ( Özbey et al., 2020 ). The p38 PMK-1 pathway is also crucial for regulating the expression of secreted innate immune effectors and is essential for survival during infection ( Troemel et al., 2006 ). Therefore, these two pathways play a critical role in ensuring animals' survival in changing environments

. In contrast, when animals are fed low-quality food ( HK-OP50 ), we found that supplementing D-GlcA in HK-E. coli or E. coli-yfbR mutation can improve VC levels and inhibit UPRER-immunity ( Figure 4C ). These data indicate that glucose boosts the animal’s ability to adapt to unfavorable food environments by increasing VC levels, but not in favorable food conditions. Unlike the sensory neuron evaluation system, which permits rapid feeding decisions through smell and taste, the cellular stress response as physiological food evaluation system describe here requires a slow and multi-step signal transduction process after the ingestion of food. The disruption of cellular homeostasis by ingested of low-quality or toxic food can activate stress response mechanisms that both increase the cellular ability to withstand and adapt to this disruption of homeostasis and promote behavioral strategies to avoid these conditions and lessen their impact on the organism. These cellular stress response mechanisms include heat shock response, unfolded protein response, oxidative stress response ( Özbey et al., 2021 ). Therefore, this slow physiological food evaluation system is an evolutionary adaptation mechanism for detecting nutrition deficiencies in food that was not detected by quick sensory nervous system. One limitation of our study is the lack of explanation for why HK-E. coli activates UPRER and immunity. We hypothesized that when heat-killed, HK-E. coli may lack or contain altered levels of certain metabolites that either activate or inhibit UPRER and immunity, respectively. Additionally, we speculated that E. coli mutants killed by heat may lack metabolites that activate UPRER and immunity, or conversely, have increased levels of metabolites that inhibit these pathways. Fortunately, our investigation led to the discovery of the E

. coli mutant yfbR, which inhibits UPRER and immunity by increasing carbohydrates that aid in resisting these stress pathways. Moving forward, we intend to further explore the intricate relationship between HK-E. coli and UPRER-immunity. This will be a key focus of our future research efforts. Collectively, this study uncovers the unexpected function of UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - Innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) as a physiological food evaluation system for evaluating and sensing food quality in animals. It also highlights the utility of the HK-E. coli ( low-quality food ) - C. elegans interaction as a means to dissect the mechanism of food evaluation system in assessing food. Most importantly, it reveals that animals are capable of altering their nutrient ( Vitamin C ) levels through in vivo synthesis or food intake to adapt to a poor food environment when better food choices are not available.

., 2019 ), we wondered whether glucose also inhibits the stress response in animals. We found that D- ( + ) -glucose supplementation also inhibited HK-E. coli induced UPRER ( Figure 3E ), immune response ( Figure 3F and G and Figure 3—figure supplement 2D ) and avoidance ( Figure 3H ). Moreover, sugar supplementation did not affect UPRER and immunity in normal food ( OP50 ) or starved condition ( NGM ) ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2E–F ). While sugar effectively inhibits the HK-E. coli-induced UPRER and immune response, it does not fully suppress it to the extent observed with live-E. coli ( Figure 3C–F ). This implies that additional nutrients present in live-E. coli might also contribute to the inhibition of UPRER and immune response. Previous studies have shown that heat-killed E. coli ( HK-E. coli ) is a low-quality food source that cannot support the growth of C. elegans larvae ( Qi and Han, 2018; Qi et al., 2017 ), whereas supplementation with vitamin B2 ( VB2 ) can restore animal growth ( Qi et al., 2017 ). Here, we found that sugar deficiency in HK-E. coli induces the UPRER-immune response and avoidance behavior in C. elegans. Given this, we investigated whether sugar supplementation could promote animal growth when fed HK-E. coli. To our surprise, supplementing HK-E. coli with carbohydrates ( D-Glc, D-GlcA ) did not support animal development ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2G ), suggesting that carbohydrates are not sufficient for supporting animal growth on this food source. However, we did find that carbohydrates are critical for inhibiting the UPRER-immune response induced by sugar deficiency in HK-E. coli. Together, these findings suggest that HK-E. coli induces a stress response and avoidance behavior in animals, which can be inhibited by D- ( + ) -glucose supplementation. This implies that animals may evaluate the sugar deficiency from HK-E. coli through the activation of UPRER and immune responses

. However, it is still unclear whether UPRER and innate immunity evaluate food quality under physiological conditions. Our study provides evidence that low-quality food ( HK-E. coli ) activates both UPRER and p-PMK-1, leading to animals leaving the low-quality food. Previously finding have shown that inhibition of ER function promotes C. elegans avoid to the toxic food, which employs the MLK-1/MEK-1/KGB-1 pathway ( Melo and Ruvkun, 2012 ). Notably, HK-E. coli induced avoidance behavior is independent of the KGB-1 pathway ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ). Additionally, our study reveals that neuronal UPRER and PMK-1 are essential for evaluating low-quality food, suggesting that the nervous system plays a critical role in assessing food quality. Previous studies have shown that XBP1 deficiency in intestinal epithelial cells leads to IRE1a hyperactivation and increased JNK phosphorylation in the epithelial compartment in vivo ( Kaser et al., 2008 ). The IRE1-XBP1 axis has been identified as a critical protective branch of the Unfolded Protein Response ( UPR ) induced secondary to an innate immune response in the presence of P. aeruginosa ( Kaser and Blumberg, 2010; Richardson et al., 2010 ). The p38 MAPK has also been shown to directly act on the phosphorylation of IRE-1 to promote the stress response ( Guan et al., 2020; Qu et al., 2019 ). Interestingly, IRE-1 has been found to confer cold resistance independently of XBP-1 by activating JNK-1 in epithelial cells ( Kaser et al,2008 ). Therefore, the IRE-X1BP-1 and p38 MAPK axis is a critical for evaluating low-quality food through UPR and innate immunity in the nervous system.

    Title: 
    Abstract: As a major class of biomolecules, carbohydrates play indispensable roles in various biological processes. However, it remains largely unknown how carbohydrates directly modulate important drug targets, such as G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ). Here, we employed P2Y purinoceptor 14 ( P2Y14 ), a drug target for inflammation and immune responses, to uncover the sugar nucleotide activation of GPCRs. Integrating molecular dynamics simulation with functional study, we identified the uridine diphosphate ( UDP ) -sugar-binding site on P2Y14, and revealed that a UDP-glucose might activate the receptor by bridging the transmembrane ( TM ) helices 2 and 7. Between TM2 and TM7 of P2Y14, a conserved salt bridging chain ( K2. 60-D2. 64-K7. 35-E7. 36 [KDKE] ) was identified to distinguish different UDP-sugars, including UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. We identified the KDKE chain as a conserved functional motif of sugar binding for both P2Y14 and P2Y purinoceptor 12 ( P2Y12 ), and then designed three sugar nucleotides as agonists of P2Y12. These results not only expand our understanding for activation of purinergic receptors but also provide insights for the carbohydrate drug development for GPCRs.

    As significant components of the organism, carbohydrates play indispensable roles in energy supply, cell signaling, and immune responses ( Gagneux and Varki, 1999 ). Dysregulation of carbohydrates has been proved to be associated with the development of various diseases ( Reily et al., 2019 ). However, it is still elusive how carbohydrates directly act on major therapeutic targets, including G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) ( Cheng and Jiang, 2019; Hauser et al., 2017 ). P2Y purinoceptor 14 ( P2Y14 ) represents an outstanding model system for understanding carbohydrate modulation of GPCRs. It belongs to P2Y purinoceptor subfamily, consisting of receptors responding to nucleotides, including adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) and UDP ( Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998 ). Distinct from the other purinoceptors, P2Y14 is potently activated by UDP and a class of carbohydrates, that is, UDP-sugars ( Abbracchio et al., 2006; Jacobson et al., 2020 ). UDP-sugars activate P2Y14 with a relative potency order of UDP-glucose ( UDP-Glc ), UDP-galactose ( UDP-Gal ), UDP-glucuronic acid ( UDP-GlcA ), and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine ( UDP-GlcNAc ) ( Chambers et al., 2000; Hamel et al., 2011; Ko et al., 2009; Ko et al., 2007 ). These sugar nucleotides act as important signaling molecules via P2Y14 to mediate many physiological processes ( Amison et al., 2017; Breton and Brown, 2018; Ferreira et al., 2017; Lazarowski, 2010; Müller et al., 2005; Sesma et al., 2016 ). Particularly, UDP-Glc regulates immune responses and associate with asthma, kidney injury, and lung inflammation ( Amison et al., 2017; Breton and Brown, 2018; Ferreira et al., 2017; Müller et al., 2005; Sesma et al., 2016 ). As an isomer of UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal is present in various cell models, including physiologically relevant primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells ( Lazarowski, 2010 )

., 2014a ). The close parallel of P2Y12 and P2Y14 in the agonist-induced conformational changes indicates a common ligand-induced activation mechanism shared by purinergic receptors. In addition, in the studies involving the other UDP-sugars, we also found that the interactions between sugar-moieties of agonists with TM7 ( E2787. 36 ) is determinant for UDP-sugars’ potencies ( Figure 3 ). The carbohydrate-binding site has not been fully characterized for GPCRs. Except for P2Y14, it has not been reported that the other members of P2Y12-like subfamily can be directly activated by carbohydrates. Integrated computational modeling with mutagenesis study, we identified a conserved carbohydrate-binding motif ( KDKE ) for both P2Y14 and P2Y12 ( Figure 4 ). The KDKE motif not only participates in receptor activation by bridging TM2 and TM7 ( K772. 60, D812. 64, K2777. 35, and E2787. 36 ) ( Figure 2 ), but also recognize different sugar moieties, including glucose, galactose, glucuronic acid, and N-acetylglucosamine groups ( Figure 3, Figure 4 ). Remarkably, this KDKE motif can distinguish isomers as UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal. Our MD simulations showed that KDKE motif attracted the 6’ hydroxyl group of glucose and interacted with the 4’ hydroxyl group of galactose ( Figure 3C and F ). Consistent with our observations, a previous structure-activity relationship study revealed that selective mono-fluorination of the 6’ hydroxyl group of the glucose moiety results to fourfold less potency on P2Y14 ( Ko et al., 2009 ). As another member of P2Y12-like subfamily, P2Y13 also has the conserved KDKE site ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ), suggesting it might be regulated by carbohydrates. GPR87 is a close homolog of P2Y14 with the sequence identity of 44. 94%. GPR87 has K/R2. 60, D2. 64, K/E7. 35, and E7

. It remains unknown how these sugar nucleotides are recognized by P2Y14. As the closest homolog to P2Y14, P2Y purinoceptor 12 ( P2Y12 ) has not been reported to be activated by any sugar nucleotide ( Jacobson et al., 2020; Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998 ). P2Y12 is potently activated ADP. The reported agonist-bound structures of P2Y12 provide insights to understand the nucleotide activation of P2Y purinoceptors. The crystal structures of P2Y12 show that a full agonist 2-methylthio-adenosine-5’-diphosphate ( 2MeSADP, a close analogue of ADP ) binds to an extracellular pocket consisting of transmembrane ( TM ) helices and extracellular loops ( Zhang et al., 2014a ). Since P2Y12 is highly similar to P2Y14 with 45. 67% amino acid sequence identity, it would be interesting to investigate whether this receptor is also sensible to sugar nucleotides. Here, we combined molecular docking, molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations, and functional study to reveal the molecular mechanism how P2Y14 is activated by a sugar nucleotide. The ligand-binding models of different UDP-sugars ( UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcA, and UDP-GlcNAc ) were quantitatively characterized to identify the sugar recognition site of P2Y14. Both P2Y14 and P2Y12 were employed to unveil a conserved sugar-binding motif. Multiple carbohydrates were designed and validated as their agonists targeting the conserved functional motif.

. 60-D812. 64-K2777. 35-E2787. 36 salt bridging chain as an important functional site for sugar moiety recognition and UDP-sugar activation of P2Y14. These four residues ( K2. 60, D2. 64, K7. 35, and E7. 36 ) are conserved between P2Y14 and its closest homolog, that is, P2Y12 ( Figure 4A, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ). Therefore, we assumed that P2Y12 can also be activated by carbohydrate ligands. P2Y12 is activated by ADP ( Herbert and Savi, 2003 ), but it has not been reported to be activated by any sugar nucleotide. To validate our assumption, we designed and synthesized three ADP-sugars, that is, ADP-glucose ( ADP-Glc ), ADP-glucuronic acid ( ADP-GlcA ), and ADP-mannose ( ADP-Man ), and then tested whether they can activate P2Y12 ( Figure 4B and C ). We docked ADP-Glc and ADP-Man to the X-ray structure of P2Y12 ( Zhang et al., 2014a ). The docking scores are –9. 4 and – 8.4 kcal/mol, respectively ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ), indicating that both AD-Glc and AD-Man can bind to P2. We then tested AD-Glc, AD-GA, and AD-Man as agonists of P2 ( Figure 4B and C ). AD-Glc and AD-Man activated P2 with EC50 values of 1. 5 and 1.5 mM, respectively ( Figure 4C ). AD-GA did not activate P2 at concentrations up to 1 mM ( Figure 4C ). These results indicate that AD-Glc and AD-Man are agonists of P2, but AD-G is not. The EC50 values of AD-Glc and AD-Man are comparable to that of AD ( Herbert Savi,2003 ), suggesting that these AD-sug are potent agonists of P2. Our results provide the first evidence that P2 can be activated by sugar nucleotides and expand our understanding of the activation mechanism of purinergic receptors.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Stem cell niche is critical for regulating the behavior of stem cells. Drosophila neural stem cells ( Neuroblasts, NBs ) are encased by glial niche cells closely, but it still remains unclear whether glial niche cells can regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of NBs. Here, we show that ferritin produced by glia, cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for the energy production, which is essential to the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs. The knockdown of glial ferritin encoding genes causes energy shortage in NBs via downregulating aconitase activity and NAD+ level, which leads to the low proliferation and premature differentiation of NBs mediated by Prospero entering nuclei. More importantly, ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression. In addition, the level of glial ferritin production is affected by the status of NBs, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis. In this study, we demonstrate that glial cells are indispensable to maintain the self-renewal of NBs, unveiling a novel role of the NB glial niche during brain development.

   . The bicellular iron homeostasis mechanism makes glial cells the main pool for ferritin production, relieving NBs from the need to produce ferritin and transferring the potential risk of iron overload-induced oxidative stress to glial cells. Furthermore, glial cells can subsequently clear oxidative stress through lipid droplets ( Bailey et al., 2015 ), ensuring normal NB function during neural development. It is intriguing to explore whether bicellular iron homeostasis exists in other stem cells and their niches. When normal NBs are converted into immortal tumor NBs, becoming highly proliferative, they need more nutrients including iron ( Bonnay et al., 2020; van den Ameele and Brand, 2019 ). In response, more ferritin is generated to transport iron from the glial cells to NBs. However, it is unclear how NBs communicate with glial cells to determine the level of ferritin production. It’s interesting to identify the specific cues from NBs that regulate the level of ferritin in future studies. In addition, iron distribution in the Drosophila brain is not observed due to low iron concentration and technical limitations in iron detection, which results in a lack of direct evidence for iron trafficking via ferritin.

., 2011; Navarro et al., 2015 ). Previous researches have shown that Drosophila ferritin not only directly participates in dietary iron absorption by removing iron from enterocytes across the basolateral membrane, but competes with transferrin to deliver iron between the gut and the fat body ( Tang and Zhou, 2013; Xiao et al., 2019 ). These findings underscore the pivotal role of ferritin in iron transport. Interestingly, iron-loaded ferritin, serving as an essential mitogen, promotes proliferation of cultured Drosophila cells ( Li, 2010 ). Therefore, it is tempting to investigate whether ferritin is required for self-renewal and the proliferation of NSCs during brain development. Here, we show that glial ferritin supplies iron into NBs to form iron-sulfur ( Fe-S ) clusters, which is necessary for the production of ATP, providing the energy required for self-renewal and proliferation of NBs, highlighting ferritin as a potential target for suppressing tumor.

., 2013 ), and found that DFP alone did not cause any brain defects in wild-type ( WT ) larvae, but it significantly exacerbated the effect of glial ferritin knockdown on defective NB maintenance ( Figure 3B and C ). Furthermore, we attempted to rescue the brain defects observed in glial ferritin knockdown by providing dietary FAC, but the effect was negligible ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1E and F ). This may be due to the possibility that the knockdown of glial ferritin largely, if not completely, prevented the transport of iron from glia to NBs, which hindered the additional iron from entering NBs. These results indicate that the NB loss phenotype induced by glial ferritin knockdown is primarily due to iron deficiency in NBs. Zip13, generally known as a zinc transporter, functions as an iron transporter, cooperating with ferritin on iron transport in the Drosophila intestine ( Xiao et al., 2014 ). Specifically, the knockdown of Zip13 leads to failure of iron loading in secretory vesicles and consequently defective iron efflux ( Xiao et al., 2014 ). To investigate whether the NB loss phenotype of glial ferritin knockdown is caused by defective iron transport, we next sought to identify the role of Zip13 in the larval brain. First, we examined the expression pattern of Zip13 and found that, similar to ferritin, the DsRed stinger driven by Zip13-GAL4 was co-localized with Repo in glial cells rather than Dpn in NBs ( Figure 3D and D’ ). Subsequently, we knocked down Zip13 in glial cells and observed a similar but weaker phenotype with a slightly reduced NB number and proliferation rate ( Figure 3E–G ). Consistently, the defective brain development was confirmed in the Zip13 mutant ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1G–I ). Moreover, the effect of double knockdown of both Zip13 and Fer2LCH was much more severe than that of either single knockdown, with a significant reduction in NB number and proliferation rate ( Figure 3E–G )

. Furthermore, we found that the reduced proliferation rate caused by Zip13 knockdown could be partially rescued by iron supplementation in the food ( Figure 3H and I ). Overall, these results suggest that glial ferritin collaborates with Zip13 to deliver iron from glia to NBs. Since previous studies have demonstrated the essential role of glial cells in NB survival and proliferation ( Bailey et al., 2015; Read, 2018 ), it is possible that iron overload in glial cells up-regulated the level of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ), leading to apoptosis of glial cells, which ultimately resulted in the loss of NBs. To rule out this possibility, firstly, we examined the ROS level of glial ferritin knockdown via a transgenic reporter GstD-GFP for oxidative stress signaling ( Sykiotis and Bohmann, 2008 ). GstD1 is a prototypical oxidative stress response gene ( Sawicki et al., 2003 ). We found an obvious increase as expected ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B ). However, overexpressing anti-oxidant genes in glial cells or NBs did not restore the NB number and proliferation ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2C and D ). ROS accumulation leads to lipid peroxidation, which in turn results in ferroptosis ( Hirschhorn and Stockwell, 2019 ). Mitochondria in cells undergoing ferroptosis typically exhibit a characteristic shrinkage and damage, while the nuclei remain structurally intact ( Mumbauer et al., 2019 ). In order to investigate whether the NB loss is due to ferroptosis, we examined the mitochondrial morphology using Transmission Electron Microscopy ( TEM ). However, our result showed that the mitochondrial double membrane and cristae were clearly visible whether in the control group or glial ferritin knockdown group, which suggested that ferroptosis was not the main cause of NB loss upon glial ferritin knockdown ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2E and F )

. To investigate whether the ferritin was transported from glia to NBs via the vesicular transport, we expressed a temperature-sensitive dominant-negative Shibire dynamin protein ( shits ) to block vesicle trafficking from glial cells, and found that Fer1HCH::GFP accumulated in glia, accompanying with significantly diminished Fer1HCH signal in NBs ( Figure 2D, D’ and E ), suggesting glial ferritin secretes into NBs through vesicle system. Given that ferritin is required for iron storage as well as delivery, glial ferritin knockdown might increase the free iron level, leading to glial iron overload. Alternatively, it will block the iron transport from glia to NBs, resulting in NB iron deficiency. To determine the underlying cause of the brain development defects observed upon glial ferritin knockdown, we used iron chelator or iron salt ferric ammonium citrate ( FAC ) to manipulate iron intake and detect how it will influence NBs. We observed that depriving iron intake by adding iron chelator bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid disodium ( BPS ) to the food led to a dramatic decrease in the number and proliferation rate of NBs, compared to control larvae on normal food ( Figure 3A ). To investigate the effect of feeding behavior in different foods, we tested the feeding behavior of flies by incorporating 1% Brilliant Blue ( sigma, 861146 ) into different foods ( Tanimura et al., 1982 ) and found the amount of dye in the fly body was similar between normal group and BPS group ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ), which suggested that BPS almost did not affect the feeding behavior. In line with this result, blocking iron absorption by knocking down intestinal ferritin ( Tang and Zhou, 2013 ) resulted in the similar defects in NB as glial ferritin knockdown ( Figure 3— supplement B and C ). These results indicate that glial ferritin knockdown leads to iron deficiency in NB, not iron overload in glial cells. Furthermore, we found that the level of glial ferritin is affected by the status of NB, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis. This is supported by the fact that glial ferritin is upregulated in the presence of NB and downregulated in the absence of NB ( Figure 3— supplement D and E ), suggesting that glial cells sense the status of NB and adjust the level of ferritin to maintain iron homeostasis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that glial cells are indispensable for the self-renewal of NB, unveiling a novel role of the glial niche during brain development, and ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression.
Researchers investigated the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 in the US population during the pandemic, analyzing multiple cause-of-death data for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. They found that cancer mortality rose by 3% over the pre-pandemic baseline, corresponding to 13,600 excess deaths, with higher elevations in less deadly cancers (breast, colorectal, and hematological) and lower in cancers with poor survival (lung and pancreatic). In contrast, there were substantial elevations in deaths from diabetes (37) and Alzheimer's (19). To understand these differences, they simulated expected mortality for each condition using COVID-19 rates, life expectancy, population size, and age of individuals with each condition, finding that observed differences primarily explained by life expectancy, with risk of death from deadly cancers outcompeting COVID-19 risk.

The study considered six cancer types and found modest elevation in mortality during the pandemic, highlighting the importance of multiple-cause records to reflect changes in coding practices. They propose that lack of excess mortality reflects competing risk from cancer, especially deadly types, rather than protection from immunosup. Hematological cancers showed a pronounced elevation compared to other cancers and expectations, aligning with a particular group in cohort studies. Future research should focus on additional outcomes, such as hospitalizations, COVID, changes in screening, and longer-term patterns.

For diabetes, there were 10,800 and 82,300 excess deaths (UC and MC, respectively), corresponding to significant elevations 16 and 37 over baseline. Alzheimer's had 850 and 21,700 excess, corresponding significant elevations 9 and 19. Pandemic excess was also seen in IHD and kidney disease. State-level analyses revealed no notable increases in cancer, but modest non-significant in cancer. The largest increase was in NY, with 6 rise in cancer above baseline. The magnitude varied by type, minimal in pancreatic and lung, higher in colorectal, hematological, and breast. Comparison showed significant elevations in Alzheimer and diabetes during this wave 49 and 128.

To understand expected elevation, simulations gauged individual-level association between COVID-19 and conditions, consistent with population patterns. Using cancer as example, two factors drive mortality, size and age of population with, and life expectancy under diagnosis. The same applies to other conditions, such as diabetes or Alzheimer. A simple model of COVID-19 for individuals with conditions was designed, projecting excess under the hypothesis condition not a risk for mortality, only demography affecting. The model projected 40 nationally and 62 at state, for cancer, and 28 and 191 for Alzheimer's, largely by age. Analysis reveals 19 and 18, which is lower than hypothesis. The demographic supports COVID will differently in population excess for each condition, even no biological association.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The R-loop is a common transcriptional by-product that consists of an RNA-DNA duplex joined to a displaced strand of genomic DNA. While the effects of R-loops on health and disease are well established, there is still an incomplete understanding of the cellular processes responsible for their removal from eukaryotic genomes. Here, we show that a core regulator of chromosome architecture —the Smc5/6 complex— plays a crucial role in the removal of R-loop structures formed during gene transcription. Consistent with this, budding yeast mutants defective in the Smc5/6 complex and enzymes involved in R-loop resolution show strong synthetic interactions and accumulate high levels of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in their chromosomes. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in vivo and promotes R-loop degradation by the RNase H2 enzyme in vitro. Collectively, our results reveal a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of toxic R-loops formed at highly transcribed genes and telomeres. 

    Supporting Text:
   ., 2018; Chang et al., 2019 ). Consistent with this, we have previously shown that the Smc5/6 complex can bind to short RNA-DNA duplexes with high affinity and specificity ( Serrano et al., 2020 ). Together, these results raise the intriguing possibility that the Smc5/6 complex might be involved in the detection and/or processing of toxic R-loops formed in eukaryotic genomes. Here, we show that the Smc5/6 complex is directly involved in the repair of unscheduled R-loops generated by a diverse set of genomic transactions. In particular, we demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex binds strongly to R-loop structures formed during active gene transcription and promotes RNase H2-mediated degradation of the RNA component of R-loops. Our results unravel a hitherto unanticipated role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of RNA structures from chromosomes, an essential function for the maintenance of genome integrity and cell fitness.

., 2020; Tanasie et al., 2022 ). It is interesting to note that most of the nuclear processes outlined above involve the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids in one form or another ( Brambati et al., 2020; Petermann et al., 2022 ). As such, the function we uncovered for the Smc5/6 complex in RNA-DNA metabolism may be a unifying role that explains its involvement in such a diverse repertoire of cellular functions. More work will be required to test this exciting possibility. In conclusion, our work demonstrates a direct and active involvement of the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of R-loops from eukaryotic chromosomes. We showed the Smc5/6 complex binds strongly to RNA-DNA hybrid structures formed during active gene transcription and telomere length regulation, and subsequently promotes the removal of these toxic structures via the stimulation of RNase H2 enzymatic activity. This work uncovered a previously unanticipated contribution of the Smc5/6 complex in genome stability with important ramifications for the health and disease of all eukaryotic organisms.

. RNase H1 and RNase H2 are the primary enzymes responsible for the removal of R-loops in chromosomes, but recent studies suggest that RNase H2 is the only one that acts throughout the cell cycle ( Lockhart et al., 2019; Zimmer and Koshland, 2016 ). Consistent with this, we also observed a remarkably strong genetic interaction when combining Smc5/6 complex mutations with RNase H2 enzyme inactivation ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ). We therefore tested the impact of the human SMC5/6 complex on the catalytic activity of purified human RNase H2 enzyme in a reconstituted R-loop degradation assay ( Figure 6A ). Similar to the EMSA, we introduced a 32P radiolabel on the RNA moiety of our R-loop substrate to allow direct visualization of RNA degradation ( Figure 6B and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ). We first confirmed that human RNase H2 was able to cleave the radiolabeled RNA in a time and concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B ). We also observed that the purified RNase H2 enzyme was not active on a D-loop structure, thereby demonstrating the specificity of the enzyme in our reaction conditions ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1C ). Next, we incubated increasing concentrations of the SMC5/6 complex with the R-loop substrate in the absence of RNase H2. Under these conditions, the complex did not induce degradation of the RNA moiety or otherwise affect the stability of the R-loop structure ( lanes 2–6; Figure 6C ). However, in the presence of low levels of RNase H2 enzyme, the same concentrations of SMC5/6 complex induced a major stimulation of R-loop degradation. This led to a rapid accumulation of radiolabeled product at the bottom of the gel ( lanes 8–12; Figure 6C ), reflecting the nucleolytic processing of the RNA moiety within the R-loop by RNase H2

The incorporation of RNA in chromosomal DNA represents a unique challenge for the stability of eukaryotic genomes because this modification can occur in both physiological and pathogenic conditions. Maintaining a finely balanced cycle of R-loop formation and removal in chromosomes is crucial for the overall fitness of cells because altered RNA-DNA hybrid homeostasis can result in DNA damage and genomic instability, ultimately contributing to the development of several pathological conditions ( Mackay et al., 2020; Crossley et al., 2023 ). Here, we show that the Smc5/6 complex promotes the removal of toxic R-loops in eukaryotic chromosomes. While previous genetic experiments have supported a role for the Smc5/6 complex in the natural regulation of TERRA levels at telomeres ( Lafuente-Barquero et al., 2017; Moradi-Fard et al., 2016 ), our study reports the first demonstration that Smc5/6 complex activity is essential for the removal of unscheduled R-loops from the genome. This discovery is significant because non-physiological R-loops represent the most toxic and damaging source of RNA-DNA hybrids for genome stability ( Crossley et al., 2019; Brambati et al., 2020; Petermann et al., 2022 ) and failure to remove these structures exacts a heavy toll on cell fitness. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the Smc5/6 complex can directly recognize R-loops, suggesting an early role in the detection and repair of these structures in vivo ( see model in Figure 7 ). Consistent with this suggestion, the Smc5/6 complex has been shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation to accumulate at sites that are common R-loop enrichment zones on chromosomes, including the rDNA locus, telomeres, and highly transcribed/difficult-to-replicate chromosomal loci ( Diman et al., 2023; Jeppsson et al., 2023; Jeppsson et al., 2014; Pebernard et al., 2008 )

., 2023 ). In addition, factors associated with transcription and mRNA biogenesis, RNA-DNA helicases, topoisomerases, chromatin remodelers, and several DNA repair enzymes are known to be involved alongside RNase H in preventing the accumulation of R-loop structures in eukaryotic chromosomes ( García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019 ). However, a definitive understanding of the sequence of events and exact molecular mechanisms responsible for the repair of R-loops/RNA-DNA hybrids remains to be established. Work from our laboratory and other researchers provides hints of a possible involvement of structural maintenance of chromosomes ( SMC ) -type complexes in RNA-DNA hybrid metabolism ( Lafuente-Barquero et al., 2017; Serrano et al., 2020; Girasol et al., 2023; Penzo et al., 2023 ). SMC complexes are effectors of large-scale changes in chromosome organization and include three evolutionarily conserved enzyme complexes: condensin, cohesin, and the Smc5/6 complex ( Peng and Zhao, 2023 ). The Smc5/6 complex is a particularly intriguing member of this family because its function —unlike that of cohesin and condensin— is primarily concerned with DNA repair, and yet its exact contribution to this process is not fully understood. Recent evidence suggests that the Smc5/6 complex is a DNA compacting enzyme that acts in vivo by regulating local chromatin domains containing unusual DNA structures that can lead to replication stress and/or DNA damage ( Serrano et al., 2020; Gutierrez-Escribano et al., 2020; Tanasie et al., 2022; Pradhan et al., 2023 ). Interestingly, genome-wide screens as well as targeted genetic analyses revealed synthetic interactions among a subset of mutants affecting Smc5/6 complex components and RNA-DNA hybrid detoxification enzymes ( Lafuente-Barquero et al., 2017; Costanzo et al, 2019 ), suggesting that the Sm5/6 complex might be involved in the removal of R-loops. Here, we demonstrate that the Sm5/6 complex is directly involved in the removal of R-loops formed during transcription and telomere regulation, and that this function is mediated by the stimulation of RNase2 enzymatic activity.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Preserved communication abilities promote healthy ageing. To this end, the age-typical loss of sensory acuity might in part be compensated for by an individual’s preserved attentional neural filtering. Is such a compensatory brain–behaviour link longitudinally stable? Can it predict individual change in listening behaviour? We here show that individual listening behaviour and neural filtering ability follow largely independent developmental trajectories modelling electroencephalographic and behavioural data of N = 105 ageing individuals ( 39–82 y ). First, despite the expected decline in hearing-threshold-derived sensory acuity, listening-task performance proved stable over 2 y. Second, neural filtering and behaviour were correlated only within each separate measurement timepoint ( T1, T2 ). Longitudinally, however, our results raise caution on attention-guided neural filtering metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening behaviour: neither neural filtering at T1 nor its 2-year change could predict individual 2-year behavioural change, under a combination of modelling strategies.

   . 001; 1/f slope: r = 0. 78, p<0. 001 ). These findings provide a reference level on reliability, demonstrating that the weak reliability of the neural filtering metric is not due primarily to differences in EEG signal quality across sessions. The temporal instability of neural filtering challenges its status as a candidate trait-like neural marker of attentive listening ability. At the same time, irrespective of the degree of reliability of neural filtering itself, across individuals it may still be reliably linked to the behavioural outcome ( Figure 1 ). This will be addressed next. On the basis of the full ( T1 and T2 ) dataset, we aimed to replicate our key T1 results and test whether the previously observed between-subjects brain–behaviour relationship would hold across time: we expected an individual’s neural filtering ability to impact their listening performance ( accuracy and response speed ) independently of age or hearing status ( Tune et al., 2021 ). Given the moderately strong correlation of age and hearing acuity ( r = –0. 43; p<0. 001; Figure 2B ), we employed causal mediation analysis to model the direct as well as the hearing-acuity-mediated effect of age on the behavioural outcome ( Imai et al., 2010 ). To formally test the stability of direct and indirect relationships across time, we used a moderated mediation analysis. In this analysis, the inclusion of interactions by timepoint tested whether the influence of age, sensory acuity, and neural filtering on behaviour varied significantly across time. Our expectations on the direct relationships were indeed borne out by the data: higher age was associated with poorer hearing ability ( β = –0. 43, SE = 0. 09, p<0. 001 ) and listening performance ( speed: β = –0. 33, SE = 0. 06, p<0. 001; accuracy: β = –0. 26, SE = 0. 06, p<0. 001 ). Better hearing ability, on the other hand, boosted accuracy but not response speed ( accuracy: β = 0. 30, SE = 0. 1, p=0

., 2017 ). Using auditory cognition as a model system, we here aim to overcome this limitation by testing directly the hitherto unknown longitudinal stability of neural filtering as a neural compensatory mechanism upholding communication success. Going further, we ask to what extent an individual’s attentional neural-filtering ability measured at a given moment is able to predict their future trajectory in listening performance. Only if this is the case, and only if such an association can plausibly be assumed to be causal for future changes in communication ability, neural filtering would be a potential translational target. We here aim to fill this gap by analysing 2-year changes in the sensory, neural, and behavioural domain in a longitudinal subsample ( N = 105; 39–82 y ) of the original AUDADAPT cohort ( Tune et al., 2021; Figure 2A ). We apply a combination of advanced cross-sectional and longitudinal modelling strategies to address the following specific research questions ( Figure 1 ). First, by focusing on each domain individually, we ask how sensory, neural, and behavioural functioning evolve cross-sectionally across the middle and older adult lifespan ( Figure 1B ). More importantly, we also ask how they change longitudinally across the studied 2-year period ( Figure 1C, Q1 ), and whether ageing individuals differ significantly in their degree of change ( Q2 ). We expect individuals’ hearing acuity and behaviour to decrease from T1 to T2. Since we previously observed inter-individual differences in neural filtering to be independent of age and hearing status, we did not expect any systematic longitudinal change in neural filtering. Second, we test the longitudinal stability of the previously observed age- and hearing-loss-independent effect of neural filtering on both accuracy and response speed ( Figure 1A )

. To this end, we analyse the multivariate direct and indirect relationships of hearing acuity, neural filtering, and listening behaviour within and across timepoints. Third, leveraging the strengths of latent change score modelling ( LCSM ) ( McArdle, 2009; Kievit et al., 2018 ), we fuse cross-sectional and longitudinal perspectives to probe the role of neural filtering as a precursor of behavioural change in two different ways: we ask whether an individual’s T1 neural filtering strength can predict the observed behavioural longitudinal change ( Q3 ), and whether 2-year change in neural filtering can explain concurrent change in listening behaviour ( Q4 ). Here, irrespective of the observed magnitude and direction of T1–T2 developments, two scenarios are conceivable: Intra-individual neural and behavioural change may be either be correlated—lending support to a compensatory role of neural filtering—or instead follow independent trajectories ( Oschwald et al., 2019; Figure 1C ). Answering these questions is vital for understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of successful communication across the lifespan. Answering them will also critically inform the development of interventions targeted at maintaining or restoring communication success and therefore concerns basic and applied researchers alike.

., 2018; Buschman and Kastner, 2015 ). This entails that at a longer time scale, here captured by two distinct measurement timepoints, ageing individuals will differ with respect to their overall level of neural filtering and associated listening behaviour. Their level of neural and behavioural functioning will differ from other individuals’ levels at the same timepoint but also from their own level at a different timepoint. Moreover, a listener’s behavioural outcome at either timepoint is not only shaped by their broad neural attentional state with which they enter a communication situation. It is also critically influenced by short-term fluctuations in neural filtering strength around their current overall level of neural functioning ( Figure 4C; Tune et al., 2021 ). As our control analyses have revealed, these fluctuations are more pronounced if neural filtering is defined by the tracking of both attended and ignored speech rather than by attended-speech tracking alone. What does this mean for the potential translational value of neural tracking? Their highly dynamic nature gives neural tracking-based metrics value as online neural indicators of a listener’s momentary attentional focus. As such, they could serve as critical neural read-outs in novel brain–computer interfaces such as neurally steered hearing aids ( Van Eyndhoven et al., 2017; Ceolini et al., 2020; O’Sullivan et al., 2017 ). At the same time, however, their non-stationarity over time limits their potential as translational targets for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention ( Panela et al., 2024; Gillis et al., 2021; Di Liberto et al., 2022 ). As a second central query of the current study, we went beyond the establishment of robust brain–behaviour relationships and directly probed the potency of neural filtering to predict behavioural change over time ( Woo et al., 2017 )

., 2019 ). From the perspective of theoretical models of neurobiological and cognitive ageing ( Reuter-Lorenz and Park, 2014; Cabeza et al., 2018; Stern et al., 2019 ), the absence of correlated trajectories of neural and cognitive functioning may indeed be the more expected result. These models highlight the multifaceted nature of healthy cognitive ageing in which environmental variables, neurobiology, and cognition are dynamically interrelated ( Freund et al., 2013 ). Neural compensatory mechanisms, such as the neural filtering correlate targeted here, are thought to offset structural decline but are themselves influenced by a number of factors. This leads to increased inter-individual variability that may circumvent the emergence of group-level correlated change relationships. Importantly, the behavioural outcome of interest, that is, the speed and accuracy with which an ageing individual solves a difficult listening situation, involves the orchestration of different perceptual and cognitive processes ( Anderson et al., 2013; Peelle, 2016 ). We here focused on one candidate neurobiological implementation of an auditory attentional filter to help explain inter-individual differences in listening behaviour and its lifespan trajectories. Yet, ageing individuals may rely on different alternative neural or cognitive strategies ( Tune et al., 2018 ). A complete understanding of inter-individual differences in listening behaviour in ageing adults will therefore depend on a number of different factors among which the attention-modulated tracking of relevant sensory information is only one.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The perception of taste and flavour ( a combination of taste, smell, and chemesthesis ), here also referred to as chemosensation, enables animals to find high-value foods and avoid toxins. Humans have learned to use unpalatable and toxic substances as medicines, yet the importance of chemosensation in this process is poorly understood. Here, we generate tasting-panel data for botanical drugs and apply phylogenetic generalised linear mixed models to test whether intensity and complexity of chemosensory qualities as well as particular tastes and flavours can predict ancient Graeco-Roman drug use. We found chemosensation to be strongly predictive of therapeutic use: botanical drugs with high therapeutic versatility have simple yet intense tastes and flavours, and 21 of 22 chemosensory qualities predicted at least one therapeutic use. In addition to the common notion of bitter tasting medicines, we also found starchy, musky, sweet, and soapy drugs associated with versatility. In ancient Greece and Rome, illness was thought to arise from imbalance in bodily fluids or humours, yet our study suggests that uses of drugs were based on observed physiological effects that are often consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste receptor pharmacology.

   . We further hypothesise that associations between perceived complexity and intensity of chemosensory qualities of botanical drugs and their versatility ( number of categories of therapeutic use a botanical drug is recommended for ) provide insights into the development of empirical pharmacological knowledge and therapeutic behaviour. If tastes and flavours, as determined by a modern-day tasting panel, do predict uses as recorded in ancient texts, this would be an unprecedented insight into how chemosensation in combination with physiological effects guided human behaviour in pre-historic times and conditioned therapeutic expectations and humoral theory in historic times. To test these hypotheses, we assessed the relationships between chemosensory qualities, their intensity, and complexity with therapeutic uses of botanical drugs described in Pedanios Dioscorides’ pharmacognostic compendium, De Materia Medica ( DMM; Matthioli, 1970; Staub et al., 2016 ), the foremost pharmaceutical source of antiquity. DMM compiles knowledge on the sourcing, preparation, and therapeutic consensus of botanical drugs traded and used in the Eastern Mediterranean region of the Roman Empire during the first century CE ( Riddle, 1985 ). We collected 700 botanical drugs described in DMM ( Supplementary file 1 ) and used quality descriptors to represent chemosensation by a trained tasting panel scoring each botanical drug for presence and intensity of each quality ( Figure 1; Supplementary files 2 and 3 ). We arranged the botanical drugs into therapeutic uses according to affected organs, therapeutic functions, diseases, and symptoms as indicated in DMM, and into broader and more inclusive categories of therapeutic use ( Figure 1; Supplementary files 1 and 4 ). By applying phylogenetic generalised linear mixed models ( PGLMMs ) to our data and a plant phylogeny ( Zanne et al

‘A bitter pill to swallow’ is just one of many common idioms referring to the taste of medicine, which from ancient to early modern times has relied mostly on botanical drugs ( Touwaide, 2022 ). In ancient Greece and Rome, the expected effects of botanical drugs were explained by their taste ( Jones, 1959; Einarson and Link, 1990; Jouanna, 2012 ) and according to the prevailing medical theory, disease resulted from a disequilibrium between bodily fluids or humours including phlegm, blood, yellow bile, and black bile; drugs affected the flow and balance of these humours ( Jones, 1959; King, 2013 ). Theophrastus ( 300 BCE ) attributed sweet the capacity to smoothen, astringent with the power to desiccate and solidify, pungent with the capacity to cut or to separate out the heat, salty with desiccating and irritating properties, and bitter with the capacity to melt and irritate ( Einarson and Link, 1990 ). Other systems of medicine, such as Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, continue to classify materia medica according to tastes and flavours ( Dragos and Gilca, 2018; Shou-zhong, 1998 ), and indigenous societies use chemosensory qualities to select botanical drugs ( Casagrande, 2000; Leonti et al., 2002; Shepard, 2004 ). The perception of taste and flavour ( a combination of taste, smell, and chemesthesis ), here also referred to as chemosensation, has evolved to meet nutritional requirements and is particularly important in omnivores for seeking out nutrients and avoiding toxins ( Rozin and Todd, 2016; Breslin, 2013; Glendinning, 2022 ). The rejection of bitter stimuli has generally been associated with the avoidance of toxins ( Glendinning, 1994; Lindemann, 2001; Breslin, 2013 ) but to date no clear relationship between bitter compounds and toxicity at a nutritionally relevant dose could be established ( Glendinning, 1994; Nissim et al., 2017 )

., 2017 ). While bitter tasting metabolites occurring in fruits and vegetables have been linked with a lower risk for contracting cancer and cardiovascular diseases ( Drewnowski and Gomez-Carneros, 2000 ), the avoidance of pharmacologically active compounds is probably the reason why many medicines, including botanical drugs, taste bitter ( Johns, 1990; Mennella et al., 2013 ). Botanical drugs are chemically complex and often used for a range of different health problems ( Wagner et al., 2007 ). Chemical complexity determines pharmacological complexity, since different chemicals interact with different targets ( Gertsch, 2011 ), and influence taste complexity and intensity ( Spence and Wang, 2018; Breslin and Beauchamp, 1997; Green et al., 2010 ). Today, some associations between chemosensory qualities and therapeutic uses, such as bitter-tasting botanical drugs for stomach problems or astringent ones for diarrhoea, are still recognised in Western herbal medicine ( Wagner et al., 2007 ). These observations establish a role for chemosensory qualities in medicine. Yet, taste and flavour are largely irrelevant to modern medicine, aside from the pharmaceutical industry looking for ways to mask bad tastes ( Mennella et al., 2013 ). Whether ancient systems of traditional medicine could be relevant to modern science is questionable. The theory of humours was the principal underlying the concept of Western medicine from ancient Graeco-Roman times until the Industrial Age, but as an entirely discredited theory it might be expected that associated practices also lack scientific basis. However, we propose that taste and flavour perception of botanical drugs links humoral theory to modern medicine. We hypothesise that chemosensation and underlying physiological effects mediated by chemesthesis and taste receptor pharmacology co-explain the diversity of therapeutic uses of botanical drugs in ancient times

. 001 ) and cough ( px = 0. 002 ). More obviously, the intake of salt aggravates fluid retention and oedema, and this is likely the reason why remedies for dropsy and oedema ( diuretics ) are negatively associated with salty tastes ( px = 0. 023 ). While chemosensory qualities of botanical drugs and their physiological effects help to explain the persistence of humoral medicine until the 19th century, our study highlights the potential of chemosensory pharmacology in the development of herbal medicines. Botanical drugs with observed chemosensory profiles not aligned with those of their therapeutic use might represent drugs working beyond chemosensory pharmacology. Conversely, associations of chemosensory qualities with therapeutic uses of botanical drugs may certainly overlap with the presence of metabolites with specific therapy-relevant constituents acting beyond chemosensory pharmacology. This is, for instance, the case with opium ( dried milk sap of Papaver somniferum ) indicated for ‘cough’ and perceived as bitter ( Figure 3; Supplementary files 1 and 2 ) but at the same time containing alkaloids with central cough suppressant properties ( Dewick, 2001 ). Besides the associations discussed, other therapeutically relevant chemosensory receptor functions might be involved in the associations currently lacking explanations. While we are aware that the limitation of this study is the impossibility to address all associations found and the dependence on published pharmacological data for the explanatory part, our approach demonstrates the power of phylogenetic methods applied to human behaviour and assessment of plant properties. We show that chemosensory perception connects ancient therapeutic knowledge with modern science, even though aetiologies were fundamentally different in Graeco-Roman times

. As a measure of therapeutic versatility, we summed up the total number of broader categories of therapeutic use each botanical drug was recommended for. The chemosensory qualities of each of the 700 botanical drugs were assessed experimentally by trained human subjects using the sensory analysis technique Conventional Profiling ( International Standard, 1994 ) performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki ( World Medical Association, 2013 ) and the ethics guidelines of the Institute of Food Science & Technology ( Institute of Food Science and Technology, 2020 ). The design of the tasting panel was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Cagliari ( NP/2019/2020 ). The tasting panel consisted of 10 trained assessors, 5 males and 5 females, aged between 20 and 40 years old, with normal sense of taste and smell. Each assessor evaluated the intensity of each chemosens quality on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 indicated absence and 10 maximum intensity ( Figure 1; Supplementary files 2 and 3 ). The intensity of each chemens quality was calculated as the mean of the scores of the assessors. The complexity of chemens was calculated as the number of chemens qualities present ( Figure 1; Supplementary files 2 and 3 ). We used phylogenetic generalised linear models (PGLMs) to assess the relationship between chemens qualities, their intensity and complexity with the number of therapeutic categories each drug was used for. The phylogeny of the drugs was based on the plant phylogenetic tree of (Zanne et al. 2017 ). The phylogenetic analysis was performed in R (R Core Team,2019 ) using the package ‘phylogenetics’ (Revell et al,2017 ) and ‘phylogen’ (Rev et al,201 ). The phylogenetic models were fitted using the function ‘glmer’ of the package ‘lme4’ (Bates et al,2015 ) and ‘lme4’ ( Bates et al,201 ). The significance of the phylogen models was tested using the function ‘anova’ of the package ‘lme’ (Bates et al,201 ) and ‘me’ ( Bates et,201 ). The phylogen models were compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) (Burnham et al,2003 ) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) (Schwarz et al,2002 ) The phylogen model with the lowest AIC and BIC was selected as the best model. The significance of the associations between chemens qualities and therapeutic uses was tested using the function ‘anova’ of the package ‘me’ (Bates et,201 ) ‘me’ ( et,201 ) and ‘anova’ of the package ‘lme’ (Bates et,201 ) ‘me ( et,201. The associations were considered significant at p 0.05. The phylogen models were plotted using the package ‘ggplot2’ (Wickham et,2016 ) and ‘ggplot2’ Wickham,201 ) and ‘ggplot2’ Wickham,201. The phylogen models were visualised using the package ‘ggplot’ Wickham,201 and ‘plot’ Wickham,201 and ‘plot’ Wickham,.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae are associated with gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding and bacteremia and are a leading cause of death, from sepsis, for individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. The bacterial behaviors and mechanisms underlying why these bacteria are prone to bloodstream entry remain poorly understood. Herein, we report that clinical isolates of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter koseri are rapidly attracted toward sources of human serum. To simulate GI bleeding, we utilized an injection-based microfluidics device and found that femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to the serum source. This response is orchestrated through chemotaxis and the chemoattractant L-serine, an amino acid abundant in serum that is recognized through direct binding by the chemoreceptor Tsr. We report the first crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine and identify a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues. We find Tsr to be widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections. Lastly, we find that Enterobacteriaceae use human serum as a source of nutrients for growth and that chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr provide a competitive advantage for migration into enterohemorrhagic lesions. We define this bacterial behavior of taxis toward serum, colonization of hemorrhagic lesions, and the consumption of serum nutrients as ‘bacterial vampirism’, which may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteriaceae for bloodstream infections.

   . From this database of Tsr sequences, we were able to visualize the distribution of Tsr orthologues across biology, which strikingly are enriched among Enterobacteriaceae, but are also present in several other families that include WHO priority pathogens ( Figure 8B, Supplementary file 2 ). This analysis confirms that the bacterial species most commonly associated with bacteremia in patients with IBD possess the Tsr chemoreceptor ( Figure 8B, Supplementary file 2; Goren et al., 2020 ). In the context of Salmonella pathogenesis, it is interesting to note that diverse serovars, which vary in terms of host specificity and epidemiology, exhibit serum attraction and have the ability to utilize serum as a nutrient ( Figures 3 and 6 ). The specific nutrients responsible for the growth benefits derived from serum remain undefined; however, one potential candidate is the presence of energy-rich glycoconjugates, which were previously implicated as nutrients for bacteria within the inflamed intestine based on the upregulation of galactose utilization operons and the prevalence of lectin-positive stained tissue ( Stecher et al., 2008 ). Enteric Peyer’s patches are primary invasion sites for non-typhoidal Salmonella, and these structures are situated close to vasculature that can be damaged through the pathogen’s destruction of microfold ( M ) cells, causing localized bleeding ( Shi et al., 2012 ). S. enterica Typhimurium uses the chemoreceptor Tsr to locate and invade Peyer’s patches ( Rivera-Chávez et al., 2016 ), which could involve L-serine chemoattraction originating from serum or necrotic cells. Although GI bleeding is relatively uncommon in Salmonella infections overall, it afflicts 60% of infected children under the age of five ( White et al., 2019 )

We show here that the bacterial attraction response to serum is robust and rapid; the motile population reorganizes within 1–2 min of serum exposure to be significantly biased toward the serum source ( Figures 2 and 8 ). Serum taxis occurs through the cooperative action of multiple bacterial chemoreceptors that perceive several chemoattractant stimuli within serum, one of these being the chemoreceptor Tsr through recognition of L-serine ( Figure 4 ). While Tsr is known as a bacterial sensor of L-serine ( Zhou et al., 2023; Keegstra et al., 2022; Cassidy et al., 2020 ), the physiological sources of L-serine in the gut sensed by Tsr have not been well-defined. Although a major source is dietary, recent research has suggested that L-serine from damaged tissue may play a significant role in the diseased gut environment and drive opportunistic pathogenesis. In a study using a dextran sodium sulfate ( DSS ) -colitis model to investigate L-serine utilization by Enterobacteriaceae, L-serine was identified as a critical nutrient providing metabolic and growth advantages in the inflamed gut ( Kitamoto et al., 2020 ). Moreover, colitis was found to stimulate substantial increases in the luminal availability of most amino acids, with the average serine content nearly doubling ( Kitamoto et al., 2020 ). A notable characteristic of the DSS-colitis model is intestinal bleeding ( Kim et al., 2012 ), suggesting that the enrichment of amino acids, including serine, could be attributed to the leakage of host metabolites from serum. The ability of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae to exploit growth advantages from L-serine during colitis may be linked to their highly sensitive and rapid chemoattraction to this effector emitted from human serum. Our structural and molecular investigations into S

. Enterobacteriaceae are prone to bloodstream entry and are a leading cause of sepsis-related deaths in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases ( IBDs ) that have recurrent enterohemorrhagic lesions ( Weber et al., 2020; Goren et al., 2020 ). Intestinal intra-abdominal abscesses, microperforations, and fistulas associated with IBD predispose patients to GI bleeding and bacteremia ( Satoh et al., 2020; Vohra et al., 2020 ). Despite the established connection between Enterobacteriaceae-induced sepsis and GI bleeding, it remained unknown whether these bacteria perceive serum through chemosensing. Serum is a complex biological solution with components that may enhance, or hinder, bacterial growth. It offers a rich reservoir of nutrients for bacteria: sugars and amino acids at millimolar concentrations and essential metals like iron and zinc ( Zhou et al., 2023; Murdoch and Skaar, 2022 ). Yet, serum also contains host factors that inhibit bacterial proliferation in the bloodstream such as cathelicidin, defensins, and the complement system ( Cheng et al., 2019; Xu and Lu, 2020 ). Consequently, how enteric pathogens and pathobionts might respond to serum diffusing into a liquid environment remained unclear. To address this open question, we elucidated how Enterobacteriaceae species use chemosensing to respond to serum, the molecular mechanism of this response, and how chemosensing is employed to enter and migrate into enterohemorrhagic lesions. Across all examined scenarios we observe these bacteria to exhibit remarkable sensitivity and attraction toward human serum. These findings suggest that environmental stimuli unique to the dysbiotic gut, sensed through bacterial chemosensory systems, can encourage pathogenic behaviors and adverse consequences for the host.

. Second, we considered the possibility that the defect in serum attraction of the tsr mutant could be due to pleiotropic effects of the tsr deletion on chemotaxis signaling or motility, similar to the inhibited swimming motility of the trg mutant. We tested the ability of the tsr strain to respond to another chemoattractant, L-aspartate, which is sensed through the Tar chemoreceptor ( Figure 4A ). We found that the tsr mutant mounted a robust chemoattraction response to 500 µM L-aspartate, similar in magnitude and rate to WT ( Figure 5G ), supporting that chemotaxis to non-serine stimuli remains functional in the tsr strain. Along with the data showing the WT attraction to serum is diminished with serine racemase treatment, these results support that the mechanism of Tsr-mediated chemoattraction to serum is through direct recognition of L-serine. The robust serum attraction response conserved across diverse Salmonella serovars suggests serum, and L-serine present in serum, could be a source of nutrients during infection. Yet, serum also contains bactericidal factors that could inhibit bacterial growth ( Cheng et al., 2019 ). To address the uncertainty as to whether serum would benefit or inhibit bacterial growth, we added human serum to Salmonella in liquid culture grown on minimal media. In all strains surveyed, we found that serum addition enhances growth, and we saw no evidence of killing even for the highest serum concentrations tested ( Figure 6 ). The growth enhancement requires relatively little serum, as 2. 5% v/v is sufficient to provide a 1. 5–2. 5-fold growth increase ( Figure 6, https://public. vetmed. wsu. edu/Baylink ). L-serine is not only a chemoattractant, but also an important nutrient for bacteria in the gut ( Zhou et al., 2023 ), so we hypothesized the growth benefit could be from L-serine

. enterica to other bacterial species. The biological distribution of Tsr chemoreceptors has not been previously characterized, so we applied our structural insights to define a motif consisting of conserved among Tsr orthologues ( Figure 7 ). This motif is shared among Enterobacteraceae and numerous WHO priority pathogens ( Figure 8, Supplementary file 2 ), suggesting a conserved mechanism of chemosensing among these species. The conserved nature of Tsr among Enterobacteraceae and its role in chemosensing to serum may explain the proclivity of these bacteria for bloodstream infections. We propose the term ‘bacterial vampirism’ to describe the behavior of Enterobacteraceae using serum as a source of nutrients for growth and chemosensing to enterohemorrhagic lesions. This behavior may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteraceae for bloodstream infections in individuals with IBD.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Male germ cells share a common origin across animal species, therefore they likely retain a conserved genetic program that defines their cellular identity. However, the unique evolutionary dynamics of male germ cells coupled with their widespread leaky transcription pose significant obstacles to the identification of the core spermatogenic program. Through network analysis of the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species, we describe the conserved evolutionary origin of metazoan male germ cells at the molecular level. We estimate the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell to correspond to the expression of approximately 10, 000 protein-coding genes, a third of which defines a genetic scaffold of deeply conserved genes that has been retained throughout evolution. Such scaffold contains a set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene expression regulators that represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of metazoan spermatogenesis. By genetically interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity, we uncover 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three new potential genetic causes of human infertility. These findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on human reproductive disease and establish a cross-species analytical pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell types and pathologies.

    In summary, we have identified a conserved male germ cell gene expression program, spanning more than 600 million years of evolution, that can provide clinical insight into the molecular basis of human infertility. We estimate the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell to correspond to the expression of approximately 10, 000 protein-coding genes, the majority of which are deeply conserved. Indeed, despite the testis being a rapidly evolving organ and frequent birthplace of genetic novelty, deeply conserved genes are central components of the male germ cell transcriptome, with younger genes being preferentially expressed in late spermatogenesis. We further pinpoint 79 functional interactions between 104 transcriptional regulators that, owing to their salient network properties across different species, likely define a core component of the ancient genetic program of spermatogenesis. By functionally interfering with 920 deeply conserved genes associated with male germ cell identity, we uncover 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes required for a broad range of germ cell functions, as well as three new potential genetic causes of human infertility. We propose that the transcriptional identity of metazoan male germ cells is built around a relatively small network of deeply conserved gene interactions with an overarching functional impact. These observations may provide a unifying genetic basis for the deep conservation of fundamental germ cell biological processes such as sperm motility and gamete fusion ( Speer et al., 2021; Moi et al., 2022 ). The existence of a shared genetic identity in metazoan spermatocytes can be regarded as a ramification of an ancestral multipotency program already present in germ line precursor cells ( Fierro-Constaín et al., 2017 )

., 2017; Shah et al., 2010 ). Of the 104 genes, 34 were testis-specific/enriched while 60 had low tissue specificity, consistent with previous observations that cell identity relies on the integration of cell type-specific genes with more broadly expressed regulators ( Kotliar et al., 2019 ). Based on its conservation in the orthoBackbone of evolutionarily distant species and on the significant spermatogenic role of the intervening genes, we posit that this subnetwork of 79 functional interactions involving 104 genes likely represents a core component of the conserved genetic program of spermatogenesis. This number fits well with previous estimates, based on expression trajectories of 1:1 orthologous genes, of an ancestral program of amniote spermatogenesis constituted by 389 genes ( Murat et al., 2023 ). We next set out to determine the functional consequences of disrupting the spermatocyte orthoBackbone. Since the latter represents a still sizeable interaction subnetwork consisting of more than 3, 000 genes, we decided to select candidate genes likely to affect the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity. For this, we again took into account how the mitosis-to-meiosis transcriptional burst activates the expression of spermatogenesis genes – a process that has been likened to that of cellular reprogramming ( Guo et al., 2018; Alavattam et al., 2019 ). We reasoned that genes that are upregulated at meiotic entry and/or downregulated at meiotic exit ( thus part of the transcriptional burst ) likely represent instructive elements for the male germ cell state, hence preferential routes to tamper with this cellular identity. Through differential gene expression analysis, we identified, in human and mouse spermatocytes, all expressed genes that shared a similar upregulation at meiotic entry and/or downregulation at meiotic exit

. By summing the products of the age of all expressed genes and their expression levels at a given developmental stage - a metric known as the transcriptome age index - TAI ( Domazet-Lošo and Tautz, 2010 ), we determined the transcriptome age of the different male germ cell stages ( Figure 1e ). As recently reported in mammalian spermatogenesis ( Murat et al., 2023 ), meiotic and pre-meiotic cells across all three tested species had lower TAIs than post-meiotic cells, indicative of older transcriptomes. This trend was less obvious in the fruit fly as in this species post-meiotic transcription is largely residual ( Lim et al., 2012 ). Collectively, we observed that, both in vertebrates and invertebrates, the male germ cell transcriptome has an old evolutionary origin that is tempered by the increased expression of younger genes at later developmental stages. Our data, indicative of a core spermatogenic program spanning more than 600 million years of evolution, significantly expand the breadth of previous observations in the mammalian lineage ( Lau et al., 2020; Shami et al., 2020; Murat et al., 2023 ), while emphasizing the potential relevance of using conserved expression between distant animal species to gain insight into the molecular basis of human infertility. We next addressed the possible significance of the abundant expression of deeply conserved genes in the male germ line. For this, we focused on meiosis, a fundamental process conserved through eukaryotes. Besides the existence of an ancient meiotic toolkit required for recombination and reduction division across sexually reproducing species ( Schurko and Logsdon, 2008 ), the mitosis-to-meiosis transition in the male germ line is also home to a transcriptional burst associated with the acquisition of male germ cell identity ( Maezawa et al., 2020 )

., 2013 ) – and to the preferential emergence of new genes in this organ ( Kaessmann, 2010 ), where they often acquire functions in spermatogenesis ( Kondo et al., 2017 ). Although the rapid divergence of genes directly involved in reproduction has traditionally been interpreted from an adaptationist stance, relaxed selection and drift have been recently proposed to account for this pattern ( Dapper and Wade, 2020 ). Central to this debate is the often-overlooked contribution of old genes for germ cell development and function. We have recently observed, in a wide range of plant species, a substantial contribution of old genes to the pollen transcriptome, suggestive of an ancient transcriptional program common to plant male gametes ( Julca et al., 2021 ). Such observation finds parallel in the concept of a metazoan germ line multipotency program ( Fierro-Constaín et al., 2017 ), and is supported by transcriptional similarities between equivalent spermatogenic cell types across mammalian species ( Lau et al., 2020; Shami et al., 2020; Murat et al., 2023 ). This led us to explore the possibility that, despite the rapid evolution of reproductive protein genes, the functional basis of metazoan male germ cell identity relies on an old, evolutionarily conserved genetic program that can provide relevant insight into spermatogenesis and human infertility. To test this hypothesis, we devised an interdisciplinary research platform based on four combined approaches ( Figure 1a ). First, we determined, through comparison of genome sequences, the age of the gene expression program of male germ cells from three evolutionarily distant metazoan species: humans ( Homo sapiens ), mice ( Mus musculus ), and fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster ). Then, we used network science to infer the significance of deeply conserved genes within the context of the complex male germ line transcriptome

. Accordingly, these 161 new deeply conserved spermatogenesis genes ( homologous to 179 and 187 in humans and mice, respectively ) represent both a significant advance in our understanding of the genetic basis of male germ cell development, and a valuable resource to explore from a precision medicine perspective. To facilitate open access to this information, we made all data available in the form of a user-friendly gene browser ( https://pages. igc. pt/meionav; Figure 2j ). Overall, by merging our results with previously published data we conclude that at least 43. 5% of the mitosis-to-meiosis transcriptional burst ( our 250 hits +150 previously reported male fertility genes that gave a negative result in our assay ) is required for a diverse range of germ cell functions, such as spermatogenesis, meiosis, and gamete fusion ( Spe et al., 202; Mo et al. 202 ). We propose that the conserved genetic program of metazo spermatogenesis is built around a small network of deeply conserved interactions with an overarching impact on the germ cell transcriptome. Our findings provide a unifying basis for the conservation of fundamental biological processes such as sperm motility and gamete ( Spe et al. 202; Mo et al 202 ), and emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on human disease. The existence of a shared identity in metazo sperocytes can be regarded as a ramification of an ancestral multipot program already present in germ precursor cells ( Fier-Constín et al. 2017; Shah et al 2010 ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: Eukaryotes swim with coordinated flagellar ( ciliary ) beating and steer by fine-tuning the coordination. The model organism for studying flagellate motility, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, employs synchronous, breaststroke-like flagellar beating to swim, and it modulates the beating amplitudes differentially to steer. This strategy hinges on both inherent flagellar asymmetries ( e. g. different response to chemical messengers ) and such asymmetries being effectively coordinated in the synchronous beating. In C. reinhardtii, the synchrony of beating is known to be supported by a mechanical connection between flagella; however, how flagellar asymmetries persist in the synchrony remains elusive. For example, it has been speculated for decades that one flagellum leads the beating, as its dynamic properties ( i. e. frequency, waveform, etc. ) appear to be copied by the other one. In this study, we combine experiments, computations, and modeling efforts to elucidate the roles played by each flagellum in synchronous beating. With a non-invasive technique to selectively load each flagellum, we show that the coordinated beating essentially only responds to load exerted on the cis flagellum; and that such asymmetry in response derives from a unilateral coupling between the two flagella. Our results highlight a distinct role for each flagellum in coordination and have implication for biflagellates’ tactic behaviors. 

    Supporting Text:
    The two flagella of C. reinhardtii have long been known to have inherently different dynamic properties such as frequency, waveform, level of active noise, and responses to second messengers ( Kamiya and Hasegawa, 1987; Okita et al., 2005; Leptos et al., 2013; Wan, 2018; Saegusa and Yoshimura, 2015 ). Intriguingly, when connected by basal fibers and beating synchronously, they both adopt the kinematics of the cis- ( eyespot ) flagellum, which led to the assumption that the flagella may have differential roles in coordination. In this work, we test this hypothesis by employing oscillatory flows applied from an angle with respect to the cells’ symmetry axis and thus exert biased loads on one flagellum. In all our experiments with wt cells, we robustly observe that cis-flows, the ones that selectively load the cis flagellum, are always more effective in entraining the flagellar beating than the trans-flows. This is shown by the larger effective forcing strengths ( ε ( cis-flow ) >ε ( trans-flow ), Figure 3B ) and larger entrained time fractions ( τ ( cis-flow ) >τ ( trans-flow ), Figure 3C ). Mapping ε ( θ ) as a function of the loads, we find empirically that the flow entrainment strength scales with the hydrodynamic load on the cis, ε∝F¯Flowc ( Figure 3D ) and that trans-loads appear to matter negligibly. These observations all indicate that the cis-loads determine whether an external forcing can entrain the cell. Moreover, this point is further highlighted by an unexpected finding: when trans-flows are applied, the trans flagellum always beats against the external flow ( PFlowt<0 ) and the only stabilizing factor for flow entrainment is the cis flagellum working transiently along with the flow ( PFlowc>0 ) during the recovery stroke ( Figure 1G lower panel )

. These observations definitively prove that the two flagella have differential roles in the coordination and interestingly imply that flagella are coupled to external flow only through the cis. To elucidate the mechanisms at the origin of this asymmetry, we develop a reduced stochastic model for the system, see Equation 2. In the model, selective hydrodynamic loading and flagellar dominance in the coordinated beating are respectively represented by ϵc≠ϵt and λct≠λtc. Using this model, we express f and ε, which we can measure experimentally ( Equation 3 ), as a function of fc, t, ϵc, t, λct and λtc to illustrate how the flagellar dominance and selective loading affect the coordinated flagellar beating. Moreover, with Monte-Carlo simulations, we clarify the interplay between flows and flagella ( Appendix 1: Monte-Carlo simulations ), and reproduce all experimental observations. We show that a ‘dominance’ of the cis ( λct≫λtc ) is sufficient to explain the experimental phenomenology comprehensively. This dominance means that the cis-phase is much less sensitive to the trans-phase than the other way around. We then reproduce the phase dynamics of flow entrainment at varying detunings ( Figure 5B ), amplitudes ( Figure 5C ), and noises ( Figure 5D ). Exploiting the observation that the coordination between flagella cannot be broken by external flows up to the strongest ones tested ( εmax∼10 Hz, Figure 2B ), we quantify the lower limit of the total basal coupling, λct+λtc, to be approximately 40 Hz ( deduced in Appendix 1: Monte-Carlo simulations ), which is an order magnitude larger than the hydrodynamic inter-flagellar coupling ( Quaranta et al., 2015; Brumley et al., 2014; Klindt et al., 2016; Pellicciotta et al., 2020 ). Dynamic modulation of flagellar dominance during synchronous beating is the basis of C. reinhardtii’s tactic motility ( Kamiya and Witman, 1984; Horst and Witman, 1993; Pazour et al., 2005; Okita et al

., 2005; Okita et al., 2005 ). Calcium has long been speculated to facilitates such dynamic modulation ( Rüffer and Nultsch, 1997; Wan et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2021 ) because it is involved in switching the beating mode ( Hayashi et al., 1998 ) and in tuning flagellar beating amplitude ( Kamiya and Witman, 1984; Okita et al., 2005 ), and calcium influx comprises the initial step of the cell’s photo- ( Harz and Hegemann, 1991 ) and mechanoresponses ( Yoshimura, 2011 ). We therefore investigate flagellar coupling in the context of tactic steering by depleting the environmental free calcium and hence inhibiting signals of calcium influxes. Cells are first acclimated to calcium depletion, and then tested with the directional flows. Our results show that the cis dominance in the synchronous beating does not require the involvement of free environmental calcium. Calcium depletion merely induces an overall drop in the forcing strength perceived by the cell ε ( θ ) ( 7%−20% ), which is captured by reducing ϵc+ϵt for 15% ( mean drop ) in the model ( Figure 5G ). In contrast to the speculation that calcium is involved in the dynamic modulation of ciliary dominance in synchronous beating ( Rüffer and Nultsch, 1997; Wan et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2021 ), our results indicate that the leading role of cis ( i. e., λct≫λtc ) is an inherent property, which does not require active influx of external calcium, and possibly reflects an intrinsic mechanical asymmetry of the cellular mesh that anchors the two flagella into the cell body. In ptx1 cells, a lack of flagellar dominance ( λct=λtc ) and a stronger noise level are necessary to reproduce our experimental observations. Previous studies suggested that both flagella of ptx1 are similar to the wildtype trans ( Horst and Witman, 1993; Rüffer and Nultsch, 1997; Okita et al

. Similarly, the force’s rate of work is computed as P=∫f ( s ) ⋅U ( s ) ds, where U ( s ) is the velocity of the flagellum at the position s along the centerline. The computations shown in this study are based on videos of a representative cell which originally beats at ~50 Hz. The cell is fully entrained by flows along different directions ( θ = 0°, 45°, 90°, 135° ) at 49. 2 Hz. In the computations, the applied flows are set to have an amplitude of 780 µm/s to reflect the experiments. Computations begin with the onset of the background flows ( notified experimentally by a flashlight event ), and last for ~30 beats ( 500 frames sampled at 801 fps ). Additionally, we confirm the results of trans-flow-entrainment, that both flagella spend large fractions of time beating against the flows, with other cells and with trans-flows at other frequencies. The total loads ( F and P ) computed consist of two parts, one from the flow created by the two flagella themselves and the other from the flow imposed. In the low Reynolds number regime, the loads of the two parts add up directly ( linearity ) : F=FSelf+FFlow, and P=PSelf+PFlow. To isolate FFlow and PFlow, we compute F′=FSelf and P′=PSelf by running the computation again but without the external flows, and obtain FFlow=F−F′ and PFlow=P−P′.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Mechanism underlying the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Here, we reported that intermittent fasting promoted interleukin-22 ( IL-22 ) production by type 3 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC3s ) and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor ( IL-22R ) attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue, suggesting that ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting. 

    Supporting Text:
    Our present study demonstrates that intestinal ILC3s are critical for the beigeing of white adipose tissue induced by intermittent fasting. This conclusion is supported by following observations. First, intermittent fasting stimulates the secretion of IL-22 by intestinal ILC3s in either lean mice fed NCD, obese mice fed HFD, or mice with metabolic dysfunction induced by HFCD diet. Second, a comprehensive set of in vivo and in vitro experiments shows that intermittent fasting promotes adipose tissue beigeing through the intestinal ILC3-IL-22-IL-22R axis. The role of ILC3s in metabolism remains largely unknown. Our studies provide evidence supporting the metabolic benefit of intestinal ILC3s in intermittent fasting. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s isolated from lean mice was sufficient to improve the metabolic dysfunctions in DIO mice, including increase of white adipose tissue beigeing and glucose tolerance. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of ILC3s significantly increased their number only in intestine. Further, alternate day fasting did not alter the ILC3s in adipose tissue. These observations indicate that ILC3s in intestine rather than in adipose tissue account for the metabolic benefit. In addition to directly promoting the beigeing of white adipose tissue through IL-22, intestinal ILC3s may enhance the intestinal mucosal barrier ( Ibiza et al., 2016 ), reducing serum LPS and peptidoglycan, thus reducing the inhibitory effect of LPS and peptidoglycan on the beigeing of white adipose tissue ( Chen et al., 2022 ). O’Sullivan et al., 2016, have reported that ILC3s are negligible in white adipose tissue of either lean or obese mice. Similarly, Sasaki et al., 2019, have demonstrated that transplanting bone marrow cells from Rag2-/- mice ( lack of T cells, B cells ) into Il2rg-/- Rag2-/- mice ( lack of T cells, B cells, ILC cells ) could not increase the number of ILC3s in the adipose tissue of recipient mice

. These results indicate that IL-22RKO attenuates the thermogenesis induced by intermittent fasting. Knockout of IL-22R demonstrated no effect on the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in mice fed NCD ( Figure 5C and D ). However, the weight of subcutaneous adipose tissue in IL-22RKO-IF mice increased significantly ( Figure 5E ). mRNA levels of the thermogenic gene Ucp1 decreased substantially, whereas Fabp4 increased ( Figure 5F ). Furthermore, knockout of IL-22R significantly attenuated the increment of multilocular lipid droplets and the decrement of adipocyte size in the subcutaneous fat induced by intermittent fasting ( Figure 5G and H ), indicating a reduction in beigeing. To further explore whether IL-22R mediates the effect of ILC3s on beigeing of adipocytes, intestinal ILC3s isolated from intermittent fasting mice were co-cultured with beige adipocytes from subcutaneous SVF of WT or IL-22RKO mice ( Figure 5I and J ). Co-culture with ILC3s significantly increased the mRNA levels of thermogenic genes in beige adipocytes derived from WT mice, while demonstrating no effect on beige adipocytes derived from IL-22RKO mice ( Figure 5K ). These observations indicate that IL-22R mediates the effect of intestinal ILC3s on beigeing of white adipocytes. To explore the mechanism by which intermittent fasting promotes the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s, live CD45+ lineage ( CD3, CD5, B220, CD19, Gr1 ) - cells isolated from the siLP of mice fed NCD, HFD, or HFD-IF were subjected for single-cell sequencing ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ). Following quality controls, we analyzed 7455, 4803, 5954 single cells for the NCD, HFD, and HFD-IF groups using Seurat-V3. 1, respectively

. Besides, intermittent fasting didn’t alter the levels of ILC3s and IL-22 in mouse adipose tissue ( Figure 1G and Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ). Similar to NCD mice, intermittent fasting significantly increased mRNA levels of IL-22 in the intestine of HFD mice while didn’t influence the secretion of IL-22 by T cells ( Figure 1H and I ). Furthermore, mice fed HFD showed an obvious reduction in the plasma IL-22 ( Figure 1J ) and percentage of total and IL-22 positive ILC3s ( Figure 1K ). Further, the decrement of plasma IL-22 ( Figure 1J ) as well as IL-22 positive ILCs in intestine ( Figure 1K ) was attenuated by 30 days’ intermittent fasting. In order to explain the chronological relationship between ILC3s secreting IL-22 and beigeing of white adipose tissue, the mice were exposed to one cycle of intermittent fasting for 2 days. At this time, the body weight of mice didn’t change and beige adipocytes haven’t been induced ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4A and B ). However, significant increase in proportion of IL-22 positive ILC3s was induced by intermittent fasting for 2 days whereas total percentile of ILC3s remained unaltered ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4C ). These results indicate that the beiging of white adipose tissue are subsequent to its effect on ILC3s secreting IL-22. Next, we examined whether adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s can increase beigeing of white adipose tissue in DIO mice. Intestinal ILC3s were isolated and purified from the siLP of NCD mice ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ). These cells were defined as lineage-CD127+KLRG1-c-Kit+ cells ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ). As shown in Figure 2A, DIO mice transferred with ILC3s demonstrated a significant increment in the proportion of small intestinal ILC3s. Previous researches report that intestinal ILC3s specifically express gut homing receptors CCR7, CCR9, and α4β7 ( Kim et al., 2015; Mackley et al., 2015; Yu et al

. ILC3-derived IL-22 are beneficial in metabolic syndrome ( Wang et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2018 ) but can also contribute to metabolic disease ( Sasaki et al., 2019; Upadhyay et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2017 ). In order to examine the role of promoting beigeing of white adipose tissue of IL-22 in the context of NCD and HFD mice, we intraperitoneally administrated IL-22 at the dose of 4µg/kg body weight/every other day for 6weeks into mice fed NCD or HFD. Saline was used as control. Administration of IL-22 increased its plasma concentration in mice fed either NCD or HFD ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ). Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and energy expenditure in mice fed either NCD or HFD ( Figure 3A–F ). RQ was significantly reduced in mice fed NCD at dark and mice fed HFD at light ( Figure 3G and H ). No significant difference was observed for animal activity ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). In addition, exogenous IL-22 significantly improved glucose tolerance in mice fed HFD ( Figure 4A ). Interestingly, body weight and food intake were not altered ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ), indicating that the metabolic benefit of IL-22 is not dependent on food intake. Consistent with previous research, IL-22 administration improves insulin sensitivity without change in body weight ( Qi et al., 2019 ). In addition, IL-22 can increase Akt phosphorylation in muscle, liver, and adipose tissues, leading to improvement in insulin sensitivity ( Wang et al., 2014 ). To examine the effect of IL-22 on beigeing of white adipose, mice were fed N or HFD were intraperitoneally administrated IL-22 at the dose 4µg/kg body weight/every day for 6 weeks. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was dissected and analyzed for multilocular lipid droplets and adipocyte size. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased multiloc lipid droplets and decreased adipocyte size in subcutaneous fat ( Figure 4A and B ), indicating beigeing of adipose. Furthermore, exogenous IL-22 increased mRNA of thermogenic genes Ucp1 and Fabp in subcutaneous adipose ( Figure 4C and D ). These results indicate that IL-22 promotes beigeing of white adipose in mice fed N or HFD. To examine the role of IL-22 in beigeing of adipose, mice fed N or HFD were intraperally administrated IL-22 at the dose 4g/kg body/every day for 6 weeks. Subcutaneous adipose was dissected and analyzed for multiloc lipid droplets and adipocyte size. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased multiloc lipid droplets and decreased adipocyte in subcut fat ( Figure 5A and B ) indicating beige of adipose. Furthermore, exogenous IL-22 increased mRNA of thermogenic Ucp and Fabp in subcutaneous ( Figure 5 and D ). These indicate that IL-22 promotes beige of white adipose in mice fed N or H. To examine the role of IL-22 in beige of adipose, mice N or H were intraperally administrated IL- at the dose 4g body/e day for 6. Subcut adipose was dissected and analyzed for multiloc lipid and adipocyte. Exogenous IL-22 increased multiloc lipid and decreased adipocyte in subcut ( Figure 5 and ) indicating beige. Furthermore, exogenous IL-22 increased mRNA of thermogenic Ucp and Fab in sub ( Figure ) These indicate that IL- promotes beige of white in mice N or H. To examine the role of IL-22 in beige of adip, mice N or H were intraper administr IL at the 4g/e for 6. Sub adip was dissect and analyzed for multiloc and adip. Exogenous-22 increased multiloc and adip in ( Figure ) indicating beige. Furthermore, exogenous-22 increased mRNA of thermogenic U and in ( Figure These indicate that IL promotes beige white in mice or H To examine the role of IL-22 in beige adip, mice N or H were intraper administr IL at the 4/e for 6. adip was dissect and analyzed for mult and.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Defensive behavior changes based on threat intensity, proximity, and context of exposure, and learning about danger-predicting stimuli is critical for survival. However, most Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms focus only on freezing behavior, obscuring the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic defensive responses. To thoroughly investigate defensive ethograms, we subjected male and female adult C57BL/6 J mice to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that paired footshock with a serial compound stimulus ( SCS ) consisting of distinct tone and white noise ( WN ) stimulus periods. To investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms affect defensive responses, we compared this paired SCS-footshock group with four control groups that were conditioned with either pseudorandom unpaired presentations of SCS and footshock, shock only, or reversed SCS presentations with inverted tone-WN order, with paired or unpaired presentations. On day 2 of conditioning, the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period with switching to explosive jumping and darting behaviors during the WN period. Comparatively, the unpaired and both reverse SCS groups expressed less tone-induced freezing and rarely showed jumping or darting during WN. Following the second day of conditioning, we observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions. During extinction, the tone-induced freezing decreased in the paired group, and mice rapidly shifted from escape jumping during WN to a combination of freezing and darting. The unpaired, unpaired reverse, and shock-only groups displayed defensive tail rattling and darting during the SCS, with minimal freezing and jumping. Interestingly, the paired reverse group did not jump to WN, and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction. These findings demonstrate that non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, but associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression. 

    Supporting Text:
    This study investigated the contributions of associative and non-associative processes to the expression of cue-induced defensive behaviors. The results signify that associative pairings and a proximal stimulus-threat association during fear conditioning produce maximal expression of cue-induced freezing and flight responses. Non-associative elements such as cue salience, change in stimulus intensity, and shock-induced sensitization elicit stress-associated behaviors like tail rattling and activity bursts, as hypothesized before ( Trott et al., 2022 ), but the addition of the WN-threat associative pairing contributes significantly to eliciting high-intensity defensive responses like escape jumping. Therefore, these associative and non-associative factors combine to produce distinct behavioral transitions between freezing and flight. During conditioning, we observed distinct ethograms for the PA and UN groups in response to the SCS. Freezing to tone and activity to WN were both significantly higher in the PA group compared to the UN group ( Figure 2E and K ), highlighting the impact of SCS-shock contingency on the magnitude of defensive responses. Notably, comparable results were previously reported in rats conditioned using similar parameters ( Totty et al., 2021 ). Additionally, we found that the PA and PA-R groups showed significant increases in freezing from pre-SCS to tone, while in the UN and UN-R groups, freezing to tone was no greater than contextual freezing, suggesting that the paired groups placed associative value on the tone ( Figure 2J ). Lastly, the PA group displayed much more intense flight behavior during WN than the PA-R group ( Figure 2L ), indicating that the proximity of WN to the footshock threat affects defensive scaling. Previous studies have factored jumping behaviors into normalized measures to gauge conditioned flight behavior ( Fadok et al., 2017; Hersman et al., 2020; Borkar et al

. 33; PA mean ± SEM = 12. 54±2. 73 ). Overall, these data show that the respective changes in defensive behavior during tone and WN were significantly affected by the explicit pairing of SCS and shock during fear conditioning, and that the order of tone and WN presentation influenced the intensity of WN-evoked responses. Although the UN or UN-R groups did not receive an associative pairing between SCS and shock like the PA and PA-R groups, all groups still displayed increased activity indices to WN ( Figure 2D ). To determine if this behavioral response was due to defensive flight or a more basic locomotor response, we investigated the occurrence of escape jumping and darting behaviors during the WN presentation on CD2. A substantial percentage of PA mice jumped during WN on every trial, and these jumps were distributed across the entire WN period ( Figure 3A and B ). In contrast, an exceedingly small percentage of the UN group jumped during WN ( Figure 3C ), and when jumps occurred, they occurred at the onset of the WN ( Figure 3D ). Both groups responded to shock with a similar number of jumps ( Figure 3B and D ). Trial-by-trial, PA mice displayed more jumping behavior across the WN period ( Figure 3E ) compared to UN mice ( Figure 3F ). Like the UN group, the reverse SCS groups also displayed lower jumping percentages to WN, with jumps in the PA-R group occurring rarely near the transition from WN to tone, ( Figure 3G ) and jumps in the UN-R group occurring near WN onset ( Figure 3H ). The PA group had the largest percentage of mice that jumped to WN during CD2 compared to all other groups ( Figure 3I ). Lastly, all groups exhibited jumps to shock ( Figure 3J ), with greater percentages of the unpaired and reverse cohorts responding with jumps. Similar analyses were performed for darting behavior

. Additionally, the absence of darting in the PA-R group indicates that the temporal proximity of the WN to the shock also influences darting. Our data show that the control groups engage primarily in simple locomotor behaviors induced by stimulus salience ( Figure 4J ). Overall, darting behaviors during conditioning contribute to the higher activity score observed during WN in the PA group, and our data suggests that these contributions are the result of associative learning and threat imminence, rather than non-associative stimulus salience. During extinction, the PA and PA-R groups showed the highest level of freezing to tone compared to the non-associative control groups ( Figure 5A and B ). This indicates that the paired groups had the strongest association between the tone stimulus and threat. This is further reinforced by the larger difference between tone-evoked freezing and pre-SCS freezing in the PA and PA-R groups ( Figure 5E and F ). Freezing during tone in the non-associative control groups, on the other hand, is no greater than freezing in the interstimulus intervals. Interestingly, tone-evoked freezing in the PA group underwent within-session extinction, while that of the PA-R group was resistant to extinction ( Figure 5A–D ). The sustained tone-evoked freezing over multiple extinction sessions in the PA-R group is likely a product of the temporal proximity of the cue to the footshock, which is set at a greater intensity ( 0. 9 mA ) in the conditioned flight paradigm than is traditionally used in Pavlovian threat conditioning ( typically 0. 2–0. 6 mA ). Because freezing during the tone is not elevated over contextual freezing levels in the unpaired and SO groups, the reductions in freezing during the tone during extinction in these groups can be attributed to reduced freezing overall

. Altering the contingency between WN and shock in the unpaired or reversed SCS conditions profoundly reduced these defensive behaviors, but the increased activity in all groups during WN suggests that inherent properties of the WN interact with non-associative processes to induce locomotor responses. This is reflected in the increased distance traveled during WN in all groups compared to the tone period. Representative behavioral responses of the PA, UN, PA-R, and UN-R groups to the SCS during conditioning are provided in Video 1 and Video 2. We next analyzed how the defensive ethogram of each group changed over the course of two extinction sessions. A two-way ANOVA was used to analyze the effect of trial and group on freezing during the tone, and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used for post-hoc comparisons. When analyzing tone-evoked freezing across extinction within the PA, UN, and SO groups ( Figure 5A ), a significant interaction between trial and group ( F ( 62, 2208 ) =2. 3, p<0. 0001 ) was found. For every trial except the last, the PA group exhibited a higher level of freezing during tone compared to the control groups ( p<0. 05 for Trials 1–15, for both sessions ). Tone-evoked freezing presented similarly between the PA-R and UN-R groups ( Figure 5B ), yielding a significant interaction between trial and group ( F ( 31, 576 ) =1. 63, p=0. 018 ). The PA-R group maintained consistently high freezing during the tone across both extinction sessions, freezing more than the UN-R group for nearly all trials ( p<0. 05 for Trials 1, 3–16 on Ext1, all trials on Ext2 ). To quantify the relative change in freezing over each extinction session, we calculated the difference in freezing between the first four trials and the last four trials for each session

The PA and PA-R groups, on the other hand, did not exhibit tail-rattling to the S ( Figure 6 ). Tail-ratt in the UN, UN, and SO groups was significantly greater than in the interstimulus intervals ( Figure 6 ). Tail-ratt in the UN, UN, and SO groups was significantly greater than in the interstimulus ( Figure 6 ) Tail-ratt in the UN, UN, and SO was significantly greater in the interstim ( Figure 6 ) Tail-r in the UN, UN, and SO was greater in thestim ( Figure 6 ) Tail-r in UN, UN, and SO was in ( Figure 6 ) Tail in UN, UN, and SO ( Figure 6 ) Tail in UN, UN, SO ( Figure 6 ) Tail UN, UN, SO ( Figure 6 ) Tail UN, SO ( Figure 6 ) Tail UN ( Figure 6 ) Tail UN ( 6 ) Tail ( 6 ) Tail ( 6 ) Tail ( 6 ) Tail (6 ) Tail (6 ) Tail (6 ) (6 ) Tail (6 ) ( ) (6 ) ( ) (6 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (

    Title: 
    Abstract: To navigate their environment, insects need to keep track of their orientation. Previous work has shown that insects encode their head direction as a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure. However, it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding of head direction is just an evolutionary coincidence or if it offers a particular functional advantage. To address this question, we establish the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and show that it can be performed by many circuits, all with different activity patterns. Among these activity patterns, we prove that the sinusoidal one is the most noise-resilient, but only when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity pattern between the encoding neurons. We compare this predicted optimal connectivity pattern with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and the fruit fly, finding that our theory agrees with experimental evidence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect but rather can emerge during development. Finally, we illustrate that in our theory, the consistent presence of the eight-column organisation of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance artefact but instead can be explained by basic evolutionary principles.

   ., 2008; Stone et al., 2017 ). Further studies have shown that models closely aligned with biological data can indeed implement heading integration using sinusoidal activity patterns ( Pisokas et al., 2020; Turner-Evans et al., 2020 ), and that such circuits can be learned ( Vafidis et al., 2022 ). Here, we show that enabling easy vector addition cannot be the unique driving factor for the presence of sinusoidal heading encodings, as many other circuits with different activity patterns can perform vector addition in the same way. This finding led us to question whether the sinusoidal activation patterns seen in insect navigation circuits are a coincidence, or if they might offer a particular functional advantage that was selected for during evolution. To address this question, we consider the basic principles necessary for a circuit encoding direction. Of all the circuits fulfilling these requirements, the sinusoidal activity pattern offers the best resilience to noise for the encoded information. However, obtaining this activity requires a circuit with a specific connectivity pattern between neurons. Thus, our theory predicts that the heading integration circuit will have a sinusoidal connectivity pattern. We compare our predicted circuit with connectivity data for the desert locust ( Schistocerca gregaria ) and fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) using network analysis tools, showing a strong agreement. We then ask how an insect brain might develop such a circuit, finding that a simple Hebbian learning rule is sufficient. Finally, we combine ideas from replication dynamics with our theory, which leads us to the conclusion that the eight-column structure is a consequence of basic theoretical principles, rather than an evolutionary coincidence.

In this work we derived an optimal noise-minimising circuit for encoding heading and verified that this circuit matches experimental data from insects. Furthermore, we showed that such a circuit can be developed and maintained by a biological learning rule, and proposed a mathematical argument for the eight-column structure found in insect compass circuits. In this section, we discuss the implications and limitations of these contributions, and outline potential future work. Heading integration circuits in insects have been extensively studied, with models ranging in complexity from simplified conceptual networks ( Wittmann and Schwegler, 1995; Cope et al., 2017 ) to sophisticated models constrained by biological data and featuring multiple neuron types ( Kakaria and de Bivort, 2017; Su et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017; Pisokas et al., 2020; Lyu et al., 2022 ). Previous theoretical work has argued that a sinusoidal activity encoding is such a common motif in insect navigation because it facilitates elementwise vector addition ( Wittmann and Schwegler, 1995 ). However, this cannot be the only reason because as we show there is a whole family of circuits with different encoding patterns that enable easy vector addition. By showing that sinusoidal activity emerges from the theoretically most noise-resilient heading integration circuit, and verifying that the corresponding circuit matches experimental data, we close this explanatory gap. We also show that our proposed circuit can be developed by a simple Hebbian-based learning rule, and that the presence of the eight-column structure can be explained from the perspective of replication dynamics. Both results align with the idea that evolution should be biased towards structures that are easier to encode in the genome ( Johnston et al., 2022; Alon, 2007 ) and learn ( Zador, 2019 )

We consider a population of N ‘compass neurons’ with an activity that encodes the direction of the insect as an angular variable θ. We represent the activity of this population by a vector where each element corresponds to the activity of one neuron, a ( θ ) =[a1 ( θ ), a2 ( θ ),..., aN ( θ ) ]. We take N=8 neurons, consistent with data from many insect species which possess an eight-column organisation, with each column encoding a different direction ( Honkanen et al., 2019; Stone et al., 2017; Pisokas et al., 2020 ). Each neuron’s activity is updated depending on its current firing rate and the inputs it receives, both from other neurons in the circuit and externally. We formulate this update rule as follows: ( 1 ) a˙ ( θ ) =−a ( θ ) +ϕ[Wa ( θ ) +u ( t ) ], where W is the circuit’s weight matrix, representing the connections between neurons; ϕ is the neural activation function, that converts the total neural input into an output firing rate; and u ( t ) is the external input that encodes the insect’s angular velocity, via the PEN population of neurons ( Green et al., 2017; Turner-Evans et al., 2017; Sayre et al., 2021; Pisokas et al., 2020; Turner-Evans et al., 2020; Hulse et al., 2021 ). To simplify our derivations we allow the neural activity values to be both positive and negative, interpreting these values as being relative to a baseline neural firing rate. Similarly, we allow the weights to be both positive and negative, a common simplification in computational models ( Li et al., 2023; Cornford et al., 2020; Kriegeskorte and Golan, 2019 ). This simplification will be addressed in section ‘Comparing the predicted circuit with biological data’ where we compare our model with experimental data. As we consider networks with N=8 neurons, consistent with multiple insect species ( Honkanen et al., 2019; Stone et al., 2017; Pisokas et al

. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such arguments have been put forward in the context of a specific circuit with a specific function. Our work still has some unaddressed limitations, in particular regarding the topology of the activity. The use of a circular topology to encode the head direction of the insect is valid only in 2D environments. But many species, including the fruit fly, can navigate in a 3D environment. We argue that even if these insects live in a 3D environment, the third dimension ( up-down ) is different from the other two due to gravity and the existence of a hard boundary ( the ground ). Further studies would be required to investigate the full effects of 3D motion. We could also investigate circuits that integrate position, not only heading, which would require the activity to have a 2D plane topology instead of a circle. This would be particularly relevant for foraging insects such as bees or ants, whose ability to remember their position with respect to their nest has been the subject of many experimental and computational studies ( Collett, 2019; Wehner and Srinivasan, 2003 ). The position integrating neurons in these insects are also predicted to have sinusoidal activation patterns ( Wittmann and Schwegler, 1995; Vickerstaff and Di Paolo, 2005; Stone et al., 2017 ). Finally, another interesting avenue for future work is to compare the encoding of direction in insects with that of mammals, which encode heading in a fundamentally different way that uses many more neurons. This raises a critical question: why would the circuit and encoding be different if navigation follows similar principles across species? We speculate that the difference might lie in the type of navigation that the two classes of animals use

Insects exhibit an impressive ability to navigate the world, travelling long distances to migrate, find food or reach places of interest before returning to their nests ( Müller and Wehner, 1988; Menzel et al., 1996; Heinze et al., 2013; Collett, 2019 ), a feat that requires them to keep track of their orientation across long journeys ( Mappes and Homberg, 2004; Merlin et al., 2012; Warren et al., 2019; Collett, 2019; Beetz et al., 2022 ). This orientation tracking is achieved by the use of visual cues as well as integrating angular velocity signals over time to maintain a heading estimate relative to the environment ( Green et al,2017; Turner-Eans et al,2017; Sayre et al,202; Pisas et al,202; Turner-Eans et,202; Hulse et al,202 ). Insect navigation has been extensively studied, with models ranging from conceptual ( Wittmann and Schler,1995; Cope et al,2017 ) to sophisticated constrained by data featuring multiple neuron types ( Kak and Bort,2017 Su et al,201; Kim et al,201; Pisas et,202; Lyu et,202 ) Previous work has argued that sinusoidal activity is a common in insect navigation because it facilitates vector addition ( Witt and Schler,1995 ) However, this cannot be the only reason as we show there are many circuits with different patterns that enable vector addition By showing sinusoidal emerges from the most resilient heading circuit and verifying the circuit matches data, we close this gap. We also show our circuit can be developed by Hebbian learning and the eight structure can be explained by replication Both align with the idea evolution should be biased towards easier to encode and learn ( Johnston et,202; Al,2007 Z,2019 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, both pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CISD1, a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulfur-binding protein, is a major target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination. We here discovered a heightened propensity of CISD1 to form dimers in Pink1 mutant flies and in dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients. The dimer consists of two monomers that are covalently linked by a disulfide bridge. In this conformation CISD1 cannot coordinate the iron-sulfur cofactor. Overexpressing Cisd, the Drosophila ortholog of CISD1, and a mutant Cisd incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster in Drosophila reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This was more pronounced with mutant Cisd and aggravated in Pink1 mutant flies. Complete loss of Cisd, in contrast, rescued all detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing ability, wing posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. Our results suggest that Cisd, probably iron-depleted Cisd, operates downstream of Pink1 shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target.

    We here identified the mitochondrial protein CISD1, specifically its iron-depleted form, as a potential downstream mediator of the pathophysiological effects arising from the loss of PINK1 function, and to a certain extent, Parkin loss of function. Our investigation revealed that both dopaminergic neurons from familial PD patients with PINK1 mutations and Pink1 mutant flies exhibit increased levels of a slower-migrating form of CISD1/Cisd on immunoblots. The presence of this slow migrating form of CISD1/Cisd was age-dependent in flies and apparent in human dopaminergic neurons after 28 days of differentiation. We did not assess whether this increased even more in older cultures but such an age-dependent increase would be in line with the fact that PD usually becomes symptomatic at an older age. The slower-migrating form likely does not represent a ubiquitinated form, as treatment with the deubiquitinase USP2 had no effect on fly Cisd dimerization ( Martinez et al., 2024 ). Additionally, it is improbable that the slower-migrating Cisd form is an unrelated protein, as under non-reducing conditions, fly Cisd shifted to the dimeric form ( Martinez et al., 2024 ) while harsh reducing conditions shifted Cisd to the monomeric form ( Figure 3E ). Based on our experiments, we conclude that the slower-migrating form of CISD1/Cisd corresponds to a dimer caused by the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond between two molecules of CISD1/Cisd. The dimeric form has been described before even in recombinant CISD1. Under non-reducing conditions, recombinant CISD1 ran as a monomeric and a dimeric band while under reducing conditions using beta-mercaptoethanol only the monomeric band was detected ( Roberts et al., 2013 ). Using proteomic analysis, it was determined that the disulfide bond forms between cysteine C83 and either C72 or C74 of CISD1 ( Roberts et al., 2013 )

., 2021 ). PD patients exhibit elevated iron levels within the substantia nigra pars compacta, and this iron accumulation correlates with the severity of the disease ( Dexter et al., 1987; Hirsch et al., 1991 ). Notably, this iron dysregulation is apparent even in asymptomatic carriers of PRKN mutations ( Pyatigorskaya et al., 2015 ), suggesting that it is an early event and correlates with mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, human dopaminergic neurons lacking PINK1 display inhibition of the iron-dependent mitochondrial aconitase, leading to accumulation of NAD+ and depletion of essential metabolites ( Bus et al., 2020 ). In flies, Pink1 deficiency similarly results in inactivation of mitochondrial aconitase by impairing its labile iron-sulfur cluster, leading to oxidative distress and mitochondrial swelling ( Esposito et al., 2013; Wan et al., 2020 ). These findings highlight the relevance of iron dysregulation in the PD development and progression. An important target protein of PINK1/PRKN crucial for iron homeostasis and redox homeostasis is CISD1, also known as mitoNEET ( reviewed in Mittler et al., 2019 ). CISD1 is a homodimeric protein N-terminally inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane facing the cytosol ( Wiley et al., 2007a ). CISD1 is ubiquitinated by PRKN ( Sarraf et al., 2013 ) and its levels are reduced upon dissipation of Δψm ( Chan et al., 2011; Cunningham et al., 2015; Lazarou et al., 2013; McWilliams et al., 2018; Narendra et al., 2012; Okatsu et al., 2012 ). Moreover, CISD1 forms a complex with PRKN, and this interaction is markedly increased by activation of PINK1 and ubiquitination ( Narendra et al., 2013; Sarraf et al., 2013 ). In Drosophila, the homolog of CISD1 is the most strongly ubiquitinated protein in response to Prkn overexpression in vivo ( Martinez et al., 2017 )

Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is the fastest growing neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by rigor, tremor, and bradykinesia. These motor symptoms stem from the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain’s substantia nigra pars compacta ( reviewed in Pickrell and Youle, 2015 ). While most cases are sporadic, familial forms of PD are linked to mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in mitochondrial quality control like PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) and Parkin ( PRKN ), providing valuable insights into the pathophysiology of PD ( Shulman et al., 2011 ). In healthy cells, PINK1 is continuously imported into mitochondria, where it is rapidly degraded ( Narendra et al., 2008 ). However, in unfit mitochondria with a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential ( Δψm ), PINK1 import stalls. When PINK1 accumulates on damaged mitochondria, it phosphorylates various proteins, including the E3 ubiquitin ligase PRKN. This phosphorylation activates PRKN, enabling it to attach ubiquitin to mitochondrial proteins. This ubiquitination acts as a signal for damaged mitochondria to be identified and engulfed by autophagosomes, initiating their degradation through mitophagy. This selective elimination of compromised mitochondria safeguards overall mitochondrial health and function ( reviewed in Youle and Narendra, 2011 ). Much of this mechanistic understanding has been elucidated in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster where Pink1 and Prkn loss of function results in profound changes of the mitochondrial ultrastructure causing mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired flight and climbing ability, and a shortened lifespan ( Clark et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006 ). In addition to disturbances in mitochondrial quality control, disruptions in iron metabolism contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of PD ( Ma et al., 2021 )

. While our study suggests a role in redox imbalance and iron dysregulation, particularly implicating the iron-depleted form of CISD1, Ham et al., 2023, describe its impact on ER calcium release, and Martinez et al., 2024, propose interference with autophagy/mitophagy. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, as they often intersect. Both studies support our findings, replicating key results, but also underscore the need for further research to fully elucidate the interplay of these proposed mechanisms. In summary, our results suggest that the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster protein Cisd is downstream of the pathophysiological cascade initiated by Pink1 and partially Prkn loss of function in flies and probably also in humans. This sheds light on the pathophysiology of PD and implicates CISD1 as a therapeutic target protein.

. Collectively, these results support a connection between iron dyshomeostasis, redox imbalance, and the presence of an intermolecular disulfide bond between two molecules of Cisd leading to apo-Cisd, although establishing causality in this relationship is challenging. To investigate potential detrimental effects of apo-Cisd and whether these would be more pronounced in the absence of functional Pink1, we next overexpressed either Cisd or a mutated Cisd C/S where we mutated all cysteine residues that coordinate the Fe/S cluster to serines ( C100S, C102S, and C/S ) in WT w1118 and Pink1B9 mutant flies using the mild ubiquitous Gal4 driver daughterless ( da ). Cisd C/S constitutes a constitutive apo-Cisd variant. Flies overexpressing mitochondrially C or C/S had reduced climbing ability and lifespan compared to controls ( Figure 5A ). In contrast, flies overexpressing constitutive C had normal climbing ability and lifespan ( Figure 5B ). These results indicate that apoisd is detrimental to mitochondrial function and survival in the absence of Pink1.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Obligate parasites often trigger significant changes in their hosts to facilitate transmission to new hosts. The molecular mechanisms behind these extended phenotypes - where genetic information of one organism is manifested as traits in another - remain largely unclear. This study explores the role of the virulence protein SAP54, produced by parasitic phytoplasmas, in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP54 is responsible for the induction of leaf-like flowers in phytoplasma-infected plants. However, we previously demonstrated that the insects were attracted to leaves and the leaf-like flowers were not required. Here, we made the surprising discovery that leaf exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction phenotype, suggesting a leaf response that distinguishes leafhopper sex in the presence of SAP54. In contrast, this phytoplasma effector alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization. We demonstrate that SAP54 effectively suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to the males. Critically, the host plant MADS-box transcription factor short vegetative phase ( SVP ) emerges as a key element in the female leafhopper preference for plants exposed to males, with SAP54 promoting the degradation of SVP. This preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed svp null mutant plants over those not exposed to males. Our research underscores the dual role of the phytoplasma effector SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction - integral to the phytoplasma life cycle. Importantly, we clarify how SAP54, by targeting SVP, heightens leaf vulnerability to leafhopper males, thus facilitating female attraction and subsequent plant colonization by the insects. SAP54 essentially acts as a molecular ‘matchmaker’, helping male leafhoppers more easily locate mates by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves. This study not only provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes, but also opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions.

    Here, we investigated colonization preferences of the leafhopper vector M. quadrilineatus, the predominant vector of AY-WB phytoplasma, for plants that produce the AY-WB effector SAP54. We made the surprising discovery that female preference for SAP54 plants only occurs in the presence of males. Both SAP54 and males are necessary for this preference, as females did not show a preference in their absence. As well, SAP54 plants exposed to males display significant downregulation of biotic stress responses. We identified the MADS-box transcription factor SVP to be essential for this female preference to male-exposed SAP54 plants. Leafhopper females exhibited a preference for reproducing on svp null mutant plants, a behavior that is also contingent upon the presence of leafhopper males, and aligning with our observation that SAP54 mediates the degradation of SVP in leaves. Therefore, by characterizing a parasite effector, we revealed the crucial role of SVP in leaf susceptibility to male herbivorous insects, enhancing female attraction and colonization. This work built on our previous findings that the leaf-like flowers are not required for the insect colonization preference and the insect vectors are predominantly attracted to the leaves and not flowers of plants ( Orlovskis and Hogenhout, 2016 ). Here, we independently confirm these data via experiments that show a preference of the insects for A. thaliana rosettes before the onset of flowering. Therefore, a morphological change in the host may not always be responsble for the extended phenotype effect on the alternative host, which is in this case the insect vector. It is possible that the attraction of insect vectors to leaves is the primary function of SAP54, and the induction of the leaf-like flowers an evolutionary side-effect of SAP54 adaptation to target MTFs that leads to degradation of SVP

., 2022 ). Our study further expands the mechanistic understanding about insect gender specific factors targeted by parasites. In our research, we have uncovered a mechanism whereby the phytoplasma effector SAP54 targets a conserved host regulator, SVP, to attract female leafhopper vectors to produce more progeny on plants exposed to leafhopper males. Given that phytoplasmas rely on leafhoppers for acquisition during feeding and subsequent transmission to other plants, SAP54 likely promotes the abundance of phytoplasma-carrying insect vectors and facilitates phytoplasma transmission. This illustrates how a bacterial gene extends its influence beyond its primary plant host to modulate the host choice and reproductive behavior of the insect vector. Such findings underscore the complexity of tripartite plant-insect-microbe interactions, wherein parasitic genes exhibit what could be termed 'hyper-extended phenotypes,'manipulating the biology of one host to facilitate transmission through another host. This research advances our understanding of plant-microbe interactions and resonates with the concept of the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis ( EES ), as articulated by Hunter, 2018. Within the EES framework, parasitic genes like SAP54 evolve adaptively through both natural selection and direct biochemical interactions with plant regulators, as well as through the extended functions these regulators serve in interactions with insect vectors. In this study, we found that the extended role includes enhancing the likelihood of male vectors to attract females for reproduction.

. Our past research showed that insects prefer SAP54 plants during the vegetative developmental phase, before flowers emerge, and even flowering SAP54 plants upon removal of the leaf-like flowers ( Orlovskis and Hogenhout, 2016 ). Therefore, it remains unclear whether plant MADS-box transcription factors play a role in the leafhopper attraction phenotype. MADS-box transcription factors have been predominantly studied in relation to regulation of floral transition and flower organ development. Nonetheless, factors like suppressor of overexpression of CO 1 ( SOC1 ) and short vegetative phase ( SVP ) are also expressed in leaves and other organs during the A. thaliana vegetative developmental phase, and regulate processes other than orchestrating the flowering process, such as plant defence responses, as has been shown for SOC1 ( Li et al., 2020 ). Based on these insights, we hypothesize that leafhopper attraction is influenced by MADS-box transcription factors involved in processes other than flowering. Here, we analysed the factors influencing leafhopper colonization preference in SAP54 plants. Surprisingly, we found that colonization preference on SAP54 plants only occurs in the presence of males on leaves during choice tests. Both SAP54 and males are essential for female preference, as females did not exhibit a preference for male-exposed versus non-exposed control plants, nor for SAP54 plants versus control plants in the absence of males. In contrast, female-only presence on SAP54 plants deters colonization by other females. We noted a clear downregulation of biotic stress response pathways in male-exposed SAP54 leaves, contrasting with the upregulation observed in female-exposed SAP54 leaves and control plants exposed to both males and females. Furthermore, we found that the MADS-box transcription factor SVP is essential for female preference in male-exposed SAP54 plants

., 2019 ) and are often dependent on sap-feeding insects, including leafhoppers, plant hoppers and psyllids, for transmission ( Weintraub and Beanland, 2006 ). As obligate bacterial parasites, phytoplasmas frequently trigger the emergence of unusual plant structures such as leaf-like floral parts ( phyllody ) and the excessive growth and clustering of leaves and branches ( witch’s broom; Lee et al., 2000; Al-Subhi et al., 2018; Kumari et al., 2019 ). These alterations not only compromise plant health but also promote attraction and colonization of insect vectors that are primarily responsible for phytoplasma spread and transmission ( Sugio et al., 2011a; Frost et al., 2013; MacLean et al., 2014; Orlovskis and Hogenhout, 2016; Clements et al., 2021; Al-Subhi et al., 2021; Huang and Hogenhout, 2022 ). The responsible phytoplasma genes encode for effector molecules that, once inside the plant cell cytoplasm, target and typically disrupt or degrade essential plant transcription factors involved in growth, development, and defence ( review by Wang et al., 2024 and references therein as well as Liu et al., 2023; Suzuki et al., 2024; Correa Marrero et al., 2024; Yan et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024 ). This molecular interference exemplifies the extended phenotype reach, affecting not just the host appearance but also its physiological and biological processes. The interaction between the Aster Yellows strain Witches Broom ( AY-WB ) phytoplasma and its vector, the aster leafhopper Macrosteles quadrilineatus, offers insights into the complex interplay between parasites and hosts. The effector protein secreted AY-WB protein ( SAP ) 11 binds to and destabilizes class II TCP transcription factors - this action leads to changes in leaf shapes and stem proliferation, reminiscent of witches’ brooms, and altered root architecture resembling the hairy roots found in infected plants ( Bai et al., 2009; Sugio et al

., 2008b; Rid et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2016 ), we examined whether male-induced female preference for SAP54 plants in the A. thaliana is mediated by the MADS transcription factor SVP. We found that SVP plays a key role in the attraction of leafh females to male-exposed SAP plants and that this preference is contingent on the presence of leafh males. Our results suggest that SAP promotes the degradation of SVP in leaves exposed to males, thereby enhancing the likelihood of colonization by leafh females. This study highlights the dual role of the phytopma effector SAP54 in host alteration and vector attraction integral to the phytopma life cycle, and clarifies how SAP, by targeting SVP, heightens leaf vulnerability to leafh males, facilitating attraction and subsequent colonization by the insects.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Candida albicans, an opportunistic human pathogen, poses a significant threat to human health and is associated with significant socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments fail, at least in part, because C. albicans can initiate a strong drug tolerance response that allows some cells to grow at drug concentrations above their minimal inhibitory concentration. To better characterize this cytoprotective tolerance program at the molecular single-cell level, we used a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform to profile thousands of individual fungal cells and establish their subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs. Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell cycle stage with distinct metabolic and stress responses. At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure ( a time when tolerance is measurable ), surviving cells bifurcate into two major subpopulations: one characterized by the upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, rRNA processing machinery, and mitochondrial cellular respiration capacity, termed the Ribo-dominant ( Rd ) state; and the other enriched for genes encoding stress responses and related processes, termed the Stress-dominant ( Sd ) state. This bifurcation persists at 3 and 6 days post-treatment. We provide evidence that the ribosome assembly stress response ( RASTR ) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate cell survival.

    The use of a nanoliter droplet-based assay adapted for fungal cells enabled a detailed sc analysis of C. albicans in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs over a period of days. The assay was cost-effective and encountered minimal issues or failed runs. Studies of thousands of individual cells enriched our understanding of community structure and population heterogeneity. Specifically, this study refines published bulk transcriptome studies by differentiating between genes, pathways, and responses that are expressed universally in all cells, and those that are restricted to specific subpopulations. Here, by examining cellular trajectories across populations in a high-throughput manner, we obtained new insights into time-sensitive processes, such as the emergence of drug tolerance during 2–3 days of drug exposure and the existence of cells with Rd and Sd states, which reflect two different cellular states within the RASTR response described as a molecular signature of an S. cerevisiae stress response. If the Rd response proves generalizable to other drug treatments, disrupting the Rd to Sd tolerance transition or the Sd response itself could represent an innovative therapeutic approach for other antifungal treatments.

., 2020 ), we profiled C. albicans using a fungal nanoliter droplet-based assay ( DROP-seq ), modified from the original system presented by Macosko et al., 2015. This approach overcomes technical challenges that arise in fungal settings, providing a flexible, cost-effective solution. Here, we extend the data and analysis from Bettauer et al. to better understand subpopulation-specific responses to drug stress. Since the original sc study ( Bettauer et al., 2020 ), a second C. albicans sc study was performed to investigate the initial response ( within 3 hr ) to high FCZ concentrations ( Dohn et al., 2022 ). Dohn and colleagues observed increased expression of ergosterol genes, an increase in cell cycle arrest genes, and a transient increase in stress response gene expression at 1. 5 hr. The work also identifies interesting variability in the temporal response to acute drug exposure but does not address molecular heterogeneity in the subsequent emergence from cell cycle arrest that can only be observed as tolerance after longer times ( days 2–3 ), the focus of this study. Here, we use the fungal DROP-seq system ( Bettauer et al., 2020 ) to explore phenotypic heterogeneity in the C. albicans response to antifungal drugs. We profiled the transcriptomes of thousands of individual cells from C. albicans populations that were either untreated ( UT ) or exposed to antifungal compounds with a focus on FCZ across several days. This data is integrated with bulk DNA sequencing and fluorescence microscopy to provide in-depth analyses that focus on subpopulation composition and phenotypic heterogeneity across isogenic cell populations. We detect a heterogeneous response to FCZ within isogenic populations, supporting the idea that different cells exhibit distinct survival strategies, including some with increased expression of genes related to drug tolerance

To uncover molecular events associated with the emergence of drug tolerance in C. albicans, we performed a series of disk diffusion assays, focusing on a 6-day time series with FCZ, detailed in Appendix 1. When assayed at 48 hr, both disk assays and broth microdilution assays report on tolerance ( Rosenberg et al., 2018 ). Drug tolerance increased significantly between days 1 and 2 ( p<0. 001, Kruskal-Wallis χ2 test ) and increased slightly at day 3, after which the tolerance level did not change. Thus, tolerant cells are present in all cultures starting at day 2. Since these populations originate from a single isogenic colony, we assume that tolerant and non-tolerant cells in the same culture differentially express pathways and processes relevant to their ability to grow ( or not grow ) in the presence of the drug. We do not observe widespread drug resistance at any time point. Although sc profiling with a commercial system is feasible in S. cerevisiae ( Jackson et al., 2020 ), specific aspects of fungal biology motivated us to develop a low-cost alternative tailored for fungi, specifically C. albicans. We first optimized the removal of the cell wall, as well as the time and concentration parameters to fix the transcriptome ( Materials and methods, ‘Strains, media, and drug treatment’, ‘Spheroplasts’ ). We then built a nanoliter droplet-based system modified from Macosko et al., 2015, using in-house components as described previously ( Booeshaghi et al., 2019 ), to reduce the device and assay costs. The profiles reported here combine our preliminary effort ( Bettauer et al., 2020 ) with additional data and analyses to provide increased power to examine the technical and biological efficacy of our system. C. albicans populations were grown in rich media alone ( UT ) or with an antifungal compound: FCZ ( 1 µg/ml ), caspofungin ( CSP; 1 ng/ml ), or rapamycin ( RAPA; 0

Candida albicans is one of the most prevalent human fungal pathogens ( Benedict et al., 2019; Kullberg and Arendrup, 2015; Pappas et al., 2018 ). Systemic C. albicans infections are the second most common cause of mortality from infectious diseases in extremely premature infants ( 15–20% mortality ), and the fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections ( 30–50% mortality ) ( Benjamin et al., 2010; Brown and Netea, 2012; Pfaller et al., 2019 ). The frequency of drug resistance is far lower than the frequency of treatment failures, such that most infections that fail to respond to antifungal drug treatments are susceptible to the drug. This clinical persistence can result from heterogeneity in antifungal drug responses, variations in host immune status, and the inability of drugs to reach their fungal target sites ( Delarze and Sanglard, 2015; Wuyts et al., 2018 ). A resistant fungal isolate can thrive in the presence of an antifungal drug at concentrations exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) of that species, with detectable growth within 24 hr of drug exposure. For a tolerant fungal isolate, a proportion of cells ( typically 5–95% of the population ) can grow, albeit slowly, at concentrations surpassing the population average MIC ( Berman and Krysan, 2020 ) ; tolerance is detectable only 48 hr after drug exposure, which is longer than most clinical assays are performed ( Espinel-Ingroff et al., 2017 ). Approaches for predicting patient response to an infection, based solely on the average response of cells to a drug challenge across a population after 24 hr, can overlook such subpopulations with behaviors that have the potential to significantly impact the evolution of drug resistance ( Altschuler and Wu, 2010 )

. These results align with several previous reports that associate cell cycle phase with the expression of stress response and metabolism-related genes ( Brauer et al., 2008; Chiu et al., 2011; Hossain et al., 2021; Senn et al., 2012 ). We next investigated the C. albicans response to antifungal compounds using fungistatic FCZ ( 1 µg/ml, 1–2 × MIC50, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ), and fungicidal CSP ( 1 ng/ml, <0. 03 × MIC ). These concentrations were chosen to ensure a sufficient number of survivors. FCZ targets Erg11p, which encodes an enzyme central to ergosterol biosynthesis and membrane integrity ( Odds et al., 2003; Thamban Chandrika et al., 2018; Wertheimer et al., 2016 ). At these concentrations, FCZ treatment slows growth relative to UT controls in the first days after exposure ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ). We observed a similar response to CSP ( Figure 3— supplement 1B ), which is fungicidal at 0. 03 × MIC. In contrast, RAPA (0.1 × MIC ) did not inhibit growth ( Figure 3— supplement 1C ) and was used as a negative control. We used the nanol droplet-based system to profile the transcriptomes of individual C. alb cells in the absence and presence of these antif drugs.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution posits variation among species in the effectiveness of selection. In an idealized model, the census population size determines both this minimum magnitude of the selection coefficient required for deleterious variants to be reliably purged, and the amount of neutral diversity. Empirically, an ‘effective population size’ is often estimated from the amount of putatively neutral genetic diversity and is assumed to also capture a species’ effectiveness of selection. A potentially more direct measure of the effectiveness of selection is the degree to which selection maintains preferred codons. However, past metrics that compare codon bias across species are confounded by among-species variation in %GC content and/or amino acid composition. Here, we propose a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species ( CAIS ), based on Kullback–Leibler divergence, that corrects for both confounders. We demonstrate the use of CAIS correlations, as well as the Effective Number of Codons, to show that the protein domains of more highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher intrinsic structural disorder. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Codon adaptation metrics more directly quantify how species vary in their exquisiteness of adaptation, than do estimates of effective population size that are based on neutral polymorphism. Both CAIS and ENC can also be estimated for far more species because they do not require polymorphism or mutation rate data, nor tRNA gene copy numbers and abundances, but only a single complete genome. CAIS has the additional advantage of not being confounded with amino acid frequencies. This makes CAIS a useful tool for applying nearly neutral theory to protein evolution, as shown by our worked example of ISD.

. It is possible that the reason that we obtained correlations when we controlled for genome-wide GC content, but not when we controlled for local GC content, is also that codon adaptation adjusts slowly relative to the timescale of fluctuations in local GC content. Here, we developed a new metric of species adaptedness at the codon level, capable of quantifying degrees of codon adaptation even among vertebrates. We chose vertebrates partly due to the abundance of suitable data, and partly as a stringent test case, given past studies finding limited evidence for codon adaptation ( Kessler and Dean, 2014 ). It remains to be seen how CAIS behaves among species with stronger codon adaptation. We restricted our analysis to only the best annotated genomes, in part to ensure the quality of intergenic %GC estimates, and in part limited by the feasibility of running linear mixed models with 6 million datapoints. The phylogenetic tree is well resolved for vertebrate species, with an overrepresentation of mammalian species. Despite the focus on vertebrates, we were able to discover new results regarding selection on ISD. Our finding that more effective selection prefers higher ISD was unexpected, given that lower-Ne eukaryotes have more disordered proteins than higher-Ne prokaryotes ( Ahrens et al., 2017; Basile et al., 2019 ). However, this can be reconciled in a model in which highly disordered sequences are less likely to be found in high-Ne species, but the sequences that are present tend to have slightly higher disorder than their low-Ne homologs. High ISD might help mitigate the trade-off between affinity and specificity in protein–protein interactions ( Dunker et al., 1998; Huang and Liu, 2013; Lazar et al., 2022 ) ; non-specific interactions might be short-lived due to the high entropy associated with disorder, which specific interactions are robust to

When different properties are each causally affected by a species’ exquisiteness of adaptation, this will create a correlation between the properties. We use codon adaptation as a reference property, such that correlations with codon adaptation indicate selection. To detect ISD as a novel property under selection, we used a linear mixed model approach that controls for Pfam identity as a random effect. This approach shows that the same Pfam domain tends to be more disordered when found in a well-adapted species ( i. e. a species with a higher CAIS or ENC ). This is true for both ancient and recently emerged protein domains. It is important that no additional variable such as GC content or amino acid frequencies creates a spurious correlation by affecting both CAIS and our property of interest. For this reason, we define CAIS as the observed Kullback–Leibler divergence ( Kullback and Leibler, 1951 ) from the codon usage expected given the GC content. The GC content pertinent to this expectation depends primarily on mutation bias and GC-biased gene conversion ( Romiguier and Roux, 2017 ), but potentially also on selection on individual nucleotide substitutions that is hypothesized to favor higher %GC ( Long et al., 2018 ). By controlling for %GC, we exclude all these forces from influencing CAIS or ENC. We thus capture the extent of adaptation in codon bias, including translational speed, accuracy, and any intrinsic preference for GC over AT that is specific to coding regions. These remaining codon-adaptive factors do not create a statistically convincing correlation between CAIS and GC ( Figure 3C ), nor between ENC and GC ( Figure 3B ), although CAI is strongly correlated with GC ( Figure 3A ). Notably, our new CAIS metric of codon adaptation controls for amino acid frequencies, rather than, like ENC, only GC content

. Conveniently, it can be estimated from only a single genome, that is, without polymorphism or mutation rate data for that species. One commonly used metric, the Codon Adaptation Index ( CAI ) ( Sharp and Li, 1987; Sharp et al., 2010 ) takes the average of Relative Synonymous Codon Usage ( RSCU ) scores, which quantify how often a codon is used, relative to the codon that is most frequently used to encode that amino acid in that species. While this works well for comparing genes within the same species, it unfortunately means that the species-wide strength of codon bias appears in the normalizing denominator ( see Equation 4 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ). Paradoxically, this can make more exquisitely adapted species have lower rather than higher species-averaged CAI scores ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B; Rocha, 2004; Botzman and Margalit, 2011 ). To compare species using CAI, it has been suggested that instead of taking a genome-wide average, one should consider a set of highly expressed reference genes ( Sharp et al., 2005; Vicario et al., 2007; Subramanian, 2008; dos Reis and Wernisch, 2009 ). This approach assumes that the relative strength of selection on those reference genes ( often a function of gene expression ) remains approximately constant across the set of species considered ( red distributions in Figure 2 ). Its use also requires careful attention to the length of reference genes ( Urrutia and Hurst, 2001; Doherty and McInerney, 2013 ), and some approaches also require information about tRNA gene copy numbers and abundances ( dos Reis and Wernisch, 2009 ). Since codon bias varies quantitatively within only a small range of sN ( Figure 1 ), a promising approach is to measure the proportion of sites at which codon adaptation is effective. We posit that more highly adapted species have a higher proportion of both genes and sites subject to effective selection on codon bias ( Figure 2; Galtier et al., 2018 )

., 2018 ). Indeed, CAI might also rely in part on variation in the fraction of sites within the reference genes that is subject to effective selection as a function of species ( Figure 2, red ). Here we take this logic further, considering all sites in a proteome-wide approach. Averaging across the entire proteome provides robustness to shifts in the expression level of or strength of selection on particular genes. The proteome-wide average depends on the fraction of sites whose selection coefficients exceed the ‘drift barrier’ for that particular species ( Figure 2, blue threshold ). In estimating the effects of selection, it is critical to control for other causes of codon bias. In particular, species differ in their mutational bias with respect to the proportion of the genome that consists of guanine-cytosine base pairs ( GC ), and in the frequency of GC-biased gene conversion ( Urrutia and Hurst, 2001; Duret and Galtier, 2009; Doherty and McInerney, 2013; Figuet et al., 2014 ). Here, we control for %GC, capturing species differences both in mutation and in gene conversion, by calculating the Kullback–Leibler divergence of the observed codon frequencies away from the codon frequencies that we would expect to see given the genomic %GC content of the species. Kullback–Leibler divergence measures the distance of an observed probability distribution from an expected reference distribution, capturing a measure of surprise ( Kullback and Leibler, 1951 ). This method does not require us to specify preferred vs. non-preferred codons, and can thus also accommodate situations in which different genes have different codon preferences ( Gingold et al., 2007 ). The Kull–Leib divergence of codon frequencies from expected given %GC is the Cod Adaptation Index of Species ( CAIS ), a measure of the degree to which codon usage is adapted to the species’ GC content. CAIS is not confounded by amino acid frequencies, unlike ENC, and can be estimated from a single genome without polymorphism or mutation rate data, tRNA copy numbers, or abundances.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Sepsis causes millions of deaths per year worldwide and is a current global health priority declared by the WHO. Sepsis-related deaths are a result of dysregulated inflammatory immune responses indicating the need to develop strategies to target inflammation. An important mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) that is released by inflamed host cells and tissues, and also by bacteria in a strain-specific and growth-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP. Using genetic mutant strains of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ), we demonstrate that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane. In addition, impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane notably contributes to ATP release and is associated with bacterial death. In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis, local effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using a transformed E. coli bearing an arabinose-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released. Abrogating bacterial ATP release shows that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival. In addition, bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles ( OMV ). ATP-loaded OMV are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulated expression of genes activating degranulation in neutrophils, potentially contributing to the exacerbation of sepsis severity. This study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Furthermore, it remains to be elucidated, which mechanisms lead to low local neutrophil counts. Since ATP is involved in cell death ( Proietti et al., 2019 ) as well as in chemotaxis ( Junger, 2011 ), increased cell death, impaired infiltration, or a combination of both is possible. This study reveals that ATP is released by bacteria during growth because of impaired membrane integrity and bacterial death. ATP is also being released via OMV and therefore acts locally ( direct release ) and systemically ( via OMV ). Bacterial ATP reduces neutrophil counts, activates the endolysosomal system, and upregulates neutrophil degranulation, which together increase the severity of abdominal infection and early sepsis. These findings have the potential to lead to the development of novel treatments for abdominal sepsis, e. g., by in vitro generated OMV that modulate neutrophil function via delivery of inhibitors to intracellular purinergic receptors during sepsis.

. E. coli, which is one of the most frequent facultative pathogens in patients with abdominal sepsis, released the highest amount of ATP isolated from a standardized mouse model of abdominal sepsis. After having demonstrated that sepsis-associated bacteria release ATP, we next questioned whether and how ATP release is dependent on ATP generation. ATP synthase and cytochrome oxidases, which are located in the inner bacterial membrane, are key components of ATP generation under aerobic conditions. Therefore, ATP release of the E. coli parental strain ( PS ) was compared to all available mutants of ATP synthase subunits ( ΔatpA, ΔatpB, ΔatpC, ΔatpD, ΔatpE, ΔatpF, ΔatpH ) and cytochrome bo3 oxidase subunits ( ΔcyoA, ΔcyoB, ΔcyoC, ΔcyoD ) from the Keio collection ( Baba et al., 2006; Yamamoto et al., 2009 ). The use of different mutants allows to identify the most relevant subunits influencing ATP release. Also, it allows to identify a possible correlation of bacterial ATP release with growth, which is a function of ATP generation ( Figure 2A; Galber et al., 2021; Ihssen et al., 2021; Ivancic et al., 2008; Lundin, 2000 ). Bacterial growth ( OD600 ) and ATP release were measured over time and cumulative ATP release ( AUC ATP ) was assessed ( Figure 2B ). We first noticed that mutations in subunits of ATP synthase, which is the key enzyme of ATP generation, were generally associated with significantly lower cumulative ATP release compared to mutations in cytochrome bo3 oxidase subunits ( Figure 2C ). Therefore, we suspected an interrelation between ATP generation and released ATP ( see growth and ATP release curves in Figure 2B ). We determined cumulative growth ( AUC growth ) in addition to cumulative ATP release and indeed, cumulative ATP release and cumulative growth were positively correlated ( Figure 2D ), similar to peak ATP and peak growth ( OD600 ) that are positively correlated ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 )

., 2013 ). Such ATP release might be a conserved mechanism of protection from host defense and precede host responses. ATP release has been shown for a variety of bacteria including the sepsis-associated Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) and Klebsiella pneumoniae ( K. pneumoniae ) from the Proteobacteria phylum or Enterococcus faecalis ( E. faecalis ) and Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) from the Firmicutes phylum ( Diekema et al., 2019; Hironaka et al., 2013; Iwase et al., 2010; Mempin et al., 2013; Mureșan et al., 2018 ). The mechanisms by which inflammatory and immune responses in the host are modulated by such released bacterial ATP have just begun to be elucidated ( Spari and Beldi, 2020 ). In colonized compartments such as the intestine, it has been shown that ATP released by mutualistic bacteria modulates local cellular and secretory immune responses ( Atarashi et al., 2008; Perruzza et al., 2017; Proietti et al., 2019 ) and in the mouth, bacterial ATP release leads to biofilm dispersal and periodontitis ( Ding et al., 2016a; Ding and Tan, 2016b ). However, the role of ATP released by bacteria invading non-colonized compartments, such as the abdominal cavity or the blood in the context of local and systemic infections, remains to be determined. In this study, we investigated if ATP released from bacteria influences the outcome of abdominal sepsis. We first isolated sepsis-associated bacteria and measured the amount of ATP they release. Second, we analyzed the function of the inner bacterial membrane on ATP release over time in E. coli and in E. coli with mutations in integral respiratory chain proteins ( Mempin et al., 2013 ). Third, the function of the outer bacterial membrane on ATP release during growth was assessed using porin mutants ( Alvarez et al., 2017; Choi and Lee, 2019 ). Fourth, we investigated local effects of ATP in the abdominal cavity

To assess ATP release of sepsis-associated bacteria, abdominal fluid of patients with abdominal sepsis was sampled and an/aerobically incubated on LB agar plates ( Figure 1A ). Twenty-five different colonies were randomly picked and analyzed by whole 16S-rRNA Sanger sequencing, which resulted in 12 different bacterial species ( Figure 1B ). From these, the four most clinically important sepsis-associated bacteria E. coli, K. pneumoniae ( both gramneg ), E. faecalis, and S. aureus ( both grampos ) ( Diekema et al., 2019; Mureșan et al., 2018 ) were further cultivated for experimental studies. We quantified released ATP over time ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) using a luciferin-luciferase-based assay. A growth-dependent release of ATP was observed in all species, peaking during exponential growth phase ( Figure 1C ). Cumulative amount of released ATP was quantified using the area under the curve ( AUC ) of released ATP over time ( AUC ATP ). ATP release was detected across all assessed species ( Figure 1D ). To model these findings in mice, abdominal sepsis was induced using a standardized cecal ligation and puncture ( CLP ) model ( Dosch et al., 2019; Figure 1E ). Similar to human samples, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes phyla were predominating ( Figure 1F, see Figure 1B ). In the mouse model, E. coli released notably more cumulative ATP compared to E. faecalis and S. aureus ( Figure 1G and H ). The bacterial species assessed in humans and mice ( E. coli, E. faecalis, S. aureus ) differed on the strain level ( sequences deposited, see Data availability statement ) confirming that ATP release is strain-specific ( Mempin et al., 2013 ). In summary, sepsis-associated bacteria release ATP in a growth-dependent and strain-specific manner. E

. We conclude from these data that destabilization of the outer bacterial membrane ( as observed with the ΔompF mutant ) results in bacterial death that is associated with ATP release. In summary, outer membrane integrity and finally bacterial death notably contribute to the amount of bacterial ATP release during growth. Next, we wanted to investigate the function of bacterial ATP release in vivo. To study this, we generated E. coli bearing an arabin-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released ( Figure 3A ). This strain was used in a mouse model of abdominal seps induced by CLP ( Figure 3B ). In this model, bacterial release of ATP was abrogated ( Figure 3C ) and neutrophil counts were increased ( Figure 3D ) and survival was improved ( Figure 3E ) compared to the parental strain. These results indicate that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses and contributes to seps severity. Furthermore, we investigated the systemic effects of ATP via outer membrane vesicles ( OMV ) loaded with ATP ( Figure 3F ). OMV were quickly distributed throughout the body ( Figure 3G ) and upregulated expression of genes degranulation in neutils ( Figure 3 ) contributing to the exacerbation of seps severity. This study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis. The findings have the potential to lead to the development of novel treatments for abdominal seps, e. g. by in vitro OM that modulate neutil function via delivery of inhibitors to intracellular purergic receptors during seps.

    Title: 
    Abstract: In children, psychotic-like experiences ( PLEs ) are related to risk of psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. Maladaptive cognitive functioning, influenced by genetic and environmental factors, is hypothesized to mediate the relationship between these factors and childhood PLEs. Using large-scale longitudinal data, we tested the relationships of genetic and environmental factors ( such as familial and neighborhood environment ) with cognitive intelligence and their relationships with current and future PLEs in children. We leveraged large-scale multimodal data of 6, 602 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study. Linear mixed model and a novel structural equation modeling ( SEM ) method that allows estimation of both components and factors were used to estimate the joint effects of cognitive phenotypes polygenic scores ( PGSs ), familial and neighborhood socioeconomic status ( SES ), and supportive environment on NIH Toolbox cognitive intelligence and PLEs. We adjusted for ethnicity ( genetically defined ), schizophrenia PGS, and additionally unobserved confounders ( using computational confound modeling ). Our findings indicate that lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs are significantly associated with lower PGSs for cognitive phenotypes, lower familial SES, lower neighborhood SES, and less supportive environments. Specifically, cognitive intelligence mediates the effects of these factors on PLEs, with supportive parenting and positive school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing PLEs. This study underscores the influence of genetic and environmental factors on PLEs through their effects on cognitive intelligence. Our findings have policy implications in that improving school and family environments and promoting local economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children.

    This study investigated the relationships of the genetic and environmental influences on the development of intelligence and the PLEs in youth, leveraging genetic data from the large epidemiological samples and a multi-level environmental ( socioeconomic ) data. Our results support the model that genetic factors ( PGS for cognitive phenotypes ), socioeconomic conditions, and family and school environments may influence cognitive intelligence in children, and this impact may lead to the individual variability of the current and future PLEs in children. Our analysis with integrated data shows the contributions of genetic and environmental factors, respectively, to cognitive and mental wellness in children, and further provides policy implications to improve them. Our SEM shows that cognitive intelligence mediates the environmental and genetic influence on the current and future PLEs. The environmental factors ( family SES, neighborhood SES, and positive parenting and schooling ) and PGS of cognitive phenotypes exhibit significant indirect effects via cognitive intelligence on PLEs. Prior research identifying the mediation of cognitive intelligence focused on either genetic ( Karcher et al., 2022 ) or environmental factors ( Lewis et al., 2020 ) alone. Studies with older clinical samples have shown that cognitive deficit may be a precursor for the onset of psychotic disorders ( Eastvold et al., 2007; Fett et al., 2020; Vorstman et al., 2015 ). Our study advances this by demonstrating the integrated effects of genetic and environmental factors on PLEs through the cognitive intelligence in 9- to 11-year-old children. Such comprehensive analysis contributes to assessing the relative importance of various factors influencing children’s cognition and mental health, and it can aid future studies designed for identifying health policy implications

. We assessed path-analytic relationships among the six key constructs: cognitive phenotypes PGSs, family SES, neighborhood SES, positive family and school environment, general intelligence, and PLEs. Considering that the observed variables of the PGSs, family SES, neighborhood SES, positive family and school environment, and PLEs are evaluated as a composite index by prior research, the IGSCA method can mitigate bias more effectively by representing these constructs as components. Notably, investigations carried out by Judd et al., 2020 and Martin et al., 2015 utilized composite indicators to examine the genetic influence on EA and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Moreover, socioenvironmental influences are often treated as composite indicators as highlighted in Judd et al., 2020. When considering the psychosis continuum, studies like that of van Os et al., 2009 postulate that psychotic disorders are likely underpinned by a multiplicity of background factors rather than a single common factor. This perspective is substantiated by a multitude of prior research that deploys composite indices for the measurement of psychotic symptoms. For these reasons, we statistically represented these constructs as the weighted sums of their observed variables or components ( Cho et al., 2022 ). On the other hand, we represented general intelligence as a common factor that determines the underlying covariance pattern of fluid and crystallized intelligence, based on the classical g theory of intelligence ( Jensen, 1998; Spearman, 1904 ). The IGSCA model included the same covariates used in the linear mixed model as well as the ABCD research site as an additional covariate. We applied GSCA Pro 1. 1 ( Hwang et al

. Neighborhood-level SES was assessed using the Area Deprivation Index ( ADI ), the percentage of individuals below −125% of the poverty level ( henceforth ‘poverty’ ), and years of residence, which were associated with PLEs in prior research ( Karcher et al., 2021 ). Higher values of ADI and poverty and fewer years of residence indicate a lower neighborhood SES. Based on existing literature ( Karcher et al., 2021; Rakesh et al., 2021 ), we measured the level of positive parenting behavior and positive school environment to assess the effect of positive family and school environment on each individual. In this study, we employ linear mixed models and a novel structural equation modeling ( SEM ) method to examine the longitudinal trajectories of genetic and environmental influences on PLEs mediated by cognitive intelligence. We specifically investigate the mediating role of cognitive intelligence within the impacts of cognitive phenotype PGSs, high family SES, low neighborhood SES, and positive family and school environments on PLEs. These influences are examined across three periods of PLEs observations: baseline, 1-year follow-up, and 2-year follow-up ( Figure 1 ). Using linear mixed models to minimize potential population stratification from different household environments and geographical locations ( Cho et al., 2022 ), we analyzed the genetic and environmental effects on cognitive intelligence and PLEs. Key variables of interest were PGS, family SES, neighborhood SES, and positive environment. To avoid multicollinearity, CP and EA PGSs were used separately in two other models. As a random factor, the variable indicating ABCD research sites was used. Variables within each model had no signs of multicollinearity ( Fox and Monette, 1992 ) ( generalized variance inflation factor <2. 0 for every variable in all models )

. In this study, we systematically explore the longitudinal trajectories of genetic and environmental influences on PLEs, mediated through cognitive intelligence. Toward this goal, we firstly assess the associations of cognitive phenotype PGSs, family and neighborhood SES, and supportive environment with children’s cognitive intelligence and longitudinally measured PLEs. To maintain robustness of our assessment, we employed statistical and computational approaches to carefully consider potential confounding. We then test the mediating effect of cognitive intelligence on the relationship between genetic and environmental factors and PLEs. Our investigation traces these effects from the baseline and through the 1- and 2-year follow-ups, providing a nuanced understanding on the role of cognitive phenotype PGSs, family SES, neighborhood SES, and positive family and school environments in shaping PLEs in children aged 9–10 years.

The child’s sex, age, genetic ancestry, BMI, marital status of the caregiver, and family history of psychiatric disorders were included as covariates in the model ( Karcher et al., 2021 ). All continuous variables were standardized ( z-scaled ) beforehand to get standardized estimates, and the analyses were conducted with the lme4 package in R version 4. 1. 2. Throughout this paper, threshold for statistical significance was set at p < 0. 05, with correction for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate. 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals were obtained with 5000 iterations. To test the plausibility of whether cognitive intelligence may mediate the association between genetic and environmental factors and PLEs, we used an up-to-date SEM method, integrated generalized structured component analysis ( IGSCA ) ( Hwang et al., 2021b ). This approach is suited to our study using the multimodal genetic and environmental variables in that it estimates models with both factors and components as statistical proxies for the constructs. Standard SEM using latent factors ( i. e., indirectly measured indicators that explain the covariance among observed variables ) to represent indicators such as PGS or family SES relies on the assumption that observed variables within each construct share a common underlying factor. If this assumption is violated, standard SEM cannot effectively control for estimation biases. The IGSCA method addresses this limitation by allowing for the use of composite indicators ( i. e., components ) —defined as a weighted sum of observed variables—as constructs in the model, more effectively controlling bias in estimation compared to the standard SEM. During estimation, the IGSCA determines weights of each observed variable in such a way as to maximize the variances of all endogenous indicators and components

This study investigated the relationship between genetic and environmental factors and the development of psychotic-like experiences (LE) in children. The researchers used a large dataset of 6,602 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study and found that lower intelligence and higher LE were associated with lower genetic scores for cognitive phenotypes, lower socioeconomic status, neighborhood, and less supportive environments. They also found that intelligence mediated the effects of these factors on LE, with positive parenting and school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing LE. The study suggests that genetic and environmental factors influence LE through their effects on intelligence. The findings have implications for improving school and family environments and promoting economic development to enhance cognitive and mental health in children.
Researchers used human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiP)-derived cerebral organoids as an in vitro platform to investigate the effect of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) signaling on neural identity and differentiation. They found that F8 treatment increases cellular heterogeneity, leading to distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic domains in multi-regional organoids. Within telencealic regions, F8 affects anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamgic neurons, thus impacting spontaneous network activity. F8 modulates key regulators of several neurodevelopmental disorders. Results show that F8 signaling is involved in regional patterning and cellular in human organoids and modulating genes associated with normal and pathological development.

 Early in development, F8 serves as a potent inducer of posteriorized, specifying dienceph/mesalic domains in brainoids. As development progresses and FOX1 becomes established, consolidating telph fate, F acts as regulator A/P and V identities in fore cells. F ability to modulate target genes varies based on regional identity of F-exposed cells. Co-presence of various domains in F-treated organ - dorsal ventral telph, as well as dph and mesph regions represents significant outcome. F mutants, where F is inactivated at later, display milder phenotype, reduced cortex and ventral structures and expanded dorposterior profile. Phenotyp alterations between anterior (F), dorsal (BMP), and ventral (SH) patter centers in loss-function models obscure specific role F signaling in telence development. A system with controlled F modulation is preferable.

Transcript analysis F-treated versus untreated cerebraloids revealed F8 induction of ventral telph genes, suggesting primary role in promoting vent identity. Consistently, observed upregulation ventral such as ASCL, DLX, PBX and downregulation dorsal like EM, NEUO, SOX, LHX. F-treated organ showed altered balance glutamg (NEO, NE, CT, T, SAT, NF, S) and GABA (E, GS, PB, G) neurons. Functional using multi-electrode arrays (MEA) indicated reduced network and electrical signal in F-treated compared to controls. Electrophys profile, lower firing and burst, aligns reduction excitamg and increase inhib G neurons. Prolonged exposure F affects not only A but also D cell. As result, F-treated exhibit imbalance production excit and inhib neurons, impacts formation electrical networks. Data redefine role F as crucial pattering and establishment distinct D and A telph identities human, highlighting significance modulating expression developmental and N-related during organization brain.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Sleep and feeding patterns lack strong daily rhythms during early life. As diurnal animals mature, feeding is consolidated to the day and sleep to the night. In Drosophila, circadian sleep patterns are initiated with formation of a circuit connecting the central clock to arousal output neurons; emergence of circadian sleep also enables long-term memory ( LTM ). However, the cues that trigger the development of this clock-arousal circuit are unknown. Here, we identify a role for nutritional status in driving sleep-wake rhythm development in Drosophila larvae. We find that in the 2nd instar larval period ( L2 ), sleep and feeding are spread across the day; these behaviors become organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar larval stage ( L3 ). Forcing mature ( L3 ) animals to adopt immature ( L2 ) feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and the ability to exhibit LTM. In addition, the development of the clock ( DN1a ) -arousal ( Dh44 ) circuit itself is influenced by the larval nutritional environment. Finally, we demonstrate that larval arousal Dh44 neurons act through glucose metabolic genes to drive onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms. Together, our data suggest that changes to energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors.

   ., 2015 ) and Drosophila show rapid increases in overall larval body size including the size of the fat body ( used for nutrient storage ) across development ( Butterworth et al., 1988; Jacobs et al., 2020 ). However, the role that developmental change in metabolic drive plays in regulating the consolidation of behavioral rhythms is not known. In adult Drosophila, sleep and feeding behaviors are consolidated to specific times of day with flies eating more in the day than the night ( Barber et al., 2016 ). Yet, early in development, sleep in 2nd instar Drosophila larvae ( L2 ) lacks a circadian pattern ( Poe et al., 2023 ). We previously determined that sleep-wake rhythms are initiated in early 3rd instar Drosophila larvae ( L3 ) ( 72 hr AEL ). DN1a clock neurons anatomically and functionally connect to Dh44 arousal output neurons to drive the consolidation of sleep in L3. Development of this circuit promotes deeper sleep in L3 resulting in the emergence of long-term memory ( LTM ) capabilities at the L3 stage but not before ( Poe et al., 2023 ). Here, we identify the cues that trigger the emergence of the DN1a-Dh44 circuit and the consolidation of sleep-wake rhythms in Drosophila larvae. We demonstrate that developmental changes to energetic demands drive consolidation of periods of sleep and feeding across the day as animals mature. While endogenous deeper sleep in L3 facilitates LTM, we find that experimentally inducing deep sleep prematurely in L2 is detrimental to development and does not improve LTM performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that DN1a-Dh44 circuit formation is developmentally plastic, as rearing on an insufficient nutritional environment prevents establishment of this neural connection. Finally, we find that Dh44 neurons require glucose metabolic genes to promote sleep-wake rhythm development, suggesting that these neurons sense the nutritional environment to promote circadian-sleep crosstalk.

., 2023 ). Therefore, we examined the functional connectivity between clock and arousal loci in the setting of nutritional perturbation by expressing ATP-gated P2X2 receptors Yao et al., 2012 in DN1a neurons and GCaMP6 in Dh44 neurons. As expected, activation of DN1as in L3 raised on control food caused an increase in calcium in Dh44 neurons ( Figure 4A and B; Poe et al., 2023 ). In contrast, in L3 raised on L. S. conditions, activation of DN1as no longer elicited a response in Dh44 neurons ( Figure 4C and D ). Thus, the nascent connection underlying circadian sleep in Drosophila is developmentally plastic: in an insufficient nutritional environment, this connection is not functional, presumably to facilitate a more constant feeding pattern that fulfills energetic needs of the animal. However, this feeding pattern eschews deep sleep at the expense of LTM. We previously determined that release of CCHamide-1 ( CCHa1 ) from DN1as to CCHa1mide-1 receptor ( CCHa1-R ) on Dh44 neurons is necessary for sleep-wake rhythms in L3 ( Poe et al., 2023 ). Our data support a model in which the downstream Dh44 neurons are poised to receive clock ( DN1a ) input as soon the connection forms between these cellular populations. To test this idea directly, we next asked whether Dh44 neurons in L2, before the DN1a-Dh44 connection has formed, are competent to receive the CCHa1 signal. CCHamide-1 peptide was bath applied onto dissected larval brains expressing UAS-GCaMP7 in Dh44 neurons. As anticipated, we observed an increase in intracellular calcium in early L3 ( Figure 4E ) ; surprisingly, CCHa1 application did not alter calcium levels in Dh44 neurons in L2 ( Figure 4F ), indicating that Dh44 neurons are not capable of receiving CCHa1 input prior to early L3. Moreover, CCHa1 application in L3 reared on L. S

. S. also failed to elicit a response in Dh44 neurons ( Figure 4G ) suggesting that sub-optimal nutritional milieu influences the development of Dh44 neuronal competency to receive clock-driven cues. Thus, our data indicate that the nutritional environment influences DN1a-Dh44 circuit development. How do developing larvae detect changes in their nutritional environments to drive the circadian consolidation of sleep and feeding at the L3 stage? In adult Drosophila, Dh44 neurons act as nutrient sensors to regulate food consumption and starvation-induced sleep suppression through the activity of both glucose and amino acid sensing genes ( Dus et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2018; Oh et al., 2021; Oh and Suh, 2023 ). Indeed, Dh44 neurons themselves are activated by changes in bath application of nutritive sugars ( Dus et al., 2015 ). We next asked whether Dh44 neurons in L3 require metabolic genes to regulate sleep-wake rhythms. In L3 raised on regular food, we conducted an RNAi-based candidate screen of different glucose and amino acid sensing genes known to act in adult Dh44 neurons. Sleep duration at CT1 and CT13 was assessed with knockdown of glucose metabolic genes ( Hexokinase-C, Glucose transporter 1, and Pyruvate kinase ) or amino acid sensing genes ( Gcn2 and its downstream target ATF4 or cryptocephal ) in Dh44 neurons. We found that knockdown of glucose metabolism genes, Glut1, Hex-C and PyK, in Dh44 neurons resulted in a loss of rhythmic changes in sleep duration and bout number ( Figure 5A–C; Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–F ) with no effect on L3 feeding in the Hex-C manipulation ( Figure 5D ). Additionally, knockdown of Hex-C in DN1as did not disrupt rhythmic changes in sleep duration in L3 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1G–I ) suggesting a specialized role for glucose metabolism in Dh44 neurons for sleep-wake rhythm maturation

The emergence of circadian sleep-wake rhythms in Drosophila larvae is advantageous as it enables long-term memory capabilities at the L3 stage ( Poe et al., 2023 ). Less mature larvae ( L2 ) do not exhibit consolidated sleep-wake patterns, prompting us to ask why rhythmic behaviors do not emerge earlier in life. To determine if the absence of rhythmic sleep-wake patterns in L2 might be related to feeding patterns, we examined larval feeding rate ( # mouth hook contractions in a 5-min period ) under constant conditions at 4 times across the day ( Circadian Time [CT] 1, CT7, CT13, and CT19 ) in developmentally age-matched 2nd ( L2 ) and early 3rd instar ( L3; 72 hr AEL ) larvae. While we observed no differences in feeding rate across the day in L2, we found that L3 show diurnal differences in feeding with higher feeding rate during the subjective day compared to the subjective night ( Figure 1A and B ). Analysis of total food intake indicated that L2 consume the same amount at CT1 and CT13; however, L3 consume more at CT1 than at CT13 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). To assess whether the daily pattern of feeding in early L3 is dependent on the canonical circadian biological clock, we examined feeding rate in null mutants for the clock gene tim ( Konopka and Benzer, 1971 ). We observed no differences in feeding rate across the day in L3 tim mutants indicating that the daily feeding pattern requires a functioning molecular clock ( Figure 1C ). These findings underscore the tight relationship between sleep and feeding across development as diurnal differences in sleep emerge concurrently at the L3 stage ( Poe et al., 2023 ). To further investigate how the emergence of circadian sleepake in L3 is influenced by feeding patterns, we manipulated feeding in L2 to mimic the pattern of L3. Specifically, we fed L2 at CT1 and CT13 and starved at CT7 and CT19 to mimic the diurnal feeding pattern of L3. We found that premature adoption of L3 feeding pattern in L2 resulted in disrupted sleep-wake rhythms ( Figure 2 A and B ) and reduced ability to exhibit LTM ( Figure 2 C and D ). Conversely, feeding L2 at CT7 and CT19 and starved at CT1 and CT13 resulted in normal sleepake and LTM ( Figure 2 E and F ). These results suggest that the daily feeding pattern of L3 is necessary for the emergence of circadian sleepake in L.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Many animals moving through fluids exhibit highly coordinated group movement that is thought to reduce the cost of locomotion. However, direct energetic measurements demonstrating the energy-saving benefits of fluid-mediated collective movements remain elusive. By characterizing both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic energy contributions in schools of giant danio ( Devario aequipinnatus ), we discovered that fish schools have a concave upward shaped metabolism–speed curve, with a minimum metabolic cost at ~1 body length s-1. We demonstrate that fish schools reduce total energy expenditure ( TEE ) per tail beat by up to 56% compared to solitary fish. When reaching their maximum sustained swimming speed, fish swimming in schools had a 44% higher maximum aerobic performance and used 65% less non-aerobic energy compared to solitary individuals, which lowered the TEE and total cost of transport by up to 53%, near the lowest recorded for any aquatic organism. Fish in schools also recovered from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish. The non-aerobic energetic savings that occur when fish in schools actively swim at high speed can considerably improve both peak and repeated performance which is likely to be beneficial for evading predators. These energetic savings may underlie the prevalence of coordinated group locomotion in fishes.

   . Nevertheless, as fish move more rapidly over a speed range, we note that the total cost of transport of ~1. 2 kJ km–1 kg–1 at 3 BL s–1 is among the lowest recorded for aquatic organisms, and is less than the TCOT ( 1. 5 kJ km–1 kg–1 ) for jellyfish ( the most energetically efficient low-speed swimmers; Blocken et al., 2018 ) swimming at <2 BL s–1 ( Xu and Dabiri, 2020 ). In summary, our experiments on giant danio have demonstrated substantial energy conservation resulting from schooling dynamics across a wide range of speeds in fish. Direct measurement of both aerobic and non-aerobic energy use is critical for understanding the rapid collective movement of animals. Fish schooling in the high-drag viscous aquatic medium serves as a model for understanding how group movement by animals can be a more energy-efficient biological collective than movement by isolated individuals. By increasing maximum aerobic performance, fish schools save anaerobic energy and reduce the recovery time after peak swimming performance. Furthermore, by decreasing the proportion of metabolic capacity and recovery time devoted to locomotion, animals can apportion more energy to other fitness-related activities, such as digestion, growth and reproduction. More broadly, comprehending how the collective dynamics of animal movements in the water, land, and air can modify the energy use profiles of individuals provide a better understanding of the ecological and evolutionary implications of group locomotion.

. Fish schools in nature swim over a wide range of speeds ( Appendix 1—figure 1 ) but no study has directly characterized the total energy expenditure ( TEE ), and accounted for the potentially substantial anaerobic metabolic costs involved in higher speed locomotion. As a result, the swimming TEE performance curve of fish schools from the minimum swimming speed to the critical swimming speed ( Ucrit ) has not yet been measured. More broadly, despite the widespread notion that collective motion saves energy ( Weihs, 1973 ), very few studies have directly measured the energetic cost of collective movement compared to the cost of movement by solitary individuals. In the canonical case of V-formation flight in birds, energetic saving is exclusively inferred from indirect measurements, for example, heart rate ( Weimerskirch et al., 2001 ), and flapping frequency and phase ( Portugal et al., 2014; Table 1 ). There are no direct measurements of metabolic energy consumption of collective movement in birds, and indeed this would be extremely challenging to accomplish. Although some energetic aspects of schooling fishes have been studied ( Parker, 1973; Abrahams and Colgan, 1985; Burgerhout et al., 2013; Currier et al., 2021; Hvas and Oppedal, 2019 ), these studies have analyzed a limited range of speeds and focused on aerobic metabolism ( see Table 1 ). In fact, several field and laboratory kinematic studies suggest that both bird flocks and fish schools do not always conserve aerobic energy ( Hvas and Oppedal, 2019; Partridge and Pitcher, 1979; Usherwood et al., 2011 ) and indicate that moving in a group can actually involve increased costs. Without directly measuring the energetic cost of movement, inferences solely based on kinematics do not include complex group interactions, and the interaction between collective behavior and fluid dynamics

. We also demonstrated that the need for energy saving in fish schools at lower speeds ( <3 BL s–1 or 38% Ucrit Figures 2E, 3D, E ) is not as crucial as at higher speeds where we demonstrated substantial energy savings in the schools compared to solitary individuals. Fluid drag is exponentially less at lower speeds compared to higher speeds. Fish predominately use aerobic metabolism to support low-speed steady swimming for prolonged periods ( Brett, 1964 ) which does not require lengthy recovery as swimming at higher speeds, where glycolysis contributes to the energetic demands. The costs of low-speed swimming are often less than <20% of aerobic capacity ( Figure 2E ), which leaves the majority of aerobic capacity ( >50% ) for other activities. Therefore, the benefits of reducing the energetic cost of locomotion are likely not major factors underlying behaviors such as low-speed milling ( Costanzo and Hemelrijk, 2018 ) and aggregation ( Rountree, 1989 ) in fishes, where other ecological drivers such as feeding, predator avoidance, and reproduction likely dominate the fitness landscape. Our 3D kinematic analyses shed light on the complex interactions between schooling and hydrodynamics that enable energy saving by fish collective movement. One of the key possible mechanisms is local interactions among individuals, where the kinematics of individual fish respond to the wakes shed by neighbors ( Camazine et al., 2020 ). Kinematic and simulation studies indicate that two to three coordinated fish can save energy ( Verma et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020 ) through local interactions. We directly demonstrate here that eight coordinated fish can save energy, and recent simulations show that schooling benefits can extend to at least 23 fish ( Kelly and Menzer, 2023 )

. Consequently, we do not yet have a holistic and mechanistic view of where and how the collective movement by fish might conserve energy. For swimming fish, fluid dynamic experiments have shown how collective movement can improve swimming efficiency due to interactions among deforming bodies and through interactions between moving animals and the local fluid environment ( these energy-saving mechanisms are summarized in Figure 1 ). Our current understanding of energy saving mechanisms during collective locomotion in fishes is largely based on computational fluid dynamic models with a few analyses using robotic systems ( Weihs, 1973; Li et al., 2020; Kelly and Menzer, 2023; Fish et al., 2016; Kurt and Moored, 2018 ) at low speed, but the link between such models and fish metabolic energy saving over a wide speed range is not yet established. We expect that the need to conserve energy in animals moving against air or water resistance should be greater at higher speeds. We hypothesize that fish in schools can reduce the total cost of high-speed locomotion relative to solitary movement, leading to reduced non-aerobic energetic costs and time of recovery for schooling fish swimming at speeds occupying the majority ( >50% ) of their aerobic capacity. Our secondary objective is to determine the differences ( if any ) between the swimming performance curves ( metabolic rate versus speed ) of solitary fish and fish schools. To evaluate these hypotheses, we directly measured both the aerobic and non-aerobic energy used by schooling fishes over a wide range of water velocities ( 0. 3–8. 0 body lengths s–1; BL s–1 ), and then compared the swimming performance curve to that of solitary fish. We equipped a high-resolution ( see materials and methods for our approach to enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio in our respirometer ) swim-tunnel respirometer with two orthogonal high-speed cameras to quantify three-dimensional ( 3-D ) fish kinematics

We discovered that a significant amount of energy conservation for active directional swimming occurs at speeds above 3 BL s–1. In nature, fish schools routinely exhibit active directional collective locomotion above ~6 BL s–1 ( Appendix 1—figure 1; Supplementary file 1c; Misund and Aglen, 1992 ), a speed that engages anaerobic glycolysis. Yet, there are no previous measurements of the anaerobic cost of schooling in fish. Hence, important and previously unrecognized benefits of active directional collective locomotion are ( 1 ) increased aerobic performance, ( 2 ) a reduced use of aerobic capacity and anaerobic energy, and ( 3 ) a resultant faster recovery from the associated metabolic perturbations and costs of swimming at higher speeds. When animals are approaching their maximum metabolic rate, the highest attainable rate of O2 uptake limits aerobic performance during the unsteady state of high-speed locomotion and anaerobic glycolysis is engaged to support the maximum metabolic demand. Fish swimming at higher speeds ( >50% Ucrit ) routinely exhibit a burst-&-glide gait mode of locomotion ( Peake and Farrell, 2006; Peake and Farrell, 2007 ) where anaerobic glycol is the primary source of energy. Our results show that fish swimming in schools at high speeds have a 44% higher aerobic performance and 65% less anaerobic energy compared to solitary individuals, which lowers the total energy expenditure ( TEE ) and cost of transport by up to 53%, near the lowest recorded for any aquatic organism. We also found that fish in schools recover from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish. The non-aerobic savings when fish swim actively at high speeds can improve both peak and repeated performance which is likely beneficial for evading predators. These energetic savings may underlie the prevalence of coordinated locomotion in fishes.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Airway macrophages ( AM ) are the predominant immune cell in the lung and play a crucial role in preventing infection, making them a target for host directed therapy. Macrophage effector functions are associated with cellular metabolism. A knowledge gap remains in understanding metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of distinct human macrophage subpopulations, especially in lung resident AM. We examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM; as a model of blood derived macrophages ) in their resting state and after priming with IFN-γ or IL-4 to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung. Human macrophages, regardless of origin, had a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFN-γ or upon stimulation. IFN-γ significantly enhanced cellular energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Upon stimulation, AM do not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike MDM which shift to ‘Warburg’-like metabolism. IFN-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM. Blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose significantly reduced IFN-γ driven cytokine production in AM, indicating that IFN-γ induces functional plasticity in human AM, which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis. Directly comparing responses between macrophages, AM were more responsive to IFN-γ priming and dependent on glycolysis for cytokine secretion than MDM. Interestingly, TNF production was under the control of glycolysis in AM and not in MDM. MDM exhibited glycolysis-dependent upregulation of HLA-DR and CD40, whereas IFN-γ upregulated HLA-DR and CD40 on AM independently of glycolysis. These data indicate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ in a manner distinct from MDM. These data provide evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases.

    Airway macrophages ( AM ) are the sentinels of the lung and the first responders to respiratory insults such as infection. Despite a large body of evidence indicating that these tissue resident AM have a distinct phenotype and function to peripherally derived macrophages, there remains a significant lack of data regarding human AM function and plasticity in response to infection and their ability to change under the influence of Th1 or Th2 environments. Macrophage function exists on a spectrum of activation states based on tissue residency, ontogeny, cytokine milieu and the plasticity of the macrophage in response to environmental factors ( Huang et al., 2018; Ginhoux et al., 2010 ). Much of the research has focused on the contribution of metabolic pathways to polarising macrophages into distinct pro-inflammatory or regulatory phenotypes ( Wang et al., 2018 ). There is a paucity of data on the role of metabolism in response to Th1 or Th2 microenvironments induced by cytokines such as IFN-γ or IL-4 respectively, in human macrophages, especially in tissue resident macrophages, such as AM. A knowledge gap remains as to whether the tissue resident AM is metabolically and functionally plastic and therefore capable of mounting effective pro-inflammatory responses despite its homeostatic, regulatory tissue resident phenotype. Plasticity of macrophage function requires metabolic reprogramming ( Vijayan et al., 2019; Tannahill et al., 2013 ). Since AM play a key role in directing and propagating immune responses and inflammation in the lung, we sought to determine the plasticity of AM and monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM ). Using primary human AM and MDM, we modelled Th1 and Th2 microenvironments with the addition of IFN-γ or IL-4, respectively

. Another question raised is whether other tissue resident macrophages behave similarly to AM or whether they have unique responses. Human AM and infiltrating MDM both increase glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in response to IFN-γ, and stimulation results in a further increase in glycolysis. Cumulatively, the data presented herein suggests that the MDM maybe more phenotypically plastic than the AM, while the AM have enhanced functional plasticity in their ability to produce cytokine after exposure Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Our data supports the hypothesis that there may be distinct roles for AM and infiltrating MDM during infection since IFN-γ increased metabolic responses are mechanistically associated with different cellular functions. Our data demonstrates that cytokine production in human AM can be promoted by supporting cellular metabolism, thus providing evidence that human tissue resident AM are a tractable target for host-directed immuno-supportive adjunctive therapies.

We acknowledge that our in vitro model is simplified and may not fully reflect macrophages in vivo. Nevertheless, these data address knowledge gaps in human macrophage biology and are required to aid the translation of immunometabolism into clinical benefits in respiratory medicine. We used LPS and irradiated Mtb to model successful macrophage responses to infection. Future experiments should examine how virulent respiratory pathogens such as gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Mtb affect human AM in Th1 or Th2 environments, to determine infection-specific effects. The inhibition of glycolysis with 2DG cannot definitively link all observations solely to glycolysis, as limiting glycolysis will ultimately limit oxidative phosphorylation. Blocking oxidative phosphorylation with oligomycin reduced LPS induced cytokine secretion in the human AM and not MDM ( Pereverzeva et al., 2022 ), both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation may therefore be needed for optimal AM function. The concentration of 2DG used only partially inhibited glycolysis; however, ablation of glycolysis induces significant cytotoxicity and confounds assay outcomes. Therefore, where 2DG had no effect, a role for glycolysis cannot be definitively excluded. Furthermore, only one dose of IFN-γ was utilised due to limitations in AM yield; however, recently both low and high doses of IFN-γ have been shown to have similar effects on AM in vitro ( Thiel et al., 2024 ). Establishing the immunometabolic and functional outputs of human macrophages will aid in future work examining the plasticity of the human AM. While we have established herein that the human AM is plastic in response to IFN-γ, since the AM is yolk-sac derived and long-lived, this raises the question of whether the plasticity of the AM can allow multiple sequential changes to respond and adapt to changing microenvironments in the lung

. IL-4 primed MDM had significantly reduced ability to process DQ-Ovalbumin compared with control or IFN-γ primed MDM ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ). Treatment of MDM with 2DG significantly reduced antigen processing in all groups, however IFN-γ primed MDM retained enhanced abilities to process antigen ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ). The reduced capacity of MDM to process antigen was not due to a deficiency in phagocytosis, as measured by both bead or bacterial uptake or due to increased cell death ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–E ). Overall, these data suggest that IFN-γ promotes expression of activation markers via increased glycolysis in human MDM, whereas AM are not as phenotypically plastic in response to cytokine priming and subsequent stimulation. Moreover, AM upregulation of cell surface markers ( with the exception of CD40 ) in response to priming or stimulation is not associated with glycolysis, in contrast to the MDM. Changes in macrophage metabolism have been previously associated with altered cytokine production ( Tannahill et al., 2013; Gleeson et al., 2016; Gleeson et al., 2018 ). Having established that both IFN-γ and IL-4 can significantly alter metabolism in human macrophages we next sought to examine the ability of AM and MDM to secrete cytokines when primed with IFN-γ or IL-4. Human AM ( Figure 4A, C and E ) and MDM ( Figure 4B, D and F ) were left unprimed or primed with IFN-γ or IL-4 for 24 hr. Macrophages were then stimulated with iH37Rv or LPS. Supernatants were harvested 24 hr post stimulation and concentrations of IL-1β ( Figure 4A and B ), TNF ( Figure 4C and D ), and IL-10 ( Figure 4E and F ) were quantified by ELISA. While iH37Rv stimulation resulted in IL-1β production in unprimed AM and MDM, IFN-γ only significantly enhanced the production of IL-1β by AM ( Figure 4A and B ). IL-4 priming attenuated iH37Rv induced IL-1β in both AM and MDM ( Figure 4A and B )

. Since IFN-γ drove glycolysis in both AM and MDM, we next sought to examine if cytokine production was associated with enhanced glycolysis. Human AM ( Figure 5A, C and E ) and MDM ( Figure 5B, D and F ) were primed with IF-γ or IL-4 for 24 hr and then treated with 2DG to inhibit glycol. Supernants were harvested 24 hr post stimulation and concentrations of IL-1 ( Figure 5A and B ) TN ( 5C and D ) and IL-10 ( 5 E and F ) were quantified by ELISA. Inhibition of glycol with 2DG significantly reduced IF-γ driven IL-β production in AM ( Figure 5A ) but not MDM ( Figure 5B ) indicating that glycol is mechanistically involved in IF- driven cytokine production in human AM.

    Title: 
    Abstract: For the first time in any animal, we show that nocturnal bull ants use the exceedingly dim polarisation pattern produced by the moon for overnight navigation. The sun or moon can provide directional information via their position; however, they can often be obstructed by clouds, canopy, or the horizon. Despite being hidden, these bodies can still provide compass information through the polarised light pattern they produce/reflect. Sunlight produces polarised light patterns across the overhead sky as it enters the atmosphere, and solar polarised light is a well-known compass cue for navigating animals. Moonlight produces an analogous pattern, albeit a million times dimmer than sunlight. Here, we show evidence that polarised moonlight forms part of the celestial compass of navigating nocturnal ants. Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely heavily on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate. Yet many foragers return home overnight when the sun cannot guide them. We demonstrate that these bull ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night, by rotating the overhead polarisation pattern above homing ants, who alter their headings in response. Furthermore, these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons, when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Finally, we show the long-term incorporation of this moonlight pattern into the ants’ path integration system throughout the night for homing, as polarised sunlight is incorporated throughout the day.

   . Several arthropods, including ants and bees, directly track the moon’s position to obtain compass information ( Jander, 1957; Klotz and Reid, 1993; Dacke et al., 2004; Ugolini et al., 2013 ). But given the moon may be occluded by clouds or overhanging canopy we aim to identify here whether the lunar polarised skylight can also be used by ants for homing. In the current study, we studied foraging ants’ ability to orient during lunar twilight, by placing and rotating a linear polarising filter over them as they returned to the nest ( Figure 1A ). This rotation blocks the ambient e-vector direction of the sky above the navigator, replacing it with an artificial e-vector of polarisation that is rotated ±45° off the ambient pattern. We also explored whether these navigators weigh their attendance to polarised moonlight across the lunar cycle, since during quarter-moon and crescent-moon nights, smaller portions of the moon’s surface reflect sunlight ( as well as moonless nights when no ambient e-vector is present ). Finally, we characterised changes in weighting that these ant navigators give polarised moonlight, as a function of the moon’s overnight consistency in the sky ( waxing vs. waning ) and the length of their accumulated path integrator, which should increase the weight given to celestial compass portion of the path integrator when in conflict with terrestrial visual cues ( Burkhalter, 1972; Narendra, 2007; Wystrach et al., 2015; Freas and Cheng, 2019a ).

. In this vein, it remains unknown if these ants are tracking their lunar polarisation compass by using a time-compensated lunar compass, or if the compass is updated with reference to other cues, such as the panorama, throughout the night. It is possible that these ants form a lunar ephemeris function or time compensator for the moon’s position. Solar ephemeris functions are well demonstrated in insect navigators ( Mouritsen and Frost, 2002; Massy and Wotton, 2023 ), including honeybees ( Dyer and Dickinson, 1994 ) as well as desert ants ( Wehner and Lanfranconi, 1981 ). This study cannot untangle these possibilities as ants had a continuous view of both the sky and surrounding terrestrial cues throughout the night before testing. However, the shift reductions on nights where there was no access to the lunar polarisation cue until just prior to tests ( lunar twilight before moonrise ), suggests these foragers may need some set period of exposure to the moon’s polarisation pattern to employ it fully during inbound homing. Future work could tackle if a lunar ephemeris function is employed by these ants through exposing or blocking access to the sky and familiar panorama for set time periods when the moon is naturally visible overnight, during waxing gibbous phases. Inbound M. midas foragers detect and respond predictably to rotations of the moonlight e-vector orientation under a filter and reorient back to the ambient e-vector after filter exit. This ability occurs across the lunar phase, suggesting that polarised moonlight is a detectable cue throughout the lunar month. Heading changes due to polarised moonlight align with responses to polarised sunlight as part of the path integrator during solar twilight. This indicates that polarised moonlight is likely detected and integrated into the ant’s path integrator for inbound homing along the same visual pathways as polarised sunlight

. These increased shift magnitudes align with the hypothesis that with longer accumulated vectors, ants increase the weighting given this cue ( Burkhalter, 1972; Narendra, 2007; Wystrach et al., 2015; Freas et al., 2017c ). Second, these ants are using polarised moonlight precisely the same way they use solar polarisation, meaning polarised moonlight is likely integrated into the forager’s path integrator throughout the night. Polarised moonlight is likely processed through the same visual pathways as polarised sunlight, meaning that these ants can use the same underlying neural architecture for polarised solar light and polarised moonlight cues. The limiting factors to lunar cue use for navigation would instead be the ant’s detection threshold for either absolute light intensity, polarization sensitivity, or spectral sensitivity. In addition to being dimmer, moonlight is less UV-rich compared to direct sunlight, and its spectrum changes across the lunar cycle ( Palmer and Johnsen, 2015 ), with sensitivity to green spectrum within polarised moonlight of potential importance for orientation ( Yilmaz et al., 2024 ). Foragers showed clear evidence of detecting and employing polarised moonlight when homing to the nest across the lunar cycle, even on waxing crescent moon nights. This aligns with polarised moonlight’s use in dung beetles, with individuals able to maintain their straight-line paths under quarter and crescent moon e-vectors ( Dacke et al., 2004 ). Furthermore, the lack of a shift-magnitude reduction between full and crescent nights suggests no reduction in detection. While we could have continued to test with smaller portions of the moon’s surface illuminated, a reduction in shift magnitude could result from either physiological limits in detection or ‘decisional’ processes in how much weight to accord the cue

The nocturnal bull ants Myrmecia pyriformis and Myrmecia midas are known to use the solar-polarised light pattern during the twilight periods ( Reid et al., 2011; Freas and Cheng, 2017a; Freas et al., 2017b ), yet both species are active after twilight, when solar polarisation cues are absent ( Reid et al., 2011; Reid et al., 2013; Freas et al., 2017b; Freas et al., 2017c ). The observed true nocturnal navigation in these animals could be driven by the moon’s presence with M. pyriformis, which shows more foraging activity on full moon nights ( Reid et al., 2013 ). M. midas exhibits a high level of overnight activity, with almost half of the foragers returning before the morning solar twilight. M. midas also navigates through heavily canopied forest habitat where the moon may be occluded but its polarisation pattern across the sky remains unobstructed. Thus, M. midas makes for an interesting species to characterise lunar and solar polarised light detection. While we cannot compare solar and moonlight polarisation navigation in outbound ants ( outbound foraging is highly correlated with evening twilight when the solar light would overpower any moonlight polarisation pattern ), striking similarities occur when comparing solar and moonlight polarisation navigation in ants homing to the nest ( Figure 7 ). In the solar polarisation study ( Freas et al., 2017c ), inbound foragers tested during morning twilight at 4–6 m from their nest altered their paths under the filter for almost the full 45° solar e-vector manipulation ( –45° rotation: –41. 16°/+45° rotation: 34. 13°; Figure 7 ) but only compensated for around half of the rotation when tested 1–2 m from the nest ( –45° rotation: –24. 86°/+45° rotation: 19. 73° ). We see the same pattern with polarised moonlight with foragers exhibiting near full shifts 5 m from Nest 1 ( –45° rotation: –41. 4°/+45° rotation: 38. 4° ) and half shifts 2 m from Nest 2 ( –45° rotation: –27

., 2017 ). We know that two well-studied nocturnal ant species, Myrmecia pyriformis, and Myrmecia midas, use the overhead solar polarised light pattern, which is still visible during the twilight period to derive compass information ( Reid et al, 2011; Fre and Cheng,2017; Fre et al 2017b; Fre et al 2017c ). Both of these species are active after the twilight when the solar polarisation is absent. The nocturnal navigation in these species could be driven by the moon’s presence. M pyriform shows foraging on full moon nights ( et al 2013 ). mid exhibits high overnight activity with half of foragers returning before morning twilight. mid also navigates heavily canopied forest where the moon is occluded but polarisation across the sky remains unobstruct. Thus, mid makes an interesting species to character lunar and polarised light. We cannot compare solar and moon polarisation in ants outbound ( outbound is highly correlated with evening when solar would overpower moonlight pattern ) but similarities occur when comparing solar and moon polar in homing ants to nest ( Figure 7 ) in polar study ( Fre et 201c ) inbounders during morning 4–6 from nest altered paths under filter almost full 45 solar-vector ( –45 rotation –41.16/45 rotation 34.13 ) but compensated around half rotation tested 1–2 from (45 rotation –24.86/45 19.73 ) see same with polar moonlight foragers near shifts 5 Nest 1 (45 rotation –41.4/45 38.4 ) half 2 Nest (45 –27.7 ).

**Title:** Nocturnal ants use polarized light from the moon for navigation

**Background:** Nocturnal ants, such as Myrmia pyiform and Myrmia mid, use polarized light from the sun for navigation during twilight, but it is unclear if they can use polarized light from the moon for navigation. Polarized light from the sun is a well-known cue for navigation, but it can be obstructed by clouds, canopy, or horizon.

**Method:** Researchers studied the ability of nocturnal ants to orient using polarized light from the moon by rotating a polarizing filter over them as they returned to the nest, blocking the ambient vector of the sky and replacing it with an artificial polarized vector rotated 45° off the ambient. They also explored if ants weigh polarized moonlight across the lunar cycle, during quarter-moon and crescent nights, and moonless nights.

**Findings:** Nocturnal ants can use polarized light from the moon for navigation during the night, rotating the polar pattern above them and altering their headings. They can detect this cue throughout the lunar cycle, even under crescent moons when polarized levels are lowest. Polarized moonlight is integrated into the ant's path system for homing as polar sunlight is during the day.

**Conclusion:** Nocturnal ants use polarized light from the moon in the same way they use polarized light from the

    Title: 
    Abstract: Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight. Early pterosaurs had long stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. These tails ended in a tall, thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. Maintaining stiffness in the vane would have been crucial in early pterosaur flight, but how this was achieved has been unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats. Here, we use Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs. The lattice supported a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system used to maintain vane stiffness, allowing the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure.

    Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight ( Palmer, 2017 ). The first pterosaurs, the non-pterodactyloids, had long, stiff tails with a mobile base ( Frey et al., 2003 ), similar to some dinosaurs like Velociraptor ( Persons and Currie, 2012 ). Many of these tails end in a soft tissue 'vane' ( Marsh, 1882; Döderlein, 1929; Frey et al., 2003; Figure 1 ), which may have contributed to passive stability in flight. A primary role in display has also been suggested ( O’Brien et al., 2018 ), given ontogenetic shape changes in the vane and the fact that, unlike most aircraft, flying animals do not need vertical control surfaces to be yaw-stable during turns ( Bowers, 2016 ). The vanes have been interpreted as steering aids ( Frey et al., 2003 ). The length and stiffening of the tails suggest that they might have been important in early pterosaurs for control based on mass shifting or inertial control, as purported for terrestrial theropods with convergent tails ( Persons and Currie, 2012 ). Such dynamic control could greatly improve maneuverability and/or stability. However, vane fluttering would be extremely costly and destabilising unless the vane was tensioned while under aerodynamic load. Tail vanes feature thick, evenly spaced, internal structures roughly perpendicular to the caudal series ( Döderlein, 1929 ), that are said to resemble neural spines and haemal arches ( Marsh, 1882 ). These structures are presumed to have minimised fluttering and prevented buckling in the same way that spars, ribs, stringers, and longerons do in airplane wings and tail-fins, but others have proposed that they were flexible and cartilaginous ( Marsh, 1882 ), especially since their preserved appearance varies. Here, we use laser-simulated fluorescence ( LSF ) imaging of Rhamphorhynchus specimens from the Upper Jurassic Solnhofen Limestones ( Kaye et al., 2015; Pittman et al

Over 100 Solnhofen pterosaur fossils were examined for well-preserved tail vanes using an ultraviolet torch. Four exceptional specimens were then imaged under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence ( LSF ). Three specimens - NHMUK PV OR 37787, NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 and ROM VP 55352 - exhibited tail vanes under white light, but the vane of NHMUK PV OR 37003 was only visible under LSF. LSF confirmed the soft tissue extent of the vanes and revealed hidden anatomical details, especially in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 and NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 ( Figure 2A–C ), where vane areas fluoresced pink and white, indicating soft tissue preservation ( Pittman et al., 2021 ). Tail vanes are sub-symmetrical and diamond-shaped in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 and NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 with a length of 700 mm, 750 mm, and 720 mm making up 21%, 22% and 21% of the total tail length of 320 mm, 362 mm, and 348 mm, respectively ( Figure 2 ). NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 and NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 have tail vanes occupying a similar proportion of the tail ( 23% and 22% ) as BSP 1907 I 37 ( 74 mm ) and YPM VP 1778 ( 50 mm ). At its widest point, about two-thirds along its length, the vane is 41 mm across in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787 but the widest in NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 ( 55 mm ), even wider than in BSP 1907 I 37 ( 46 mm ) and almost twice as wide as YPM VP 1778 ( 30 mm ). The vanes of NHMUK PV OR 37003 and 37787, NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 and YPM VP 1778 form anterior, lateral and posterior angles of 40°, 45° and 90°; 107°, 113° and 105°; 104°, 100° and 90°; 44°, 107° and 80°, respectively. There is no marked change in caudal morphology within and outside the periphery of the tail vane. The vane encompasses at least 15 caudals in NHMUK PV OR 37003 and NMS G. 1994. 13. 1 and at least 17 in NHMUKPOV OR 37787, out of which, 13 appear to bear elongated zygapophyses in 37703 and at least 14 in 37787 ( 16 caudals within YPM VP 1778 and BSP 1907 I 37 )

Over 100 Solnhofen pterosaur fossils were examined for well-preserved tail vanes using an ultraviolet torch at the Bayerische Staatssamlung für Paläontologie ( Munich ), Museum für Naturkunde ( Berlin ), Jura Museum ( Eichstätt ), Natural History Museum ( London ), National Museum of Scotland ( Edinburgh ), and Royal Ontario Museum ( Toronto ) representing the pterosaur inventories in their care. These specimens were screened without bias regardless of their ontogenetic stage and preservation ( i. e. completeness, degree of articulation and the presence or absence of soft tissues under white light ). Out of this significant sample, only four specimens were found to preserve tail vane soft tissues, which were then imaged under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence ( LSF; Kaye et al., 2015 ) at the Natural History Museum, National Museum of Scotland, and the Royal Ontario Museum. LSF involved projecting a 405 nm violet laser diode from a line lens and scanning it over the specimens in a dark room following standard laser safety protocol. Long exposure photographs over 30 s were taken with a Nikon digital single-lens reflex camera fitted with a 425 nm laser blocking filter. LSF images were then postprocessed for equalisation, saturation, and colour balance across the entire images in Adobe Photoshop CS6. Initially described by von Meyer, 1846 as R. gemmingi; followed by R. meyeri ( Owen, 1870 ), described under Nr. 39 in Wellnhofer, 1975; synonymised under the same species by Bennett, 1995. No keratin appears conserved on pedal digits or rhamphotheca, despite good preservation. Wellnhofer in his assessment does not mention the presence of a tail vane and the feature is not discernible in visible light. Detected with UV and then imaged more vividly under LSF. The specimen is better articulated than NHMUK PV OR 37787

. Ontogenetically, on basis of the size of preserved elements and tail vane morphology, it likely belongs to a similar growth stage to NHMUK PV OR 37787. The distal end of tibia is unfused, pointing at immaturity of the animal. The slab contains a ventrally exposed lower jaw and heavily disarticulated postcranial material. It preserves fragments consisting of disarticulated flight apparatus and partially preserved scapula-coracoid. 11 rib-bearing dorsal vertebrae in articulation; disarticulated unfused pubic elements, both hindlimb elements with paired well-preserved tarsals in articulation. Metacarpal IV is 23 mm long. The wing phalanges make up an incomplete ~380 mm long wing ( WP1 = ~113 mm but incomplete, WP2 = ~112 mm but incomplete, WP3 = ~101 mm, and WP4 ~ mm ). The vane of NHUK OR 03 370 and 87 N G.199.13 1 are subymmetrical and diamond-shaped with a length of 700, 750, and 720 making 21%, 22 and 21 of the total length of 320, 362, and 348 respectively ( Figure 2 ). NHUK OR 03 370 and 87 G.199.13 1 have vanes occupying similar proportion of tail 23 and 22 as BSP 190 I37 74 and YPM 177 50.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Adolescence is characterized by changes in reward-related behaviors, social behaviors, and decision-making. These behavioral changes are necessary for the transition into adulthood, but they also increase vulnerability to the development of a range of psychiatric disorders. Major reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence is thought to underlie, in part, the associated behavioral changes and increased vulnerability. Here, we utilized fast scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine differences in dopamine release as well as mechanisms that underlie differential dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) core of adolescent ( P28-35 ) and adult ( P70-90 ) male rats. We show baseline differences between adult and adolescent-stimulated dopamine release in male rats, as well as opposite effects of the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) on modulating dopamine release. The α6-selective blocker, α-conotoxin, increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats, but decreased dopamine release in rats beginning in middle adolescence and extending through adulthood. Strikingly, blockade of GABAA and GABAB receptors revealed that this α6-mediated increase in adolescent dopamine release requires NAc GABA signaling to occur. We confirm the role of α6 nAChRs and GABA in mediating this effect in vivo using microdialysis. Results herein suggest a multisynaptic mechanism potentially unique to the period of development that includes early adolescence, involving acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs to drive inhibitory GABA tone on dopamine release.

   . Further studies are needed to understand the microcircuitry mediating the α6-containing nAChR regulation of dopamine release in adolescent rats. Interestingly, one report using adult mice found that antagonizing GABAB receptors increased dopamine release when β2-containing nAChRs were antagonized ( Lopes et al., 2019 ), indicating that GABA and nAChRs have a potentially complex and reciprocal regulation of dopamine release that we suggest here may be age/developmental stage dependent. In conclusion, we found that stimulated dopamine release is decreased in the NAc core of early adolescent male rats. This effect is driven, in part, by multisynaptic regulation of dopamine release only in adolescent male rats, through both acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs and GABA tone. The dopamine system undergoes reorganization during adolescence ( see Wahlstrom et al., 2010a; Wahlstrom et al., 2010b; Padmanabhan and Luna, 2014 ) and these changes are implicated in behavior as well as increased vulnerability to the development of various psychiatric disorders ( Spear, 2000; Spear, 2013; Nelson et al., 2005; Wahlstrom et al., 2010a; Wahlstrom et al., 2010b ). The present study gives us novel insight into age-related differences in dopamine release and its regulation, thus highlighting critical neurochemical targets that may partially underlie these behavioral changes. Examining how these systems develop in healthy individuals is imperative to our understanding of how perturbations may disrupt development and lead to certain disease states.

. Given the role of local modulators in the dopamine system, variations in heterosynaptic regulation of striatal dopamine release may be responsible for the neurobiological changes seen between adolescence and adulthood. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the role of local modulators on presynaptic NAc dopamine release of adult and adolescent male rats is the mechanism responsible for driving such developmental changes. Here, we use ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry ( FSCV ) to compare stimulated dopamine release and local circuitry regulation in the NAc core of adult and adolescent male rats. We then use microdialysis to determine the influence of other extrinsic factors in vivo in mediating developmental changes in the dopaminergic system. Enhancing our understanding of the transitional changes in dopamine regulation may shed light on the mechanisms driving changes in reward-related behaviors, and related increase in vulnerability, that are characteristic of adolescence.

., 2009; McCutcheon et al., 2012 ). While reports examining extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum show both lower and higher levels of dopamine during adolescence ( Badanich et al., 2006; Cao et al., 2007; Philpot et al., 2009 ), sub-second stimulated dopamine release is consistently found to be decreased in the striatum of adolescent rats ( Stamford, 1989; Palm and Nylander, 2014; Pitts et al., 2020 ). Our lab has previously shown that the maximum concentration of evoked dopamine release is decreased in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) core of early adolescent male rats ( Pitts et al., 2020 ), though the mechanism responsible for differentially regulating dopamine release in adolescent and adult rats remains unclear. Since previous research from our lab revealed that the NAc core has the largest difference in stimulated dopamine release between adult and adolescent male rats ( Pitts et al., 2020 ), we focused this report on understanding the mechanisms mediating dopamine release in that region. This is of particular interest because the NAc core is essential for regulating reward-related learning and goal-directed decision- making ( Di Chiara, 2002; Saddoris et al., 2013 ), which are altered during adolescence. Moreover, terminal dopamine release in the striatum does not always correspond with action potentials from ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra projection neurons ( Trulson, 1985; Mohebi et al., 2019 ). Release is also regulated by local circuitry via both homosynaptic and heterosynaptic mechanisms ( see Nolan et al., 2020 ). Functionality of dopamine transporters and release probability ( homosynaptic regulation ) can both mediate stimulated dopamine release ( see Ferris et al., 2013 )

Significant reorganization of the dopamine system occurs during the transitional period between adolescence and adulthood. Adolescents exhibit greater dopamine receptor levels, increased neuronal sensitivity, and altered dopamine dynamics when compared to adults ( Teicher et al., 1995; Bolanos et al., 1998; Galvan, 2010 ). Restructuring of the dopamine system occurs in protein expression and activity that affects dopamine release or uptake. Although these transitional changes in dopamine release are implicated in a wide range of psychiatric disorders, much is unknown about the mechanisms driving these age-related differences. Thus, the goal of this study was to identify variations in NAc core stimulated dopamine release and pinpoint the mechanism for which these changes may occur in adolescent and adult male rats. Consistent with our previous findings ( Pitts et al., 2020 ), we showed no difference in our measure of dopamine uptake ( Vmax ) between adult and adolescent male rats in the NAc, suggesting the rate of dopamine uptake does not drive differences in stimulated dopamine release shown here. While the affinity of dopamine for the DAT ( i. e. Km ) has been shown to be different in prior publications by other groups ( Walker and Kuhn, 2008 ), the dopamine curves we generated were optimized for measures of release and Vmax, not baseline affinity measurements ( i. e. Km ). Km is traditionally derived from the bottom third of the descending portion of the dopamine curve in FSCV, and electrode adsorption and other artifacts are known to occlude this outcome measure without affecting our other measures ( Ferris et al., 2013 ). Thus, we did not quantify this measure and it remains possible that the affinity of dopamine for the DAT could be different between these groups

. Stimulation parameters were adjusted to model both tonic- and phasic-like neuronal firing across a wide range of frequencies in order to mimic physiologically relevant firing patterns. Replicating our previous findings ( Pitts et al., 2020 ), the present study found decreased dopamine release in the NAc core of adolescent male rats. This is consistent with in vivo evidence of male adolescent rats demonstrating lower NAc dopamine release than adults. For example, high-frequency stimulations of the VTA in anesthetized rats reveal significantly greater stimulated NAc dopamine release in adult males compared to adolescent males ( Walker and Kuhn, 2008 ). In freely moving rats, differences in dopamine release between early adolescence and adulthood appear stimuli-specific and differ in habituation over repeated exposures ( Robinson et al., 2011 ). For example, the frequency of dopamine transients was no different between early adolescent and adult rats both at baseline and in the initial response to social interactions with other rats ( Robinson et al., 2011 ). However, the unexpected presentation of additional stimuli across many modalities showed less frequent dopamine responses in early adolescent rats compared to the classic dopamine response of adult rats ( Robinson et al., 2011 ). We found that decreases in stimulated dopamine release are not driven by differences in release probability within a burst. For example, the paired-pulse ratio ( PPR ) shows the relative magnitude of release attributed to each pulse in a single burst. This differs from electrophysiological PPR in that we are directly observing the relative release magnitude from a population of neurons ( as opposed to a single cell ) between pulse 1 and pulse 2. PPRs are known to be frequency dependent as we show here, but we find there are no age-related differences in the distribution of release magnitude across pulses in a single burst

The study investigated the changes in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (Nac) of adolescent and adult male rats using fast cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis. The results show that dopamine release is decreased in adolescent rats compared to adults, and that the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACh) modulates this release. The α-selective blocker, α-conotoxin, increased dopamine release in adolescent rats but decreased it in adults. Blockade of GABA and GAB receptors revealed that α-mediated increase in adolescent release requires N GABA signaling. The study suggests a multisynaptic mechanism unique to the period of development involving acetylcholine at α-containing AChRs driving inhibitory GABA on dopamine release.

The study aimed to understand the microcircuit mediating α-containing ACh regulation of release in adolescent rats and found that GABA and A receptors have a complex reciprocal regulation of dopamine release that may be age/development dependent. The results highlight the role of α ACh and G in mediating this effect in vivo microdial. The dopamine system undergoes reorganization during adolescence and changes are implicated in behavior and vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. The study gives insight into age-related differences in release and regulation, highlighting neurochemical targets that may underlie behavioral changes.

The study used fast cyclicammetry to compare dopamine and circuit regulation in the N core of adult and adolescent rats, and microdial to determine extrinsic factors mediating developmental changes in the dopaminergic system. Enhancing understanding the changes in regulation may shed light on mechanisms driving changes in reward behaviors and increase vulnerability characteristic of adolescence.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) is defined by common behavioral characteristics, raising the possibility of shared pathogenic mechanisms. Yet, vast clinical and etiological heterogeneity suggests personalized phenotypes. Surprisingly, our iPSC studies find that six individuals from two distinct ASD subtypes, idiopathic and 16p11. 2 deletion, have common reductions in neural precursor cell ( NPC ) neurite outgrowth and migration even though whole genome sequencing demonstrates no genetic overlap between the datasets. To identify signaling differences that may contribute to these developmental defects, an unbiased phospho- ( p ) -proteome screen was performed. Surprisingly despite the genetic heterogeneity, hundreds of shared p-peptides were identified between autism subtypes including the mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling alterations were confirmed in all NPCs across both ASD subtypes, and mTOR modulation rescued ASD phenotypes and reproduced autism NPC-associated phenotypes in control NPCs. Thus, our studies demonstrate that genetically distinct ASD subtypes have common defects in neurite outgrowth and migration which are driven by the shared pathogenic mechanism of mTOR signaling dysregulation.

   . 2 deletion, ERK/MAPK3 is part of the 11. 2 segment and implicated in driving some of the neurodevelopmental phenotypes associated with the deletion and duplication syndromes. The WNT pathway, which includes CHD8 ( an autism-related chromatin modifier ) and beta-catenin, has long been implicated in ASD pathogenesis. The WNT pathway, much like mTOR, is thought to regulate neuronal proliferation and has been associated with macrocephalic phenotypes seen in ASD. For example, a study by Marchetto et al. found that NPCs derived from individuals with macrocephaly and I-ASD displayed excessive proliferation as well as altered WNT signaling. In our p-proteome analyses, the ERK/MAPK and PKA pathway have also been shown to be enriched. Ultimately, altered cellular signaling seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of ASD and other NDDs. Importantly, our study indicates that ASD NPCs not only have enrichment of dysregulated mTOR but that mTOR dysregulation is driving autism-associated phenotypes. The importance of mTOR signaling was further highlighted by our small molecule gain and loss of function analyses and EF studies. By correcting the p-S6 levels with mTOR agonists and antagonists, we were able to rescue the developmental defects in both I-ASD and 16pDel NPCs. Furthermore, by changing Sib control p-S6 to ASD levels, the neurodevelopmental defects could be reproduced demonstrating that the mTOR signaling differences are mechanistically linked to the shared neurodevelopmental defects for both I-ASD and 16pDel NPCs. In addition, as one of the first studies to challenge ASD NPCs with EFs, we were able to uncover the importance of mTOR in the regulation of the signaling milieu and uncover differences between I-ASD and 16pDel in their ability to respond to EFs. Specifically, by utilizing subthreshold doses of SC-79 and MK-2206, we were able to facilitate responses to EFs in all I-ASD NPCs

. Our study is one of the first to show the remarkable convergence of neurodevelopmental and molecular phenotypes in two distinct autism subtypes using rigorous methods such as utilization of multiple iPSC clones and neural inductions. The extensive rigor of our analyses that included a total of 29 distinct iPSC clones and 61 distinct neural inductions lends to relatively small sample sizes ( though similar to other iPSC studies ) with only six autism probands, three of each subtype. Thus, it is difficult to know whether our observed phenotypes are generalizable to all individuals with 16pDel, I-ASD, or other ASDs. However, it is important to note that our sample had significant clinical and genotypic heterogeneity yet, we could still uncover common phenotypes. Expanding our study design to other subtypes of ASD or other NDDs would help establish if common underlying mechanisms could be identified ( Gandal et al., 2018 ). While our studies reveal important alterations in early neurodevelopment in ASD, our monolayer NPC studies do not recapitulate the 3D nature or complex interactions occurring in the developing brain. Moreover, as hiPSC-derived NPCS are most similar to fetal cortical radial glial cells, the phenotypes observed in our dishes may not directly parallel the structural or functional defects in the ASD brain. Neuropathological studies of ASD have indicated brain defects suggestive of dysregulated development. However, studies have not been conducted to determine whether, for example, a defect in migration in ASD iPSC-derived NPCs is correlated with altered cortical lamination in the patient from whom the cells were derived. To understand this, MRI and postmortem analyses need to be conducted to correlate iPSC results with neuropathological alterations. Interestingly, an iPSC study of ASD patients with MRI-defined macrocephaly found that affected NPCs proliferated faster than control NPCs ( Marchetto et al

. Surprisingly, our EF studies revealed that all unaffected NPCs responded to selected EFs with increases in neurite outgrowth and migration while I-ASD NPCs failed to respond to any of the tested EFs, suggesting the possibility of impaired signaling pathways. Thus, to identify mediating signaling pathways, an unbiased p-proteome analysis was conducted, which showed significant overlap in p-peptides between I-ASD and 16pDel datasets with less overlap in the total proteome. Bioinformatics revealed the mTOR pathway as one of the strongest points of convergence between the two ASD subtypes, which was supported by western analyses. Moreover, modulation of the mTOR pathway with small molecules rescued and reproduced ASD NPC phenotypes indicating that mTOR signaling defects are mechanistically linked to the neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Nonetheless, there were also ASD subtypes as evidenced by differential responses to EFs between I-ASD and 16pDel NPCs as well as distinct mTOR alterations including elevations and reductions. Overall, our studies indicate that despite the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, two distinct ASD subtypes have dysregulation of mTOR signaling which mediates the surprisingly uniform neurodevelopmental phenotypes.

. In the 16pDel group, all three 16pDel patient NPCs had higher p-S6 levels compared to both Sib and NIH NPCs ( M1: ~170%, p < 0. 0001, M2: ~130%, p < 0. 001, F: ~80%, p < 0. 01 increase, Figure 4G and H ). There were no statistical differences in p-S6 levels between Sib and NIH NPCs ( p = 0. 99 ). All 16pDel NPCs also displayed higher p-AKT levels compared to NIH but not Sib NPCs ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1G and H ). Thus, western studies validate the p-proteome results in our six ASD patients and confirm changes in both p-S6 and to some extent p-AKT, which can be divided into low mTOR and high mTOR groups. Ultimately, the most striking finding is the consistent mTOR signaling differences across two genetically distinct groups of autism, a finding not previously described. To determine whether the mTOR differences described above drive the developmental abnormalities in our cohorts, we conducted gain and loss of function studies on all I-ASD and both male 16pDel NPCs. As there were no small molecule activator and inhibitor pairs for p-S6 when experiments were being conducted, we instead employed an AKT activator ( SC-79 ) and AKT inhibitor ( MK-2206 ), which have been used extensively in other systems to modulate mTOR pathway ( Jo et al., 2012; Takizawa et al., 2012; Hirai et al., 2010 ). Notably, in the mTOR pathway AKT phosphorylation leads to mTOR pathway activation and ultimately S6 phosphorylation. Given p-AKT was not a central node in our p-proteome analyses and the p-AKT western data readout was less robust, our experiments largely focused on effects of small molecule activator and inhibitor on p-S6. However, we did conduct a brief proof of principle experiment which found that Sc-79 and MK-2206 did increase and decrease ( respectively ) AKT levels in human NPCS ( data not shown ). We first examined our low mTOR cohort comprised of I-ASD-1 and I-ASD-3

. Now, with the advent of induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) technology, we can study human neural development in cells derived from individuals with both genetic and idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders. iPSC studies of monogenic, CNV, and idiopathic ASD have observed alterations in basic developmental processes, such as synapse formation ( Acab and Muotri, 2015; Yang and Shcheglovitov, 2020 ). However, many of these studies focused on terminally differentiated neurons, with very few examining developmental events that correspond to mid-fetal cortical development that precede synapse formation, such as neurite outgrowth and cell migration ( Packer, 2016, Prem et al., 2020 ). Moreover, there is little insight into whether and how extracellular factors ( EFs ), which coordinate neurodevelopment by regulating signaling, contribute to ASD pathogenesis in human NPCs. To begin addressing these questions, we studied early neurite development and cell migration using human iPSC-derived NPCs from two ASD subtypes, idiopathic and 16.2 deletion (16Del). Our results show that both subtypes have defects in neurite outgrowth and migration which are driven by the shared pathogenic mechanism of mTOR signaling dysregulation. Our study is one of the first to demonstrate the convergence of neurodevelopmental and molecular phenotypes in two autism subtypes using rigorous methods such as utilization of multiple iP clones and inductions. The extensive of our analyses included a total of 29 iP clones and 61 inductions to relatively small sizes though to other iP studies with only six probands, three each. It is difficult to know whether observed phenotypes are generalizable all 16Del, IAS, or ASD. However, our sample had significant and genotypic heterogeneity yet could uncover common phen. Expanding study to other subtypes or NDD would establish if underlying could be identified ( Gandal et al, 2018 ) While our reveal alterations earlydevelopment in ASD our monolayer do not recapitulate 3D or complex occurring brain. Moreover, hiSC-derivedS most to fetal radial glial phenotypes observed may not parallel structural or functional in ASD brain. Neuropath studies have indicated defects of dysregulated development However, not conducted whether defect migration iPSC NPCs correlated altered lamination patient whom cells derived To this, MRI postmortem need conducted correlate iP results neuropath alterations Interestingly, study ASD patients MRI-defined macroaly found that NPCs proliferated faster control (March et al.

The final answer is: 

This study used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to investigate the neural development of two autism spectrum disorder (ASD) subtypes, idiopathic and 16.2 deletion (16Del). The researchers found that both subtypes had defects in neurite outgrowth and migration, which were driven by the shared pathogenic mechanism of mTOR signaling dysregulation. The study is one of the first to demonstrate the convergence of neurodevelopment and molecular phenotypes in two autism subtypes using rigorous methods such as utilization multiple iP clones and inductions. The results suggest that despite genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, two ASD subtypes have dysregulation of m signaling, which mediates uniform neurodevelopment phenotypes. The study also found that mTOR alterations were present in both subtypes, and modulation of the pathway with small molecules rescued ASD phenotypes, indicating that m signaling is mechanistically linked to neurodevelopment. However, there were also subtypes evidenced by differential responses to extracellular factors (EF) between IAS and 16Del NPCs, as well as distinct mTOR alterations, including elevations and reductions. The study highlights the importance of mTOR in the regulation of signaling and differences between IAS and 16Del in their ability to respond to EF. The study is one of the first to challenge NPCs with EF and uncover the importance of m in the regulation of the milieu. The results suggest that m signaling may play a key role in the pathogenesis of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.
Researchers investigated the diversity of synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) in the cochlea, a crucial for sound processing in the auditory system. They found that synapses with high spontaneous release rates (SR) were predominantly located on the pillar side of IHC and had larger, more compact excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), lower voltage thresholds, tighter calcium channel coupling to vesicle release, shorter latencies, and higher release rates. This suggests that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs. The study aimed to bridge the gap between synaptic and SGN physiology, using paired recordings of murine IHC and postsynaptic S boutons with stimuli mimicking in vivo conditions. Synaptic diversity is expressed across the nervous system, within a circuit, and even within a neuron. The auditory system harbors striking examples, such as glutamatergic synapses in the cochlea, calce synapses in the brainstem, and bout synapses in the central system. Heterogeneity exists among synapses formed by individual IHC with 5-30 SGN. Synaptic heterogeneity has been found at tonopic positions of the cochlea, a candidate for decomposing acoustic information. The cochlea might use heterogeneous affer synapses to break sound information into spike codes of SGN along the tonopic axis. The study used depolarizations to emulate physiological potentials of IHC in the high-frequency mouse cochlea, which represent the rectified envelope of an acoustic stimulus. The results indicate that synaptic heterogeneity accounts for SGN diversity at a given tonopic position.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The environmental challenges the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, faces during its progression into its various lifecycle stages warrant the use of effective and highly regulated access to chromatin for transcriptional regulation. Microrchidia ( MORC ) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across plant and animal kingdoms. Accumulating evidence has shed light on the role MORC protein plays as a transcriptional switch in apicomplexan parasites. In this study, using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool along with complementary molecular and genomics approaches, we demonstrate that PfMORC not only modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite erythrocytic cycle, but is also essential to the parasite survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) experiments suggests that PfMORC binds to not only sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation but may also play a role in modulating stage transition. Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture ( Hi-C ) studies indicate that downregulation of PfMORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite heterochromatin structure leading to its death. All together these findings confirm that PfMORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies.

   ., 2020; Singh et al., 2024 ). Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that PfMORC seems to interact with AP2-G2 ( Singh et al., 2021a ), a TF that plays a critical role in the maturation of gametocytes. However, the genome-wide distribution and exact function of this protein throughout the parasite life cycle remained elusive. In this study, we apply CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing technologies to determine the function, genome distribution, and indispensability of PfMORC throughout the parasite’s IDC. Immunoprecipitation of an HA-tagged parasite line validates the role of PfMORC in heterochromatin structure maintenance. Using the downregulation of PfMORC induced through the TetR-DOZI system, we demonstrate the functional significance of PfMORC in heterochromatin stability and gene repression. Immunofluorescence-based assays and ChIP-seq experiments show that PfMORC localizes to heterochromatin clusters at or near var genes with significant overlap with well-known signatures of the parasite heterochromatin post-translational modification ( PTM ) H3K9-trimethylation ( H3K9me3 ) marks. When PfMORC was downregulated, a level of H3K9me3 was detected at a lower level, demonstrating a possible role of this protein in epigenetic regulation and gene repression. Finally, Hi-C analyses demonstrate that downregulation of PfMORC results in significant dysregulation of chromatin architectural stability resulting in parasite death. All together our work provides significant insight into the role of PfMORC in the maintenance of the pathogens' epigenetics and chromosomal architectural integrity and validates this protein as a promising target for novel therapeutic interventions.

. Given the multifunctional role of MORC proteins throughout apicomplexan parasites, we further explored the association of PfMORC with chromatin accessibility and stage-specific gene regulation by assessing the genome-wide distribution of PfMORC using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing ( ChIP–seq ) in duplicate at the ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages. Inspection of PfMORC binding sites across each chromosome revealed a strong signal for telomeric and subtelomeric regions of the parasite genome, as well as the internal clusters of genes responsible for antigenic variation such as var and rifin ( Figure 2a–c, Supplementary file 4 ). We found that while only 47% of reads mapped to antigenic genes in the ring stage, 95% of reads mapped to the same genes during the trophozoite stage and 82% during the schizont stage. Although a vast majority of the genome is actively transcribed during the trophozoite stage, these antigenic gene families are under tight regulatory control to ensure mutually exclusive expression and participate in immune evasion ( Chen et al., 1998; Scherf et al., 1998 ). This could explain the disparity in the level of PfMORC binding of the coding regions between the ring and trophozoite stages ( Figure 2c, Figure 2—figure supplement 1b ). We also evaluated PfMORC binding of stage-specific gene families including gametocyte-related genes, and merozoite surface proteins ( msp ) ( Meerstein-Kessel et al., 2018 ). In trophozoite and schizont stages, gametocyte-associated genes contain a mean of <0. 5 RPKM normalized reads per nucleotide of PfMORC binding within their promoter region, whereas antigenic gene families such as var and rifin contain ~1. 5 and 0. 5 normalized reads, respectively ( Figure 2b ). The difference is even greater within the gene body with gametocyte genes displaying almost no reads mapped more than 200 bp downstream of the TSS and antigenic gene families containing 0. 5–1

Despite intensive investigations on the dynamic nature of the Plasmodium chromatin, progress has been slow in capturing the regulatory factors that maintain and control chromatin structure and gene expression throughout parasite development. Preliminary studies performed by our lab and others have identified PfMORC as one of the most abundant chromatin-bound proteins ( Singh et al., 2021a; Zhong et al., 2023 ). MORC proteins from plant to animal cells have a broad range of binding sites within the genome and participate in either DNA methylation establishment or heterochromatin formation ( Li et al., 2013; Tencer et al., 2020; Shao et al., 2010; He et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2020; Mimura et al., 2010 ). They have also been shown to co-localize with TFs in unmethylated promoter regions to alter chromatin accessibility and regulate TF binding and gene expression ( He et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2020; Mimura et al., 2010 ). For instance, AP2-P ( PF3D7_1107800 ), AP2-G5, ISW1, NUP2, MCM5, and HDAC1 have been shown to interact with MORC in several published works ( Farhat et al., 2020; Subudhi et al., 2023; Bryant et al., 2020 ), including this work. Protein pull-down experiments in Plasmodium spp. and T. gondii studies have detected MORC in complexes with several AP2 TFs. In T. gondii, TgMORC was characterized as an upstream transcriptional repressor of sexual commitment ( Farhat et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2023 ). In Plasmodium, the role of PfMORC was still poorly understood. Conflicting results on the essentiality of PfMORC using either KD or KO strategies remained unresolved ( Singh et al., 2021a; Zhang et al., 2018 ). Using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool, we have determined the nuclear localization, genome-wide distribution, and regulatory impacts of PfMORC on the parasite chromatin, transcriptome, and cell cycle development

Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Among the five human-infecting species, Plasmodium falciparum is the deadliest, with over 619, 000 deaths in 2023 ( WHO, 2023 ). To adapt to extreme environmental challenges, P. falciparum possesses unique strategies that direct the tightly coordinated changes in gene expression and control transcriptional switching in genes encoded by multigene families to ensure antigenic variation and immune evasion. Changes in gene expression throughout the parasite life cycle are controlled by a surprisingly low repertoire of transcription factors ( TFs ) encoded in the Plasmodium genome ( Coulson et al., 2004; Balaji et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2008; Yuda et al., 2009; Iwanaga et al., 2012; Sinha et al., 2014; Kafsack et al., 2014; Lesage et al., 2018 ). The 27 apicomplexan APETALA2 ( ApiAP2 ) DNA-binding proteins are the only well-documented parasite TFs known to contribute to the modulation of gene expression throughout various stages of the parasite’s development ( Balaji et al., 2005; Yuda et al., 2009; Iwanaga et al., 2012; Sinha et al., 2014; Kafsack et al. 2014; Lesage et. 2018 ). However, the role of other TFs in gene regulation remains largely unexplored.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, prompting an exploration into whether nerves infiltrating tumors contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions. Using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing, we show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas. The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors ( decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running ). Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos as well as increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts. The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie test behaviors, it did not fully restore voluntary wheel running indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts. Unraveling the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain is pivotal to developing targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer.

   . However, this approach fails to label all tumor-infiltrating nerves, predominantly those not close to the WGA-injected region and nerves that are in contact with or influenced by the tumor but are not directly infiltrating it. This limitation is a calculated one, reflecting a technical trade-off. We aimed to ensure the specificity of capturing only tumor-infiltrating nerves, which meant sacrificing the comprehensiveness of labeling all nerves associated with the tumor. This constraint extends to our calcium imaging studies and brain tracing. Although we can confidently assert that all labeled neurons are indeed tumor-infiltrating or connected, we cannot conclusively state that all tracer-negative ipsilateral nerves are unconnected to the tumor-brain circuit. Even with these constraints, our findings are important. We have demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating nerves are integrated into a pre-established neuronal circuit. This circuit extends from the tumor bed to the TGM ganglion, connects to the SpVc, and projects into the brain, influencing behavior in both pain-dependent and independent ways. This revelation paves the way for in-depth exploration into the mechanistic underpinnings of cancer-associated alterations in well-being and mental health, shedding light on potential therapeutic interventions to alleviate these profound effects.

. Although all groups displayed similar nesting scores initially, the scores in vehicle-treated mice declined significantly faster compared to RTX-treated mice ( Figure 5A ). Body weight decreased in all tumor-bearing mice, but the extent of weight loss was similar between vehicle and RTX-treated mice ( Figure 5B ). Similar to the developmental ablation of TRPV1 neurons, their chemoablation post-development resulted in a similar decrease in tumor growth compared to controls ( Figure 5C ). Since HNSCC tumors cause oral pain and both nesting and the cookie test require the use of the mouth, we also evaluated the effect of nociceptor ablation on voluntary wheel running to gain additional insights into cancer-associated fatigue, a surrogate for depressive-like behaviors in tumor-bearing mice ( Norden et al., 2015a; Zombeck et al., 2013; Grossberg et al., 2018; Bower et al., 2011; Norden et al., 2015b ). To assess the potential influence of cancer-associated pain, 1 week post tumor inoculation, groups of mice were treated with carprofen ( a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ), extended-release buprenorphine ( opioid ), or vehicle. We found that wheel running decreased as tumors progressed, an effect partially alleviated by carprofen and buprenorphine ( Figure 6A and B ). The nesting behavior ( Figure 6C ), body weight ( Figure 6D ), and food disappearance ( Figure 6E ) were also alleviated by the painkillers. Neither carprofen nor buprenorphine impacted MOC2-7 tumor growth compared to vehicle-treated animals ( Figure 6F ), but buprenorphine increased tumor growth compared to carprofen-treated mice. Significant effects for all statistical analyses in Figure 6 are presented in Supplementary file 3. These findings suggest that choosing pain management drugs in the context of cancer can potentially influence tumor growth adversely

. These functional and Fos staining data indicate that central neurons within the tumor-brain circuit are functionally altered compared to their healthy brain counterparts. Cancer patients, and even more notably, survivors, experienced poor mental health ( Carreira et al., 2018; Niedzwiedz et al., 2019; Utley et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2021 ). The neural connection between tumor and brain, together with our finding that TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons within this circuit become functionally altered, might contribute to these changes. To test whether this is the case, we genetically engineered mice with ablated nociceptor neurons ( TRPV1-Cre::Floxed-DTA ). TRPV1-Cre::Floxed-DTA animals lack TRPV1-expressing cells ( including neurons ) as well as many other nociceptive neurons. These nociceptor-neuron-ablated mice have been previously characterized and lack the expected sensitivity to temperature as well as itch and pain reactions to chemical mediators such as capsaicin ( Mishra et al., 2011 ). First, we confirmed the absence of TRPV1+ neurons in the TGM of these ablated animals ( Figure 4A ). Fos immunostaining of brains from nociceptor ablated and control ( C57BL/6 ) mice show no significant differences indicating that, in the absence of a malignancy, the neurons in these regions are not differentially activated ( Figure 4—figure supplements 1–3 ). The absence of nociceptor neurons in tumor-bearing animals, however, decreased cFos and ΔFosB in the PBN, and ΔFosB in the SpVc ( Figure 4B and C ). Other tested regions were not impacted ( Figure 4D ). These data suggest that the tumor-brain communication was disrupted in the absence of nociceptor neurons. To evaluate the effects of this disruption on cancer-induced behavioral changes, we assessed the animals’ general well-being through nesting behavior ( Neely et al., 2019 ) and anhedonia using the cookie test ( Liu et al., 2018; Eliwa et al

We have previously demonstrated that head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is associated with innervation by sensory neurons and that substance P, one of the principal neuropeptides these fibers release, drives malignant cell proliferation and migration ( Restaino et al., 2023 ). Significantly, patients suffering from HNSCC often experience depressive disorders, which are poorly managed clinically ( Chen et al., 2013a; Lazure et al., 2009; Elaldi et al., 2021 ). Here, we found that nociceptor neurons infiltrating HNSCC connect to a pre-existing brain-projecting circuit ( Navratilova et al., 2016; Mercer Lindsay et al., 2021 ) that includes the trigeminal ganglia, the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal ( SpVc ), as well as the parabrachial nucleus ( PBN ), and central amygdala ( CeA ) ( Ito et al., 2021; Jaramillo et al., 2021; Ge et al., 2022; Torres-Rodriguez et al., 2024 ). This connection occurs independently of pain, and this cancer-brain circuit drives behavioral alterations in tumor-bearing mice. While the elimination of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons reduces tumor growth and enhances survival rates, it also highlights a potential therapeutic target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients. This underscores the complex interplay between sensory neurons, cancer progression, and mental health, uncovering a two-pronged approach to improving HNSCC patients’ physical and psychological health. In melanoma ( Balood et al., 2022 ) and HNSCC, we demonstrated significant alterations in transcript levels within tumor-infiltrating nerves. Several mechanisms can account for these changes. For instance, TRPV1 stimulation is sufficient to trigger the activation of the AP-1 transcription factor within neurons ( Backes et al., 2018 ). Such TRPV1 activation could occur in response to low pH ( Boedtkjer and Pedersen, 2020 ) or hypoxia ( Pocock and Hobert, 2008; Pocock and Hobert, 2010; Stevenson et al

. These data show that the constraint imposed by the tumor on behavioral activities that require the use of the oral cavity is mainly due to pain and not to the physical interference of the tumor mass with the pattern of oral activities that need to take place for mice to perform the corresponding behavior. Cancer pain often interferes with activities that don't involve oral movements, a phenomenon evident in the impaired voluntary wheel running observed in tumor-bearing mice. Although analgesic drugs can partially mitigate this deficit, they fail to restore this behavior fully, despite their efficacy in completely restoring oral activity behaviors like nesting and the cookie test. Moreover, given that carprofen and buprenorphine decrease inflammation ( Shepherd and Mohapatra, 2018 ), their ability to restore normal nesting and cookie behaviors suggests that pain is not the primary driver of these alterations. The tumor-brain interaction is pivotal to understanding cancer-induced changes in mental health and well-being, as well as developing targeted interventions to alleviate these effects.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Genetic diversity is a hallmark of RNA viruses and the basis for their evolutionary success. Taking advantage of the uniquely large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2, we examine the impact of mutations across the spectrum of viable amino acid sequences on the biophysical phenotypes of the highly expressed and multifunctional nucleocapsid protein. We find variation in the physicochemical parameters of its extended intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) sufficient to allow local plasticity, but also observe functional constraints that similarly occur in related coronaviruses. In biophysical experiments with several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants, we find that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal impact and modulate thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, protein oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation. In the Omicron variant, distant mutations in different IDRs have compensatory effects in shifting a delicate balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties, and include the creation of a new protein-protein interaction interface in the N-terminal IDR through the defining P13L mutation. A picture emerges where genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional N-protein species, in particular in the IDRs.

    The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has motivated the collection of virus genomic sequences on an unprecedented scale, which has generated invaluable data on the genomic diversity of an RNA virus. From the ensemble of observed consensus sequences of infected hosts, we can extract, for the first time, an exhaustive map of possible amino acid replacements in viral proteins that are tolerable for viable virus ( Bloom et al., 2023; Saldivar-Espinoza et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2022 ). This brings into stark relief our limited understanding of the genotype/phenotype relationship, which is very detailed on some local functional aspects, such as spike protein antigenicity, but not much developed in general. This limits our ability to draw conclusions from the observed mutant spectrum on their variation in biophysical functions and fitness. Besides traditional sequence-based structure prediction and structure/function relationships, and more recent recognition of structural dynamics, new paradigms have emerged with increased understanding of the role of IDRs, their mimicry of SLiMs, nonlocal physicochemical properties of sequence regions, and the ability of IDRs to promote macroscopic phase separation to generate or usurp condensates with virus-related functions. The extensive genomic data of SARS-CoV-2 presents an opportunity to probe how sequence diversity impacts these biophysical properties, and to examine what biophysical constraints exist for viral proteins to support viability. Focusing on SARS-CoV-2 N-protein we have studied the diversity of biophysical phenotypes with the goal to increase understanding of salient mechanisms of the many N-protein functions, and also to glean aspects of the biophysical fitness landscape underlying evolution. On one hand, our studies of the diversity of nonlocal physicochemical properties of N-protein revealed the absence of tightly controlled hydrophobicity, polarity, and charges outside the folded domains

. It was also shown how nonlocal biophysical properties, such as the charge of IDRs, can be relevant evolutionary traits ( Zarin et al., 2021; Zarin et al., 2017 ). More recently, it was recognized that the formation of membrane-less cellular compartments driven by liquid-liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) is a key aspect of many intrinsically disordered proteins, including many viral proteins ( Cascarina and Ross, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023 ). What kind of sequence constraints may derive from the biophysical requirement to conserve LLPS properties is currently only emerging ( Brown et al., 2011; Chin et al., 2022; Ho and Huang, 2022; Lin et al., 2017; Riback et al., 2017 ). The goal of the present work is to probe the phenotypic diversity with respect to several biophysical properties of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid ( N- ) protein, taking advantage of the vast mutational landscape of SARS-CoV-2. N-protein is the most abundant viral protein in the infected cell ( Finkel et al., 2021 ), and as we reported previously ( Zhao et al., 2022 ), it is also the most diverse structural protein with approximately 86% of its 419 residues capable of assuming on average four to five different amino acids evidently without impairment of viability. The highest frequency of mutations occurs in the substantial IDRs which are the N-arm, linker, and C-arm that flank and connect the folded nucleic acid binding domain ( NTD ) and the dimerization domain ( CTD ) ( Figure 1 ). The IDRs comprise approximately half of the molecule and allow large conformational fluctuations ( Botova et al., 2024; Cubuk et al., 2021; Redzic et al., 2021 ). The eponymous structural function of N-protein is that of scaffolding genomic RNA for virion assembly

. 1 ( gray symbols ). Charge properties of related coronaviruses follow a similar pattern of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 3A ), although with somewhat greater differences, particularly again for NL63 and APD51511. 1. Peptides corresponding to L-rich regions exhibit low charge, distinctly below those of the SR-rich regions, and similarly, N3 peptides have lower charges than C-arm-1 peptides of the corresponding viral species, and nearly all are acidic. Even though it is unclear to what extent IDRs of other coronaviruses can be phosphorylated, their amino acid composition would provide similar potential as SARS-CoV-2, as the completely phosphorylated charges of all peptides follow closely those of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 3B ). This suggests that the charge properties and phosphorylation, like polarity and hydrophobicity, of the equivalent IDR sub-regions are functional biophysical constraints maintained across related coronaviruses despite little sequence conservation. Unfortunately, it is impossible to express and experimentally characterize biophysical properties of all mutant species. Therefore, to assess the range of phenotype variation, we examine only six exemplary protein constructs related to variants of concern in comparison with the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference molecule, Nref ( Table 2 ) : ( 1 ) N:R203K/G204R with a double mutation in the disordered linker that arose early in the Alpha variant ( B. 1. 1. 7 ), but occurs also in the Gamma variant ( P. 1 ), and all Omicron variants ( BA. 1 through BA. 5 ). It was found to modulate phosphorylation of cytosolic N-protein, enhance assembly in a VLP assay, and increase viral fitness ( Johnson et al., 2022; Javed et al., 2023; Syed et al

. In the IDRs, individual mutations may alter each of these properties apparently without impacting viability, although modulatory fitness effects may be possible. For example, viable linker sequences span from 4. 8 to 9. 1 charges. On the other hand, a very clear separation of physicochemical parameters far exceeding mutational dispersion is maintained between the L-rich and SR-rich region of the linker IDR, and between the N3 and remaining region of the C-arm IDR. These distinctions are likely functionally important, with the polarity and charges of the SR-rich linker region aiding in NA binding ( Pontoriero et al., 2022 ), the hydrophobicity of the L-rich region aiding in assembly functions ( Bessa et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2023 ), and the acidic N3 region probably playing a role in NA- and M-protein interactions as suggested from analogy to MHV- and SARS-CoV-1 ( Masters, 2019 ). These nonlocal features are also maintained in analogous consensus sequence regions of related coronaviruses, and thus provide further examples for nonlocal biophysical properties that are evolutionary conserved despite amino acid sequence divergence ( Zarin et al., 2017; Zarin et al., 2021 ). It may seem as a paradox that despite this conservation these features seem not very fine-tuned and that significant variation of these properties is still observed within the viable mutant spectrum, for polarity and hydrophobicity significantly exceeding the spread of parameter values of the folded domains. However, as mentioned above, the differences between IDR regions that appear associated with biophysical functions are of significantly larger magnitude. The tolerance for the remaining comparatively smaller fluctuations in physicochemical parameters may be important to allow sufficient local variation in sequence space for additional functions to evolve, such as the emergence of SLiMs to manipulate the host/virus interface ( Davey et al

SARS-CoV-2 sequence data were downloaded from Nextstrain ( Hadfield et al., 2018 ) in January 2023 and 5. 06 million high-quality sequences were selected for analysis. The N-protein amino acid sequences exhibit ≈43 million instances of mutations distributed across ≈92% of its residues. We have previously characterized this dataset with regard to the amino acid mutational landscape of N-protein, and found mutation frequencies that are strongly dependent on position and largely time-invariant, except for the defining mutations arising in variants of concern, the latter of which are highly conserved ( Zhao et al,202 ). Here we focus on the physicochemical properties of IDRs of N-pro and their impact on biophysical phenotypes of the multifunctional N-protein. The physicochemical properties of IDRs were calculated using the following parameters : charge, hydrophobicity, polarity, and secondary structure, oligomeric state, thermodynamic stability, and liquid-liquid phase separation ( LLPS ), and protein-protein interactions ( PPIs ). The physico properties of IDRs of N-pro were compared to those of other coronaviruses, including NL63 and AP515.1 1.1, to examine conservation of biophysical constraints across coronaviruses. The physchemical properties of IDRs of SARS-CoV-2 N-pro were compared to those of the Wu-Hu-1 reference strain and several variants of concern, including Alpha, Gamma, Omicron, and BA. 1 through BA. 5, to examine the impact of mutations on biophysical phenotypes of N-pro. The physico properties of IDRs were calculated using the following parameters : charge, hydroobicity, polarity, secondary structure, oligomeric state, thermodynamic stability, LLPS, and PPIs. The phys properties of IDRs of N-pro were compared to those of other coronaviruses, including NL and AP. 1. 1, to examine conservation of biophysical constraints across coronavir. The phys properties of ID of SARSV-2 N-pro were compared to those of Wu-H-1 and several variants of concern, including Alpha, Gamma, Omic, and BA. through BA. to examine the impact of mutations on bi phenotypes N-pro. The phys properties of IDRs were calculated using the following : charge, hydrophity, polarity, secondary, oligom state, thermodynamic, LL, and PIs. The properties of ID of N were compared to other coronavir, NL and AP. to examine conservation bi constraints coron. The properties of SARS-2 N were compared to Wu-1 and variants Alpha, Gamma, Omic, and BA through BA to examine mutations bi N. The properties were calculated using : charge, hydroph, polarity, secondary, olig, therm, LL, and P. The of N were compared coron NL and AP to conservation.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Hibernation is a period of metabolic suppression utilized by many small and large mammal species to survive during winter periods. As the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood, our study aimed to determine whether skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency undergo alterations during hibernation to optimize energy utilization. We isolated muscle fibers from small hibernators, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus and Eliomys quercinus and larger hibernators, Ursus arctos and Ursus americanus. We then conducted loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure resting myosin dynamics and its ATP demand. In parallel, we performed multiple proteomics analyses. Our results showed a preservation of myosin structure in U. arctos and U. americanus during hibernation, whilst in I. tridecemlineatus and E. quercinus, changes in myosin metabolic states during torpor unexpectedly led to higher levels in energy expenditure of type II, fast-twitch muscle fibers at ambient lab temperatures ( 20 °C ). Upon repeating loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments at 8 °C ( near the body temperature of torpid animals ), we found that myosin ATP consumption in type II muscle fibers was reduced by 77–107% during torpor compared to active periods. Additionally, we observed Myh2 hyper-phosphorylation during torpor in I. tridecemilineatus, which was predicted to stabilize the myosin molecule. This may act as a potential molecular mechanism mitigating myosin-associated increases in skeletal muscle energy expenditure during periods of torpor in response to cold exposure. Altogether, we demonstrate that resting myosin is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to significant changes to the ATP consumption of skeletal muscle. Additionally, we observe that it is further altered in response to cold exposure and highlight myosin as a potentially contributor to skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis.

   . Hence, in the present study, we hypothesized that a remodeling of the proportions of myosin DRX and SRX conformations within skeletal muscles occurs and is a major suppressor of ATP/metabolic demand during hibernation. A recent study on I. tridecemlineatus cardiac muscle supports this hypothesis, finding higher proportions of SRX during torpor ( Toepfer et al., 2020 ). We examined isolated skeletal myofibers extracted from both small and large hibernating mammals - I. tridecemlineatus, E. quercinus, U. arctos, and U. americanus. We employed a multifaceted approach: loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments to assess myosin conformation and ATP turnover time, X-ray diffraction for sarcomere structure evaluation, and proteomic analyses to quantify differential PTMs.

. Accordingly, a few studies investigating human pathological conditions have reported disruptions of the myosin ATP turnover times in resting isolated skeletal myofibers, but their actual impacts have never been thoroughly investigated ( Lewis et al., 2023; Phung et al., 2020; Sonne et al., 2023 ). Here, originally, we estimated the consequences on the actual energy consumption of sarcomeres/muscle fibers. Our results of higher ATP consumption during torpor ( and IBA ) could, at first glance, be seen as counter-intuitive but is an indication of adaptation to the myosin protein during hibernating periods. It was therefore essential to investigate if these changes were also observed at a lower temperature, more relevant to the actual temperature of skeletal muscle in small hibernators during hibernation ( Cooper et al., 2012 ). A critical difference between the large hibernators, U. arctos and U. americanus, and the small hibernators, E. quercinus and I. tridecemlineatus, during their hibernation periods is core body temperature. Whilst the large hibernators only undergo a modest temperature decrease during hibernation, small hibernators reduce their core body temperature drastically to between 4°C and 8°C ( Cooper et al., 2012; Sahdo et al., 2013; Kisser and Goodwin, 2012 ). We repeated the Mant-ATP chase assays at 8 °C to mimic the environment of physiological torpor. Interestingly, lowering the temperature decreased DRX and SRX-linked ATP turnover times during active periods ( in SA and IBA ), especially in type II myofibers from I. tridecemlineatus, inducing an increase in ATP consumption. Metabolic organs such as skeletal muscle are well-known to increase core body temperature in response to significant cold exposure ( i ) by inducing rapid involuntary contractions known as shivering ( Haman, 2006; Haman and Blondin, 2017 ) or ( ii ) a process named non-shivering thermogenesis ( NST )

., 2005 ). Another type II fiber-specific protein significantly downregulated in both torpor and IBA was MYBPC2 ( fast skeletal myosin binding protein-C ) ( McNamara et al., 2017; Song et al., 2021 ). Its loss in skeletal mammals of rodents is thought to directly interfere with myosin conformation ( Song et al., 2021 ). Taken together, we believe that the aberrant PTMs and/or protein expression remodeling do play a role in modifying the myosin filament stability and this all may be triggered by the well-known decreased tension on sarcomeres during hibernation ( Linari et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2018b ). Our findings suggest ATP turnover adaptations in DRX and SRX myosin states occur in small hibernators like I. tridecemlineatus during hibernation and cold exposure. In contrast, larger mammals like U. arctos and U. americanus show no such changes, likely due to their stable body temperature during hibernation. This supports our hypothesis that myosin serves as a non-shivering thermogenesis regulator in mammals, a mechanism inhibited during torpor.

., 2011; Evans et al., 2023 ). While species-specific physiological patterns are well-documented, the molecular and cellular mechanisms operative in individual organs to achieve these remain largely undefined. Skeletal muscle constitutes approximately 45–55% of body mass and serves as a major determinant of basal metabolic rate and heat production ( Zurlo et al., 1990; Sylow et al., 2021 ). Previous studies have uncovered some specific metabolic changes in skeletal muscle during hibernation ( Giroud et al., 2020 ). For example, a decrease in mitochondrial respiration, as well as a suppression of ATP production capacity, has previously been documented in skeletal muscles from I. tridecemlineatus during torpor ( James et al., 2013 ). Previous work has demonstrated that ground squirrels require an optimal dietary ratio of monounsaturated to polyunsaturated fats, approximately 2:1, during their fat-storing period to facilitate effective hibernation ( Frank and Storey, 1995 ). The proteome of I. tridecemlineatus has then been shown to be enriched for fatty acid β-oxidation during periods of torpor. However, some reliance upon carbohydrate metabolism is maintained. The activity of phosphoglucomutase ( PGM1 ) is even increased during torpor ( Hindle et al., 2011 ). In U. arctos, skeletal muscle exhibits a transition from carbohydrate utilization to lipid metabolism, coupled with a reduction in whole-tissue ATP turnover ( Chazarin et al., 2019 ). Muscle is organized into an array of fibers containing repeating sarcomeres, which are crucial for regulating not only contraction but also metabolism and thermogenesis ( Gordon et al., 2000 ). Until recently, energy consumption in skeletal muscle was thought to be primarily linked to the activity of myosin during muscular contraction ( Gordon et al., 2000 )

In contrast to our study hypothesis, we demonstrated that the animals studied continue to maintain their active levels of myosin in the more metabolically active disordered-relaxed state ( DRX ) during periods of metabolic shutdown. This is of particular interest when compared to a previous study by Toepfer et al., who observed that in cardiac muscle from I. tridecemlineatus the percentage of myosin heads in the DRX conformation was lower in periods of torpor vs SA and IBA ( Toepfer et al., 2020 ). Maintenance of the resting myosin conformation to active levels during hibernating periods may be to prevent the onset significant muscular atrophy during hibernation. Hibernating animals have evolved mechanisms that prevent skeletal muscle atrophy during the extended periods of immobilization inherent to hibernation ( Hindle et al., 2011; Miyazaki et al., 2022; Miyazaki et al., 2019; Mugahid et al., 2019 ). Further research into changes to myosin head conformation in human atrophy and immobilization models would provide an interesting comparison to these data and potentially highlight resting myosin conformation as a novel target in the treatment of sarcopenia associated with aging and/or inactivity. It would furthermore ideally be possible to increase the biological sample size of all mammalian hibernators to include other species such as bears, bats, and marmots, and chipmunks to determine the universality of myin changes during hibernation and cold exposure.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Chondrocyte columns, which are a hallmark of growth plate architecture, play a central role in bone elongation. Columns are formed by clonal expansion following rotation of the division plane, resulting in a stack of cells oriented parallel to the growth direction. In this work, we analyzed hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos using a pipeline comprising 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis. Surprisingly, analysis of the elevation angles between neighboring pairs of cells revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation, implying incomplete rotation of the division plane. Morphological analysis revealed that although embryonic clones were elongated, they formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction. Analysis of growth plates of postnatal mice revealed both complex columns, composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks, and small, disorganized clusters located in the outer edges. Finally, correlation between the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns and between bone elongation and expansion suggests that clusters may promote expansion, whereas columns support elongation. Overall, our findings support the idea that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determines the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth. Broadly, this work provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development.

   . In this study, we analyze the 3D architecture of confetti-labeled clones in the embryonic and postnatal growth plate of mice. Intriguingly, we found that chondrocytes in the embryonic growth plate are rarely arranged in columns. Instead, successive incomplete rotations during cell division result in non-stereotypic cell stacking that, in turn, give rise to elongated clusters oriented orthogonally to the longitudinal bone axis. However, in the postnatal growth plate clones, the rate of complete cell rotations increases, leading to the formation of complex columns through a combination of stereotypical and non-stereotypic cell stacking, as well as of small, orthogonally oriented clusters. Additionally, we observed that column formation is buffered, permitting deviations of up to 60% incomplete rotations between successive cells within columns. The presence of clusters and columns correlated temporally with the rates of growth plate elongation and expansion, suggesting that these structures support different growth strategies during embryonic and postnatal bone development, while highlighting the imperative role of 3D analysis when studying complex cellular arrangements.

Chondrocyte columns are a hallmark of growth plate architecture that, in turn, drives bone elongation. In this work, we studied column formation by analyzing the 3D structure of cell clones in the embryonic and postnatal growth plates of mice, using a modified version of 3D MAPs ( Rubin et al., 2021 ). Addressing the three criteria for a column, we found that uniclonal and multiclonal columns are rare in the embryonic growth plate. Instead, most clones form elongated clusters that orient orthogonal to the longitudinal bone axis as a result of numerous incomplete rotations that occur during cell division within a clone. Postnatally, clones form complex columns from a combination of ordered and disordered stacks of cells, as well as small orthogonally oriented clusters. These morphological entities correlate with the temporal dynamics of growth plate elongation and expansion, suggesting that clusters and columns support different growth strategies during embryonic and postnatal bone development ( Figure 7 ). Column formation is commonly viewed as a key morphogenetic process during bone elongation. During this process, clones of flat PZ cells form stacks, resulting in alignment of the long axis of the column with the longitudinal bone axis ( Dodds, 1930; Li and Dudley, 2009; Li et al., 2017; Romereim et al., 2014; Romereim and Dudley, 2011; Aszodi et al., 2003 ). This arrangement is thought to restrict lateral cell density, thereby maximizing the effect of chondrocyte hypertrophy along the elongation axis of the bone ( Romereim and Dudley, 2011 ). Our discovery that during embryogenesis, when bone elongation is at its highest, the growth plates contain only few columns, contradicts previous studies and reveals the need to reconsider the underlying mechanisms. Several possibilities could explain these differences

. One limitation of our rotation analysis is that in order to calculate the relative position between neighboring cells, we assumed that chondrocyte rotation and orientation are correlated and that chondrocytes do not move after rotating, as was previously suggested ( Romereim et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2023 ). Moreover. growth plates of various organisms employ different strategies to create bones of diverse morphologies, which serve different functions such as running, swimming, flying, etc. Thus, it is possible that in each context, the ratio between clusters and columns is adjusted to cope with these different requirements. Here, we discovered that the core mechanism underlying chondrocyte column formation, namely a complete rotation of the division plane during chondrocyte proliferation, is rare in the embryonic growth plate. Our 3D analyses reveal the temporal dynamics of division plane rotations and their effect on the formation of columns and clusters in the pre- and postnatal growth plate, as well as the correlation of these morphogenetic processes with different growth behaviors. Overall, these findings establish a new model for column formation and provide a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation and expansion during development.

To date, a comprehensive 3D analysis of column formation in the mouse embryonic growth plate has not been performed. To address this gap, we conducted multicolor clonal lineage tracing on proximal tibia and distal femur growth plates of Col2a1-CreER:R26R-Confetti embryos. Labeled cellular clones were subjected to 3D morphometric analysis using our previously reported 3D MAPs pipeline ( Rubin et al., 2021; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Recombination was induced at E14. 5 and 4 days later, chondrocyte clones were observed in all growth plate zones ( Figure 1A–C ). In 2D optical sections from both femur and tibia, cells within the clones appeared neatly stacked, forming a column-like structure parallel to the P-D bone axis ( Figure 1B and C ). However, 3D examination revealed no columnar organization and cells that were rarely stacked neatly ( Figure 1D and E, Figure 1—figure supplement 2, and Figure 1—videos 1–11 ). To characterize the stacking behavior of embryonic growth plate cells, we performed quantitative analysis of local cell stacking in distinct clones. For that, we measured the elevation angle between all neighboring pairs of cells ( doublets ) within a given clone, similar to what was done previously ( Carolyn, 2023 ) ( see details in ‘Materials and methods’ and Figure 1F ). In a spherical coordinate system, the elevation angle between two perfectly stacked cells at origin 0 would be 90° ( Figure 1F ), indicating a complete rotation of the division plane during cell division. Visualization of cell doublets representative of various elevation angles employing two orthogonal viewing directions revealed that in 3D, typically stacked column cells are expected to exhibit elevation angles in the range of 60–90° ( Figure 1G ). Notably, however, quantification of elevation angles revealed that less than 20% of doublets within a clone were typically stacked ( distal femur, 17. 6%; proximal tibia, 19. 4%; Figure 1H and I )

. One plausible explanation is that earlier studies focused on the mechanism of division plane rotation in column formation, but they either analyzed small subsets of clonal doublets without tracking their contributions to columns ( Li et al., 2017; Romereim et al., 2014 ) or examined non-clonal doublets ( Yuan et al., 2023 ). Without integrating these aspects into a comprehensive study, it is difficult to confirm the existence of clonal columns and determine whether they are formed by cells that have undergone complete division plane rotation. Additionally, it is plausible that the clusters we identified intercalate in a manner that forms geometric non-clonal columns. This could explain the columnar arrangement of chondrocytes observed in histological sections of the growth plate. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of column formation and the function of bone elongation may be regulated by this organization of clusters into geometric non-clonal columns, or increase in cell volume. The latter has been shown to be a major driver of longitudinal bone growth ( Rubin et al., 2021; Breur et al., 1991; Wilsman et al., 2008; Wilsman et al., 1996; Cooper et al., 2013; Breur et al., 1997; Li et al., 2015 ). Changes in chondrocyte morphology, proliferation, and matrix secretion may also play important roles in this process; however, their exact contributions to embryonic bone elongation are unclear. As the cellular entity that regulates bone growth and morphology, the growth plate must balance between different requirements and constraints while performing its functions. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the growth plate follows the most efficient strategy to elongate the bone during embryonic development, which may differ from the postnatal growth. Our findings suggest that during embryonic growth, the plate employs a strategy of clusters to elongate the bone, whereas postnatally employs a combination of clusters and columns to elongate and expand the bone ( Figure 7 ). Overall, this study provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying bone elongation and growth during embryonic and postnatal development and highlights the importance of 3D analysis when studying complex cellular arrangements in the growth plate.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters ( POTs ) are of great pharmaceutical interest owing to their promiscuous substrate binding site that has been linked to improved oral bioavailability of several classes of drugs. Members of the POT family are conserved across all phylogenetic kingdoms and function by coupling peptide uptake to the proton electrochemical gradient. Cryo-EM structures and alphafold models have recently provided new insights into different conformational states of two mammalian POTs, SLC15A1, and SLC15A2. Nevertheless, these studies leave open important questions regarding the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling, while simultaneously providing a unique opportunity to investigate these processes using molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations. Here, we employ extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling MD to map out the full SLC15A2 conformational cycle and its thermodynamic driving forces. By computing conformational free energy landscapes in different protonation states and in the absence or presence of peptide substrate, we identify a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access. These simulations identify key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs, which we validate experimentally in cell-based transport assays. Our results from constant-PH MD and absolute binding free energy ( ABFE ) calculations also establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition, revealing key details underpining secondary active transport in POTs. This study provides a vital step forward in understanding proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals and pave the way to integrate knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design to target tissue and organ bioavailability.

   ., 2012 ). Since R57 interacts with both the ExxER glutamates and the substrate C-terminus, we hypothesise that it may play an important role in substrate–proton coupling. In this study, we use extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling MD simulations ( totalling close to 1 ms of sampling ) to show how changes in protonation states of H87 and D342 control the OCC↔OF transition as an extracellular gate. We validate the importance of these residues for transporter function in cell-based transport assays. We also elucidate the role of E53xxER glutamates and the substrate-engaging E622 in controlling the OCC↔IF transition, thereby identifying a clear molecular basis for the directionality of proton movement coupling to conformational changes. Furthermore, we establish several distinct effects of the presence of substrate, coupling ligand binding with protein conformational changes and also linking it to protonation of the E56 and E622 titratable residues. Taken together, our work provides for the first time a detailed model of a plausible sequence of steps for substrate and proton-coupled alternating access in mammalian POTs.

. Although these unbiased simulations show a large amount of stochasticity and drawing clean conclusions from the data are diﬃcult, we can already appreciate a possible mechanism where protons move down the transporter pore, first engaging H87 and D342 to favour the OF state and then moving to the ExxER motif ( E53 and/or E56 ) and E622 to favour the IF orientation, driving successive conformational changes along the way. The initial unbiased approach taken in this section, therefore, serves to generate hypotheses for testing by a more rigorous investigation of the protonation state-dependent conformational changes. To this end, we set out to employ enhanced sampling simulations for obtaining conformational free energy landscapes in dependence on a range of protonation state and substrate binding conditions. To overcome the time-scale limitations of MD simulations and sample important slow degrees of freedom, many enhanced sampling approaches have been developed ( Hénin et al., 2022 ) and employed in the computational study of membrane proteins ( Harpole and Delemotte, 2018 ). An important class of methods that includes ( among others ) the popular techniques of steered MD ( SMD ) ( Izrailev et al., 1999 ), umbrella sampling ( Torrie and Valleau, 1977 ), metadynamics ( Barducci et al., 2008 ), adaptive biasing force ( ABF ) ( Darve et al., 2008 ), and the accelerated weight histogram method ( AWH ) ( Lindahl et al., 2014 ) uses a small number of collective variables ( CVs ) along which to bias the simulation, thus improving exploration of important regions of phase space if the CV includes the relevant slow degrees of freedom ( DOFs ). If the CV is not optimal, problems can manifest in the form of hysteresis ( starting-state dependence ) when moving between known end-states ( Lichtinger and Biggin, 2023 ). This is the case for the PepT2 OCC↔OF transition with the simple tip-CV illustrated in Figure 2a

. This could be investigated using reactive MD or QM/MM simulations ( both approaches have been employed for other protonation steps of procaryotic peptide transporters, see Parker et al., 2017 and Li et al., 2022 ), however the putative path is very long ( ≈1. 7 nm between H87 and E56 ) and may or may not involve a large number of intermediate protonatable residues, in addition to binding site water. While such an investigation is possible in principle, it is beyond the scope of the present study. Likewise, a coupled enhanced-sampling treatment involving both proton movement and large-scale conformational changes-as discussed above for the ordering of steps in the OCC → OF transition-would make for interesting future work, once it becomes computationally tractable. Our data is not fully determinate with respect to whether protons move to E56 before or after the OF→OCC conformational transition ( our CpHMD, for example, remains agnostic on this matter since the shift in the E56 pKa value induced by the substrate is evident in both the OCC and OF states ). We may interpret the fact that OCC is raised in energy while H87 is protonated and substrate-induced OCC stabilisation is not found when H87 and D342 are protonated ( but does occur when E56 is protonated ) as an indication that proton movement is favoured before the transition into OCC is complete. On the other hand, the transition-region interaction between protonated H87 and D317 could also be interpreted as a potential facilitator of the OF→OCC transition. We thus speculate that the proton movement processes may happen as an ensemble of different mechanisms, and potentially occur contemporaneously with the conformational change. This, in addition to a ﬂexible binding pocket, may also contribute to the substrate promiscuity mechanism

. Several residues have been suggested to be involved in proton transfer, including a partially conserved histidine on TM2 ( H87; residue numbers refer to PepT2, if not specified otherwise ) ( Terada et al., 1996; Fei et al., 1997; Chen et al., 2000; Omori et al., 2021; Parker et al., 2021 ) and two conserved glutamates on TM1 ( E53 and E56 ) ( Jensen et al., 2012; Doki et al., 2013; Aduri et al., 2015 ), while simulations have helped our understanding of proton-transfer processes and conformational changes ( Parker et al., 2017; Selvam et al., 2018; Batista et al., 2019; Li et al., 2022 ). However, the details of the molecular mechanism of alternating access in POTs, particularly regarding the coupling of conformational changes, substrate binding, and proton movement to each other, remain unclear. Cryo-EM and Alphafold 2 have recently provided views of mammalian POTs in conformations spanning from OF via inward-facing-partially occluded to fully-open IF ( Parker et al., 2021; Killer et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2022; Jumper et al., 2021 ). From these structures emerges a picture where the intracellular gate is constituted by broad close-packing of hydrophobic residues on TM 4, 5, 10, and 11, with possible stabilisation from the conserved D170–K642 salt-bridge. The extracellular gate appears to be spread along the cleft between the N-and C-terminal bundles, with contributions from the H87 ( TM 2 ) – S321 ( TM 7 ) polar interaction network as well as the R206 ( TM 5 ) – D342 ( TM 8 ) and K64 ( TM 1 ) – D317 ( TM 7 ) salt bridges ( Figure 1b ). This is intriguing, because the mammalian H87 residue is only conserved in some prokaryotic homologues, and R206–D342 just among mammalian POTs. We speculate based on this feature that the extracellular gating mechanism could be less conserved than POT alternating access in general

. Once the substrate ( driven by E622 protonation ) and the protons ( driven by their electrochemical potential gradient ) have left through the open intracellular gate into the intracellular bulk, the resulting apo, standard-protonation-state IF conformation has a thermodynamic preference to return to OCC as evidenced in our 2D-PMFs. We thus arrive back at the starting state of the conformational cycle, ready for the next round of substrate binding and protonation. This cycle is consistent with the alternating access model of POTs, where substrate and protons move in opposite directions through the transporter. Our results are in line with previous studies on proary and mammalian POTs ( Jensen et al. 2012; Doki et al. 2013; Aduri et al 2015; et al. 2017; Selam et al 2018; Batista et al 2019; Li et 2022 ) and provide a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition in mammalian POTs. This is a step forward in understanding of proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals and pave the way to integrate knowledge of solute carrier biology with drug design to target and bioavailability.
Researchers investigated the neural responses in the auditory cortex during speech production in humans using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants. They found that the strongest auditory suppression was observed in the superior temporal gyrus (ST), but the degree of suppression varied across different recording sites. The study aimed to determine the role of auditory suppression in speech monitoring and whether sites showing suppression were sensitive to auditory feedback. A delayed feedback (DAF) task was used to test sensitivity to feedback. Results showed overlapping sites in the ST exhibited both speech-induced suppression and sensitivity to feedback, with a strong correlation between the two measures, supporting the hypothesis that suppression increases sensitivity to errors. Further, responses in the posterior ST were enhanced in the DAF task compared to normal production, suggesting attention modulates feedback sensitivity. The study found no anatomical organization for suppression and sensitivity in the ST, but an anterior-posterior organization for the effect of attention on sensitivity. Auditory sites posterior to the lateral termination of the TS in ST showed stronger activation during the D task compared to standard reading, even with simultaneous feedback, demonstrating attentional modulation of sensitivity.

    Title: 
    Abstract: A comprehensive census of McrBC systems, among the most common forms of prokaryotic Type IV restriction systems, followed by phylogenetic analysis, reveals their enormous abundance in diverse prokaryotes and a plethora of genomic associations. We focus on a previously uncharacterized branch, which we denote coiled-coil nuclease tandems ( CoCoNuTs ) for their salient features: the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases. The CoCoNuTs alone show extraordinary variety, with three distinct types and multiple subtypes. All CoCoNuTs contain domains predicted to interact with translation system components, such as OB-folds resembling the SmpB protein that binds bacterial transfer-messenger RNA ( tmRNA ), YTH-like domains that might recognize methylated tmRNA, tRNA, or rRNA, and RNA-binding Hsp70 chaperone homologs, along with RNases, such as HEPN domains, all suggesting that the CoCoNuTs target RNA. Many CoCoNuTs might additionally target DNA, via McrC nuclease homologs. Additional restriction systems, such as Type I RM, BREX, and Druantia Type III, are frequently encoded in the same predicted superoperons. In many of these superoperons, CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides, possibly, RNA fragments with cyclic termini, that bind associated CARF ( CRISPR-Associated Rossmann Fold ) domains. We hypothesize that the CoCoNuTs, together with the ancillary restriction factors, employ an echeloned defense strategy analogous to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems, in which an immune response eliminating virus DNA and/or RNA is launched first, but then, if it fails, an abortive infection response leading to PCD/dormancy via host RNA cleavage takes over.

   . In these complex configurations of the CoCoNuT genome neighborhoods ( Figure 8 ), the gene order is likely to be important, with Type I RM almost always directly following CARF genes and CoCoNuTs typically coming last, although Druantia Type III sometimes follows the CoCoNuT. As translation in bacteria is co-transcriptional, the products of genes transcribed first would accumulate before those of the genes transcribed last, so that the full, potentially suicidal impact of the CoCoNuT predicted RNA nucleolytic engine would only be felt after the associated DNA restriction systems had ample time to act – and possibly, fail ( Irastortza-olaziregi and Amster-choder, 2020 ). In recent years, systematic searches for defense systems in prokaryotes, primarily by analysis of defense islands, revealed enormous, previously unsuspected diversity of such systems that function through a remarkable variety of molecular mechanisms. In this work, we uncovered the hidden diversity and striking hierarchical complexity of a distinct class of defense mechanisms, the Type IV ( McrBC ) restriction systems. We then zeroed in on a single major but previously overlooked branch of the McrBC systems, which we denoted CoCoNuTs for their salient features, namely, the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases. Astounding complexity was discovered at this level as well, with three distinct types and multiple subtypes of CoCoNuTs that differ by their domain compositions and genomic associations. All CoCoNuTs contain domains capable of interacting with translation system components, such as the SmpB-like OB-fold, Hsp70 homologs, or YTH domains, along with RNases, such as HEPN, suggesting that at least one of the activities of these systems targets RNA

. Often, one or two CSDs, generally RNA-binding domains, although capable of binding ssDNA, are fused to Type III-A CnuC homologs as well ( Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplements 1 and 4, Supplementary file 1; Heinemann and Roske, 2021 ). RNA targeting capability of Types III-B and III-C can perhaps be inferred from their similarity to Type III-A in encoding CnuD Hsp70-like proteins. Moreover, higher-order associations of Type II and Type III-A CoCoNuT systems with various DNA restriction systems suggest a two-pronged DNA and RNA restriction strategy reminiscent of Type III CRISPR-Cas ( see below ). We suspect that RNA targeting is an ancestral feature of the CoCoNuT systems. Several observations are compatible with these hypotheses: We observed even greater levels of complexity in Type III-A CoCoNuTs, which might ultimately beget another level of classification, where the TerY-related VWA domains were duplicated. In each of the three subtypes of Type III-A, a different ATPase was inserted between these VWA domains into the predicted operon. In these systems, the Mg2+-coordinating MIDAS motif ( DxSxS…T... D ) is perfectly conserved in the VWA domain encoded at the 5′ end of the operon, which resembles the domains found in systems with only one VWA domain, whereas the internal VWA domain lacks the middle threonine and is slightly shorter ( Figure 7, Supplementary file 1; Lacy et al., 2004 ). In the first two of these Type III-A subtypes shown in Figure 7, a CARF ( CRISPR-Associated Rossmann Fold ) domain-containing protein is encoded, with two distinct CARF domains encompassing different RING nuclease motifs. These CARF domains are fused at the C-terminus to a D-ExK nuclease domain, an architecture suggestive of a PCD/dormancy-eliciting antiphage effector ( Supplementary file 1; Makarova et al., 2014; Makarova et al., 2020a )

., 2003 ). The N-terminal OB-folds in Type II and III-A CnuH homologs also resemble prokaryotic HIRAN domains, which are uncharacterized, but have eukaryotic homologs fused to helicases that bind ssDNA ( Figure 6—figure supplement 5; Chavez et al., 2018 ). These HIRAN domains, however, do not overlay with the CoCoNuT domains any better than SmpB ( Figure 6—figure supplement 5 ), lack a small helix that SmpB and the CoCoNuT domains share, and likely being DNA-binding, do not fit the other pieces of evidence we gathered that all suggest an RNA-binding role for this domain in the CoCoNuTs ( see below ). The Type II and Type III-A CoCoNuT CnuH helicases contain an additional domain, structurally similar to the RelE/Colicin D RNase fold ( Gucinski et al., 2019 ), which we denote RNase toxin-like ( RTL ), located between the SPB OB-fold and the helicase ( Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement 1, Supplementary file 1 ). The proteins of this family are ribosome-dependent toxins that cleave either mRNA or tRNA in the ribosomal A-site ( Pedersen et al., 2003 ). This domain was identified by structural similarity search with the AF2 models, but no sequence conservation with characterized members of this family was detected, leaving it uncertain whether the RTL domain is an active nuclease. However, considerable divergence in sequence is not unusual in this toxin family ( Guglielmini and Van Melderen, 2011; Goeders et al., 2013 ). In Type III-B CoCoNuTs, a wHTH domain resembling the archaeal ssDNA-binding protein Sul7s is fused to the CnuH N-termini ( Figure 6, Supplementary file 1 ). We searched for additional homologs of CnuH ( see ‘Methods’ )

., 2012 ). Given the context of extensive, high-probability coiled-coils in other components of the CoCoNuT systems with which they might interact, we chose to report these CnuE regions as coiled-coils, despite the comparative weakness of these predictions. In the AF2 multimer model of CnuHE, one of these potential coiled-coils is positioned near the coiled-coils detected in CnuH, suggesting they may facilitate interaction between these two factors. A comprehensive search and phylogenetic analysis of this family was beyond the scope of this work, but to determine the relationships between the CoCoNuTs and the rest of the UPF1-like helicases, we used the following procedure. We retrieved the best 2000 hits in each of two searches with UPF1 and CoCoNuT helicases as queries against both a database containing predicted proteins from 24, 757 completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes downloaded from the NCBI GenBank in November 2021 and a database containing 72 representative eukaryotic genomes that were downloaded from the NCBI GenBank in June 2020. Next, we combined all proteins from the four searches, made a nonredundant set, and annotated them using CDD profiles, as described above. Then, we aligned them with MUSCLE v5 ( Edgar, 2022 ), constructed an approximately maximum-likelihood tree with FastTree, and mapped the annotations onto the tree. Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis of the UP1 helicases and CoNu helicases revealed that the UP1 helicases form a monophyletic clade with the CoNu helases ( Figure 9 ). The CoNu helicases, however, do not form a monophyle clade with the rest of the UP1-like helicases ( Figure 9 ). This suggests that the CoNu helases diverged from the rest of the UP1 helicases after the UP1 helases diverged from the rest of the UP1-like helases. The phylogenetic tree also suggests that the CoNu helases are more closely related to the UP1 helases than to the rest of the UP-like helases. This is consistent with our hypothesis that the CoNu helases evolved from the UP1 helases. The phylogenetic tree also suggests that the CoNu helases are more closely related to the UP helases than the rest of the UP-like helases. This is consistent with our hypothesis that the Nu helases evolved from the UP helases. The phylogenetic tree also suggests that the Nu helases are more related to the helases than the rest the helases. This is consistent with our hypothesis that the hel evolved from the hel. The phylogenetic tree suggests that the hel are more related to the hel than the hel. This is consistent with our hypothesis that evolved from the.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Calcineurin is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase with diverse functions. Inhibition of calcineurin is known to enhance the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans through multiple signaling pathways. Aiming to study the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity, we discover that calcineurin is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program ( DMP ) in C. elegans. Calcineurin inhibition leads to defects in the DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. We demonstrate that intestinal bloating caused by calcineurin inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition. Finally, we show that the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for the increased lifespan. Our studies uncover a role for calcineurin in the C. elegans DMP and provide a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension.

    We discovered that calcineurin is required for the C. elegans DMP. Calcineurin activity is regulated by intracellular calcium levels. Increased amounts of calcium ions activate the phosphatase activity of calcineurin via the binding of the calcium-sensing protein calmodulin to calcineurin ( Klee et al., 1998 ). The rhythmic DMP cycle in C. elegans is known to be regulated by rhythmic calcium waves ( Dal Santo et al., 1999; Teramoto and Iwasaki, 2006 ). The calcium waves are regulated by the endoplasmic reticulum calcium channel, ITR-1, and mutations in the itr-1 gene affect defecation by preventing cytoplasmic calcium release ( Dal Santo et al., 1999 ). It is likely that calcium waves regulate DMP via calcineurin activities. Indeed, calcineurin is expressed in the enteric muscles that are required for contractions for DMP ( Lee et al., 2005 ). It is interesting to note that tax-6 gain-of-function mutants are also known to have DMP defects ( Lee et al., 2005 ). Therefore, optimum calcineurin activity appears to be crucial for maintaining a rhythmic DMP. Calcineurin inhibition has been shown to extend C. elegans lifespan via multiple mechanisms ( Dong et al., 2007; Dwivedi et al., 2009; Mair et al., 2011; Tao et al., 2013 ). Activation of autophagy has been shown to be one of the mechanisms of extended lifespan upon calcineurin inhibition ( Dwivedi et al., 2009 ). We showed that defects in the DMP caused by calcineurin inhibition reduce lipid levels and mimic calorie restriction. Calorie restriction is known to induce autophagy ( Morselli et al., 2010 ), and autophagy is required for calorie restriction-mediated lifespan extension ( Hansen et al., 2008; Jia and Levine, 2007 ). Therefore, it is likely that reduced lipid levels because of intestinal bloating result in the activation of autophagy upon calcineurin inhibition

. Dephosphorylation of substrate proteins by calcineurin affects several cellular pathways, including transcriptional signaling programs ( Ulengin-Talkish and Cyert, 2023 ). Calcineurin regulates the activity of the transcription factors of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) family ( Hogan et al., 2003 ). Dephosphorylation of NFATs by calcineurin triggers their nuclear localization and activates immune responses in vertebrates ( Herbst et al., 2015; Hogan et al., 2003; Vandewalle et al., 2014 ). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, calcineurin regulates thermotaxis, body size, fertility, and lifespan ( Bandyopadhyay et al., 2002; Dong et al., 2007; Kuhara et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2013 ). Knockdown of the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, tax-6, is known to enhance C. elegans lifespan via multiple pathways, including autophagy and CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivators ( CRTCs; Dong et al., 2007; Dwivedi et al., 2009; Mair et al., 2011; Tao et al., 2013 ). However, the role of calcineurin in regulating C. elegans response to pathogen infections has not been studied. Because C. elegans lacks the NFAT transcription factors ( Song et al., 2013 ), it will be intriguing to study how calcineurin inhibition impacts C. elegans innate immunity. These studies could also shed some light on the complex interplay between lifespan and immunity. In this study, we examined the effect of calcineurin inhibition on C. elegans innate immunity. Surprisingly, we found that the knockdown of tax-6 enhanced the susceptibility of C. elegans to bacterial infection despite enhancing lifespan. We discovered that tax-6 is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program ( DMP ). The knockdown of tax-6 resulted in intestinal bloating due to defects in the DMP, which enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infection by increasing gut colonization by bacteria

. Intestinal bloating resulted in calorie restriction-like phenotypes, including reduced lipid levels, and led to increased lifespan. We discovered that the TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for calcineurin inhibition-mediated lifespan extension. Moreover, we found that the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for increased lifespan. Our studies uncover a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension.

. Knockdown of these genes also increased nhr-8 mRNA levels ( Figure 5H ), indicating that intestinal bloating induces nhr-8 upregulation. Thus, calcineurin inhibition likely enhances lifespan via NHR-8 by increasing its expression. Given that HLH-30 and NHR-8 are essential for lifespan extension upon calcineurin inhibition, we investigated whether these pathways also influence survival in response to P. aeruginosa infection following calcineurin knockdown. Both hlh-30 ( tm1978 ) and nhr-8 ( ok186 ) animals showed significantly reduced survival upon tax-6 RNAi ( Figure 6A and B ). These findings suggested that the reduced survival on P. aeruginosa following calcineurin inhibition is independent of HLH-30 and NHR-8 and is more likely due to increased gut colonization by P. aeruginosa resulting from DMP defects ( Figure 6C ).

. Knockdown of these genes causes complete disruption of DMP rhythmicity, increasing gut colonization by P. aeruginosa ( Singh and Aballay, 2019b ). Overall, these findings demonstrated that calcineurin is crucial for maintaining the DMP ultradian clock, and its inhibition increases susceptibility to P. aeruginosa by disrupting the DMP. Defects in the C. elegans DMP lead to reduced nutrient absorption, resulting in decreased intestinal fat levels ( Sheng et al., 2015 ). We investigated whether tax-6 knockdown similarly reduces fat levels. To test this, we performed oil-red-O ( ORO ) staining on tax-6 RNAi animals. The knockdown of tax-6 significantly reduced fat levels ( Figure 4A and B ). Next, we examined whether the reduced fat levels in tax-6 knockdown animals mimic calorie restriction-like phenotypes. Calorie restriction is known to upregulate the expression of the FoxA transcription factor PHA-4 ( Panowski et al., 2007 ). Consistent with this, tax-6 knockdown also resulted in the upregulation of pha-4 expression levels ( Figure 4C ). Because calorie restriction enhances lifespan ( Kaeberlein et al., 2006; Lakowski and Hekimi, 1998; Panowski et al., 2007 ), we explored whether calcineurin inhibition could similarly increase lifespan through calorie restriction mechanisms. The knockdown of tax-6 in the genetic model of calorie restriction, eat-2 ( ad465 ) ( Lakowski and Hekimi, 1998 ), did not increase the lifespan ( Figure 4D ). Since eat-2 ( ad465 ) animals consume fewer bacteria, it is possible that their feeding-based RNAi efficiency is reduced, leading to a lack of responsiveness to tax-6 RNAi. To assess RNAi efficiency in eat-2 ( ad465 ) animals, we exposed them to act-5 and bli-3 RNAi, which are known to cause developmental arrest and a blistered cuticle, respectively ( Gahlot and Singh, 2024 )

Calcineur is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threon protein phosphatase with diverse functions. Inhibition of calcineur is known to enhance the lifespan of Caenorhabitis elegans through multiple pathways. To study the role of calcine in regulating immunity, we discovered that calcine is required for the rhythmic defation program (DMP) in C. elegans. Calcine inhibition leads to defects in D, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to infection. Intestinal bloating caused by calcine inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The TF ortholog, HL-30, is required for calcine-mediated lifespan extension. The nuclear receptor, N-8, is upregulated by calcine inhibition and necessary for increased lifespan. Our studies uncover a role for calcine in C. elegans DMP and provide a mechanism for calcine inhibition-mediated extension.

Calcine activity is regulated by intracellular calcium levels. Increased calcium ions activate the phosphatase activity of calcine via binding the calcium-sensing protein calmod to calcine. The rhythmic D cycle in C elegans is regulated by rhythmic waves. The waves are regulated by the endoplasmic reticulum channel, I-1, and mutations in the itr- gene affect defec by preventing cytoplasmic release. It is likely that waves regulate D via calcine activities. Calcine is expressed in enteric muscles required for contractions D. Tax- gain-function mutants also have D defects. Optimum calcine activity is crucial for maintaining rhythmic D.

Calcine inhibition has extended C eleg lifespan via multiple mechanisms. Activation autagy has been shown to be one of the mechanisms extended upon calcine inhibition. Defects in D caused by calcine reduce lipid levels mimic calorie restriction. Calorie is known to induce autagy, and autagy required for restriction lifespan extension. Reduced lipid levels intestinal blo result in activation autagy upon calcine inhibition. Dephosphorylation substrate by calcine affects several pathways, including transcriptional programs. Calcine regulates the activity of transcription factors NFAT family. Deposphory NFs calcine triggers nuclear and activates immune responses in vertebrates. In nemat Caenorhabitis, calc regulates thermaxis, size, fertility, and lifespan.
Researchers investigated how the brain represents and resolves conflicts between task-relevant and task-irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior. They proposed that conflicts can be parameterized and represented as points in a low-dimensional cognitive space, which can be resolved by a limited set of cognitive processes working along dimensions. This leads to the hypothesis that similar conflicts in sources are represented similarly in the space. A task was designed with five types of conflicts that could be conceptually parameterized. Human performance and fMRI patterns in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex supported that different types of conflicts are organized based on similarity, suggesting cognitive space as a principle for representing conflicts.

The study aimed to test the geometry of cognitive space representation in conflict. It hypothesized that types of conflicts are represented as points in cognitive space, and the distance between points reflects the geometry of space scales the difference in sources of conflicts. Dimensions in the space can be domains, which domain-specific control processes are defined. A type of conflict's location in space can be parameterized by coordinates reflecting control needed for each domain control. The space can represent types with low dimensionality and domains conjunct in a single space to achieve domain control from different sources can be resolved using same processes.

The space may be located in the frontopetal network due to its roles in conflict resolution and abstract representation. The paradigm was adjusted from a previous study to define conflict based on combinations of sources, such as spatial-Stop and Simon, from evidence that sources undergo independent processing. Identifying sources is critical in resolving diverse conflicts. If conflicts are organized in space, similarity between types should be reflected in behavior and neural representations. Data from two experiments supported predictions: behavioral influence of congrency increased with similarity between trials, and fMRI showed multivariate similarity in right dlFC.

The study provides evidence for geometry of space representing conflicts in control. Future research should examine space's dimension, applicability to tasks, and relevance to abilities. The finding suggests control can be encoded in dlFC and guides goal behavior, reconciling domain-general and domain views of control and providing a framework for representing multiple settings.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most cases of preterm birth occur spontaneously and result from preterm labor with intact ( spontaneous preterm labor [sPTL] ) or ruptured ( preterm prelabor rupture of membranes [PPROM] ) membranes. The prediction of spontaneous preterm birth ( sPTB ) remains underpowered due to its syndromic nature and the dearth of independent analyses of the vaginal host immune response. Thus, we conducted the largest longitudinal investigation targeting vaginal immune mediators, referred to herein as the immunoproteome, in a population at high risk for sPTB. Vaginal swabs were collected across gestation from pregnant women who ultimately underwent term birth, sPTL, or PPROM. Cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides in the samples were quantified via specific and sensitive immunoassays. Predictive models were constructed from immune mediator concentrations. Throughout uncomplicated gestation, the vaginal immunoproteome harbors a cytokine network with a homeostatic profile. Yet, the vaginal immunoproteome is skewed toward a pro-inflammatory state in pregnant women who ultimately experience sPTL and PPROM. Such an inflammatory profile includes increased monocyte chemoattractants, cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation, and reduced antimicrobial proteins/peptides. The vaginal immunoproteome has improved predictive value over maternal characteristics alone for identifying women at risk for early ( <34 weeks ) sPTB. The vaginal immunoproteome undergoes homeostatic changes throughout gestation and deviations from this shift are associated with sPTB. Furthermore, the vaginal immunoproteome can be leveraged as a potential biomarker for early sPTB, a subset of sPTB associated with extremely adverse neonatal outcomes. This research was conducted by the Perinatology Research Branch, Division of Obstetrics and Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Division of Intramural Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services ( NICHD/NIH/DHHS ) under contract HHSN275201300006C. ALT, KRT, and NGL were supported by the Wayne State University Perinatal Initiative in Maternal, Perinatal and Child Health.

   . Together, these findings suggest that the vaginal cytokine network in normal pregnancy is modestly modulated during gestation, which prompted us to investigate whether a deviation from these changes occurs in women who ultimately undergo sPTB. To interrogate whether alterations in the vaginal immunoproteome are observed in women destined to undergo sPTB, immune mediator data were quantified in vaginal swabs collected longitudinally from early to late gestation ( in the interval of 8–37 weeks ) from women who ultimately delivered term or preterm. Linear mixed effects modeling controlling for gestational age at sampling, maternal age, BMI, parity, and history of preterm birth was used to compare the concentrations of immune mediators between cases and controls ( Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 3—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Figure 3—source data 1, Figure 4—source data 1, Figure 5—source data 1 ). Using the same immune mediator categories defined previously, we first looked at the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, IL-16, CXCL8, TNF, IFN-γ, IL-1α, and LT-α. Notably, two pro-inflammatory cytokines that have been considered master regulators of parturition, IL-6 ( Romero et al., 2006a; Robertson et al., 2010; Gomez‐Lopez et al., 2016 ) and IL-1β ( Romero et al., 1989; Romero et al., 1992a ), were increased in women who ultimately experienced sPTB compared to those who delivered at term ( Figure 3A and B ). Next, we divided cases of sPTB into sPTL and PPROM, as prior studies have suggested that there are distinct mechanisms of disease for PPROM and sPTL ( Goldenberg et al., 2008; Romero et al., 2014a ). We observed that IL-6 and IL-1β were increased in both sPTB subsets compared to women who delivered at term ( Figure 3A and B ). As early and late preterm birth have differing pathophysiology ( Goldenberg et al

. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the vaginal immunoproteome analyzed during the second trimester can generate noninvasive biomarkers with potential predictive value for early preterm birth cases, although the clinical utility of such models needs to be investigated further. Regardless, these data show that the vaginal immunoproteome has improved predictive value over maternal characteristics alone for a subset of early sPTB, highlighting that vaginal immune mediator changes in a subset of preterm birth are attributable to factors other than maternal characteristics.

. Therefore, as a proof of concept, we next evaluated whether the vaginal immunoproteome could serve to generate noninvasive biomarkers for preterm birth subsets with improved predictive value over maternal clinical and demographic information. Random forest modeling of the vaginal immunoproteome was used to establish a predictive tool for sPTB and its subtypes. First, using the last sample taken before 28 weeks of gestation, predictive models were created for sPTB subsets, resulting in delivery after 28 weeks: all sPTB cases ( Figure 7A ), all sPTL cases ( Figure 7B ), sPTL cases delivered before 34 weeks of gestation ( sPTL <34 or early sPTL ) ( Figure 7C ), all PPROM cases ( Figure 7D ), and PPROM cases delivered before 34 weeks of gestation ( PPROM <34 or early PPROM ) ( Figure 7E ). When considering the vaginal concentrations of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and defensins without including maternal characteristics ( black line ), the vaginal immunoproteome has the highest potential predictive value for early PPROM <34 ( area under the curve [AUC] = 0. 787 ) ( Figure 7E ), with the two most informative immune mediators for the prediction of early PPROM being VEGF and IL-1β. Importantly, limiting inclusion in our model to only the five most significant immunoproteins from a univariate analysis for early PPROM would have resulted in similar performance [AUC = 0. 701 ( 0. 6–0. 802 ) ]. Nonetheless, the combination of all analytes determined in the vaginal fluid resulted in a model with a lower predictive strength for early sPTL <34 ( AUC = 0. 637 ) ( Figure 7C ) compared to early PPROM. For early sPTL, concentrations of IL-1β, IL-16, and IL-13 were most informative

., 2021; Kumar et al., 2021 ). Nonetheless, an extensive interrogation of the vaginal soluble immune response ( i. e., the vaginal immunoproteome ), with consideration of the distinction between sPTL and PPROM cases, has not been undertaken. Herein, we conducted the largest assessment, based on the study’s scale, longitudinal nature, and depth of immunological mediators evaluated, of the vaginal immunoproteome during uncomplicated and complicated pregnancies. Importantly, our determinations were performed in vaginal samples collected during all three trimesters and considered sPTB, including its two subsets ( i. e., sPTL and PPROM ), as well as the timing of delivery ( i. e., early and late sPTB ). Furthermore, the immunological mediators evaluated were selected for their relevance to key biological processes in the vaginal ecosystem. Additionally, we used machine learning approaches and cross-validation to generate and assess predictive models for sPTL and PPROM in our high-risk population.

This study represents the largest ( N = 739 women, n = 2819 samples ) and most comprehensive ( 31 immune mediators ) profiling of the soluble immune response in vaginal fluid throughout well-characterized pregnancies that culminated in the delivery of a term neonate ( controls ) or those that resulted in sPTB ( sPTL and PPROM cases ) ( Figure 1A ). Specifically, we enrolled pregnant women from whom vaginal swabs were collected at different points throughout gestation. Patients were followed until delivery, after which we selected women who underwent sPTL or PPROM with delivery before 37 weeks of gestation ( preterm birth ) and women with a normal term delivery as controls ( matched by gestational age at sampling at a 2:1 ratio ). All patients had a singleton pregnancy without fetal anomalies and had at least three vaginal samples available. Patients were classified into three study groups according to pregnancy outcome and diagnosis: ( i ) women who delivered at term ( 494 patients, 1907 samples ) ; ( ii ) women who underwent sPTL ( 140 patients, 521 samples ) ; and ( iii ) women who experienced PPROM ( 105 patients, 391 samples ) ( Figure 1A ). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Wayne State University and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Vaginal swabs were analyzed for cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides via specific and sensitive immunoassays. Predictive models were constructed from immune mediator concentrations throughout uncomplicated gestation the immunrote harbors a cytok network with homeostatic profile. The immunrote is skewed toward a pro-inflammatory in women who experience sL and PP such profile includes increased monocyte chemoatants, cytokines indicative macrophage and T-cell activation and reduced antimicrobial/peptides. The immunrote has predictive value over maternal alone for women at risk early sPT < weeks. The immunrote undergoes changes throughout gestation and deviations from this are associated with sB. The immun can be leveraged as potential biomarker for sB a subset associated with adverse neonatal outcomes.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The function of the smooth muscle cells lining the walls of mammalian systemic arteries and arterioles is to regulate the diameter of the vessels to control blood flow and blood pressure. Here, we describe an in silico model, which we call the ‘Hernandez–Hernandez model’, of electrical and Ca2+ signaling in arterial myocytes based on new experimental data indicating sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes from murine resistance arteries. The model suggests the fundamental ionic mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ signaling during the development of myogenic tone in arterial blood vessels. Although experimental data suggest that KV1. 5 channel currents have similar amplitudes, kinetics, and voltage dependencies in male and female myocytes, simulations suggest that the KV1. 5 current is the dominant current regulating membrane potential in male myocytes. In female cells, which have larger KV2. 1 channel expression and longer time constants for activation than male myocytes, predictions from simulated female myocytes suggest that KV2. 1 plays a primary role in the control of membrane potential. Over the physiological range of membrane potentials, the gating of a small number of voltage-gated K+ channels and L-type Ca2+ channels are predicted to drive sex-specific differences in intracellular Ca2+ and excitability. We also show that in an idealized computational model of a vessel, female arterial smooth muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to commonly used Ca2+ channel blockers compared to male. In summary, we present a new model framework to investigate the potential sex-specific impact of antihypertensive drugs.

   ., 2002; Amberg et al., 2004 ). A recent study by O’Dwyer et al., 2020 suggested that KV2. 1 channels have dual conducting and structural roles in mesenteric artery smooth muscle with opposing functional consequences. Conductive KV2. 1 channels oppose vasoconstriction by inducing membrane hyperpolarization. Paradoxically, by promoting the structural clustering of the CaV1. 2 channel, KV2. 1 enhances Ca2+ influx and induces vasoconstriction. Interestingly, KV2. 1 protein is expressed to a larger extent in female than in male arterial smooth muscle. This induced larger CaV1. 2 clusters and activity in female than in male arterial myocytes. Here, we describe a new model, which we call the ‘Hernandez–Hernandez model’, of mesenteric smooth muscle myocytes that incorporates new electrophysiological and Ca2+ signaling data suggesting key sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes. The model simulates membrane currents and their impact on membrane potential as well as local and global [Ca2+]i signaling in male and female myocytes. The Hernandez–Hernandez model predicts that KV2. 1 channels play a critical, unexpectedly large role in the control of membrane potential in female myocytes compared to male myocytes. Importantly, our model predicts that clinically used antihypertensive CaV1. 2 channel blockers cause larger reductions in CaV1. 2 currents in female than in male arterial myocytes. Finally, we present a one-dimensional ( 1D ) vessel representation of electrotonically coupled arterial myocytes connected in series. Predictions from the idealized vessel suggest that Ca2+ channel blockers are more potent in females, resulting in a more substantial [Ca2+]i reduction in female arterial smooth muscle compared to male. The Hernandez–Hernandez model demonstrates the importance of sex-specific differences in CaV1. 2 and KV2

. 2 channels produced a current of 0. 5 pA. However, in female simulations ( Figure 7D ), we observed that at a steady membrane potential of –40 mV, L-type calcium CaV1. 2 channels produced a current of 0. 65 pA. We calculated that at –40 mV, two CaV1. 2 channels are needed to sustain 0. 5 pA of current in male myocytes while three CaV1. 2 channels are needed to sustain 0. 65 pA of current in female myocytes. Although the sex-specific differences in male and female simulations at –40 mV are small, a 15 nM difference in the overall response of [Ca2+]i can have a profound effect on the constriction state of the myocytes. The predictions from the Hernandez–Hernandez model provide a comprehensive picture of physiological conditions and support the idea that a small number of CaV1. 2 channels supply the steady Ca2+ influx needed to support a maintained constricted state in small arteries and arterioles ( Fleischmann et al., 1994; Rubart et al., 1996 ). The differences between males and females are notable in the context of observations indicating varied sex-based responses to antihypertensive agents that target the Ca2+ handling system in vascular smooth muscle cells. Next, we simulated the effects of calcium channel blocker nifedipine on ICa at a steady membrane potential of –40 mV in male and female simulations. Briefly, previous studies Davis et al., 1992 have shown that at the therapeutic dose of nifedipine ( i. e., about 0. 1 μM ) L-type Cav1. 2 channel currents are reduced by about 60–70%. Accordingly, we decreased ICa in our mathematical simulations by the same extent. In Figure 7C and D, we show the predicted male ( gray ) and female ( pink ) time course of membrane voltage at –40 mV ( top panel ), ICa ( middle panel ), and [Ca2+]i ( lower panel ). First, we observed that in both male and females 0

. The Hernandez–Hernandez model of the isolated mesenteric vascular myocyte was informed and validated with experimental data from male and female vascular myocytes. We then used the model to reveal sex-specific mechanisms of KV2. 1 and CaV1. 2 channels in controlling membrane potential and Ca2+ dynamics. In doing so, we predicted that very few channels are needed to contribute to and sustain the oscillatory behavior of the membrane potential and calcium signaling. We expanded our computational framework to include a 1D tissue representation, providing a basis for simulating the effect of drug effects within a vessel. The model predictions suggested differences in the response of male and female myocytes to drugs and the underlying mechanisms for those differences. These predictions may constitute the first step toward better hypertensive therapy for males and females.

Our primary objective was to develop and implement a novel computational model that comprehensively describes the essential mechanisms underlying electrical activity and Ca2+ dynamics in arterial myocytes. We aimed to uncover the key components necessary and sufficient to fully understand the behavior of arterial vascular smooth muscle myocytes and the cellular response to variations in pressure. The model represents the first-ever integration of sex-specific variations in voltage-gated KV2. 1 and CaV1. 2 channels, enabling the prediction of sex-specific disparities in membrane potential and the regulation of Ca2+ signaling in smooth muscle cells from systemic arteries. To further investigate sex-specific responses to antihypertensive medications, we extended our investigation to include a one-dimensional ( 1D ) representation of tissue. This approach enabled us to simulate and forecast the effects of Ca2+ channel blockers within the controlled environment of an idealized mesenteric vessel. It is worth noting that this computational framework can be expanded to predict the consequences of antihypertensive drugs and other perturbations, transitioning seamlessly from single-cell to tissue-level simulations. Previous mathematical models ( Jacobsen et al., 2007; Kapela et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2003; Parthimos et al., 1999 ) of vascular smooth muscle myocytes generated to describe the membrane potential and Ca2+ signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells have described the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) by endogenous or pharmacological vasoactive agents activating inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate ( IP3 ) and ryanodine ( RyR ) receptors, resulting in the initiation of calcium waves. Earlier models have also provided insights into the contraction activation by agonists and the behavior of vasomotion

The model presented here describes the necessary and sufficient ion channels, pumps, and transporters to describe the electrical activity and Ca2+ signaling of an isolated mesenteric smooth muscle cell in the absence of complex signaling pathways. Such an approach enabled us to perform a component dissection to analyze the sex-specific differences observed in the fundamental electrophysiology of male and female myocytes. However, it is well known that vascular smooth muscle cells are subject to a plethora of stimuli from endothelial cells, neurotransmitters, endocrine, and paracrine signals ( Karlin, 2015 ). The next phase of the project includes an expansion of the model to incorporate receptor-mediated signaling pathways that are essential for blood pressure control. Excitation–contraction coupling refers to an electrical stimulus that drives the release of calcium from the SR and results in the physical translocation of fibers that underlie muscle contraction. In the present model, we did not explicitly consider the mechanical description of muscle contraction. Nevertheless, we can imply contractile effects by tracking membrane potential and the elevation of [Ca2+]i as a proxy. To conclude, we developed and present the Hernandez–Hern model of mesenteric smooth muscle myocytes that incorporates sex-specific differences in electrophysiology and Ca+ signaling. The model simulates membrane currents and their impact on membrane potential as well as local and global [Ca+] signaling in male and female myocytes. The Hernandez–Hern model predicts that KV.1 channels play a critical role in the control of membrane potential in female myocytes compared to maleocytes. Importantly, our model predicts clinically used antihypensive Ca2 channel blockers cause larger reductions in Ca2 currents in female than male myocytes. Finally, we present a one-dimensional 1 representation of electrotonically coupled myocytes in series. Predictions from the ideal vessel suggest Ca+ blockers are more potent in females, resulting in substantial [Ca+ reduction in female smooth muscle compared to male. The Hernandez–ern model demonstrates the importance of sex differences in Ca2 and KV channels.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Litter decomposition is expected to be positively associated with precipitation despite evidence that decomposers of varying sizes have different moisture dependencies. We hypothesized that higher tolerance of macro-decomposers to aridity may counterbalance the effect of smaller decomposers, leading to similar decomposition rates across climatic gradients. We tested this hypothesis by placing plant litter baskets of different mesh sizes in seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient, and by characterizing the macro-decomposer assemblages using pitfall trapping. We found that decomposers responded differently to precipitation levels based on their size. Microbial decomposition increased with precipitation in the winter while macro-decomposition peaked in arid sites during the summer. This led to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient except in hyper-arid sites. Macro-decomposer richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in arid environments. Our findings highlight the importance of macro-decomposition in arid-lands, possibly resolving the dryland decomposition conundrum, and emphasizing the need to contemplate decomposer size when investigating zoogeochemical processes.

    Our goal was to investigate how climate interacts with soil biota of different size categories to influence litter decomposition. We used litter baskets of different mesh sizes that were placed along a sharp precipitation gradient during hot–dry summer and again during colder–wetter winter. Our results suggest that decomposers respond differently to precipitation levels based on their size, leading to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient, except in hyper-arid sites. We found that microbial decomposition was minimal during the summer. In the winter, microbial decomposition was positively associated with precipitation, governing the whole-community decomposition. In both seasons, mesofaunal decomposition was moderate and followed a hump-shaped response to precipitation, peaking in semiarid sites. Macro-decomposition contributed minimally to whole-community decomposition during the winter, but during the summer dominated decomposition in the two arid sites. Using pitfall trapping, we found that macro-decomposer richness, abundance, and biomass followed a hump-shaped response to precipitation, peaking in arid environments. The puzzle of why plant litter decomposition in arid-lands is decoupled from annual precipitation and is faster than expected based on microbial decomposition models has bothered scientists for half a century ( Meentemeyer, 1978; Noy-Meir, 1974; Whitford et al., 1981 ), and was later termed the dryland decomposition conundrum ( Throop and Archer, 2009 ). Attempts to resolve this conundrum have focused predominantly on abiotic weathering agents, such as photodegradation ( Austin and Vivanco, 2006; Austin, 2011 ) and thermal degradation ( Day et al., 2019 ), alternative sources of moisture such as fog, dew, and atmospheric water vapor ( Evans et al., 2020 ) and soil–litter mixing ( Throop and Archer, 2009; Throop and Belnap, 2019 )

. In these environments, the extreme climatic conditions and scarce and unpredictable plant litter availability may limit macro-decomposer populations, diminishing macro-decomposition rates with increasing aridity. Consequently, and in sharp contrast to smaller organisms, macro-decomposition should follow a hump-shaped response to precipitation that peaks in arid ecosystems ( Figure 1 ). To test this novel hypothesis, we examined the climate dependency of plant litter decomposition by microorganisms, meso-decomposers, and macro-decomposers along a sharp aridity gradient spanning from mean annual precipitation ( MAP ) of 22–526 mm. This gradient represents hyper-arid, arid, semiarid, and dry sub-humid Mediterranean climates ( Table 1, Figure 2A ). We repeated the experiment during hot summer with no precipitation and again during cooler and wetter winter. We hypothesized that both microbial and mesofaunal decomposition should increase with increasing precipitation during the winter, but during the dry summer contribute only minimally to plant litter decomposition across the aridity gradient. In the dry summer, macrofaunal decomposition should follow a hump-shaped response to precipitation, increasing from hyper-arid to arid sites and decreasing gradually in more mesic semiarid and Mediterranean sites. We also predicted that the opposing climatic dependencies of macrofauna and microorganisms and mesofauna should lead to similar overall decomposition rates across the precipitation gradient except in the hyper-arid sites in which decomposers activity is predicted to be minimal regardless of organism size ( Figure 1 ). To reveal the mechanism, we sampled macro-decomposers across the aridity gradient and the two seasons, using pitfall traps. We predicted hump-shaped relationships between precipitation and the abundance, richness, and biomass of macro-decomposers that peak in arid ecosystems.

. We, in turn, hypothesized that the opposing climatic dependencies of macrofauna and that of microorganisms and mesofauna should lead to similar overall decomposition rates across precipitation gradients, except in hyper-arid environments in which decomposers activity is predicted to be minimal regardless of organism size. Our results largely agree with this hypothesis. Whole-community decomposition was minimal in hyper-arid sites in both summer and winter. In the winter, microbial decomposition dominated the whole-community decomposition, demonstrating a positive response to precipitation that reached a maximum in the most mesic Mediterranean site. In contrast, macro-decomposition has contributed only little to the whole-community decomposition during the winter, but dominated the arid sites’ decomposition in the summer. These findings supported the long-suggested but largely overlooked hypothesis that macro-decomposition governs plant litter decomposition in deserts ( Meentemeyer, 1978; Noy-Meir, 1974; Whitford et al., 1981 ). The opposing climatic dependencies of micro- and macro-decomposers have led to similar or even higher annual decomposition rates in arid sites compared to those measured in more mesic sites. Consequently, we highlighted that differential climatic dependencies of different-sized decomposers rather than abiotic factors explain the discrepancy between classic decomposition models and the observed decomposition rates in drylands. This realization provided a plausible resolution to the longstanding dryland decomposition conundrum, and exposed a hidden mechanism that may account for unexplained variation in plant litter decomposition across biomes. Canonically, faunal decomposition is expected to be positively associated with temperature and moisture ( García-Palacios et al., 2013 )

. To determine how general our findings are, future research should repeat our experimental approach using different litter sources, and across multiple climatic gradients. In conclusion, our work revealed that decomposers of varying size categories have different moisture dependencies. This suggests that microorganisms, meso-decomposers, and macro-decomposers should be considered separately in decomposition models, and emphasizes the need to contemplate animals’ physiology and behavior when investigating zoogeochemical processes. Warm drylands cover 19% of the land surface worldwide and expand rapidly due to unsustainable land-use and climate change ( Cartereau et al., 2022 ). We highlight the importance of macro-decomposition in arid-lands that compensates for the minimal microbial decomposition, providing a plausible resolution to the long-debated dryland decomposition conundrum. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate decomposition in drylands is key for conserving and restoring fundamental ecosystem processes in these ever-growing areas, and in improving our understanding of global processes like C cycling. To date, the general conceptualization of decomposition is largely based on ample research from temperate ecosystems. Thus, prevailing theory centers on focal processes that dominate decomposition in these systems. Our work highlights that in other less studied ecosystems additional processes like the role of animal decomposers may be dominant, opening the door for new exciting research that may shake our conceptualization of decomposition processes.

. Theory suggests that plant litter decomposition by meso-decomposers should increase with moisture. This pattern was supported by a cross-biome experiment ( Wall et al., 2008 ). Thus, we hypothesized that both meso-decomposition and microbial decomposition should increase with precipitation and be more prominent in the winter than in the summer. Our results did not coincide with these hypotheses. Litter decomposition by mesofauna followed a unimodal pattern across the precipitation gradient, peaking under semiarid conditions in both seasons ( Figure 4 ). Meso- and macro-decomposition were similar in the hyper-arid and Mediterranean sites. However, meso-decomposition was higher than macro-decomposition in the semiarid sites and much lower than macro-decomposition in the arid sites. These results suggest that meso-decomposers, like macro-decomposers, have adaptations that allow them to strive in moisture-deprived environments. Yet, meso-decomposition peaked in more mesic conditions than macro-decomposition, implying higher moisture dependency. Our findings highlight the need to explore the moisture dependency of mesofauna in greater details, and to generate different predictions for how mesofauna and microorganisms may affect plant litter decomposition. Faunal decomposition in our study peaked in arid environments, contrasting the positive association between faunal decomposition and precipitation that was found in recent global meta-analyses ( García-Palacios et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2020 ). This discrepancy may reflect underestimation of faunal decomposition rates in drylands, possibly because these studies either deliberately grouped cold and dry environments together ( García-Palacios et al., 2013; Wall et al., 2008 ), or focused solely on precipitation without accounting for differences in temperature ( Xu et al. 202 )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma carries a dismal prognosis, with high rates of metastasis and few treatment options. Hyperactivation of KRAS in almost all tumours drives RAC1 activation, conferring enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity as well as macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is well understood as a nutrient scavenging mechanism, but little is known about its functions in trafficking of signalling receptors. We find that CYRI-B is highly expressed in pancreatic tumours in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Deletion of Cyrib ( the gene encoding CYRI-B protein ) accelerates tumourigenesis, leading to enhanced ERK and JNK-induced proliferation in precancerous lesions, indicating a potential role as a buffer of RAC1 hyperactivation in early stages. However, as disease progresses, loss of CYRI-B inhibits metastasis. CYRI-B depleted tumour cells show reduced chemotactic responses to lysophosphatidic acid, a major driver of tumour spread, due to impaired macropinocytic uptake of the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1. Overall, we implicate CYRI-B as a mediator of growth and signalling in pancreatic cancer, providing new insights into pathways controlling metastasis. 

    Supporting Text:
    We have revealed an important role of CYRI-B in PDAC development, progression, and metastasis using the KPC mouse model and cells derived from the tumours. Our previous cell biology studies highlighted a role for CYRI-B as a buffer of RAC1-mediated actin assembly in lamellipodia and macropinocytic cups ( Fort et al., 2018; Le et al., 2021 ), but did not address the potential role that CYRI-B could play in tumourigenesis and metastasis, given its central role as a regulator of motility. We noticed that CYRI-B was highly expressed in human pancreatic cancers and correlated with poorer survival ( Nikolaou and Machesky, 2020 ). Increased expression of CYRI-B in mice with PDAC suggested that this model could help to reveal the role of CYRI-B in human PDAC. We might predict, based on amplified expression of CYRI-B, that RAC1 activity might be dampened down at least during some stages of tumourigenesis. Having a buffer for RAC1 activity could provide advantages for tumours, where mutations in KRAS will drive high activation of RAC1, which might be detrimental to cell survival due to enhanced reactive oxygen species production and enhanced downstream signalling. While we were not able to measure RAC1 activity in tumours directly, it would be desirable to do this in the future, using such tools as a RAC1 FRET biosensor mouse model ( Floerchinger et al., 2021 ). It would also be interesting to determine whether CYRI-A is involved in pancreatic cancer progression, as we previously implicated this protein in RAC1 binding ( Yelland et al., 2021 ) and macropinocytosis ( Le et al., 2021 ). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a correlation between CYRI-A expression and prognosis in human pancreatic tumours ( e. g. Human Protein Atlas https://www. proteinatlas. org/ENSG00000197872-CYRIA/pathology )

. org/ENSG00000197872-CYRIA/pathology ). In contrast, CYRI-A appears to have prognostic potential in both renal and urothelial cancers, suggesting a possible tissue specificity ( see Human Protein Atlas https://www. proteinatlas. org/ENSG00000197872-CYRIA/pathology ). Deletion of Cyrib in the pancreas, in concert with expression of KRAS G12D and p53 R172H, led to acceleration of PanIN formation and an increase in the area of pancreas showing lesions with high phospho-ERK and phospho-JNK, two crucial downstream targets of KRAS and RAC1 that drive proliferation and expansion. These results support the idea that CYRI-B could buffer RAC1 activity in early tumourigenesis, but there are other possible explanations for its role. Another study implicated CYRI-B in mitochondrial superoxide production, which could fuel early tumour progression ( Chattaragada et al., 2018 ). However, more studies are needed, as this is consistent with CYRI buffering RAC1, as RAC1 is a well-known regulator of superoxide production ( Du et al., 2011 ). Another possible mechanism by which loss of CYRI-B could enhance early cancer progression would be via its role in maintenance of epithelial apico-basolateral polarity ( Fort et al., 2018 ). We previously found that depletion of CYRI-B in MDCK cell spheroids disrupted lumen formation in a similar way to hyperactivation of RAC1. Likewise, RAC1 and PI3-kinase are important for apicobasal polarity in the pancreas ( Löf-Öhlin et al., 2017 ) and RAC1 has a known role in acinar to ductal metaplasia and in polarity and cell identity during early PDAC progression ( Heid et al., 2011 ). PI3-kinase plays an important role in polarity maintenance and CYRI-B has been implicated in PI3-kinase signalling in gallbladder cancer cells ( Zhang et al., 2020 )

. Consistent with enhanced RAC1 signalling, we observed a significant increase in the percentage pERK area and pJNK area from pancreata of CKPC mice vs KPC ( Figure 3D–G ). We next investigated proliferation using BrdU injections at 15 weeks and found increased BrdU positive nuclei in the CKPC tissues in comparison with the KPC, suggesting enhanced proliferation in the abnormal ductal structures ( Figure 3H and I ). Indeed, CKPC mice presented with increased pancreatic weight to body mass ratio at 15 weeks, in agreement with increased proliferation of preneoplastic and neoplastic cells, whereas at 10 weeks of age there was no difference ( Figure 3J ). Thus, loss of Cyrib in the KPC model accelerates PanIN formation and progression, likely due to loss of CYRI-B’s capacity to buffer RAC1 activation downstream of active KRAS leading to abnormal architecture, combined with hyperactivation of ERK and JNK to drive proliferation. The KPC mouse model is characterised by high metastatic rates to clinically relevant organs such as liver, diaphragm, and bowel ( Hingorani et al., 2005 ). Since CYRI-B regulates cell migration and chemotaxis ( Fort et al., 2018 ), we asked whether deletion of CYRI-B can affect the metastatic potential of cancer cells in the CKPC mouse model. Analysis of mice at end-point from KPC and CKPC cohorts revealed similar infrequent metastasis to the diaphragm in both cohorts, but a significant reduction in metastasis to both the liver and bowel of CKPC mice ( Figure 4A and B ). To explore mechanisms behind the reduced metastasis of CKPC mice, we used an in vivo transplantation assay to test the metastatic seeding in the peritoneal cavity. This assay also allows us to rule out whether reduced metastasis was just due to the earlier progression to end-point in CKPC mice

The Cyrib gene resides on human chromosome 8q24, near c-Myc, and is frequently amplified in many types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer ( Nikolaou and Machesky, 2020 ). High expression of CYRI-B correlates with poor outcome in many cancers ( Li et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2022a ), including in human pancreatic cancer. To further investigate a potential role for Cyrib in pancreatic cancer, we first assessed the expression of CYRI-B in the KPC mouse model of metastatic PDAC ( Hingorani et al., 2005 ). In this model, PanIN develops by around 10 weeks and progresses to later stages towards 15 weeks, with full-blown PDAC appearing at this stage and mice reaching end-point with a half time of median 150–200 days. As we do not currently have a reliable antibody to detect CYRI-B protein in tissue samples, tissue samples from 6-, 10-, 15-week-old KPC mice were processed for RNA in situ hybridisation ( ISH ). At 6 weeks, before appearance of PanIN, Cyrib was not detected in the pancreas ( Figure 1 ). Cyrib expression was detectable by 10 weeks, especially around PanIN lesions, which remained stable until 15 weeks of age ( Figure 1 ). End-point tumours showed a significant increase in the levels of Cyrib ( Figure 1 ), suggesting that the KPC model was a good model for exploring the role of Cyrib expression during PDAC progression. To further probe the mechanism by which CYRI-B might influence PDAC progression, we crossed Cyrib floxed mice with KPC mice. We refer to these mice and cell lines derived from them as CKPC ( Figure 2A ). ISH of end-point tumours confirmed no detectable Cyrib mRNA in CKPC tumours in comparison with KPC ( Figure 2B and C ), indicating loss of CY-B in tumourigenesis.

    Title: 
    Abstract: HERV-K ( HML-2 ), the youngest clade of human endogenous retroviruses ( HERVs ), includes many intact or nearly intact proviruses, but no replication competent HML-2 proviruses have been identified in humans. HML-2-related proviruses are present in other primates, including rhesus macaques, but the extent and timing of HML-2 activity in macaques remains unclear. We have identified 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, including a clade of young, rhesus-specific insertions. Age estimates, intact open reading frames, and insertional polymorphism of these insertions are consistent with recent or ongoing infectious activity in macaques. 106 of the proviruses form a clade characterized by an ~750 bp sequence between env and the 3′ long terminal repeat ( LTR ), derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K ( HML-8 ) -related virus. This clade is found in Old World monkeys ( OWM ), but not great apes, suggesting it originated after the ape/OWM split. We identified similar proviruses in white-cheeked gibbons; the gibbon insertions cluster within the OWM recombinant clade, suggesting interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons. The LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in U3, which disrupt the Rec Response Element ( RcRE ), required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA. We show that the HML-8-derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element ( CTE ), indicating the ancestral Rec–RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism.

This recombination resulted in the formation of a chimeric env gene, with the SU surface subunit and part of the TM transmembrane subunit derived from HML-2 env and the rest of TM derived from HML-8 env, including the transmembrane alpha helix and the cytoplasmic tail. The non-coding region is derived from the HML-8 LTR, also known as MER11. We estimate that the recombination event which formed this clade of viruses, which we are calling SERV-K/MER11, occurred approximately 20–25 million years ago, before the split between the colobine and cercopithecine subfamilies of OWM, but after the split between apes and OWM. Consistent with this estimate, orthologs of the oldest insertions are found in species from both subfamilies of OWM, but not in any apes. This timing is supported by estimated integration times of these ancient elements based on sequence divergence of their 5′ and 3′ LTRs. The majority of the 106 recombinant proviruses so far identified in rhesus genomes are much younger, however, including two subclades of rhesus-specific insertions. Many of these young proviruses are insertionally polymorphic and present at low frequencies in macaques, and 36 of them have identical LTRs. Taken together, this evidence suggests infectious activity of HERV-K-like retroviruses in rhesus macaques within the last 500–250, 000 years, and the potential for ongoing replication

., 2007 ). More recently, another study identified several HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, detected expression of env mRNA, and identified one macaque with an Env-specific immune response ( Wu et al., 2016 ). One of the proviruses identified, which the authors named SERV-K1, has full-length ORFs for gag and env, and only two single nucleotide insertions disrupting the pro and pol ORFs. SERV-K1 is not present in the rhesus reference genome, indicating that it is insertionally polymorphic, and its 5′ and 3′ LTRs are identical in sequence. Both of these characteristics indicate that SERV-K1 is a relatively young insertion ( less than about 500, 000 years old ), and suggests that rhesus macaques could possibly harbor currently or recently active HML-2-like retroviruses. Lastly, a recent study identified SERV-K1-like proviruses in a number of OWM species, including multiple macaque species, geladas, and olive baboons; this study also reported that many of these proviruses had very similar LTRs, suggestive of recent integration ( van der Kuyl, 2021 ). Overall, these studies indicate the potential for recent HML-2 activity in multiple catarrhine primate species, including rhesus macaques. Thus, a comprehensive characterization of HML-2 proviruses in the rhesus macaque reference genome would provide a valuable starting point for further investigations of this potential. In order to investigate the possibility that HML-2 viruses were recently or are currently active in rhesus macaques, we searched for HML-2 proviral sequences in the two most recent rhesus genome assemblies and performed an in-depth characterization of their structure, coding capacity, and evolutionary history, with a particular focus on SERV-K1-like proviruses. We have found that SERV-K1 is part of a large clade of rhesus proviruses that show signs of recent activity

. The evidence for at least one and possibly more such transmission events is strong, and geographic proximity makes contact between the GSM and white-cheeked gibbon lineages plausible; however, both species are herbivorous, removing perhaps the most straightforward route of transmission, predation, from consideration. Additionally, the titres of reconstituted HML-2 viruses in cell culture are relatively low, which would seem to make transmission via incidental contact unlikely ( Dewannieux et al., 2006; Lee and Bieniasz, 2007 ). It is possible that the recombinant CTE and/or LTR deletions may have altered the biology of SERV-K/MER11 compared to HERV-K HML-2 in some way that makes interspecies transmission easier. In summary, we have characterized a clade of ERVs in rhesus macaques that may serve as a valuable model for investigating viral evolution over deep time, and as a model for HERV-K HML-2 virology and pathogenesis. This clade provides a high resolution record of the evolution of a single viral lineage going back approximately 25 million years, potentially up to the present day, that has undergone multiple significant evolutionary transitions, including recombination with divergent viral lineages and interspecies transmission to divergent host species. Rhesus macaques are a well-characterized model organism for human disease; if these viruses are still actively replicating in macaques or other OWM species, they could provide an opportunity to observe the infection dynamics of an HML-2-like virus in a natural host, which could provide insights on currently incompletely understood aspects of HML-2 biology, such as tropism, pathogenic potential, receptor usage, and mode of transmission

. Strikingly, the majority of these deletions overlap with the RcRE in human HML-2; it seems plausible that the accumulation of these RcRE deletions is causally related to the ancient recombination with HML-8 which provided the MER11 element of SERV-K/MER11. We have demonstrated that the MER11 element in a consensus young SERV-K/MER11 provirus is capable of functioning as a Rec-independent CTE, thus explaining how these proviruses are capable of functioning without an RcRE. Of the four most well-characterized betaretroviral systems ( MMTV, Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus, MPMV, and HERV-K HML-2 ), only one, MPMV, has a CTE system. MPMV was isolated from a rhesus macaque, and is the prototype isolate of the simian retroviruses ( SRVs ) of Asian macaques. Interestingly, the SRV clade is, like SERV-K/MER11, recombinant, with an env gene more closely related to those of gammaretroviruses than betaretroviruses ( Sonigo et al., 1986 ) ; this raises the possibility that the SRV CTE system is also derived from a recombination event involving env and an adjacent non-coding sequence ( the CTE ). Although these viruses appear to have lost their RcRE, they have retained a rec-like transcript that is predicted to produce a chimeric Rec-like protein, with a second exon derived from the recombinant HML-8-like sequence. This sRec protein does not appear to promote unspliced RNA transport, either with the human HML-2 RcRE or with SERV-K/MER11 sequences, but the conservation of this splice form suggests it may have another function in viral replication. This function may have evolved since the recombination event, or alternatively it may be that the Rec protein of human HML-2 and SRV are not functional in the same way. The CTE of SER-KER11 is functional in the absence of the Rc, suggesting that the ancestral Rec system was replaced by the CTE in the course of evolution of the SER-KER clade. This is the first demonstration of a Rec-independent CTE in a betaretrovirus, and the first evidence that a CTE can function in the absence of Rc in a retrovirus. This finding has implications for our understanding the evolution of retroviral replication and transcriptional regulation, and highlights the diversity of mechanisms used by retroviruses to export unspliced RNA from nucleus to cytoplasm.
Researchers investigated the role of Enterococcus faalis in wound infections using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on infected and uninfected wounds in a mouse model. They analyzed over 23,000 cells and created a comprehensive single-cell atlas capturing the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of wounds. The study revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating distinct changes associated with bacterial infection compared to normal healing. Keratinocytes and fibroblast transcriptomes were dysregulated in response to infection, contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, E. faalis prompted premature epithelial-mesymal transition in keratinocytes and modulated M2 macrophage polarization inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro and in vivo. Macrophages interacted with neutils, regulating chemine signaling and promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. The study provides new insights into immunosuppressive role of E faalis in wound infections. Elevated TGF-1 levels were observed in epidermis of chronic wounds in humans and mice. E fa infection contributed to higher Tfb expression while Pdg levels remained low, correlating with delayed healing. The cellular heterogeneity in wound environment following E fa infection was investigated by dissociating cells from full-thickness skin, including adjacent healthy skin. Single-cell transcriptomes were generated using droplet-based 10 Gen Chromium microfluid partitioning. Integrating transcriptomes identified 24 clusters, irrespective of infection, including epithelial, immune, fibro, endothelial, vascular, and neural types. Epithelial clusters included basal, supasal, hairles, outer, bulge, and seb gland cells. Immune clusters included macroages, neutils, memory, T cells, and mixed dendritic cells. Cells from infected wounds demonstrated distinct patterns compared to uninf wounds. E fa altered transcript of keratin toward partial EMT at early, while uninf showed differentiating and terminally keratin populations. Fibblasts were fundamental in skin homeostasis and healing, producing ECM and regulating inflammatory response. E fa-infected macroages drove vascular signatures in endothelial, resembling cancer microenvironment. Macroph interacted with neutils regulating chemine and anti-inflammatory with endothelial.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Volatiles emitted by herbivore-attacked plants ( senders ) can enhance defenses in neighboring plants ( receivers ), however, the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon remain poorly studied. Using a custom-built, high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( PTR-ToF-MS ) system, we explored temporal patterns of volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. We found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles results in clocked temporal response patterns in neighboring plants, characterized by an induced terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure. This delayed burst is not explained by terpene accumulation during the night, but coincides with delayed jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The delayed burst occurs independent of day:night light transitions and cannot be fully explained by sender volatile dynamics. Instead, it is the result of a stress memory from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary exposure to bioactive volatiles on the second day. Our study reveals that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern. This provides an answer to the long-standing question of whether stress volatiles predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants, by revealing that they can do both in sequence.

   . We leveraged a highly temporally resolved volatile multiplexing system that allowed us to track continuous volatile emissions in sender and receiver plants for the first time in real time. We further measured foliar terpene pools, stress hormones, and defense gene expression in receiver plants, and determined the impact of day:night light transitions in the observed defense induction kinetics. Finally, we measured defenses upon sequences of short-term HIPV and GLV exposure to unravel the relative importance of direct induction and priming. Together, our experiments reveal how the natural kinetics of herbivore attack result in a clocked defense response in neighboring plants via volatile information transfer.

HIPVs play an important role in mediating interactions between damaged and undamaged plants ( Escobar-Bravo et al., 2023 ). However, the kinetics and temporal dynamics of this information transfer remain poorly understood. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, upon continuous exposure to HIPVs, receiver plants show a pronounced activation of defenses at the onset of the second day. We find that this is the result of volatile-mediated priming on the first day that yields a clocked response to the volatiles that are perceived the next day. Here, we discuss the mechanisms and biological implications of this phenomenon. Plants are well known to respond to herbivore-induced volatiles by increasing their own defenses. Defense activation can happen directly, with plants increasing their defense hormone production and volatile release ( Engelberth et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2023 ), and/or via priming effects, with plants increasing their defenses more strongly upon a secondary stimulus ( Erb et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2019 ). Here, we show that these two phenomena operate together to trigger strong defense activation in receiver plants with predictable temporal kinetics. So far, studies in maize and other plants showing priming effects have often exposed receiver plants to HIPVs for several hours, overnight, or even for multiple days, and induced them, e. g., by simulated herbivory, on the following day in the absence of HIPVs ( Erb et al., 2015; Engelberth et al., 2004; Ton et al., 2007; Ali et al., 2013; Paudel Timilsena et al., 2020 ). Indeed, such a setup would reveal clear priming, with minor or no direct induction by the volatile treatment. Our findings demonstrate that more natural continuous exposure to volatiles results in the same pattern without the need for another stimulus. We thus conclude that HIPVs are sufficient to trigger robust, clocked defense activation in neighboring plants

. Based on the above observations, we reasoned that, under natural conditions, the strong delayed volatile burst may be due to the interaction of an initial volatile burst that primes plants for higher volatile release at the onset of the second day, and a secondary trigger in the form of bioactive volatiles released from sender plants at the onset of the second day. To test this hypothesis, we exposed receiver plants to volatiles from control plants or volatiles from herbivory-induced plants for 1. 25 hr. We then disconnected the receiver plants and exposed them to clean air for 17 hr, until the beginning of the next day. Half of the plants were then exposed to HAC as a secondary trigger. HAC was selected as an inducer as it showed the strongest correlation with all measured terpenes ( Figure 6 ). Following the short exposure to HIPVs, we detected a generally small, but significant, induction of sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes, DMNT, and TMTT emissions in receiver plants ( Figure 7, Table 2 ). During the night, no differences between treatments were detected any more. At the beginning of the next day, we found a slight induction in terpene emissions, most apparent for sesquiterpenes and TMTT, in plants that had been exposed to herbivory-induced volatiles 18 hr prior ( Figure 7, Table 2 ). HAC exposure at the beginning of the next day also induced terpene emissions. Furthermore, HAC induced a stronger release of all terpenes in plants that had been exposed to HIPVs the previous day. In an independent experiment, we also tested whether HAC sensitivity per se may be higher at the start of the light period. We exposed maize seedlings to HAC dispensers either 30 min or 4 hr 30 min after lights came on. We found induction in terpene emission to be similar regardless of when induction began ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 )

. In both continuous light experiments the ‘second day’ burst occurred somewhat earlier than under normal light conditions. It is possible that stomata, which are closed in the dark, delay the onset of the terpene burst under dark:light transitions. A simple explanation for the delayed volatile burst may be that the bioactive volatiles are more strongly emitted from sender plants at the onset of day 2, thus triggering a stronger volatile response in the receiver plants at this time. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed volatile emission kinetics of S. exigua-infested plants over time. We focused our analysis on GLVs and indole, which are known to induce and/or prime volatile release in neighboring maize plants ( Hu et al., 2019; Engelberth et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2023; Ruther and Fürstenau, 2005 ). Terpenes are not known to prime or induce volatile release in maize, and were thus not included in the sender plant analysis ( Ruther and Fürstenau, 2005 ). We analyzed GLV and indole emission data of the sender plants from the experiments depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 4, Figure 5, and then correlated their emission with the induction of terpenes in receiver plants ( Figure 6 ). We found strong positive correlations between hexenyl acetate, hexenal, hexen-1-ol, and indole emissions in sender plants and terpene responses in receiver plants when plants had a dark period ( Figure 6 ). Interestingly, this was not the case under continuous light, where the apex of bioactive volatile emission in sender plants was not temporally aligned with the apex of terpene responses in receiver plants ( Figure 6 ). Sender plant emissions even showed slight negative correlations with terpene induction in receiver plants under continuous light. Thus, the emission kinetics of bioactive volatiles from sender plants cannot fully explain the delayed terpene burst

When maize plants are exposed to volatiles from herbivore-attacked neighbors, they start to release terpenes ( Hu et al., 2019; Ruther and Fürstenau, 2005 ). To understand the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon, we conducted a detailed time-course analysis of terpene release by receiver plants exposed to volatiles from sender plants under attack by Spodoptera exigua caterpillars ( Figure 1 ). Herbivore feeding began around 12:00 and within 3 hr, we detected a small induction of sesquiterpenes [C15H25+, m/z=205. 20], monoterpenes [C10H17+, m/z=137. 13], 4, 8-dimethylnona-1, 3, 7-triene ( DMNT ) [C11H19+, m/z=151. 15], and 4, 8, 12-trimethyltrideca-1, 3, 7, 11-tetraene ( TMTT ) [C16H27+, m/z=219. 21] in undamaged receiver plants. Volatile emission was severely impaired during the night, regardless of treatment. Interestingly, as soon as the light was restored, we observed a strong burst of terpene release from receiver plants, which was two to five times higher than the release the day before ( Figure 1 ). Thus, exposure to volat from herboreatt plants results in a delayed response in neighboring plants characterized by a pronounced terene burst at the onset of the day.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Recursive procedures that allow placing a vocal signal inside another of a similar kind provide a neuro-computational blueprint for syntax and phonology in spoken language and human song. There are, however, no known vocal sequences among nonhuman primates arranged in self-embedded patterns that evince vocal recursion or potential incipient or evolutionary transitional forms thereof, suggesting a neuro-cognitive transformation exclusive to humans. Here, we uncover that wild flanged male orangutan long calls feature rhythmically isochronous call sequences nested within isochronous call sequences, consistent with two hierarchical strata. Remarkably, three temporally and acoustically distinct call rhythms in the lower stratum were not related to the overarching rhythm at the higher stratum by any low multiples, which suggests that these recursive structures were neither the result of parallel non-hierarchical procedures nor anatomical artifacts of bodily constraints or resonances. Findings represent a case of temporally recursive hominid vocal combinatorics in the absence of syntax, semantics, phonology, or music. Second-order combinatorics, ‘sequences within sequences’, involving hierarchically organized and cyclically structured vocal sounds in ancient hominids may have preluded the evolution of recursion in modern language-able humans.

   . This suggests that controversy may have been underscored by data-poor circumstances on vocal combinatorics in wild great apes, which only now start gathering comprehensive research effort ( Bortolato et al., 2023a; Bortolato et al., 2023b; Girard-Buttoz et al., 2022; but see Lameira et al., 2013a ). Resolution may come through a re-evaluation of previous studies with further related taxa and with experimental tests designed within a richer and more articulated panorama of observations on vocal combinatorics in wild great apes. Recursive vocal patterning in a wild great ape in the absence of syntax, semantics, phonology, or music opens a new charter for possible incipient and transitional states of recursion among hominids. The open discussion of what properties make a structure proto-recursive will be essential to move the state of knowledge past antithetical, dichotomous notions of how recursion and syntax evolved ( Berwick and Chomsky, 2019; Martins and Boeckx, 2019 ). Second, our findings invite renewed interest and reanalysis of primate vocal combinatorics in the wild ( Gabrić, 2022; Girard-Buttoz et al., 2022; Leroux et al., 2023; Leroux et al., 2021 ). Given the dearth of such data, findings imply that it may be too hasty to discuss whether combinatorial capacities in primates or birds are equivalent to those engaged in syntax ( Engesser et al., 2015; Watson et al., 2020 ) or phonology ( Bowling and Fitch, 2015; Rawski et al., 2021 ). Such classifications may be putting the proverbial cart before the horse; they are based on untested assumptions that may not have applied to proto-recursive ancestors ( Kershenbaum et al., 2014; Miyagawa, 2021 ), for example, that syntax and phonology evolved as separate ‘modules’, that one attained modern form before the other, or that they evolved in hominids regardless of whether consonant-like and vowel-like calls were present or not

. Third, given that isochrony universally governs music and that recursion is a feature of music, findings could suggest a possible evolutionary link between great ape loud calls and vocal music. Loud calling is an archetypal trait in primates ( Wich and Nunn, 2002 ) and among ancient hominids it could have preceded, and subsequently transmuted, into modern recursive vocal structures in humans, as found today in the form of song and chants. Given their conspicuousness, loud calls represent one of the most studied aspects of primate vocal behavior ( Wich and Nunn, 2002 ), but their rhythmic patterns have only recently started to be characterized with precision ( Clink et al., 2020; De Gregorio et al., 2021; Gamba et al., 2016 ). Besides our analyses, there are remarkably few confirmed cases of vocal isochrony in great apes ( but see Raimondi et al., 2023 ). The behaviors that have been rhythmically measured with accuracy have been implicated in the evolution of percussion ( Fuhrmann et al., 2015 ) and musical expression ( Dufour et al., 2015; Hattori and Tomonaga, 2020 ), such as social entrainment in chimpanzees in connection with the origin of dance ( Lameira et al., 2019a ) ( a capacity once also assumed to be neurologically impossible in great apes; Fitch, 2017; Patel, 2014 ). This opens the intriguing, tentative possibility that recursive vocal combinatorics were first and foremost a feature of proto-musical expression in human ancestors, later recruited and ‘re-engineered’ for the generation of linguistic combinatorics. Future studies probing for recursive call sequence patterns in other orangutan vocal contexts and other great ape vocal behaviors could help test this idea. The presence of temporally recursive vocal motifs in a wild great ape revolutionizes how we can approach the evolution of recursion along the human lineage beyond all-or-nothing accounts

. Future studies on primate vocal combinatorics, particularly undertaking a structural approach and in the wild, offer promising new paths to empirically assess possible precursors and proto-states for the evolution of recursion within the hominid family, also adding temporal recursion as a new layer of analysis. These crucial data on the evolution of recursion, language, and cognition along the human lineage will materialize if, as stewards of our planetary co-habitants, humankind secures the survival of nonhuman primates and the preservation of their habitats in the wild ( Estrada et al., 2022; Estrada et al., 2017; Laurance, 2013; Laurance et al., 2012 ).

. e., 1/22 ). Also, some of these processes ( e. g., vocal fold action ) are oscillatory in nature, involving nested frequency waves. They are not combinatorial, involving nested sequences of events, as we report here. Our data stimulate new questions about the relationship between oscillators and combinatoriality, which is difficult to investigate from an observational point of view in the wild. Hopefully, our results will inspire new studies using controlled experimental settings to assess how oscillators and combinatoriality may be associated in ways potentially richer than thus far suspected. Together, our findings suggest that recursive isochrony is not the absolute result of raw mechanics but is instead likely generated or tampered with by, at least, one temporally recursive neuro-motor procedure. The occurrence of three non-exclusive recursive patterns drives down the likelihood that orangutans concatenate long call pulses and sub-pulses in a linear fashion and without bringing into play a recursive neuro-motoric process. To generate the observed vocal motifs linearly, three independent neuro-computational procedures would need to run in parallel. These three independent procedures would need to be indistinguishable, transposable, and/or interchangeable at the pulse level, whilst generating distinct rhythms and acoustics at the sub-pulse level. If theoretically possible at all, one would predict some degree of interference between the three linear procedures at the pulse level, manifested in some form of deviation around the isochrony peak. However, this was not observed; distribution of data points on and off isochrony was equivalent between pulses and sub-pulses. Recursive self-embedded vocal motifs in orangutans indicate that vocal recursion among hominids is not exclusive to human vocal combinatorics, at least in the form of temporally embedded regular rhythms

. This is not to suggest that orangutan recursive motifs exhibit all other properties that recursion exhibits in modern language-able humans, or that the two are the same, or equivalent. Further research will be necessary to fully unveil how orangutans use and control vocal recursion to form a clearer evolutionary picture. Expecting equivalence with language is, however, unwarranted as it would imply that no evolution would have occurred in over 10 million years since the split between the orangutan and human lineages. Any differences between our findings and recursion in today’s syntax, phonology, or music do not logically reject the possibility that recursive isochrony represents an ancient, and perhaps ancestral, state for the evolution of vocal recursion within the hominid family. Recursion and fractal phenomena are prevalent across the universe. Celestial and planetary movement, the splitting of tree branches, river deltas and arteries, and the morphology of bacteria colonies. Patterns within self-similar patterns are the norm, not the exception. This makes the seeming singularity of human recursion amongst animal vocal combinatorics all the more enigmatic. The discovery of recursive vocal patterns organized along two hierarchical temporal levels in a hominid besides humans suggests that ‘sequences within sequences’ may have been present in ancestral hominids, and hence, that second-order sequences may have predated the emergence of language in the human lineage. Three major implications for the evolution of recursion in language apply. First, much ink has been laid on the topic. second-order combinator in modern humans, but little is known about second-order combinator in homids. Our findings suggest that second-order combinator may have been present in homids before the emergence of syntax, phonology, or music. Second, second-order combinator in homids may not have been the same as second combinator in modern humans. Third, second-order combinator in homids may not have evolved in the same way as second comb in modern humans. Our findings suggest that second-order combinator in homids may have been present before the emergence of syntax, phonology or music, and that second-order comb in homids may not have been the same as second comb in modern humans.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The incessant arms race between viruses and hosts has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that shape life’s evolution. During this process, the interactions between viral receptors and viruses have garnered significant interest since viral receptors are cell surface proteins exploited by viruses to initiate infection. Our study sheds light on the arms race between the MDA5 receptor and 5’ppp-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate fish, Miichthys miiuy. Firstly, the frequent and independent loss events of RIG-I in vertebrates prompted us to search for alternative immune substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation response ( HDGCR ) being the main pathway. Our further analysis suggested that MDA5 of M. miiuy and Gallus gallus, the homolog of RIG-I, can replace RIG-I in recognizing 5’ppp-RNA virus, which may lead to redundancy of RIG-I and loss from the species genome during evolution. Secondly, as an adversarial strategy, 5’ppp-RNA SCRV can utilize the m6A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability, thus promoting its own replication and immune evasion. In summary, our study provides a snapshot into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering valuable perspectives on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system.

   . Next, by linking the immune replacement ability evolved by MDA5 with the common RIG-I loss event in vertebrates, we propose a straightforward explanation for this evolutionary event: In the lengthy process of vertebrate evolution, MDA5 gradually acquired new functionalities to effectively detect viruses such as 5’ppp-RNAs, which were initially recognized by RIG-I. As a result, there was functional redundancy of RIG-I, which eventually led to its gradual disappearance from the vertebrate genome. This hypothesis is supported by two viewpoints: first, MDA5 and RIG-I can both recognize overlapping viruses Schoggins et al., 2015; secondly, in fish without RIG-I deficiency, MDA5 has stronger antiviral ability compared to RIG-I ( Wan et al., 2017 ). Finally, although MDA5 has a compensatory effect on RIG-I, the absence of RIG-I may still have a significant impact on the immune system of vertebrates. Ducks are often resistant to influenza viruses capable of killing chicken, and the loss of RIG-I in chickens provides a plausible explanation for their increased susceptibility to influenza viruses compared with ducks ( Barber et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, SCRV virus, the virus model used in this study, mainly affects the Siniperca chuatsi, which is a fish species that also lacks RIG-I like M. miiuy ( Liu et al., 2023 ). Viruses are constantly co-evolving with hosts. Our available data suggested that the vertebrate has evolved MDA5 with alternative functions to recognize and resist 5’ppp-RNA virus in the absence of RIG-I. As a response, virus has also evolved to use the m6A mechanism to evade the host immune response. Previous study indicated that m6A modification plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis in the body ( Gan et al., 2023 ). During the infection process, the virus may disrupt the m6A level and disrupt the immune balance, thereby facilitating its own replication and invasion

., 2022 ). 5’ppp-RNA is present in a wide variety of RNA viruses, including Flaviviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae families ( Hornung et al., 2006 ). These viruses widely infect all kinds of life and cause various harmfulness and serious diseases, and the infected hosts range from the highest vertebrates to the lowest vertebrate, teleost fish ( Millet et al., 2021; Walker et al., 2022 ). 5’ppp-RNA viruses are expected to be recognized and trigger an antiviral immune response by RIG-I. However, RIG-I is lacking in many vertebrates, so who then recognizes 5’ppp-RNA in these species? When a gene is functionally inactive or lost, other genes or pathways may undergo homology-dependent genetic compensation response ( HDGCR ) to maintain organismal balance. The pressure from viral infections has led to the evolution of the immune system, and the loss of RIG-I may be accompanied by functional substitution by homologous genes in order to compensate for the loss of RIG-I function. Tupaia belangeri, a mammal lacking RIG-I, has been reported to possess the MDA5 protein, which has undergone positive selection and exhibits the ability to sense Sendai virus ( an RNA virus posed as a RIG-I agonist ) for inducing type I IFN ( Xu et al., 2016 ). This study provides insights into the compensatory mechanism of RIG-I deficiency in vertebrates, however, considering the dynamic nature of host-virus dynamics, further research is urgently needed to validate and expand these insights. For millions of years, viruses have coevolved with their hosts, leading to the development of various mechanisms for immune evasion in response to the mutual evolutionary pressure ( Naz et al., 2021 ). Recently, it is reported that N6-methyladenosine ( m6A ) modification plays a crucial role in enabling viruses to evade the interferon ( IFN ) response ( Lou et al., 2021 )

. This proposed an immune substitution model for RIG-I deficiency in mammals, though direct evidence of MDA5/LGP2 binding to 5’ppp-RNA was lacking. In this study, we characterized the consequences resulting from the loss of RIG-I in the M. miiuy and G. gallus ( two representative species of vertebrates lacking RIG-I ) and provided direct functional evidence for the alternative immune recognition function of MDA5. SCRV and VSV belongs to the class of rhabdovirus, which is a negative-strand virus with a non-segmented genome and initiate both replication and transcription de novo leading to 5′-triphosphate RNA in the cytosol, was expected to trigger an IFN response without the need for replication and presumed dsRNA formation ( Hornung et al., 2006 ). Then, we synthesized 5’ppp-RNA probes from the SCRV and VSV genome sequences and purified recombinant MDA5 of M. miiuy and G. gallus. Results demonstrated that MDA5 detect the 5’ppp-RNA in M. miiuy and G. gallus and is disrupted when RNA is capped at the 5'-triphosphate end or dephosphorylated. Furthermore, the recognition of RNA by MDA5 depends on its RD domain, which not only indicates that the RD domain of MDA5 has evolved functions similar to RD domain of RIG-I, but also excludes the possibility of MDA5 binding to 5’ppp-RNA through intermediate ligands. Furthermore, in vertebrates that possess RIG-I, STING exclusively binds to RIG-I rather than MDA5. However, similar to the interaction observed between MDA5 and STING in tree shrews and chickens that lacking RIG-I ( Xu et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2019 ), the MDA5 of M. miiuy can also interact with STING protein, indicating that in vertebrates lacking RIG-I, MDA5 may utilize STING to facilitate signal transduction in the antiviral response

. miiuy and G. gallus ) is guided by the RNA 5'-triphosphate end and is disrupted when RNA is capped at the 5'-triphosphate end or dephosphorylated. As stated in the previous results, MDA5 has evolved to possess immune recognition abilities that take over the role of RIG-I, significantly enhancing the host’s ability to resist viral infections. However, evolution is a continuous battle between hosts and viruses, viruses often evolve complex escape mechanisms to evade immune surveillance and destruction, in which the m6A modification mechanism is an important way. To investigate the impact of SCRV infection on the overall methylation dynamics of fish hosts, we utilized methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing ( MeRIP-seq, GenBank accession number: PRJNA819945 ) to measure changes in m6A modification of host transcripts during SCRV infection ( Figure 5A ). From the results shown in Figure 5B, we identified 3060 differentially m6A methylated peaks ( p-value<0. 05 ) and 2082 differentially expressed genes ( p-value<0. 05 ) between the non-infected and SCRV-infected group, indicating that infection significantly alters the m6A modification of specific host transcripts. It is worth noting that hyper-methylated m6A peaks were also observed in the MDA5 mRNA transcripts during SCRV infection ( fold change >1. 5, p<0. 05 ), and the expression level of MDA5 was higher in the infection group compared to the control group ( p<0. 05 ). Further analysis of the m6A-seq data showed that MDA5 contained m6A sites in the 3′-UTR and 5′-UTR regions of the mRNA ( Figure 5C ), which is consistent with previous studies that m6 modification in 3′-UTR and 5-UTR is associated with mRNA stability and translation ( Wang et al, 2018 ). The m6 modification of M5 may be a mechanism for SCRV to evade the host immune response by degrading M5 and reducing its antiviral ability. In conclusion, our study provides insights into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering valuable perspectives on ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system. Our data suggest that M5 of M. mii and G. gall can replace R-I in recognizing 5pp-R virus, leading to redundancy of R-I from the species during evolution. Furthermore, SCRV can utilize m6 mechanism to degrade M5 and weaken its antiv immune ability, promoting its replication and immune evasion. This study highlights the dynamic nature of host-virus and the need for further research to validate and expand these insights.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Among its extragonadal effects, follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) has an impact on body composition and bone metabolism. Since androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) has a profound impact on circulating FSH concentrations, this hormone could potentially be implicated in the changes of fat body mass ( FBM ), lean body mass ( LBM ), and bone fragility induced by ADT. The objective of this study is to correlate FSH serum levels with body composition parameters, bone mineral density ( BMD ), and bone turnover markers at baseline conditions and after 12 months of ADT. Twenty-nine consecutive non-metastatic prostate cancer ( PC ) patients were enrolled from 2017 to 2019 in a phase IV study. All patients underwent administration of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist degarelix. FBM, LBM, and BMD were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 12 months of ADT. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. For outcome measurements and statistical analysis, t-test or sign test and Pearson or Spearman tests for continuous variables were used when indicated. At baseline conditions, a weak, non-significant, direct relationship was found between FSH serum levels and FBM at arms ( r = 0. 36 ) and legs ( r = 0. 33 ). Conversely, a stronger correlation was observed between FSH and total FBM ( r = 0. 52, p = 0. 006 ), fat mass at arms ( r = 0. 54, p = 0. 004 ), and fat mass at trunk ( r = 0. 45, p = 0. 018 ) assessed after 12 months. On the other hand, an inverse relationship between serum FSH and appendicular lean mass index/FBM ratio was observed ( r = −0. 64, p = 0. 001 ). This is an ancillary study of a prospective trial and this is the main limitation. FSH serum levels after ADT could have an impact on body composition, in particular on FBM. Therefore, FSH could be a promising marker to monitor the risk of sarcopenic obesity and to guide the clinicians in the tailored evaluation of body composition in PC patients undergoing ADT. This research was partially funded by Ferring Pharmaceuticals.

   ., 2012; Silva et al., 2013; El Khoudary et al., 2016 ). Studies clarifying the relationship among FSH, body composition measures, and BMD in prostate cancer ( PC ) patients are lacking. Likewise, the interaction between the variation of FSH serum levels and the modification of these parameters in PC patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) is not known. We recently conducted the BLADE study ( Bone mineraL mAss Dexa dEgarelix ), a prospective phase IV study designed to obtain explorative information on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) measurement changes in lean body mass ( LBM ) and fat body mass ( FBM ) in patients with non-metastatic PC treated with degarelix, an LHRH ( luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ) antagonist that has been developed to achieve effective long-term medical castration without the risk of testosterone surge and its associated flare. Data on changes in total LBM and FBM and on the impact of degarelix on BMD and bone turnover markers were recently published ( Palumbo et al., 2021; Palumbo et al., 2022 ). Here, we analyse the association of FSH with DXA-assessed FBM, LBM, and BMD and bone turnover markers at baseline and after degarelix administration in the patients enrolled in the BLADE study.

Recent preclinical and clinical studies have shown that follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) exerts effects beyond those on gonadal tissue, which have been known for a long time ( Lizneva et al., 2019 ). In the animal model, FSH has been observed to stimulate osteoclastic activity and therefore to exert a negative role on bone mass ( Sun et al., 2006; Zaidi et al., 2023; Gera et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, FSH was found to have a positive action on adipocytes and the blockade of FSH induced by antibodies against FSH receptor caused an increase in bone mass and a reduction of body fat ( Liu et al., 2017; Rojekar et al., 2023 ). These preclinical data were confirmed in clinical studies. Large epidemiologic data have shown significant reductions in bone mineral density ( BMD ) and high resorption rates 2–3 years prior to menopause, when FSH serum levels are increasing, which is also associated with increased body weight and visceral adiposity ( Thurston et al., 2009; Senapati et al., 2014 ). A longitudinal study involving post-menopausal women has shown that increases in circulating FSH levels were associated with greater increases in the percentage of total body fat, total body fat mass, and subcutaneous adipose tissue ( Mattick et al., 2022 ). Moreover, clinical studies have found that FSH is also involved in the modulation of lean mass. A large cohort study of perimenopausal women showed that increased FSH concentrations were associated with increasing fat mass and decreasing lean mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis ( Sowers et al., 2007 ). Another recent prospective study showed that the indicators of sarcopenia were strongly associated with gonadotropins levels, especially in older men ( Guligowska et al., 2021 ). The impact of FSH on body composition may at least partially explain the observed correlation between FSH levels and the risk of cardiovascular events ( Munir et al., 2012; Silva et al

At baseline conditions no relationship was found between FSH serum levels and the following DXA-derived parameters: BMD at left hip and spine, total FBM, total LBM, lean mass at arms and legs, ALMI, ALMI/FBM ratio, and android/gynoid ratio. No correlation was also found between FSH serum levels and serum levels of either ALP or CTX. A direct relationship, although not significant, was found between FSH serum levels and FBM at arms ( r = 0. 36 ) and legs ( r = 0. 33 ) ( Table 1 ). The correlation between circulating FSH levels at 6 and 12 months, bone turnover markers evaluated at the same time, BMD and body composition parameters assessed after 12 months is shown in Table 2. FSH serum levels assessed after 6 months of degarelix administration showed a direct relationship with total FBM ( r = 0. 49, p = 0. 008 ) and with fat mass evaluated at arms ( r = 0. 53, p = 0. 004 ), trunk ( r = 0. 48, p = 0. 009 ), and legs ( r = 0. 45, p = 0. 015 ). In contrast, FSH serum levels after 6 months of treatment showed an inverse relationship with ALMI/FBM ratio ( r = −0. 58, p = 0. 001 ). FSH measured after 12 months maintained a significant relationship with total FBM ( r = 0. 52, p = 0. 006 ) ( Figure 2a ), fat mass at arms ( r = 0. 54, p = 0. 004 ) ( Figure 2b ), and fat mass at trunk ( r = 0. 45, p = 0. 018 ) ( Figure 2c ). The relationship between FSH and fat mass at legs lost the statistical significance ( r = 0. 33, p = 0. 089 ), while the inverse relationship with ALMI/FBM ratio was confirmed ( r = −0. 64, p = 0. 001 ) ( Figure 2d ).

ADT in PC patients leads to an increase in fat mass and to a decrease in lean mass, thus increasing the risk of sarcopenic obesity. In addition, ADT has also a negative impact on skeletal fragility, which increases the risk of fractures. During the recent years, there has been consistent evidence that alterations in body composition could contribute to determine skeletal fragility in patients under ADT, such as well demonstrated in other forms of male hypogonadism ( Vena et al., 2023 ). However, the determinants of altered body composition in male hypogonadism and in ADTs have not been completely defined. As a matter of fact, low testosterone values do not seem to be the only determinant of sarcopenic obesity in males with hypogonadism. In this context, FSH could play a role in the changes of body composition in PC patients undergoing ADT. In this study, we investigated the relationship between FSH levels and body composition, BMD, and bone markers at baseline and after 12 months of degare administration in patients with nonmetastatic PC. Our results suggest that F serum levels after AD could have an impact on body composition, in particular on FBM. Therefore, F could be a promising marker to monitor the risk of sarcic obesity and guide clinicians in the evaluation of body composition in PC patients undergoing AD.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation ( VT/VF ) is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolemmal ion channels, none have proven sufficiently effective for preventing SCD. Sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor 2 ( RyR2 ) Ca2+ release channels, the downstream effectors of sarcolemmal ion channels, are underexplored in this context. Recent evidence implicates reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) -mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of RyR2s in the pathophysiology of SCD. We tested the hypothesis that RyR2 inhibition of failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability, mitigates VT/VF/SCD and improves contractile function. We used a guinea pig model that replicates key clinical aspects of human nonischemic HF, such as a prolonged QT interval, a high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic SCD, and profound Ca2+ leak via a hyperactive RyR2. HF animals were randomized to receive dantrolene ( DS ) or placebo in early or chronic HF. We assessed the incidence of VT/VF and SCD ( primary outcome ), ECG heart rate and QT variability, echocardiographic left ventricular ( LV ) structure and function, immunohistochemical LV fibrosis, and sarcoplasmic RyR2 oxidation. DS treatment prevented VT/VF and SCD by decreasing dispersion of repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, DS lowered resting heart rate, preserved chronotropic competency during transient β-adrenergic challenge, and improved heart rate variability and cardiac function. Inhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene mitigates the vicious cycle of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak-induced increases in diastolic Ca2+ and ROS-mediated RyR2 oxidation, thereby reducing repolarization lability and protecting against VT/VF/SCD. Moreover, the consequent increase in sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load improves contractile function. These potentially life-saving effects of RyR2 inhibition warrant further investigation, such as clinical studies of repurposing dantrolene as a potential new therapy for heart failure and/or SCD.

   ., 2018; Wehrens, 2007; Hamilton et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020 ). Recent evidence suggests that dantrolene, a RyR2 inhibitor, reduces the inducibility of atrial fibrillation in animals with myocardial infarction ( Azam et al., 2021; Zamiri et al., 2014; Chou et al., 2014; Meissner et al., 1999 ). The effect of RyR2 inhibition on ventricular arrhythmias and non-ischemic HF has been unexplored. We hypothesized that RyR2 inhibition of failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability, mitigates VT/VF/SCD and improves contractile function. The present study employs a guinea-pig model that recapitulates key features of human non-ischemic HF including spontaneous episodes of VT/VF resulting in SCD ( Dey et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2021 ). We examine the effects of chronic dantrolene treatment on the incidence of VT/VF and SCD incidence as non-ischemic HF develops and progresses. In cross-over studies, we determine whether RyR2 inhibition reverses HF and SCD risk. The findings have important implications for repurposing dantrolene, a clinically-used RyR2 inhibitor, as a potential new therapy for HF and SCD.

To study the effects of RyR2 leak inhibition on SCD and HF, we leveraged a pressure overload guinea pig model of HF/SCD with spontaneous arrhythmias. Unique to this model is the high incidence of premature ventricular contractions ( PVCs ) and VT/VF, leading to SCD in about two-thirds of the animals within 4 weeks. Notably, the SCD occurs early on, in the first 2 weeks over the course of cardiac hypertrophy, even before the heart dilates or progresses into failure ( Dey et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2014 ). Hence, the primary endpoint of our study was SCD, and the secondary endpoint was cardiac contractility measured by echocardiography at four weeks. To determine if Dantrolene sodium ( DS ) treatment can be used as a potential therapeutic agent, we treated the HF/SCD animals with and without oral DS in the early stages of heart failure ( Figure 1A ). HF animals exhibit frequent PVCs that often trigger sustained and non-sustained VT and VF, causing SCD ( Figure 1B ). DS treatment not only drastically reduced the rate of PVCs in early and late stages of HF ( Figure 1C ), but also improved survival ( Figure 1D ). Compared to the HF group, the HF + DS group had a significantly higher rate of survival ( 55% HF vs 80% in HF +DS, p<0. 05 ). Cardiac structure and function were preserved in HF animal treated with DS as compared to the HF group. In contrast to the HF group, the HF+DS group did not display a significant dilation of the LV at the 4 week endpoint ( Figure 2A ). Echocardiography measures ( Figure 2B ) show that the relative wall thickness ( RWT ), which is a measure of the LV dimensions and is a marker for adverse events in LV dysfunction, was significantly lower in HF group as compared to control ( Figure 2C, p<0. 05 ). Progressive decline of the RWT causes the end systolic volume ( ESV ) and the end diastolic volume ( EDV ) to increase and cardiac output to decrease

SCD in heart failure ( HF ) is the leading cause of death in the modern world. Current therapies for preventing SCD due to VT/VF are limited. For example, ICDs, the only effective therapy for VT/VF and SCD, are palliative, expensive, and pose several risks. Moreover, many patients suffer from VT/VF and SCD in the early stages of HF before they become eligible to receive an ICD ( Aziz et al., 2021; Butrous et al., 1992; Krishnan et al., 2018; Richardson et al., 2018; Vaseghi et al., 2017; Yalin et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2019; Zanoni et al., 2017; Tygesen et al., 1999 ). Antiarrhythmic drugs, which target ion channels, may confer acute benefits but can also be proarrhythmic, triggering VT/VF. Importantly, most antiarrhythmic drugs worsen survival over the longer term ( Echt et al., 1991; The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial II Investigators, 1992 ). Thus, there is a pressing need to identify new antiarrhythmic targets and develop new therapies for SCD. A growing body of evidence indicates that sympathetic stress-induced hyperactivity of the RyR2, located in the SR of cardiac myocytes, causes SR Ca2+ leak, which contributes to the pathogenesis of VT/VF and SCD ( Fischer et al., 2013; Alvarado and Valdivia, 2020; Wehrens et al., 2006; Eisner et al., 2009 ). During systole, the release of Ca2+ by the RyR2 plays a pivotal role in myocyte excitation-contraction coupling. The degree of contractility is determined by the amount of Ca2+ in the SR and by the timing and magnitude of Ca2+ release. In diseased and/or stressed hearts, PKA-mediated hyper-phosphorylation and ROS-mediated oxidation results in a leaky RyR2 ( Echt et al., 1991 ), which allows Ca2+ to leak out of SR during diastole. The consequent reduction in SR Ca2+ load weakens systolic contraction. The subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+ levels also leads to DADs, which can trigger atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias ( Al-Khatib et al

Damage caused by oxidative stress alters the proteomic profile of the cell, including altering expression levels as well as the structure and function of EC-coupling proteins. This study demonstrates that inhibition of Ca2+ leak via RyR2 pauses the transition to heart failure by reducing cardiac fibrosis, increasing repolarization lability, and decreasing QT heterogeneity, improving chronotropic competency, ultimately improving LV contractility, and mitigating lethal VT/VF. Given that dantrolene is available for clinical use, future studies should evaluate its efficacy in humans with heart failure.

. Reduced contractility and increased afterload both reduce the ejection fraction and increase end-systolic volumes in failing hearts ( Figure 2D–F ). Additionally, EDV increased ( not shown ) without an increase in RWT ( Figure 2E ), indicating preserved diastolic function in the HF+ group compared to the HF group. Immunohistochemical analysis ( Figure 3 ) shows reduced fibrosis in the HF+ group compared to HF ( p< 0.05 ), indicating reduced fibrotic remodeling in the HF+ group. Immunohistochemical analysis of Ry2 ( Figure 3 ) shows reduced oxidation in the HF+ group compared to HF ( p< 0.05 ) indicating reduced oxidative stress in the HF+ group. These results suggest that Ry2 inhibition with drol mitigates the vicious cycle of sarcoplasmic Ca2 leak and ROS-mediated Ry2 oxidation, thereby reducing repolar lability and protecting against VT/SCD and improving contractile function.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Smads and their transcription factor partners mediate the transcriptional responses of target cells to secreted ligands of the transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) family, including those of the conserved bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) family, yet only a small number of direct target genes have been well characterized. In C. elegans, the BMP2/4 ortholog DBL-1 regulates multiple biological functions, including body size, via a canonical receptor-Smad signaling cascade. Here, we identify functional binding sites for SMA-3/Smad and its transcriptional partner SMA-9/Schnurri based on ChIP-seq peaks ( identified by modEncode ) and expression differences of nearby genes identified from RNA-seq analysis of corresponding mutants. We found that SMA-3 and SMA-9 have both overlapping and unique target genes. At a genome-wide scale, SMA-3/Smad acts as a transcriptional activator, whereas SMA-9/Schnurri direct targets include both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in sma-9 partially suppress the small body size phenotype of sma-3, suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors and challenging the prevailing model for Schnurri function. Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) secretory pathway, including the disulfide reductase dpy-11. Our findings indicate that Smads and SMA-9/Schnurri have previously unappreciated complex genetic and genomic regulatory interactions that in turn regulate the secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body size regulation.

    TGF-β signaling pathways regulate sets of target genes to execute biological functions in a context-dependent manner. Canonical signaling is mediated by the Smad transcription factor complex, but Smad binding sites are too degenerate and have low affinity to account for the specific context-dependent effects, so transcription factor partners must also be involved. Some of the characterized partners are cell type-specific transcription factors. In contrast, Schnurri proteins are transcriptional partners that co-regulate target genes across multiple cell types. Here, we used genome-wide RNA-seq and ChIP-seq integrated through a novel software analysis pipeline to untangle the roles of Smad and Schnurri transcription factors in the developing C. elegans larva. We chose the second larval ( L2 ) stage because Smad activity is elevated at this stage as determined by the RAD-SMAD activity reporter ( Tian et al., 2010 ), and because this stage is the earliest point at which one can observe a clear difference for one of the best-studied Smad mutant phenotypes: body size growth. Using ChIP-seq, we detected numerous SMA-3 and SMA-9 binding sites. The large number of sites could reflect the low affinity and degenerate DNA sequence recognition of known targets for their respective families of transcription factors. By using an analysis pipeline that combines BETA, which integrates ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data to identify targets, with LOA, which integrates two separate RNA-seq pairwise comparisons to identify shared DEGs, we identified nearby direct transcriptional targets based on their functional impact on transcript levels in corresponding mutants. Only a fraction of the total SMA-3 and SMA-9 sites were classified as functional based on BETA analysis of the ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets. Most SMA-3 and SMA-9 sites were not found at HOT sites, which are often considered to be non-specific binding sites typically found in open regions of chromatin

. To date, only a few direct target genes of Smads have been extensively studied, including Drosophila brinker ( Pyrowolakis et al., 2004 ) ; Xenopus mixer ( Germain et al., 2000 ) and Xvent2 ( Yao et al., 2006 ) ; and the mammalian ATF3 and Id genes ( Kang et al., 2003 ). Genome-wide studies have the potential to expand these examples and elucidate general principles of target gene selection ( Deignan et al., 2016; Chiu et al., 2014; Morikawa et al., 2011 ). More of these studies are needed to understand how Smad transcriptional partners influence target gene selection and contribute to the execution of specific biological functions. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a BMP signaling cascade initiated by the ligand DBL-1 plays a major role in body size regulation ( Suzuki et al., 1999 ). In nematodes, body size is constrained by a collagen-rich cuticle, which is secreted by an epidermal layer ( the hypodermis ) and remodeled over four successive molts during larval growth and then continuously during adulthood ( Lazetic and Fay, 2017; Page and Johnstone, 2007 ). DBL-1 signals through type I receptor SMA-6, type II receptor DAF-4, and Smads SMA-2, SMA-3, and SMA-4 ( founding members of the Smad family ), which act together in the hypodermis to promote body size growth during the earliest larval growth stages ( Gumienny and Savage-Dunn, 2013; Yoshida et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2002 ). The exact mechanism by which the DBL-1 pathway regulates body size is not fully understood, but is known to involve the regulated synthesis of cuticular collagen, of which there are over 170 genes ( Roberts et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2007; Madaan et al., 2018 ). A complete understanding of how DBL-1 regulates body size will require the identification of all direct transcriptional targets of the pathway during larval growth

. With either possibility, SMA-9 represses the expression of these genes in the absence of SMA-3. DBL-1 signaling regulates multiple developmental and physiological processes in C. elegans, including body size, lipid metabolism, innate immunity, and male tail development. Our samples were not enriched for males, precluding an analysis of targets involved in male tail development. Binding sites and their nearby regulated targets fell into three classes: SMA-3-exclusive, SMA-9-exclusive, and co-regulated. Interestingly, the GO terms for both shared and independent target genes partially overlap, suggesting broad similarity in biological functions. Within the subset of SMA-3-exclusive target genes, we noticed GO term enrichment for chaperones and factors involved in collagen secretion. Given the low affinity and degenerate nature of Smad binding sites, we speculate that additional binding factors associate with SMA-3 at these SMA-3-exclusive targets to facilitate regulation. Future studies will be needed to identify these novel partners. By contrast, the subset of SMA-9-exclusive target genes was enriched in GO terms associated with lipid metabolism and innate immunity. Although SMA-3 functions in both fat storage and pathogen resistance, respectively ( Clark et al., 2018a; Mallo et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2017; Clark et al., 2021; Zugasti and Ewbank, 2009; Ciccarelli et al., 2024a; Ciccarelli et al., 2024b ), these SMA-9-exclusive target genes imply Smad-independent roles for SMA-9 in these functions. A Smad-independent role for SMA-9 in immunity is consistent with the pronounced role of vertebrate Schnurri homologs in immunity ( Jones and Glimcher, 2010 ), which have not been reported to overlap with TGF-β-regulated functions. In vertebrates, Schnurri homologs are shown to be direct DNA-binding proteins with diverse biological functions that include TGF-β-responsive and TGF-β-independent roles

. To identify SMA-3 direct targets, differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) from the RNA-seq comparison of wild-type versus sma-3 ( wk30 ) using an FDR ≤0. 05 were compared against the genomic coordinates of SMA-3 peaks from the ChIP-seq analysis using BETA basic and the WS245 annotation of the C. elegans genome ( Wang et al., 2013 ). The following parameters were used: 3 kb from TSS, FDR cutoff of 0. 05, and one-tail KS test cutoff of 0. 05. The input files consisted of. bed files of IDR thresholded peaks and differential expression Log2FC and FDR values from the RNA-seq. An identical approach was used to identify SMA-9 direct targets using DEGs from the RNA-seq comparison of wild-type versus sma-9 ( ok1628 ). To identify direct targets co-regulated by both SMA-3 and SMA-9, the two pairwise RNA-seq comparisons ( wild-type versus sma-3 and wild-type versus sma-9 ) were analyzed, measuring DEGs for the same genes in both comparisons. Taking a conditional approach, the information from the first comparison ( wild-type versus sma-3 ) was examined to see if it affected interpretation in the second ( wild-type versus sma-9 ). Using the approach of Luperchio et al., 2021, the genes in the second comparison were split into two groups, conditional on the presence or absence of SMA-3 in the first comparison, and DE in the second. The conditional analysis was repeated for SMA-9 in the first and SMA-3 in the second. The conditional analysis was repeated for SMA-9 in the first and SMA-3 in the second. The conditional analysis was repeated for SMA-9 in the first and SMA-3 in second. The conditional analysis was repeated SMA-9 in first and SMA-3 second. The conditional was repeated for SMA- in first and SMA- second. The conditional was repeated for SMA- in and SMA. The conditional was repeated for SMA and SMA. The conditional was repeated SMA and SMA. The conditional was for SMA and SMA. The was repeated for SMA and SMA. The was repeated SMA and. The was for SMA. The was SMA.
Researchers have identified the embryonic transcription factor DUX as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation, which is aberrantly expressed in a subset of primary tumors. They found that DUX expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors, with approximately 10-50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers expressing DUX. DUX expression is associated with immune exclusion and decreased response to PD-1 blockade in a large cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients. DUX expression is a significant predictor of survival even after accounting for tumor mutational and molecular and clinical features in this cohort, with DUX expression associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year. Data motivate attempts to develop DUX as a biomarker and therapeutic for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance.

DUX expression in metastatic context is associated with reduced anti-tumor immunity, mirroring previous observations in primary and cancer cell models. DUX expression is correlated with patient survival under I treatment. The prognostic value of IF-γ activity and its redundancy relative to TMB in influencing I response is appreciated. Patients with melanoma nonresponsive to anti-CT-4 or anti-P-1/P-1 therapy have higher frequencies of genetic alterations with IF- signaling defects compared to responsive patients. DUX has been implicated in modifying IF- activity through direct inhibition of STAT via its C-terminal. Sequence analyses show DUX transcripts in metastatic contain full-length region, suggesting intact capability as STAT suppressor.

DUX expression across metastatic and controlled analyses emphasize DUX as underappreciated contributor I resistance. RS model interrogated changes importance over time, contribution DUX to prediction most prominent at later points, effects on long survival. Intriguingly, analyses revealed outsize influence ECO, measure patient status on survival early points relative other covariates. DUX remains silenced in adult somatic tissues, aside select immune sites like testis. D expression in cancer suppresses M class-mediated presentation, hypothesized DUX common in metastatic vs primary studied, where evasion important. Analyzed large cohorts metastatic patients determine frequency DUX in advanced, rigorously tested importance DUX response I well-powered cohort.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Lack of data on the aetiology of livestock diseases constrains effective interventions to improve livelihoods, food security and public health. Livestock abortion is an important disease syndrome affecting productivity and public health. Several pathogens are associated with livestock abortions but across Africa surveillance data rarely include information from abortions, little is known about aetiology and impacts, and data are not available to inform interventions. This paper describes outcomes from a surveillance platform established in Tanzania spanning pastoral, agropastoral and smallholder systems to investigate causes and impacts of livestock abortion. Abortion events were reported by farmers to livestock field officers ( LFO ) and on to investigation teams. Events were included if the research team or LFO could attend within 72 hr. If so, samples and questionnaire data were collected to investigate ( a ) determinants of attribution; ( b ) patterns of events, including species and breed, previous abortion history, and seasonality; ( c ) determinants of reporting, investigation and attribution; ( d ) cases involving zoonotic pathogens. Between 2017–2019, 215 events in cattle ( n=71 ), sheep ( n=44 ), and goats ( n=100 ) were investigated. Attribution, achieved for 19. 5% of cases, was significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid deterioration of samples. Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection. Livestock abortion surveillance, even at a small scale, can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks, reproductive losses and can identify pathogens not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance. This study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system, achieved through engagement of community-based field officers, establishment of practical sample collection and application of molecular diagnostic platforms.

    A logic model was created to provide a conceptual framework that described the logical links between the main activities, outputs, and outcomes that were expected from the programme ( Figure 7 ). The model depicts the overarching assumption that building better livestock abortion surveillance systems and strong community partnerships will lead to data-driven interventions to prevent and control infectious causes of livestock abortion and to catalyse changes in knowledge, attitudes, behaviours, or practices that could improve livestock productivity, livelihoods, and human and animal health. The abortion surveillance platform was set up in northern Tanzania through a collaboration between the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, local government authorities, and the research team. The study was undertaken from October 2017 through September 2019 in 15 wards of five districts of Arusha, Kilimanjaro, and Manyara Regions in northern Tanzania ( Figure 8 ). These study wards were selected from randomly selected wards included in earlier cross-sectional exposure studies ( Bodenham et al., 2021 ). Thirteen wards were selected at random and two additional wards were selected purposively because of strong existing relationships with the livestock-keeping community ( Thomas et al., 2022 ). These 15 wards comprised five wards that were expected to be predominantly pastoral, three were expected to be predominantly agropastoral and seven expected to predominantly smallholder, with categories assigned by the research team following discussion with local experts ( typically the district level veterinary officer; Bodenham et al., 2021 ). Recruited livestock field officers ( LFOs ) responsible for each target ward received training on the causes and safe investigation of livestock abortion. These officers are government employees that are equivalent to para-veterinarians in other settings

., 2022 ). The challenges of attribution, discussed also in Thomas et al., 2022, should not detract from the value of reporting and investigating livestock abortion cases. Recent studies have indicated that the economic costs of livestock abortion in Tanzania and impacts on food security are much more substantial than previously recognized; for example ( Semango et al., 2024 ) estimated the annual gross losses associated with abortion in Tanzania to be $262 million USD. Given these findings, data collected on the number of cases and species/breed affected will be of considerable value in highlighting the importance of this syndrome in the context of livestock productivity, household livelihoods and food security. Data from the household questionnaire indicated that livestock abortion was a common occurrence across the study area with almost a third of cattle herds and two-thirds of small ruminant herds having experienced a previous case of abortion in the preceding 12 months. This study indicated that investigated cases occurred more often than expected in non-indigenous breeds ( cross-bred and exotic cattle and cross-bred goats ) than in local breeds. This is consistent with studies reporting a four-times higher risk of abortion in cross-bred cattle in Ethiopia in comparison to local breeds ( Deresa et al., 2020 ) and studies in Nigeria ( Yakubu et al., 2015 ) and India ( Khan et al., 2016 ) reporting breed effects in relation to cattle abortion. Our results may simply reflect a higher likelihood of reporting of abortion in animals that are of higher value and more likely to be zero-grazed or tethered while grazing ( and hence abortions would be more apparent ) and for which an existing relationship with animal health services is more likely

. 8% ), and Brucella sp., and Toxoplasma gondii in one case each ( 0. 5% ). Our study draws on the operational data generated from establishment of a livestock abortion study to examine characteristics of reporting and investigation of cases of livestock abortion. While this study was not designed as a systematic or comprehensive evaluation of a surveillance system, we present data on several key attributes ( ECDC, 2014 ) of the platform, including simplicity, data quality, representativeness, timeliness, and usefulness. We discuss our findings in relation to the feasibility, practicality, and value of establishing a livestock abortion surveillance framework to support evidence-based interventions to improve livestock development, livelihoods, and human health in Africa.

. The expected number of abortions was estimated by multiplying ( a ) the number of abortion cases per head of livestock reported over a 12-month period obtained through a previous randomized cross-sectional study ( described in de Glanville et al., 2022; Supplementary file 5 ) by ( b ) the number of livestock in the ward reported by surveys conducted by LFOs from the Tanzania Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries covering a period from 2011 to 2016 ( E. Swai, unpublished data; Supplementary file 6 ). This figure was multiplied by two to account for the 24-month duration of the study. Where data were not available for a specific ward, figures were estimated from the average of other wards in the same division ( Rau ) or by current estimates provided by the LFO ( Machame Mashariki ). The determinants of event investigation were analysed to determine the number of cases that each LFO investigated and the distribution of time taken between the report and the subsequent investigation by the research team. The relationship between the time taken between a report and its subsequent investigation and the distance ( km ) of the ward from the research team headquarters ( in the town of Moshi ) was investigated using Pearson correlation analysis ( Figure 1 ). Data were recorded and summarized for: ( a ) the types of samples collected for each abortion event; ( b ) the availability of placental and foetal materials and, when not available, the reasons why these materials were not available; and ( c ) the relationship between sample types and pathogen detection and pathogen attribution. The distribution of investigated abortion cases was examined in relation to ( a ) livestock species and breed in which they occurred, ( b ) history of previous abortion cases in the aborting dams, ( c ) a history of recent stressful events affecting the pregnant dam, and ( d ) seasonality of the cases

. They were requested to ask livestock owners to report any incidents of livestock abortion, stillbirths, and peri-natal death ( hereafter referred to as abortion cases ). Cases were investigated if, following a report from the LFO, the event could be followed up within 72 hr of the abortion occurring. Full details of sample collection are provided in Thomas et al., 2022. Briefly, where available, blood, milk, and vaginal swabs were collected from the aborting dam and tissue and swab samples collected from the foetus and placental membranes. Information about the abortion event was collected and a household questionnaire ( comprised of mixed open and closed questions ) conducted to collect information on livestock demographics, livestock abortion history, the aborting dam ( age, breed ), household livestock parturition practices and household socio-economic data ( Supplementary file 3 ). Questionnaire data were only collected from abortion cases that were investigated by the research team and were used to investigate underlying patterns of abortion, risks associated with abortion cases, and operational aspects of the surveillance platform. LFOs were instructed to provide farmers with advice as to locally appropriate preventive measures that could be taken to reduce transmission or contamination risks associated with abortion cases, which included safe removal of abortion tissues from livestock-occupied areas ( e. g. burning, burying or covering the tissues in thorny branches; Supplementary file 4 ). Diagnostic results were reported back to LFOs and livestock owners within 10 days of the investigation and, where pathogens were detected, more specific advice provided as to appropriate management strategies that could minimise further transmission to livestock and people. Event data were collected using a paper-based Cardiff Teleform system ( Cardiff Inc, Vista, Ca., USA ) into an Access database ( Microsoft Corp, Va., USA )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor inducing the development and progression of various diseases. Nicotine ( NIC ) is the major constituent of cigarette smoke. However, knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated stem cell functions is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) in vivo and ex vivo. Moreover, NIC induces Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) /Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif ( TAZ ) and Notch signaling in ISCs via α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAchR ) and protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation; this effect was not detected in Paneth cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine ( DBZ ) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs. NIC enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. Hence, this study identifies a NIC-triggered pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs and suggests the use of DBZ as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors.

   . Our data indicated that NIC increased the abundance and proliferation of ISCs, which may partly explain the increased rate of intestinal tumors in smokers. In conclusion, we demonstrated that NIC enhances the ISC population via α7-nAChR as well as Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling. These findings revealed the pivotal role of NIC as a stimulant of the cancer stem cell proliferation in intestinal tumors, and thus, explains colon cancer development in cigarette smokers. The development of drugs that can block the α7-nAChR, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, and Notch signaling may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating colon cancers.

. However, knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated ISC functions and intestinal tumorigenicity is limited. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the effects of NIC treatment on the functions of murine ISCs ex vivo and in vivo. Moreover, we explored the molecular factors and signaling cascades prospectively associated with the regulation of the effects of NIC on ISCs. This study can potentially contribute to the comprehensive knowledge on the pathway by which stem cells respond to NIC, a major component of cigarette smoke, and suggest an effective new strategy for the treatment of smoking-related colon cancer.

Our data propose a model in which NIC enhances the self-renewal of ISCs via activated Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling ( Figure 5G ). Our analyses revealed an increase in the number of ISCs in NIC-treated mice. In contrast to ISCs, Paneth cells showed no increase in cell numbers in NIC-treated mice. Similarly, we assessed the functional ability of ISCs and Paneth cells in terms of ex vivo organoid formation, which indicated a NIC-induced gain-of-function in ISCs but not in Paneth cells. Hence, we propose that the increase of ISC activity induced by NIC are not dependent on Paneth cells in functional assays. Furthermore, we traced the signaling pathway in ISCs and detected that ISCs respond to NIC via α7-nAchR, PKC activation, and stimulation of Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling ( Figure 5 ). Consistent with this model, DBZ treatment inhibited Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling in mice and prevented NIC-induced ISC expansion and transformation through Apc loss. Treatment of organoids with NIC has been reported to enhance cell growth and expression of marker genes of stem cells ( Takahashi et al., 2018 ). Moreover, mRNA analysis of NIC-treated organoids showed that the expression of YAP1/TAZ and Notch1/Dll1 was upregulated after treatment with NIC ( Takahashi et al., 2020 ). This previous report predicted that NIC activates the Hippo and Notch signaling pathway in Paneth cells rather than ISCs, because the α2β4-nAChR was mainly expressed in Paneth cells ( Takahashi et al., 2020 ). However, the hypothesis was not fully testified in the report. In contrast, our analysis validates that NIC affects ISC rather than Panth cells via Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling activated though nAchRa7 by mRNA and protein analyses of sorted ISCs or Paneth cells and ex vivo functional assays. The crosstalk between Hippo, Notch, and Wnt signaling regulates mammalian intestinal homeostasis ( Totaro et al., 2018; Khoramjoo et al., 2022; Li et al

., 2014; Sancho et al., 2015 ) and Notch signaling is positively regulated by YAP/TAZ in the intestine ( Zhou et al., 2011 ). Hence, we examined Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling. YAP1 and TAZ expression was significantly induced in the crypts of NIC-treated mice ( Figure 4C ). YAP1 and TAZ also upregulated at mRNA level in ISCs from NIC mice ( Figure 4D ). Moreover, activation of Notch signaling in crypts of NIC-treated mice was confirmed through immunoblotting assay ( Figure 4E ). The expression of genes, including Jagged1, HeyL, Hes1, Hes5, and Dll1, involved in Notch signaling, significantly increased in ISCs obtained from NIC-treated mice ( Figure 4D ). Notably, Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling were not significantly activated in Paneth cells, indicating that NIC affects α7-nAchR of ISCs rather than Paneth cells. Collectively, these results suggest that NIC induces a Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signal pathway in ISCs via activation of α7-nAchR and PKC. To further explore the role of the Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling in NIC-induced ISC expansion, ISCs were cultured with NIC in the presence of either K-975, a specific inhibitor of transcriptional enhanced associate domain ( TEAD ), which binds to its transcriptional co-activators YAP or TAZ and forms a transcription complex ( Kaneda et al., 2020 ), or γ-secretase inhibitor MK-0752 that inhibits the cleavage of Notch into its active signaling effector, Notch intracellular domain ( NICD ) ( Krop et al., 2012 ). Treatment with K-975 and MK-0752 completely abolished the NIC-induced increased organoid formation ( Figure 5A and B ). Furthermore, K-975 or MK-0752 prevented the increase in the organoid formation in ISCs treated with PNU 298987 or Ingenol-3-angelate ( Figure 5C–F ), suggesting that YAP/Notch signaling acts downstream of α7-nAchR or PKC leading to the response of ISC to NIC ( Figure 5G )

All tissues and organs are generated from stem cells. Abnormal stem cell functions are significantly associated with age-related organ dysfunction and carcinogenesis ( Adams et al., 2015 ). Intestinal epithelial turnover is sustained by intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) and adjacent Paneth cells. Paneth cells constitute the niche for ISCs that reside at the bottom of the crypts. Most of the ISCs are leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 ( Lgr5 ) +ones that regulate intestinal homeostasis in response to dietary signals ( Igarashi and Guarente, 2016; Yilmaz et al., 2012 ). In the intestine, Lgr5 +ISCs are possibly the origin of precancerous adenomas ( Barker et al., 2009 ). For instance, long-term high-fat diet ( HFD ) -induced obesity enhances the self-renewal potential of ISC and promotes in vivo formation of tumors via the induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta in ISCs ( Beyaz et al., 2016 ). Moreover, cigarette smoking has emerged as a potential major risk factor associated with colon cancer, along with metabolic risk factors such as diet and obesity. Previous studies indicate that cigarette smoking is significantly associated with colon cancer and mortality in humans ( Botteri et al., 2008 ) and animal models ( Kim et al., 2008 ). Cigarette smoke contains a wide range of compounds that are harmful to human health; nicotine ( NIC ) derivatives 4- ( methylnitrosamino ) –1- ( 3-pyridyl ) –1-butanone ( NNK ) and N'-nitrosonornicotine ( NNN ) are highly carcinogenic ( Brunnemann and Hoffmann, 1991; Schuller et al., 1995 ), which can induce mutations in tumor suppressive genes like Rasa, Trp53, and Rb ( Sekido et al., 2003 ). Although NIC itself, the addictive component in cigarette smoke, is generally considered to have a limited ability to initiate cancer, it can stimulate several effects crucial for cancer development independently ( Schaal and Chellappan, 2014 )

A study investigated the effects of nicotine (NIC) on murine intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in vivo and ex vivo. NIC increased the abundance and proliferative activity of ISCs, which may explain the increased rate of intestinal tumors in smokers. NIC enhanced ISC via α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACh) and protein kinase (PK) activation, Hippo-associated protein (Y) transcriptional activator with PD-binding motif (TAZ) and Notch signaling. This effect was not detected in Pan cells. Inhibition of Notch by dibenzepine (DB) nullified the effects of NIC on IS. NIC enhanced in vivo formation of tumors from IS after loss of tumor suppressor gene APC, DB inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. The study identified NIC-triggered pathway regulating stemness and tumorigenicity of IS and suggests DB as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors. NIC increased the population of IS via α7ACh as well as Hipp-Y/TA and Not signaling. Findings revealed the role of NIC as a stimulant of cancer cell proliferation in intestinal tumors, explaining colon cancer in smokers. Development of drugs blocking αA, Hipp-Y/TA, and Not signaling may provide a therapeutic for colon cancers. NIC enhanced self-renew of IS via activated Hipp-Y/TA and Not signaling. Analyses revealed increase in IS in NIC-treated mice. In contrast, Pan cells showed no increase in NIC-treated mice. Functional assays indicated NIC-induced gain in IS but not Pan cells. NIC responded via αA, PK, activation, and stimulation of Hipp-YTA and Not signaling. Consistent with this, DB treatment inhibited Hipp-YTA and Not signaling in mice and prevented NIC-induced expansion and transformation through APC loss. Organoids treated with NIC enhanced growth and expression of stem marker genes. mRNA analysis NIC-treated showed upregulation of Y1TA and Not1. Previous reported NIC activates Hipp and Not signaling in Pan rather IS, α2A was mainly expressed in Pan. However, this was not validated. Analysis validated NIC affects IS rather Pan via Hipp-YTA and Not activated nA by mRNA and protein of IS or Pan cells and functional assays. Crosstalk between Hipp, Not, and W regulates mammalian homeostasis and Not is regulated by Y in intestine. Y1 and T were induced in NIC-treated crypts. Also upregulated in IS from NIC mice. Activation Not in NIC-treated crypts confirmed immunoblot. Genes including Jagged, Hey, Hes, H5, and D1 in Not signaling increased IS from NIC mice. Not, Hipp-Y and Not were not activated in Pan cells, indicating NIC αA of IS rather Pan cells. Collectively, NIC induces Hipp-Y and Not in IS via activation αA and PK. To explore role Hipp-Y and Not in NIC-induced expansion, IS were cultured NIC with K975, a inhibitor of transcriptional coactivator Y or γ-secretase MK-2 that inhibits cleavage Not into NICD. Treatment K and MK-2 abolished NIC-induced organ formation. K or MK-2 prevented increase in IS treated PNU or Ingen-3.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Hsp70 is a key cellular system counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, associated with stress, ageing, and disease. Hsp70 solubilises aggregates and aids protein refolding through substrate binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaperones: J-domain proteins ( JDPs ) and nucleotide exchange factors ( NEFs ). Here, we elucidate the collaborative impact of Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes throughout Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing. We show that Hsp110 plays a major role at initial stages of disaggregation, determining its final efficacy. The NEF catalyses the recruitment of thick Hsp70 assemblies onto aggregate surface, which modifies aggregates into smaller species more readily processed by chaperones. Hsp70 stimulation by Hsp110 is much stronger with class B than class A JDPs and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction. Such destabilisation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface might improve disaggregation, but also lead to the inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum. Thus, balanced interplay between the co-chaperones and Hsp70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential.

   . Here, we demonstrate that the interplay between Hsp110 and Hsp70 in disaggregation strictly relies on the class of a JDP and unravel the critical role of the B-class-specific interaction with the EEVD motif of Hsp70 for the Hsp110-dependent stimulation. Furthermore, we elucidate differential contribution of the NEF across different phases of protein recovery from aggregates. We employ biolayer interferometry ( BLI ) to investigate the Hsp110 impact on the formation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface and we assess changes in aggregates’ properties associated with the abundant chaperone binding. Finally, we address a question of the competition between the NEF and JDP co-chaperones. Our findings shed new light on the mechanisms behind the potentiation and inhibition of the disaggregation activity of Hsp70 by its co-chaperones.

Our results uncover a comprehensive picture of the role of Hsp110 co-chaperones in aggregate processing by the Hsp70 system. Potentiation of the Hsp70 activity by the NEF strongly depends on the class of the JDP and the preference for class B, conserved in yeast and human orthologs, relies on Hsp70 binding through the EEVD motif. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hsp110-dependent stimulation of disaggregation is limited to its initial stages: chaperone recruitment to aggregates and their disassembly, but not final protein folding ( Figure 5 ). The initial Hsp110-dependent loading of more Hsp70 onto aggregates correlates with their remodelling into smaller aggregated species, which improves their recognition by the Hsp104 disaggregase. We also gained insight into the biphasic impact of Hsp110: with increasing Sse1 level, the stimulation is overshadowed by inhibition and the contribution of each trend depends on the phase of disaggregation and the composition of the disaggregating system, with a crucial role of the NEF’s affinity for Hsp70. Finally, we show that the disaggregation inhibition by Hsp110 involves disruption of the Hsp70-JDP interaction, suggesting competition between JDP and Hsp110 co-chaperones. The balance between the partners within the Hsp70 system is key for efficient disaggregation, as an individual co-chaperone with a critical function at one step may inhibit another. To investigate this differential contribution, we used biochemical assays reflecting individual stages of protein disaggregation. The results of the BLI experiments show that Hsp110 with class B JDP ( JDPB ) greatly increases Hsp70 aggregate binding ( Figure 1B and C, Figure 1—figure supplements 1E, F and 2A ), which correlates with the final reactivation yield ( Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1H ), implying that the initiation phase determines the overall disaggregation efficiency

During stress, protein homeostasis is perturbed by protein misfolding and aggregation. Accumulation of protein aggregates disrupts cellular functions and contributes to ageing and is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases ( Hartl et al., 2011; Morimoto, 2008 ). A protein quality control system, relying on a network of cooperating chaperones, has evolved to moderate stress-induced proteotoxicity and rebalance proteostasis. To refold proteins from aggregates into their native state, eukaryotes use a system comprising Hsp70, an ATP-dependent chaperone, and its co-chaperones: an Hsp110 nucleotide exchange factor ( NEF ) and a J-domain protein ( JDP/Hsp40 ), together with an Hsp100 disaggregase ( Glover and Lindquist, 1998 ). The process is initiated by a JDP, which delivers Hsp70 to an aggregated substrate and whose J-domain induces ATP hydrolysis in Hsp70, resulting in conformational changes that stabilise the interaction with aggregates ( Rohland et al., 2022 ). Next, Hsp100 interacts with the Hsp70-aggregate complex and the aggregate-trapped polypeptides are translocated through the Hsp100 hexamer. The disentangled and released polypeptides can fold back into their native conformation, alone or with further aid of chaperones ( Lum et al., 2004; Schaupp et al., 2007; Seyffer et al., 2012; Weibezahn et al., 2004; Zietkiewicz et al., 2004 ). Hsp110 co-chaperone boosts the Hsp70 activity by stimulating nucleotide exchange and substrate release ( Dragovic et al., 2006; Raviol et al., 2006; Shaner et al., 2005 ). It belongs to the Hsp70 superfamily, with identical domain organisation to Hsp70 but distinct size and arrangement of the nucleotide-binding domain ( NBD ) and substrate-binding domain ( SBD ) ( Easton et al., 2000; Liu and Hendrickson, 2007 ). In contrast to Hsp70, Hsp110 is unable to refold denatured proteins, yet it may bind to and prevent aggregation of certain misfolding substrates ( Garcia et al

. Hsp104mut does not require Hsp70 for allosteric activation and aggregate binding and it can serve as an indicator of Hsp70-dependent aggregate modification by facilitating final reactivation of its products ( Chamera et al., 2019 ). When heat-aggregated GFP was initially incubated with Ssa1-Sis1-Sse1, which yielded very low protein recovery, we added Hsp104mut and observed much faster and more effective GFP reactivation than when the substrate was first incubated with Ssa1-Sis1 only ( Figure 2A ). In an analogous experiment with Ydj1, we also observed stimulation by Sse1, yet not as strong as in the presence of Sis1 ( Figure 2A ). Aggregate remodelling by Hsp70-JDP, improved by Hsp110, might induce changes limited to the aggregate surface, such as partial polypeptide disentanglement that uncovers additional chaperone-binding sites, or also lead to global rearrangements, changing aggregate size and total exposed surface area, e. g., through partial aggregate dissolution and fragmentation. To shed light on this, we visualised the aggregates of luciferase C-terminally fused with GFP using fluorescence microscopy. After heat denaturation, approximately 80% of luciferase-GFP aggregates had the size of 2 µm or more ( Figure 2B ). Incubation with Ssa1-Sis1 for 1 hr decreased the fraction of aggregates larger than 2 µm to 25. 8%, whereas the addition of Sse1 reduced it to 12. 5% ( Figure 2B ). At the same time, the activity remained at the level of 1–2% of the native luciferase-GFP and only the presence of Hsp104-Hsp70 led to its substantial recovery ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ). The reduced size of luciferase-GFP aggregates by Hsp70 depended on ATP and the aggregate size was only moderately affected by Ssa1-Ydj1, irrespective of the presence of Sse1 ( Figure 2B ). We also measured the size of aggregates using dynamic light scattering ( DLS )

. The fate of the displaced proteins is yet to be established, presumably at low Hsp110 levels, they may re-bind at another site on the substrate or to the aggregate-bound chaperones. At high Hsp110 levels, the JDPB-Hsp70 interaction is very strongly affected, similarly as aggregate binding and disaggregation ( Figures 3A, B, D, 4A and B ), suggesting that the proteins released by Hsp110 do not re-bind or that any subsequent binding is non-productive. The apparent competition between the co-chaperones is reflected in the fact that the inhibition by Hsp110 is moderated at increasing Sis1 level ( Figure 4C ). Interestingly, the class B JDP also exerts an inhibitory effect on Hsp at high S1 levels ( Figure 4 ), which is not observed with A-class JDP ( Figure 4 ). The inhibitory effect of class BDP on Hsp at high S1 is not due to competition with H110 for the EE motif of H70 ( Figure 4— supplement 1 ), but may be related to the interaction between BDP and H70 ( Figure 4— supplement 1 ). The inhibitory effect of BDP on Hsp at high S1 is not due to competition with H110 for the EE motif H70 ( Figure— supplement 1 ) but may be related the interaction between B and H70 (— supplement 1 ) The inhibitory effect of BDP on Hsp at S1 is not due to competition H110 for EE motif H70 (— supplement ) but may be related interaction B and H (— supplement ) The inhibitory of B on H at S is not due competition H110 for EE H ( supplement ) but may related B and H ( supplement ) The inhibitory B on H at S is not due H110 for EE ( supplement but related B and supplement The inhibitory on H at S not due H for ( supplement but related The inhibitory B on S not H due for ( but related The inhib on S not H due ( but related The inhib on not H due ( but The inhib on not ( but The inhib ( but The inhib ( but The inhib ( but The inhib but ( The but inhib but The but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but
Researchers developed a machine learning model to analyze gait data from digital insoles to diagnose and monitor knee osteoarthritis. The model was trained on force plate data from participants with and without knee osteoarthritis and achieved high accuracy in predicting force data from a separate validation set and an independent insole dataset. The study showed that digital insole-derived gait characteristics are comparable to traditional gait measurements and that a single stride of raw sensor data can be assigned to a subject, indicating that individuals can be identified by their gait. The work provides a framework for an alternative to traditional gait analysis methods and supports the development of at-home assessments, potentially improving ease and frequency of patient monitoring.

The study aimed to clinically validate digital insole measurements in those with knee osteoarthritis by developing a machine learning framework based on standard force plate data and applying it to insoles to detect osteoarthritis and processed insole gait outcomes and raw signals to identify disease-specific patterns. Clinical validity is the ability to provide meaningful measures, including detection of disease patterns relative to controls and identification of subject-specific gait. Future work will determine g outcome accuracy and error.

The study built a model using data from plates and insoles and showed disease classification. The platform-agnostic analysis demonstrates that machine learning can support biomarkers and yield clinical endpoints. The finding that models can identify g patterns suggests data from insoles may detect changes in patterns, providing understanding of therapeutic impact on individuals. The work supports that technology may provide value in healthcare, aiding diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression or response to treatment.

The study used walking speed as a variable of OA and found it discriminated between OA and controls. The insole demonstrated high predictive power. Derived g characteristics excluded strongly correlated to speed showed better accuracy. The most discriminating parameters included takeoff dynamics, force, mean velocity, and g line parameters. Flattened strides from sensor data were predictive. The study evaluated contribution of each sensor to disease accuracy.

The study used ground reaction force data from plates and insoles and observed similar means across platforms. Distinct patterns between OA and controls were observed. Individuals with OA displayed a different g signature, with a flatter curve during middle phase. A dimension reduction approach separated subjects by OA status rather than platform. The insole data recapitulated force data.

The study sought to determine subject-specific g signatures and found that models can identify individuals from a single stride. This suggests g data has ability to identify attributes beyond disease. The question was posed irrespective of state and focused on identifying optimal method to determine individual g pattern. The approached via commonly used in clinical settings. The first is individuality of g patterns. The second understanding methodology captures features with time. By analogy, facial software identifies people regardless of accessories.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Pain after surgery causes significant suffering. Opioid analgesics cause severe side effects and accidental death. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid therapies for managing post-surgical pain. Local application of Clarix Flo ( FLO ), a human amniotic membrane ( AM ) product, attenuated established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity without exhibiting known side effects of opioid use in mice. This effect was achieved through direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways. We further purified the major matrix component, the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 ( HC-HA/PTX3 ) from human AM that has greater purity and water solubility than FLO. HC-HA/PTX3 replicated FLO-induced neuronal and pain inhibition. Mechanistically, HC-HA/PTX3-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements to inhibit sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive DRG neurons, suggesting it is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. Moreover, we unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3.

   . These findings suggest that the full HC-HA/PTX3 complex is superior to HMW-HA in attenuating post-surgical pain. Using in vivo calcium imaging of DRG, we have demonstrated that intra-paw injection of FLO significantly reduced the activation of nociceptive neurons in the ganglia to peripheral noxious stimulation ( Figure 2 ), possibly through inhibiting the transduction of ‘pain’ signals at the peripheral nerve terminals, leading to the alleviation of post-surgical pain ( Figure 1 ). Due to the technical challenges and limitations of in vivo optical imaging and recording at nerve terminals in skin, we subsequently used cultured DRG neurons to examine the receptor mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in neuron inhibition by FLO. Since HC-HA/PTX3 mimics FLO in its ability to inhibit pain behavior and has higher purity and greater water solubility compared to FLO, it is well-suited for investigating cellular mechanisms. In cultured lumbar DRG neurons from WT mice, HC-HA/PTX3 exerted inhibitory effects in both calcium imaging ( Figure 3C–F ) and patch-clamp electrophysiology studies ( Figure 3G, H ). Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 ( TRPV1 ), transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 ( TRPA1 ), and mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor D ( MrgprD ) -expressing DRG neurons are critical to heat and mechanical pain signaling ( Cavanaugh et al., 2009 ). Applying capsaicin ( a TRPV1 agonist ), cinnamaldehyde ( a TRPA1 agonist ), or β-alanine ( a MrgprD agonist ) to bath solution increased intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i in 41%, 24%, or 17% of DRG neurons ( Domocos et al., 2020; Tiwari et al., 2016 ). Here, HC-HA/PTX3 ( 15 μg/ml ) significantly reduced the [Ca2+]i increase produced by these proalgesics. However, HMW-HA ( 15 μg/ml ) was not effective at the same concentration ( Figure 3C–F )

Our study suggests that human birth tissue products may be deployed as a viable biologic to treat post-surgical pain. We further identified HC-HA/PTX3 as the primary bioactive component responsible for pain inhibition. It induced an acute cytoskeleton rearrangement and inhibition of INav and HVA-Ica currents in a CD44-dependent manner, making it a promising non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. Nevertheless, translation of preclinical findings into clinical treatments is complex and often challenging due to species differences and the intricate nature of pain etiology in patients. Our findings provide an important rational for future clinical trials to validate the utility of FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 for post-surgical pain control.

. However, the mechanisms underlying its potential pain-inhibitory properties and how it may affect sensory neuron excitability remain unknown. In a plantar-incision mouse model of post-surgical pain, we first explored whether FLO may be deployed as a viable biologic for the treatment of trauma pain. We then purified the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 ( HC-HA/PTX3 ), which is in uniquely high amounts in human AM. The natural process of HC-HA/PTX3 formation may involve: Tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 protein covalently binds to HC1 of inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor and then transfers it to high-molecular-weight hyaluronan ( HMW-HA ). At this point, HC1 becomes conjugated, and tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 is released. PTX3 then tightly associates with the HC1–HA complex by binding to the HC1. HC-HA/PTX3 was recently shown to alleviate dry eye disease induced by chronic graft-versus-host disease by suppressing inflammation and scarring in murine lacrimal glands ( Ogawa et al., 2017 ). We hence investigated whether HC-HA/PTX3 is a key bioactive component mediating the pain relief effects of FLO and further examined its mode of action. Our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. Moreover, we unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3.

. Intrinsic membrane excitability ( IME ) is a property of a neuron that refers to its general state of excitability, which is reflected in part by its ability to generate action potentials ( APs ). IME of lumbar DRG neurons from WT mice after plantar-incision was measured 24 hr after dissociation. In small DRG neurons, HC-HA/PTX3 concentration-dependently hyperpolarized the membrane potential ( 5, 10, and 25 μg/ml, Figure 3G, I ), and increased the rheobase ( Figure 3H, J ), indicating decreased neuronal excitability. However, HC-HA/PTX3 ( 10 μg/ml ) did not significantly affect the IME of large neurons ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ). These findings suggest that HC-HA/PTX3 may attenuate the activation of key receptors involved in pain control such as TRPV1, TRPA1, and MrgprD. Additionally, it fundamentally decreases nociceptor excitability by inducing membrane hyperpolarization and altering intrinsic membrane properties. CD44 is a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein that functions as a cell surface adhesion receptor, regulating essential physiologic and pathologic processes ( Campo et al., 2010; Janiszewska et al., 2010 ). CD44 is the principal receptor for HA ( Ferrari et al., 2018 ). Since HMW-HA is a primary component of the HC-HA/PTX3 complex, we explored whether CD44 is required for the inhibition of post-surgical pain by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3. CD44 is expressed in both neurons and glial cells ( Dzwonek and Wilczynski, 2015 ), but its distribution in the DRG was unclear. In mouse DRG, CD44 immuno-reactivity highly colocalized with Na-K ATPase alpha1, a neuron surface marker, but presented at a much lower level in satellite glial cells ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ). The specificity of the CD44 antibody was validated in CD44 knockout ( KO ) mice ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) and by a previous study ( Protin et al., 1999 )

., 2009 ). HC-HA/PTX3 was suggested to be a biologically active component with uniquely high amounts in human birth tissues ( Chen et al., 2015; He et al., 2009; He et al., 2014 ). However, it remains unclear whether HC-HA/PTX3, as a key component, is responsible for FLO’s inhibitory effects on neuron activation and pain. Like FLO, intra-paw injection of HC-HA/PTX3 dose-dependently ( 10–20 μg ) induced heat antinociception in naive WT mice and attenuated heat hypersensitivity developed in the hindpaw after plantar-incision ( Figure 3A ). Moreover, HC-HA/PTX3-induced pain inhibition was comparable between male and female mice after plantar-incision ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ). HMW-HA, a major component of HC-HA/PTX3, was suggested to attenuate inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain induced by the cancer chemotherapy paclitaxel ( Bonet et al., 2020; Bonet et al., 2021b; Bon et al. 2022 ). However, in our study, HM-HA was not effective at same concentration as HC-HA/PT3 ( Figure 3C–F ) suggesting that HC/PT3 is the bioactive component of HC/PT3.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) cells show heterogeneous levels of pigmentation when cultured in vitro. To know whether their color in appearance is correlated with the function of the RPE, we analyzed the color intensities of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cells ( iPSC-RPE ) together with the gene expression profile at the single-cell level. For this purpose, we utilized our recent invention, Automated Live imaging and cell Picking System ( ALPS ), which enabled photographing each cell before RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of each cell. While our iPSC-RPE were categorized into four clusters by gene expression, the color intensity of iPSC-RPE did not project any specific gene expression profiles. We reasoned this by less correlation between the actual color and the gene expressions that directly define the level of pigmentation, from which we hypothesized the color of RPE cells may be a temporal condition not strongly indicating the functional characteristics of the RPE.

   . Our recent invention, ALPS, enables the characterization of a cell that is actually showing a behavior of interest ( Jin et al., 2023 ). While monitoring the cells in live, ALPS enables to pick up one single-cell for further manipulation. In the present study, we utilized this system to monitor the color of iPSC-RPE cells, then to pick up one of the cells, followed by RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of that single-cell. In this way, we concluded the color of iPSC-RPE cells did not project any specific gene expression profile. We reasoned this by analyzing the correlation between the color and the expression level of each gene. We found the genes that define pigmentation itself had less correlation with the color, suggesting the color in appearance is a temporal condition that does not directly represent the function of the RPE.

. Several attempts were made to re-pigment RPE cells by supplying them with melanosomes isolated from ex vivo RPE cells ( Boulton, 2014 ) or more recently with artificial melanin-like nanoparticles ( Kwon et al., 2022 ). In accordance with decreased amount of melanin in adult RPE, primary cultured adult RPE cells are less pigmented ( Boulton, 2014 ). On the other hand, primary culture of fetal-derived RPE cells, although less pigmented initially, becomes heavily pigmented when confluent monolayers are formed ( Maminishkis et al., 2006 ), reflecting the nature of melanosomes produced during a limited time window of embryogenesis ( Boulton, 2014 ). More importantly, human embryonic stem cell ( ESC ) - or iPSC-derived RPE cells exhibit pigmentation when they become confluent ( Boulton, 2014; Kamao et al., 2014 ) suggesting these cells may retain or have been reprogrammed to gain the characteristics of fetal RPE cells. The Lonza-RPE cells ( line #476621 ) used in this study were fetal-derived. Our iPSC-RPE formed different clusters from Lonza-RPE by single-cell transcriptome analysis, which was consistent with our previous study showing the gene expression pattern of our iPSC-RPE was slightly different from Lonza-RPE, although it was closer than human RPE cell-line ARPE19, ( Kamao et al., 2014 ). Interestingly, the pigmentation level of Lonza-RPE cells correlated with their gene expression profile ( Figure 2D ), which may reflect the developmental process of RPE that gains protective function, including melanogenesis, during embryogenesis. From this aspect, ESC- or iPSC-derived RPE cells may be more plastic, retaining immature profiles although apparently being pigmented spontaneously. In fact, there are several lines of evidence implying in vitro pigmentation of stem cell-derived RPE cells may not necessarily reflect their levels of functional maturation

. For example, bone marrow-derived RPE cells that are poorly pigmented in vitro become highly pigmented when transplanted ( Sengupta et al., 2009 ), as well as our iPSC-RPE cells that are not pigmented when prepared but actually become heavily pigmented after engrafted ( Mandai et al., 2017; Sugita et al., 2020 ), suggest the significance of environmental niche for melanogenesis. When stem cell-derived RPE cells are cultured in vitro, they are apparently not pigmented at sparse density, probably due to dilution amongst daughter cells ( Boulton, 2014 ) or secretion of melanin by the fusion of melanosome membrane to the plasma membrane as proposed in melanocytes ( Moreiras et al., 2021 ), but they become pigmented when they form a confluent monolayer, which is a reversible effect as the dynamics of pigmentation repeats when they are re-plated at a sparse density and become confluent again ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). This again suggests the involvement of extracellular cues for pigmentation, besides the intrinsic characteristics of each RPE cell. Indeed, it has been shown that in vitro pigmentations of RPE cells are enhanced by extracellular matrix ( Boulton, 2014 ) or even more intriguingly by phagocytosis of rod outer segments ( Schraermeyer et al., 2006 ). Without the exposure to pathogens or photoreceptor outer segments, in vitro pigmentation of iPSC-RPE cells could be somewhat a spontaneous but not a necessary sign to show they are prone to execute their protective function.

iPSC-RPE cells were produced from two human iPSC-lines of the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application ( CiRA; iPSC-lines 201B7 and 253G1 ). The quality of the generated iPSC-RPE cells were verified by the expressions of RPE65, Bestrophin, CRALBP, and MERTK by quantitative PCR; PAX6, MiTF, and Bestrophin by immunostaining; and PEDF and VEGF by ELISA. Hexagonal morphology and pigmentation were also confirmed qualitatively ( Figure 1A ). Normally the degree of pigmentation of RPE cells increases during the culture period, culminating when the cells become confluent, and returns less pigmented when they are replated at sparse density. It is also normal that even at the most confluent state, RPE cells show diverse degrees of pigmentation ( Figure 1A ). To characterize the cells with different degrees of pigmentation, 2304 cells of iPSC-RPE ( 96 cells each from two different dishes of 12 independent cultures of iPSC201B7-RPE and iPSC253G1-RPE cultured for 6 and 12 weeks; Figure 1—source data 1 ) were photographed under a light microscope ( Figure 1B photos ) and picked as single-cells by ALPS. The intensities of red, green, and blue channels were measured for each cell ( Figure 1B plots ). Because of the strong correlation ( r>0. 99 ) between the three channels ( Figure 1—video 1 ), we used the intensity of the blue channel, or the average intensity of the three channels ( so-called brightness ), as a proxy for the color intensity of each cell. The iPSC-RPE cells photographed and picked by ALPS were then subjected to RNA extraction followed by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. To compare the gene expression profiles of our iPSC-RPE lines with other commercially available RPE cells, human fetal primary RPE cells purchased from Lonza were photographed and picked by ALPS after cultured for 6 and 12 weeks as well ( Figure 1—source data 1 )

In this study, we showed the degree of pigmentation of in vitro cultured iPSC-RPE cells did not project specific gene ontological clusters, although it correlated to some extent with the expressions of functional genes of the RPE, such as complement- and lysosome-related genes. Eye, as well as brain and testis, is an immune privilege organ, where inflammation by the immune system is minimized ( Zhou and Caspi, 2010; Chen et al., 2019; Mohan et al., 2022 ). To protect the photoreceptors from pathogens in this immune suppressive environment, RPE has an immune cell-like aspect with the capability of complement activation ( Kunchithapautham et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2019; Jensen et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020; Schäfer et al., 2020 ) and phagocytosis ( Boulton, 2014; Lehmann et al., 2014 ). Although it was weak, the correlation of complement- and lysosome-related genes to the color shown in the present study, suggests the darker RPE cells may be prone to facilitate these functions. Besides these immunogenic aspects, pigmentation also confers a protective function on RPE from different biological aspects. The material of the dark pigments, melanin, is conserved from bacteria to mammals, with diverse protective functions against damaging ultraviolet rays, free radicals, or toxins ( D’Alba and Shawkey, 2019 ). In most species, melanin pigments are confined in an intracellular organelle called melanosome. In the eye, melanosomes are located in RPE cells and choroidal melanocytes, where they protect photoreceptors from oxidative stress and light-induced damage ( Boul,2014 ). Melanosomes in R cells are also involved in phagocytosis ( Bton 2014 ). In the present study, we found a weak correlation between melanin-related genes and the color intensity of iPSC-R cells, suggesting that pigmentation may not be a direct indicator of the level of melanin in R cells. This is consistent with previous studies showing that melanin in R cells is not directly correlated with pigmentation in vitro ( Boul,2014 ) or in vivo ( Kwon et al,202 ). In fact, melanin in R cells can be present without pigmentation ( Boul,201 ) and pigmentation can occur without melanin ( Boul,201 ), suggesting that pigmentation and melanin are not directly correlated in R cells. In addition to melanin, other pigments are present in R cells, such as lipofuscin and carotenoids ( Boul,201 ), which also have protective functions against oxidative stress and light-induced damage ( Boul,201 ). These pigments are present in melanosomes in R cells ( Boul,201 ) and are involved in phagocyt ( Bton 201 ). In the present study, we found a weak correlation between lipofus and caroten-related genes and the color of iP-R cells, suggesting that pigmentation may not be a direct indicator of the level of these pigments in R cells. This is consistent with previous studies showing that lipof and caroten in R are not correlated with pigmentation in vitro ( Boul,201 ) or in vivo (won et al,202 ). In fact, lip and caroten in R can be present without pigmentation ( Boul201 ) and pigmentation can occur without lip and caroten ( B,201 ) suggesting that pigmentation and lip caroten are not directly in R cells. 

The results of the present study suggest that the color of iPSC-R cells is not a direct indicator of their functional characteristics as R. This is consistent with previous studies showing that pigmentation of R cells in vitro is not correlated with their function ( Boul,201 ) or in vivo (won et,202 ). In fact, pigmentation of R cells can occur without function ( Boul201 ) and function can occur without pigmentation (oul,201 ) suggesting that pigmentation and function are not directly related in R. The results also suggest that pigmentation of iP-R cells may be influenced by extracellular cues, such as extracellular matrix ( Boul,201 ) or phagocyt of outer segments (Schermeyer et al,2006 ) rather than intrinsic characteristics of each R cell. This is consistent with studies showing that pigmentation of R cells is enhanced by extracellular ( Boul,201 ) or phocyt of outer segments (Scherm et2006 ). The results also suggest that pigmentation of iP-R cells is not a necessary for their function as R. This is consistent with studies showing that pigmentation R is not necessary for function ( Boul201 ) and function can occur without pigmentation (oul201 ) suggesting that pigmentation and function are not directly related in R. The results also suggest that pigmentation iP-R may be a temporal condition rather than a characteristic of R. This is consistent with studies showing that pigmentation R is a temporal ( Boul201 ) and can change over time (oul201 ). The results also suggest that pigmentation iP-R may be influenced by environmental factors such as culture conditions ( Boul,201 ) rather than intrinsic characteristics of R. This is consistent with studies that pigmentation R is influenced by culture (oul201 ) and can change over time (201 ). The results suggest that pigmentation iP-R may not be a reliable indicator of their function as R. This is consistent with
Researchers in the field of neuroscience have recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in their natural environments to gain insights into ethologically relevant processes and neural mechanisms. The common marmet (Callithrix jacch) has emerged as a model for this effort due to its small size, prosocial nature, and genetic proximity to humans. However, traditional research methods fail to capture nuances of marmet interactions and cooperative behaviors. To address this, the Marmet Apparatus for Automated Pulling (MAAP) was developed, a novel apparatus for studying cooperative behaviors in marmets. MAAP addresses limitations of traditional research by enabling high-throughput, detailed outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for nuanced analyses in naturalistic settings. It also accommodates a range of behaviors and animal capabilities, providing a platform for investigations of neural activity underlying social behaviors. MAAP is a versatile tool advancing understanding primate behavior and cognitive processes, bridging ethologically relevant animal studies and neural investigations.

The MAAP incorporates behavioral metrics from video and audio with timing of mets pulling behaviors and reward, providing a comprehensive understanding of interplay between behavior, communication, and interactions. It offers rich data and flexibility for various tasks, creating an avenue for neural recordings while mets are engaged in tasks. MAAP significantly increases trials for analysis, ensuring statistical power investigating neural and behaviors. Reproducible lever-pulling in mets in natural context balances conventional tests, where are immobilized and lack movement, and natural studies, exhibit unrestrained but lack benchmarks (Fan et al, 202; Knll et 2018). To validate MAAP, neural recordings were conducted using a silicon-based probe while mets engaged in cooperative task, isolating activity from prefrontal cortex. Each mets performed 10 sessions of Mutual task and 10 Selfeward, synchronizing behavioral and activity to investigate spiking relative events.

MAAP was developed to capture nuances of cooperative behaviors and high-resolution data, suitable for underlying mechanisms. It comprises levers controlled by precision motor, integrated sensors, and suite-designed components. MA offers versatility, accommodating a spectrum of tasks, demonstrating utility in cooperative, eliciting large trials, and granular readouts. It surmounts traditional constraints, aligning with advanced research tools. AP allows time-lock task and events with activity in dlFC and OFC, increasing trials through MA supports examining neural dynamics mets. AP and paradigm represent advancement, bridging animal studies and precise investigations.
Researchers employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PA) to investigate the effects of common patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy on the developing offspring. Moderate PA was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborns without altering behavioral outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulf sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding regions with regulatory potential indicative of broad effects on genome regulation. Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. In the murine model, a diet high in folate and choline protected some of the damaging effects of early PA on DNA methylation. The study demonstrates early exposure is sufficient to affect genome regulation even in the absence of phenotypic changes and highlights a role for preventative dietary interventions.

The study identified regions sensitive to gestational exposure were replicated in human cohorts. The study investigated the impact of early PA on DNA comparing exposed and unex mice, with an additional arm comparing exposure in the context of a high maternal diet. The period covered preconception until the first trimester when neurulation occurs, reflecting typical consumption in women. Primary outcomes were DNA methylation and behavioral deficits across neurodevelopment domains relevant to FAS.

Conducted candidate testing regions identified as sensitive early PA.

Moderate PA was sufficient to induce site-specific differences in newborn without overt outcomes in mice. Global levels were not different PA, but regional demonstrated effects characterised by lower methylation PA, mostly non-coding regions.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Since double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) is effective for silencing a wide variety of genes, all genes are typically considered equivalent targets for such RNA interference ( RNAi ). Yet, loss of some regulators of RNAi in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can selectively impair the silencing of some genes. Here, we show that such selective requirements can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism. In this network, the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10, the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 work together so that any two are required for silencing one somatic gene, but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene, where only the requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing. Quantitative models and their exploratory simulations led us to find that ( 1 ) changing cis-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce the dependence on NRDE-3, ( 2 ) animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells, and ( 3 ) cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides, which makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs, are enriched within ‘pUG zones’ matching the dsRNA. Similar crosstalk between pathways and restricted amplification could result in apparently selective silencing by endogenous RNAs.

   . Here, we analyze the requirements for silencing two exemplar genes and use quantitative modeling to advance a parsimonious view of RNAi in somatic cells. We show that MUT-16, RDE-10, and NRDE-3 are each required for the silencing of bli-1, but any two of these proteins are sufficient for unc-22 silencing. These differences can be explained by differences in the thresholds for silencing the two genes using an intersecting network of regulators but not by parallel pathways of regulation after primary mRNA recognition. The requirement for NRDE-3 but not for MUT-16 or RDE-10 can be bypassed by enhancing the processing of dsRNA, suggesting that loss of NRDE-3 has the least impact on the efficiency of silencing. A dynamic model of RNA changes during silencing by dsRNA reveals several criteria for efficient RNA silencing. Insights from modeling led us to discover the influence of cis-regulatory regions on the requirements for RNAi, the recovery of animals from RNAi within non-dividing cells, and a dearth of pUG RNA production by 2° siRNAs.

. The fact that any two of MUT-16, NRDE-3, and RDE-10 – three structurally and functionally different proteins – are required for unc-22 silencing suggests that each of these proteins could be contributing to silencing of any RNAi target. Despite this potential use of an intersecting network for silencing all somatic genes, different genes could critically depend on different regulators because of differences in their mRNA metabolism and/or subcellular localization ( summarized as threshold differences in Figure 2 ). Intermediate steps that require the participation of mRNA such as the production of 2° siRNA could have complex dependencies, making RNA intermediates poor predictors of silencing efficiency ( Figure 4E ). For example, the subcellular localization of mRNA could increase or decrease its interaction with RdRPs and thus influence the levels of 2° siRNAs made. Future studies that address the dynamics and subcellular localization of target mRNA before RNAi and the subcellular localization of components of the RNAi machinery are required to test these hypotheses. Multiple small RNA species of defined lengths and 5′-nt bias have been detected in C. elegans. Of these, 22G RNAs ( 2° siRNAs ) are the most abundant and arise from amplification downstream of exposure to dsRNA and in multiple endogenous small RNA pathways ( Gu et al., 2009 ). Our results suggest that production of 2° siRNAs in response to dsRNA is eliminated in animals that lack both MUT-16 and RDE-10 ( Figure 3C ). While the precise mechanisms of amplification are unknown, MUT-16 is thought to nucleate perinuclear foci in the germline ( Phillips et al., 2012; Uebel et al., 2018 ) that recruit many additional components – RDE-2, MUT-7, MUT-14, MUT-15, NYN-1, NYN-2, RDE-8, RDE-3/MUT-2, etc. ( Phillips and Updike, 2022; Uebel et al., 2018 ). Similar interactions may occur in somatic cells despite the lack of detectable perinuclear foci

. ) and 2° Argonautes ( e. g., worm-specific Argonautes ( WAGOs ) ) would be more available to contribute to silencing in response to ingested dsRNA. We used available eri-1 mutants ( Figure 3A, mg366 ) and mutants generated using Cas9-mediated genome editing ( Figure 3A, jam260 to jam264 ) to test if requirements for silencing bli-1 and/or unc-22 could be bypassed. Loss of ERI-1 enabled bli-1 silencing in animals lacking NRDE-3, but not in animals lacking RDE-10 or MUT-16 ( Figure 3B ). Furthermore, loss of eri-1 was not sufficient for the complete rescue of unc-22 silencing in animals lacking any two of these three regulators ( Figure 3C ). An alternative approach for increasing dsRNA processing is the overexpression of the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4, which recruits dsRNA for processing by DCR-1 ( Tabara et al., 2002, Parker et al., 2006 ). Minimal amounts of RDE-4 can support RNAi as evidenced by silencing in rde-4 ( − ) adult progeny of rde-4 ( +/− ) hermaphrodites ( Figure S7E in Marré et al., 2016 ) and in rde-4 ( − ) animals with trace levels of ectopic expression from multicopy rde-4 ( + ) transgenes ( Figure 2 in Raman et al., 2017 ). We found that even hemizygous males expressing rde-4 ( + ) from a single-copy transgene driving expression in the germline and the intestine under the control of the mex-5 promoter ( Marré et al., 2016 ) was sufficient for rescuing both bli-1 and unc-22 silencing ( Figure 3D ). Similar expression of rde-1 ( + ), however, was not sufficient for rescuing silencing in rde-1 ( − ) animals ( Figure 3D ), suggesting that small amounts of RDE-4 but not RDE-1 are sufficient for RNAi. RDE-4 can be selectively overexpressed in the hypodermis using a single-copy transgene with a nas-9 promoter ( overexpression evident in Figure 3—figure supplement 1; and selectivity demonstrated in Figure 4C in Raman et al., 2017 )

Double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) can trigger the conserved mechanism of RNA interference ( RNAi ) to degrade mRNA of matching sequence ( Fire et al., 1998 ), and thus silence gene expression, in many organisms. This conservation has made dsRNA-based drugs useful in crops ( Das and Sherif, 2020 ), insects ( Vogel et al., 2018 ), and humans ( Zhu et al., 2022 ). While a dsRNA-based drug can be designed using just the mRNA sequence of any target gene, the intracellular effectiveness of the drug and the ease with which an organism could escape the drug by developing resistance are difficult to predict. Predicting both efficacy and susceptibility to resistance for each target could inform the selection of a suitable target from two or more equivalent candidates. Extensive characterization of RNAi in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ( reviewed in Seroussi et al., 2022 ) makes it a suitable system to examine how differences between target genes and reliance on specific regulators contribute to efficacy and resistance. A skeletal pathway that is required for gene silencing in response to the addition of dsRNA has been worked out in C. elegans ( Figure 1A ). Long dsRNA is imported through the transmembrane protein SID-1 ( Feinberg and Hunter, 2003; Winston et al., 2002 ), after which it is bound by the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4 ( Tabara et al., 2002 ), which recruits the endonuclease DCR-1 ( Knight and Bass, 2001 ) to cleave the long dsRNA into smaller dsRNAs ( Parker et al., 2006 ). The primary Argonaute protein RDE-1 ( Parrish and Fire, 2001; Tabara et al., 1999 ) cleaves one strand of the smaller dsRNA ( Steiner et al., 2009 ) and associates with the other, making it a 1° short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) that can guide the recognition of target mRNAs of complementary sequence Fire et al. 1998. The 1 siRNA is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) with the Argona protein RDE-3 ( Tabara et al,1999 ) and the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16 ( Phillips et al,2012 ) and the Mael domain protein RDE-10 ( Phillips et al,201 ). The RISC then cleaves the target mRNAs complementary to the 1 siRNA, leading to their degradation and silencing of the target gene.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Mortality and morbidity from tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) are common, primarily due to inflammatory response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We aimed to uncover genes and pathways associated with TBM pathogenesis and mortality, and determine the best predictors of death, utilizing whole-blood RNA sequencing from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM, 295 pulmonary tuberculosis ( PTB ), and 30 healthy controls. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we identified hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality, with a consensus analysis revealing distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. We employed multivariate elastic-net Cox regression to select candidate predictors of death, then logistic regression and internal bootstrap validation to choose best predictors. Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways were associated with TBM mortality. Among HIV-positive individuals, mortality associated with increased angiogenesis, while HIV-negative individuals exhibited elevated TNF signaling and impaired extracellular matrix organization. Four hub genes—MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C, and CD4—were strong TBM mortality predictors. These findings indicate that TBM induces a systemic inflammatory response similar to PTB, highlighting critical genes and pathways related to death, offering insights for potential therapeutic targets alongside a novel four-gene biomarker for predicting outcomes.

    The biological pathways involved in pathogenesis of TBM are unclear. In general, previous studies investigating TBM pathogenesis have been small, testing for relatively small numbers of selected genes or molecules, and have been unable to take an unbiased and broader view of the inflammatory response. This study investigated the pathways associated with death from TBM at a whole-genome transcriptome level in whole blood, characterizing a global dysregulation in immune responses, including inflammation, and revealing specific functional pathways and hub genes involved in TBM and the mechanisms leading to death. We sought to understand better the pathogenesis of TBM by identifying pretreatment blood transcriptional gene modules associated TBM disease severity and three-month mortality. Four out of five identified modules were involved in immunological functions, indicating multiple functional pathways of systemic immunity are involved in the pathogenesis of TBM. In particular, mortality was strongly associated with increased acute inflammation and neutrophil activation, and decreased adaptive immunity and T and B cell activation. Whilst there appeared to be many common pathways involved in TBM mortality in HIV-positive and negative individuals, there were differences: death was associated with increased expression of angiogenesis genes in HIV-positive adults, and with TNF signaling and down regulated extracellular matrix organization in HIV-negative adults. We also identified a four-gene signature as a potential host response biomarker for mortality, regardless of HIV status. TBM mortality was associated with increased acute inflammatory responses, the regulation of inflammatory responses, and neutrophil activation. Previous blood transcriptome studies have shown that IFN-inducible neutrophil-driven transcripts were over-expressed in blood neutrophils from active TB patients compared to those with latent TB ( Berry et al

. Hierarchical clustering of modules indicated that these two modules were highly correlated ( Figure 8A ) suggesting they share similar functions, which appeared in some pathways such as angiogenesis and extracellular matrix organization. In addition, almost all of the pathways significantly associated with TBM mortality were similar in HIV-negative and positive cohorts, confirming that these important pathways were common to all TBM ( Figure 9—figure supplement 1 ). However, pathway enrichment scores were higher in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative, especially for the TNF signaling pathway and TNF transcripts ( Figure 9 ). Death in HIV-negative TBM was associated with increased enrichment of these pathways, but with less TNF transcript compared to HIV-positive individuals. The enrichment scores indicated mortality was strongly associated with downregulation of adaptive immune responses, including T cell activation, T and B cell receptor signaling pathways, with little impact of HIV status on these pathways ( Figure 9 ). These data suggest an inadequate adaptive immune response contributes to disease pathogenesis and mortality in all those with TBM, regardless of HIV status. We aimed to identify baseline gene signatures that might help predict death or survival from TBM. We selected potential gene predictors from 26 common and 10 HIV-specific hub genes; these hub genes represented the dominant modules associated with mortality. Three predefined clinical factors known to be associated with outcome ( age, MRC grade and CSF lymphocyte count ) were also used for candidate predictor selection

. Our prognostic models combining this four-gene host response in blood and two routine clinical predictors achieved very good performance, with AUC 0. 80 and 0. 86 for HIV-negative and HIV-positive individuals with TBM, respectively. This is proof-of-concept that whole blood RNA host response might be a useful pre-treatment biomarker to predict early TBM mortality. Although further investigation and validation is needed, we have identified potential gene candidates for future development as prognostic biomarkers. In summary, we present a comprehensive and unbiased analysis of the gene transcripts associated with TBM severity and mortality. Our data open a new window on TBM pathogenesis, with dysregulation in both innate and adaptive immune responses strongly associated with death from TBM. Furthermore, we have identified similarities and differences in the inflammatory response associated with TBM in HIV-positive and negative adults, which may explain the different therapeutic effects of adjunctive corticosteroid treatment. We also revealed a four-gene host response signature in blood that might represent a novel biomarker for defining those at highest risk of death, regardless of their HIV status.

., 2017 ). These data suggest that different forms of TB are associated with similar inflammatory responses, but with different degrees of host responses, exemplified by hyper-inflammation in those with HIV. The HIV-driven differences in TBM-associated inflammation appear sufficient to influence response to adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy with corticosteroids. An earlier randomized controlled trial of corticosteroids in 545 predominantly HIV-negative Vietnamese adults showed they significantly improved survival ( Thwaites et al., 2004 ). Our group recently completed a similar sized trial exclusively in HIV-positive adults without any clear benefit upon mortality ( Donovan et al., 2023 ). Therefore, the differences in gene expression associated with TBM mortality in the current study – with angiogenesis activation linked to HIV-positive TBM mortality only, for example – may provide an explanation for the poor response and offer alternative therapeutic strategies. Recent studies have shown that angiogenesis is induced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, which then contributes to inflammation, tissue damage and is correlated with disease severity ( Kumar et al., 2016 ). Developing prognostic models for TBM is important for guiding clinical decision making and improving outcomes. Several studies have developed and validated prognostic models for TBM using clinical, laboratory and radiological variables. These models have demonstrated moderate to high accuracy in predicting mortality and functional outcomes from TBM patients ( Thao et al., 2018; Thao et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2021; Sharawat et al., 2022 ). In this study, we used blood transcriptional signatures and co-expression network analysis to identify module-representative hub genes. We identified a four-gene set at the start of treatment ( MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C, and CD4 ) whose expression strongly predicted three-month TBM mortality

. Briefly, blood transcriptional profiling was generated from four cohorts of 207 TBM HIV-negative, 74 TBM HIV-positive, 279 PTB and 30 healthy controls. To define transcriptional signatures associated with TBM mortality, data from all 281 TBM participants were used. To ensure reproducibility, in our main analysis we randomly split our TBM data into two datasets, a discovery cohort ( n=142 ) and a validation cohort ( n=139 ). After identifying gene modules associated with mortality, related functional pathways and hub genes were determined. In a broader view, gene enrichment and expression from significant pathways and hub genes were illustrated across all four cohorts. Next, outcome prediction models were developed for TBM. Finally, the association of hub genes and outcome prediction then was validated in qPCR HIV-negative TBM cohort. Whole blood samples, collected from participants at enrollment, were stored in PAXgene collection tubes at –80 °C. RNA extraction and RNA-seq were done in 2 batches. Batch 1 was done in 2020 including 207 HIV-negative TBM, 31 HIV-positive TBM and 296 PTB. Batch 2 was done in 2022 including 43 HIV-positive TBM and 30 Healthy control. RNA samples were isolated using the PAXgene Blood RNA kits ( QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA ) following the manufacturer’s instructions, except for an additional washing step before RNA elution. DNA was digested on columns using the RNase-free DNase Set ( QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA ). Quality control of the RNA extraction was performed using the Epoch spec for quantity and quality, and Tapestation Eukaryotic RNA Screentape for integrity. Samples with RNA integrity number below 4 were exclude for further steps. RNA-seq was performed by the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics ( Sydney, Australia ). One microgram of total RNA was used as input for each sample, using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Ribo-zero Globin kit ( Illumina )

    Title: 
    Abstract: Antibodies are critical reagents to detect and characterize proteins. It is commonly understood that many commercial antibodies do not recognize their intended targets, but information on the scope of the problem remains largely anecdotal, and as such, feasibility of the goal of at least one potent and specific antibody targeting each protein in a proteome cannot be assessed. Focusing on antibodies for human proteins, we have scaled a standardized characterization approach using parental and knockout cell lines ( Laflamme et al., 2019 ) to assess the performance of 614 commercial antibodies for 65 neuroscience-related proteins. Side-by-side comparisons of all antibodies against each target, obtained from multiple commercial partners, have demonstrated that: ( i ) more than 50% of all antibodies failed in one or more applications, ( ii ) yet, ~50–75% of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, depending on application, suggesting that coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies is significant; and ( iii ) recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The hundreds of underperforming antibodies identified in this study were found to have been used in a large number of published articles, which should raise alarm. Encouragingly, more than half of the underperforming commercial antibodies were reassessed by the manufacturers, and many had alterations to their recommended usage or were removed from the market. This first study helps demonstrate the scale of the antibody specificity problem but also suggests an efficient strategy toward achieving coverage of the human proteome; mine the existing commercial antibody repertoire, and use the data to focus new renewable antibody generation efforts.

   ., 2019 ). Our set of 65 funder-designated proteins is an unbiased sample, representative of the heterogeneity of knowledge of the human proteome; a search of the NIH protein database revealed that 15 proteins ( 23% of our protein sample ) are well studied with more than 500 publications and 50 proteins ( 77% of our protein sample ) have corresponding publications ranging from 37 to 498 ( Figure 1—source data 1 ). Although we observed that there are more commercial antibodies available for the best-studied proteins ( Figure 1—source data 1 ), an encouraging result of our work is that more than half of our protein targets are covered by well-performing, renewable antibodies for WB, IP and IF - including both well characterized and more poorly studied proteins. Within the antibodies we tested, we found a successful renewable antibody for WB for 77% of proteins ( 50/65 ), for IP for 75% of proteins ( 49/65 ) and for IF for 54% of proteins ( 30/56 ) examined. Extrapolation of our findings to the human proteome would suggest that it might be possible to identify well-performing renewable reagents for half the human proteome, including poorly characterized proteins, simply by mining commercial collections. Indeed, it is likely that the coverage is greater because our corporate partners only represent 27% of the antibody production worldwide. The research market is heavily dominated by polyclonal antibodies, and their use contributes to reproducibility issues in biomedical research ( Baker, 2015; Baker, 2020 ) and present important ethical concerns. From a scientific perspective, polyclonal antibodies suffer from batch-to-batch variation and are thus in conflict with the scientific community desire to use and provide only renewable reagents. From an ethical perspective, the generation of polyclonal antibodies requires large numbers of animals yearly ( Gray et al., 2016 )

Here, we present the analysis of a dataset of commercial antibodies as an assessment of the problem of antibody performance, and as a step toward a comprehensive and standardized ecosystem to validate commercial antibodies. We evaluated 614 antibodies against 65 human proteins side-by-side in WB, IP, and IF. All raw data are openly available ( https://ZENODO. org/communities/ycharos/ ), identifiable on the RRID portal and on participating antibody manufacturers’ websites. Our studies provide an unbiased and scalable analytical framework for the representation and comparison of antibody performance, an estimate of the coverage of human proteins with renewable antibodies, an assessment of the scientific value of common antibody characterization methods, and they inform a strategy to identify renewable antibodies for all human proteins. Our approach, developed in collaboration with manufacturers, and intended to be applied to entire proteomes, uses universal protocols for all tested antibodies in each application. Scientists use variants of such protocols, optimized for their protein of interest, which can have a major impact on antibody performance ( Pillai-Kastoori et al., 2020; Piña et al., 2022; Marcon et al., 2015 ). Nevertheless, the process robustly identifies antibodies that fail to recognize their intended target, which becomes evident when other antibodies tested in parallel perform well. At a minimum, removal of these poorly performing products from the market will have significant impact in that hundreds of published papers report the use of such antibodies. The impacts of poorly performing antibodies are well documented ( Voskuil et al., 2020; Sato et al., 2021; Aponte Santiago et al., 2023; Freedman et al., 2016 ) ; our analyses provide insight into the magnitude of the problem

Antibodies are critical reagents used in a range of applications, enabling the identification, quantification, and localization of proteins studied in biomedical and clinical research. The research enterprise spends significantly on the ~1. 6 M commercially available antibodies targeting ~96% of human proteins ( Bandrowski et al., 2023 ). Unfortunately, a significant percentage of these antibodies do not recognize the intended protein or recognize the protein but also recognize non-intended targets, with estimates that $0. 375 to $1. 75 billion is wasted yearly on non-specific antibodies ( Baker, 2015; Bradbury and Plückthun, 2015; Voskuil et al., 2020 ). Perhaps worse, the use of poor-quality antibodies is a major factor in the scientific reproducibility crisis ( Bradbury and Plückthun, 2015; Voskuil et al., 2020; Baker, 2020 ). With tens to hundreds of antibodies available for any given protein target, it is difficult for antibody users to select the best performing antibody ( Voskuil, 2014 ), and a growing number of cases reveal that depending on previously published antibodies is not a reliable method to assess their performance ( Laflamme et al., 2019; Sato et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023; Sicherre et al., 2021; Haytural et al., 2019; Virk et al., 2019 ). Academic and industry scientists aspire to have at least one, and ideally more, potent, selective and renewable antibody for each human protein for each of the most common applications ( Marx, 2020 ). Unfortunately, there is no agreed-upon mechanism to determine, validate or compare antibody performance and there are multiple strategies for antibody validation ( Uhlen et al., 2016 ), with unequal scientific value. Most information on how commercial antibodies perform is anecdotal. It is thus difficult to assess progress toward the objective of well-validated antibodies for each human protein, or to design a strategy to accomplish this aim

. For each protein target, we tested commercial antibodies, provided from various manufacturers, in parallel using standardized protocols, agreed upon by all parties, in WB, IP, and IF applications. All data are shared rapidly and openly on ZENODO, a preprint server. We have tested 614 commercially available antibodies targeting 65 proteins, and found that approximately two thirds of this protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, and half was covered by at least one high-performing renewable antibody, suggesting that coverage of human proteins by high-performing antibodies is significant. This sample is large enough to observe several trends in antibody performance across various parameters and estimate the scale of the antibody liability crisis.

. We sought to address this issue by developing optimized protocols to assess antibody specificity in the three most common uses of antibodies in biomedical research laboratories; Western blot ( WB ), immunoprecipitation ( IP ), and immunofluorescence ( IF ). We used these protocols to test antibodies against a variety of neuroscience targets, chosen by funders, to predict requirements for the larger goal of coverage of an entire mammalian proteome. The optimal antibody testing methodology is largely settled; using an appropriately selected wild type cell and an isogenic CRISPR knockout ( KO ) version of the same cell as the basis for testing, yields rigorous and broadly applicable results ( this study, as well as Laflamme et al., 2019; Ellis et al., 2023; Davies et al., 2013 ). However, the cost of antibody characterization using engineered KO cells is higher than that of other methods, mainly because of the cost of custom edited cells. Commercial antibody suppliers support a large and diverse catalogue of products, with most antibody products generating <$5000 in total sales, far less than the costs of KO-based validation, estimated at $25, 000. While leading companies are increasingly assessing antibody performance, it is exceedingly difficult, and cost restrained, to properly characterize all their products. Even when available, high-performing antibodies may remain hidden within the millions of reagents of unknown quality. To begin the process of large-scale antibody validation, we have developed a scalable and standardized approach using KO cell lines to assess performance of commercial antibodies. Our results indicate that more than 50% of antibodies failed in one or more applications, yet ~75% of protein was covered by at least one high-performing antibody depending on application, suggesting coverage of human proteins by high-per antibodies is significant, and recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal. Hundreds of underperforming antibodies were found to have been used in a large number of published articles, which raises alarm. Encouragingly, more than half of underperforming antibodies were reassessed by manufacturers and had alterations to recommended or removed from market. This study demonstrates the scale of the antibody problem and suggests efficient strategy toward coverage of human proteome using existing repertoire and data to focus new antibody generation.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The ability to independently control gene expression in two different tissues in the same animal is emerging as a major need, especially in the context of inter-organ communication studies. This type of study is made possible by technologies combining the GAL4/UAS and a second binary expression system such as the LexA system or QF system. Here, we describe a resource of reagents that facilitate combined use of the GAL4/UAS and a second binary system in various Drosophila tissues. Focusing on genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns, we generated a set of more than 40 LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions by CRISPR knock-in and verified their tissue specificity in larvae. We also built constructs that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector. Following successful integration of this construct into the fly genome, FLP/FRT recombination is used to isolate fly lines that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD. Finally, using new compatible shRNA vectors, we evaluated both LexA and QF systems for in vivo gene knockdown and are generating a library of such RNAi fly lines as a community resource. Together, these LexA and QF system vectors and fly lines will provide a new set of tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal.

   ., 2015 ). Like GAL80-based modulation of LexA-GAD, QF2 activity can also be regulated temporally by expressing QS, a QF repressor. QS repression of QF can be released by feeding flies quinic acid ( Riabinina and Potter, 2016 ). Each knock-in was rigorously genotyped, and the expression pattern verified by imaging. Thus, we can systematically compare LexA-GAD vs QF2 activators inserted at precisely the same position in the genome. In addition to the new fly stocks, we provide a new set of vectors and protocols to efficiently generate LexA-GAD and/or QF2 drivers. This includes constructs that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector, with each coding sequence flanked by FRT sites. Following successful integration into the fly genome, the vector generates a driver in which a target gene expresses both QF2 and LexA-GAD. If desired, one of the two coding regions can then be excised with Flp, resulting in flies that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD. Furthermore, we evaluated both QF2 and LexA-GAD systems for in vivo gene knockdown and are generating a compatible library of transgenic shRNA lines in our custom QUAS and LexAop vectors as a community resource. Together, these QF2/LexA-GAD and QUAS/LexAop vectors and fly lines will provide a new set of tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal.

. When we compared the knockdown efficiency of shRNAs targeting forked and ebony and, we found that the TRiP 13XLexAop vector was more effective than the 5XQUAS vector, although both were able to induce knockdown. Based on these results, the TRiP is currently generating a set of ~100 LexAop shRNA lines encompassing the genes targeted by the most commonly ordered UAS shRNA stocks at the BDSC. See Supplementary file 1 for a list of all LexAop shRNA lines in production. There remains an unmet need for a single vector that would allow for UAS/LexAop/QUAS control of different shRNAs. However, recent innovations in multi-module vectors and multiplexed drug-based genetics allow researchers to more efficiently generate UAS/QUAS/lexAop transgenic fly strains ( Matinyan et al., 2021; Wendler et al., 2022 ). In summary, we have generated a set of stocks, vectors, and protocols that when combined with the wide array of GAL4 lines will greatly expand the ability of Drosophila researchers to modulate gene expression in multiple tissues simultaneously.

There have been previous efforts to make LexA and QF tools, but the availability of LexA-GAD and QF2 tissue-specific fly stocks remains a major resource gap, preventing the average fly researcher from performing the type of multi-tissue manipulations that are essential to advance the study of organ and tissue communication. The collection of T2A-LexA-GAD and T2A-QF2 drivers described here is unique in that it is the first to focus on covering the major organ systems of the fly. Our protocol for generating these stocks is straightforward and can be easily adapted to produce driver lines for other fly tissues. These efforts will benefit from the emergence of scRNAseq datasets, which can be used to identify target genes with highly organ or tissue-specific gene expression patterns. For example, we identified the uncharacterized genes CG9458 and CG17560, as highly oenocyte-specific based on the Fly Cell Atlas Single-cell transcriptome ( Li et al., 2022 ), and the T2A-LexA-GAD and T2A-QF2 knock-ins in these genes were indeed restricted to this tissue. Our collection of T2A-LexA-GAD and T2A-QF2 and double driver vectors can be easily adapted to target any gene for CRISPR knock-in, with a high probability that the resulting line will accurately reflect the expression of the endogenous locus. The specificity achieved with this approach can also be seen in recent efforts to build collections of gene-specific T2A-Split-GAL4 and T2A-GAL4 insertions ( Kanca et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2023; Ewen-Campen et al., 2023 ). Our vectors are compatible with both the traditional large HA flanked cassettes and the more streamlined drop-in approach. In our hands, the drop-in cloning strategy is particularly effective, as the cloning success rate is 100%, requires little troubleshooting, has a very high knock-in rate, and only costs ~$100 to synthesize the construct ( Kanca et al., 2019; Kanca et al., 2022 )

. For our targets, we selected a set of genes with tissue-specific expression patterns encompassing most of the major organs of the fly ( Table 1 ). When possible, we selected genes which had a previously characterized GAL4 insertion, and strong evidence of tissue specificity ( e. g. from publicly available scRNAseq, in situ, and immunohistochemistry ). Once the donors/guides were cloned, they were injected into Cas9-expressing fly embryos to induce CRISPR-based HDR of the T2A-LexA-GAD or T2A-QF2 ( Figure 1D and E ). We selected integration sites in the most 5’ coding exon common to all or most isoforms, resulting in expression of the activators under control of the endogenous gene regulatory regions. The knock-in also produces a truncated endogenous protein and thus a predicted strong LOF allele. To verify the knock-ins, we PCR-amplified the genomic regions flanking the insertion sites and confirmed that the insertions were seamless and in-frame. Most of our knock-in stocks were made with the long HA method, but we transitioned to the drop-in method as this technology became available. As Table 1 shows, we were able to successfully generate knock-ins into nearly all the target genes using these methods. Next, we tested the specificity of the knock-in driver lines in the third instar larva ( Figure 2 ). Each T2A-LexA-GAD and T2A-QF2 knock-in line was crossed to a LexAop-GFP and QUAS-GFP reporter, respectively. Note that most of the lines are highly tissue-specific and are comparable between the LexA-GAD and QF2 knock-ins. Insertions in the daughterless gene ( da ) are an exception, as the T2A-LexA-GAD ( Figure 2A ), but not the T2A-QF2 ( Figure 2B ), gives the expected ubiquitous expression pattern. Similarly, for insertions in the nubbin gene ( nub ) the T2A-LexA-GAD ( Figure 2LL ), but not the T2A-QF2 ( Figure 2MM ), gives the expected expression in the wing imaginal disc

. Furthermore, the FlyLight lines use a p65 transcriptional activation domain and therefore are not compatible with the GAL80 temperature-sensitive GAL4 repression system. A second large collection of ~180 LexA-based enhancer trap fly stocks has been generated ( the StanEx collection ) ( Kockel et al., 2016; Kockel et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2023 ). On average, each StanEx line expresses LexA activity in five distinct cell types, with only one line showing expression in just one tissue, unfortunately limiting usefulness of these reagents ( Kockel et al., 2016 ). These findings are consistent with prior studies indicating that enhancers very rarely produce expression patterns that are limited to a single cell type in a complex organism ( Jenett et al., 2012 ). Regarding the Q system, there are 101 total QF lines available from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center ( BDSC ), but only a few are tissue-specific, with most expressing in multiple cell types or ubiquitously. In contrast, our T2-Lex-GAD and T2-Q2F lines are highly tissue-specific, making them more useful for the study of inter-organ communication.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The transcription factor Bcl11b has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. Bcl11b is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remained unclear. We show in mice that the synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2 is a direct functional target of Bcl11b that regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate C1ql2 to exert its functions through direct interaction with a specific splice variant of neurexin-3, Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ). Interruption of C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) interaction by expression of a non-binding C1ql2 mutant or by deletion of Nrxn3 in the dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates major parts of the Bcl11b as well as C1ql2 mutant phenotype. Together, this study identifies a novel C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) -dependent signaling pathway through which Bcl11b controls mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function. Thus, our findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders accompanied by synaptic dysfunction.

   ., 2018 ). MFS have a critical role in learning and memory stemming from their unique structural and functional properties, such as an enormous pool of releasable synaptic vesicles ( SV ), and reliable presynaptic short- and long-term plasticity ( Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005; Rollenhagen and Lübke, 2010 ). Conditional ablation of Bcl11b in murine DGN impairs presynaptic recruitment of SV and abolishes mossy fiber long-term potentiation ( MF-LTP; De Bruyckere et al., 2018 ). The molecular mechanisms, however, through which the transcriptional regulator Bcl11b controls highly dynamic properties of the MFS remained elusive. In the present study, we show that the secreted synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2, a member of the C1q-like protein family ( Yuzaki, 2017 ), is a functional target of Bcl11b in murine DGN. Reintroduction of C1ql2 in Bcl11b mutant DGN rescued the localization and docking of SV to the active zone ( AZ ), as well as MF-LTP that was abolished upon Bcl11b ablation. Knock-down ( KD ) of C1ql2 in wildtype animals recapitulated a major part of the MFS phenotype observed in Bcl11b mutants. Furthermore, we show that C1ql2 requires direct interaction with a specific neurexin-3 isoform, Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ), a member of a polymorphic family of presynaptic cell adhesion molecules ( Reissner et al., 2013; Südhof, 2017 ), to recruit SV in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we observe that localization of C1ql2 along the mossy fiber tract depends on C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) interaction. Taken together, this study identifies a novel Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) -dependent regulatory mechanism that is essential for the control of MFS function. Recent genetic studies suggested its single components to be associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction. Our data, for the first time, demonstrate these molecules to be interconnected in one regulatory pathway

There is emerging evidence that the zinc finger transcription factor Bcl11b is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental as well as neuropsychiatric disorders that are frequently associated with synaptic dysfunction. Previous work from our group demonstrated Bcl11b to be essential for synapse function in the mossy fiber circuit of the adult murine hippocampus. The underlying molecular mechanisms downstream of Bcl11b, however, remained elusive. In the present study, we uncover a novel C1ql2-dependent regulatory pathway through which Bcl11b controls the structural as well as functional integrity of hippocampal MFS in adult mice. We show that SV recruitment to the AZ of MFS, as well as the expression of MF-LTP, depend on C1ql2, which is a direct functional target of Bcl11b. Reintroduction of C1ql2 into Bcl11b mutant DGN restores defective SV recruitment and LTP expression. KD of C1ql2 in DGN recapitulates the impaired SV recruitment and loss of LTP observed in Bcl11b mutants. Finally, we show that C1ql2 controls SV recruitment through a direct interaction with presynaptic Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ), while LTP depends on C1ql2 signals independent of Nrxn3 interaction. Recent studies suggested Nrxn3, as well as C1ql2, to be associated with neuropsychiatric disorders ( Hishimoto et al., 2007; Hu et al., 2013; Huggett and Stallings, 2020a; Marballi et al., 2022 ). Our study for the first time identifies a Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3-dependent signaling pathway in the control of basic structural and functional properties of MFS. Analysis of this regulatory pathway in mice may provide important novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders

. While a modest displacement of SV might fail to noticeably influence synaptic transmission due to the low initial Pr at MFS, causing only a fraction of release-ready vesicles to be initially released, the reduction in synapse numbers might indeed be expected to reflect in the input-output relationship. It might be that synapses that are preferentially eliminated in Bcl11b mutants are predominantly silent or have weak coupling strength, such that their loss has only a minimal effect on synaptic transmission. Further investigation is needed to elucidate this apparent discrepancy. Together, our results suggest Bcl11b to be an important synaptic regulator that controls the structure and function of adult MFS through both C1ql2-dependent, as well as -independent transcriptional programs. C1ql proteins are complement-related factors that are synthesized by the presynapse and secreted into the synaptic cleft. Within the hippocampus, C1ql2 and –3 protein expression overlaps and is highly restricted to DGN ( Iijima et al., 2010 ) and the corresponding mossy fiber system, including MF-CA3 synapses. C1ql2 and –3 were previously suggested to form functional heteromers that can cluster postsynaptic KAR on MFS. Selective deletion of either C1ql2 or –3 in mice was reported to have no overt mutant hippocampal phenotype, suggesting functional compensation for both proteins ( Matsuda et al., 2016 ). Using shRNA-mediated selective KD of C1ql2 in DGN as well as rescue of the Bcl11b mutation by the reintroduction of C1ql2 into mutant DGN, we observed a novel, presynaptic function for C1ql2 in the recruitment of SV and the expression of LTP in MFS. This function was specific to C1ql2 since overexpression of C1ql3 in Bcl11b mutant DGN was unable to rescue the synapse phenotype. Furthermore, another study has identified all four C1ql proteins, including C1ql2, as ligands for the postsynaptic Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 3 ( BAI3 )

. Addition of any of the four C1ql proteins to cultured hippocampal neurons led to a loss of excitatory synapses, a function inhibited by the presence of BAI3 ( Bolliger et al., 2011 ). In our study, we show that neither loss of C1ql2 nor overexpression of C1ql2 affects the number of MFS, supporting the notion that synaptic organizers have synapse-specific functions. This highlights the role of C1ql2 as a synaptic organizer and adds a new layer of understanding to its function at the MFS. Previous in vitro studies suggested that C1ql2 function at the MFS involves interaction with Nrxn3 isoforms containing the splice site 5 25b sequence ( SS525b ) ( Matsuda et al., 2016 ). Nrxns are synaptic cell adhesion molecules that mediate various synaptic properties ( Reissner et al., 2013; Südhof, 2017 ), including the recruitment of SV and dense-core vesicles ( Dean et al., 2003; Ferdos et al., 2021; Quinn et al., 2017; Rui et al., 2017 ). This prompted us to analyze, whether C1ql2-dependent SV recruitment in MFS requires a direct interaction with Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) in vitro and in vivo. Expression of C1ql2 in HEK293 cells co-cultured with GFP-Nrxn3α ( 25+ ) -expressing hippocampal neurons was able to recruit Nrxn3α ( 25b+ ) and vGlut1 at contact points, while C1ql2. K262E, a C1ql2 mutant unable to bind Nn3 ( 25+ ), was unable to recruit Nn3 ( 25+ ) and vGl1. In contrast, expression of Cql in HEK cells co-cultured with GFP-Nn3 ( 25+ )-expressing hippocal neurons was unable to recruit N3 (25 ) and vGl1, indicating that Cql requires N3 (25 ) interaction to recruit N3 (25 ) vGl.

    Title: 
    Abstract: To function effectively as an integrated system, the transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries must communicate through mechanisms that are still poorly understood. Here, we focus on the zinc-finger Sfp1, known to regulate transcription of proliferation-related genes. We show that Sfp1 can regulate transcription either by binding to promoters, like most known transcription activators, or by binding to the transcribed regions ( gene bodies ), probably via RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ). We further studied the first mode of Sfp1 activity and found that, following promoter binding, Sfp1 binds to gene bodies and affects Pol II configuration, manifested by dissociation or conformational change of its Rpb4 subunit and increased backtracking. Surprisingly, Sfp1 binds to a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them. The interaction between Sfp1 and its client mRNAs is controlled by their respective promoters and coincides with Sfp1’s dissociation from chromatin. Intriguingly, Sfp1 dissociation from the chromatin correlates with the extent of the backtracked Pol II. We propose that, following promoter recruitment, Sfp1 accompanies Pol II and regulates backtracking. The backtracked Pol II is more compatible with Sfp1’s relocation to the nascent transcripts, whereupon Sfp1 accompanies these mRNAs to the cytoplasm and regulates their stability. Thus, Sfp1’s co-transcriptional binding imprints the mRNA fate, serving as a paradigm for the cross-talk between the synthesis and decay of specific mRNAs, and a paradigm for the dual-role of some zinc-finger proteins. The interplay between Sfp1’s two modes of transcription regulation remains to be examined.

   . These results, in combination with the weak interaction of Sfp1 with chromatin ( Figure 5A ‘Sfp1 Control’ ), are in accord with previous observation that expression of >30% of the genes, most are not considered to be direct targets of Sfp1, is affected by either Sfp1 depletion or its overexpression ( Albert et al., 2019, and our unpublished NET-seq data ). An important support for this notion is the correlation we found between the binding of Sfp1 to gene bodies and Pol II occupancy in all genes ( Figure 5B ). The general capacity of Sfp1 to alter elongating Pol II in the context of Rpb4 and to affect backtracking ( Figure 7B, Figure 7—figure supplement 1A ) likely underlies its widespread effect on transcription. As mentioned above, this widespread effect of Sfp1 on backtracking correlates with higher mRNA HL in many genes ( not only in CRAC+; Figure 6D ). This suggests that the effect of Sfp1-dependent backtracking on mRNA HL does not always require Sfp1 binding to mRNA. Perhaps, this indirect effect of Sfp1 on mRNA HL is mediated by other factors, like Ccr4-Not, whose imprinting may also be affected by Pol II backtracking ( Kruk et al., 2011; Villanyi et al., 2014; Begley et al., 2019 ). In contrast, the correlation between Rpb4/Rpb3 and mRNA HL is much higher in CRAC + than in the rest of the genome, and is entirely dependent on Sfp1 ( Figure 7C, Figure 7—figure supplement 1B ). Interestingly, we previously demonstrated that transcription elongation of Rap1-controlled genes is exceptionally affected by backtracking ( Pelechano et al., 2009 ). We propose that Rap1-dependent recruitment of Sfp1 modulates its interaction with Pol II in a manner that permits Sfp1 transfer to mRNA ( Figure 8 ). Binding of Sfp1 to CRAC + mRNAs, which stabilizes the bound mRNAs, is dependent on Rap1 binding sites. On the other hand, we previously found that depletion of Rap1 leads to mRNA stabilization ( Bregman et al., 2011 )

Sfp1 has traditionally been regarded as a ‘classical’ TF known to bind specific promoters, either through interactions with other TFs or by directly binding to promoter DNA ( Albert et al., 2019; Reja et al., 2015 ). Further analysis that we performed using published ChIP-exo and ChEC-seq data has revealed an additional aspect of Sfp1’s binding behavior—it also interacts with gene bodies. Notably, the binding of Sfp1 to CRAC + gene bodies correlates with the presence of transcriptionally active Pol II molecules ( Figure 5B ), suggesting a physical association between Sfp1 and Pol II. Consequently, the binding of Sfp1 has an impact on Pol II configuration, stoichiometry, and backtracking, particularly in the context of CRAC + genes ( Figures 6 and 7 ). This alteration in the Pol II configuration is reflected in the increased backtracking frequency, as indicated by the BI values. Moreover, the binding of Sfp1 to gene bodies correlates with Pol II activity, particularly within CRAC + genes ( Figure 5B ). Thus, Sfp1’s function in a subset of its target genes extends beyond transcription initiation and encompasses transcription elongation, as we proposed earlier ( Gómez-Herreros et al., 2012b ). Based on the following observations, we propose that Sfp1 binds to Pol II in proximity to both DNA and Rpb4, accompanying Pol II during elongation and influencing its configuration, thereby enhancing its propensity to backtrack ( Figure 8A ) : ( I ) Sfp1 physically interacts with Rpb4, either directly or indirectly ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). ( II ) ChIP-exo results, dependent on Sfp1’s cross-linking with DNA, indicate Sfp1’s presence near DNA, both at promoters and gene bodies ( Figure 5A ). ( III ) Sfp1 influences Pol II configuration in a manner that impacts the architecture or stoichiometry of Rpb4 within Pol II ( Figure 7 )

., 2019; Jorgensen et al., 2004; Marion et al., 2004; Fingerman et al., 2003 ). It also impacts many G1/S ( ‘START’ ) genes, where it appears to act as a repressor ( Albert et al., 2019 ). Sfp1 was, therefore, viewed as a classical TF. Shore’s lab has examined the Sfp1 configuration within promoters, using either chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP-seq ) or chromatin endogenous cleavage ( ChEC-seq ), and found that the two approaches exhibit different sensitivity to different configurations. While Sfp1 binding sites detected by ChEC are enriched for the motif gAAAATTTTc, binding identified by ChIP is dependent on Ifh1, hence on Rap1 as well ( Albert et al., 2019 ). Thus, Sfp1 can be viewed as a ‘classical’ zinc-finger containing TF. Zinc-finger domains have also been described to function as RNA-binding domains ( Font and MacKay, 2010 ). In some proteins, such as TFIIIA, the same zinc-finger domain can recognize both a specific double-stranded DNA sequence and another specific sequence in single-stranded RNA - discussed in Font and MacKay, 2010. In response to the misincorporation of nucleotides, damage to the DNA, nucleosomes, hairpins or certain DNA sequences, elongating Pol II transiently pauses. During pausing, Pol II remains catalytically active and can resume transcription if the obstacle is removed ( Bar-Nahum et al., 2005; Gómez-Herreros et al., 2012a ). However, these pauses increase the probability of Pol II backward movement along the DNA template, a process named ‘backtracking. ’ During backtracking, the 3’ end of the nascent RNA extrudes from the active site, traps the trigger loop of the enzyme, and stably blocks mRNA elongation ( Cheung and Cramer, 2011 ). Once arrested, Pol II can reactivate itself by cleaving its own synthetized RNA at the active site ( Sigurdsson et al., 2010 )

. Sfp1 disruption affects both mRNA HL ( Figures 4 and 6C ) and BI ( Figure 6B and C ). In both cases, these effects were significantly stronger for the CRAC + group. We were intrigued by a possible link between these two effects, as it raises a possible role for backtracking in imprinting-mediated mRNA decay. In favor of this idea, we found a modest correlation between the effect of Sfp1 on HLs and on BIs ( Figure 6D; r=0. 366 ), which was higher for the CRAC + genes ( Figure 6D: green spots, r=0. 423 ). This indicates that the interaction of Sfp1 with chromatin has an effect on both Pol II elongation and mRNA HLs, suggesting a mechanistic linkage. The yeast Rpb4 is a sub-stoichiometric Pol II subunit ( Choder, 2004; Choder and Young, 1993 ), which enhances Pol II polymerization activity ( Fischer et al., 2020; Rosenheck and Choder,2004 ). S1’s interaction with R4 subunit may therefore influence Pol elongation and backtracking ( Figure 7, Figure 7— supplement 1 ). We propose that S1 binds to R4 subunit, either directly or indirectly ( Figure 1— supplement 1 ) and influences Pol elongation and backtracking ( Figure 8 ). The effect of S1 on Pol elongation and backtracking correlates with its binding to chromatin ( Figures 5 and 7 ). The interaction of S1 with R4 subunit may also affect Pol configuration ( Figure 7, Figure 7— supplement 1 ). The interaction of S1 with R4 subunit may also affect Pol configuration ( Figure 7, Figure— supplement 1 ). The interaction of S1 with R subunit may affect Pol configuration ( Figure 7, Figure— supplement 1 ) The interaction of S with R sub may affect Pol configuration ( Figure 7,— supplement 1 ) The interaction of with R sub may affect Pol configuration ( Figure 7— supplement ) The interaction with R sub may affect Pol configuration ( Figure 7— supplement ) The interaction with sub may affect Pol configuration ( Figure 7— supplement ) The interaction R may affect Pol configuration ( Figure— supplement ) The with may affect Pol configuration (— supplement ) The with sub may affect configuration ( supplement ) The R may affect configuration ( supplement ) The sub may configuration ( supplement The interaction of S1 with R sub may affect Pol configuration ( Figure 7,— supplement ) The interaction of S with R sub may affect Pol configuration ( Figure 7— supplement ) The interaction S with sub may affect Pol configuration ( Figure— supplement ) The R may affect Pol configuration ( supplement ) The sub may configuration ( supplement The interaction of S with R may affect Pol ( Figure 7— supplement ) The interaction S sub may affect Pol ( Figure— supplement ) The R may configuration ( supplement The interaction of S with sub affect Pol ( Figure 7— ) The S may affect ( supplement The interaction with R sub Pol ( Figure 7— ) The may affect supplement The interaction of S sub Pol ( Figure— ) The may supplement

    Title: 
    Abstract: Programmed cell death occurring during plant development ( dPCD ) is a fundamental process integral for plant growth and reproduction. Here, we investigate the connection between developmentally controlled PCD and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thaliana roots, focusing on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO ( SMB ) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1. Mutations of both dPCD regulators increase colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendipita indica, primarily in the differentiation zone. smb-3 mutants additionally exhibit hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and a delay of S. indica-induced root-growth promotion. This demonstrates that root cap dPCD and rapid post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Additionally, reporter lines and transcriptional analysis revealed that BFN1 expression is downregulated during S. indica colonization in mature root epidermal cells, suggesting a transcriptional control mechanism that facilitates the accommodation of beneficial microbes in the roots.

   . This observation indicates that S. indica is able to degrade uncleared cell corpses, which likely provide additional nutrients that fuel fungal hypercolonization in the smb-3 mutant background. To further explore the role of root dPCD during S. indica accommodation in Arabidopsis, we performed transcriptome analysis, tracking developmental cell death-marker gene expression during different colonization stages ( Olvera-Carrillo et al., 2015 ). The major regulator in LRCs, SMB, showed no significant changes in expression during fungal colonization ( Figure 4A and C ). However, in Arabidopsis colonized by S. indica, there was a significant decrease in BFN1 expression observed after 6 dpi ( Figure 4B and C ). To validate the RNA-Seq analysis, we performed whole-root qPCR of WT mock- and colonized-roots, confirming BFN1 downregulation at the onset of cell death in S. indica-colonized plants ( Figure 4D ). While SMB expression is restricted to the LRC, BFN1 exhibits a broader expression pattern across various cell types and tissues, such as root cap cells, cells adjacent to emerging lateral root primordia, differentiating xylem tracheary elements, as well as senescent leaves, and abscission zones of flowers and seeds ( Escamez et al., 2020; Farage-Barhom et al., 2008 ). This widespread expression establishes BFN1 as a key player in the general regulation of dPCD and senescence processes in various tissues in Arabidopsis. To visualize the extent of BFN1 downregulation upon S. indica colonization in different zones of the root, we used a transgenic BFN1 promoter-reporter line ( pBFN1::NLS-tdTOMATO ) ( Huysmans et al., 2018 ). In agreement with the previously described GUS reporter lines ( Farage-Barhom et al., 2008 ), we detected activation of the BFN1 promoter via accumulation of the fluorescent tdTOMATO signal in the nuclei of root cap and xylem cells in mock-treated roots ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 )

. Here, we show that the accumulation of uncleared LRC cell corpses on the roots of smb-3 mutants triggers hypercolonization by S. indica, especially around the meristematic zone, and delays S. indica-induced root growth promotion. We propose that a tight regulation of host dPCD and rapid and complete clearance of root cap cell corpses play important roles in restricting fungal colonization at the root apical meristem. Furthermore, we show that S. indica downregulates BFN1 in older and differentiated epidermal cells to promote fungal accommodation. Our results emphasize that beneficial microbes have the ability to modify plant dPCD processes to enhance host colonization.

In this study, we investigated the functional link between dPCD and microbial accommodation in roots. Impaired dPCD in the Arabidopsis smb-3 and bfn1-1 mutants increased colonization by the beneficial endophyte S. indica. The smb-3 mutants displayed hypercolonization along the entire primary root, suggesting that the extra sheet of cell corpses surrounding smb-3 roots provide additional and easily accessible nutrients that fuel fungal colonization. In fact, we observed a clearing effect with progressive colonization stages. Furthermore, hypercolonization of Arabidopsis, caused by the loss of dPCD in the root cap, mitigated the beneficial effects of S. indica by delaying the induction of growth promotion. Most notably, we observed hypercolonization of the meristematic zone of smb-3 mutants ( Figure 6 ). The root apical meristem embedded in this zone of the root tip is essential for root growth, as all primary root tissue originates from these continuously dividing stem cells ( Hamamoto et al., 2006 ). This sensitive tissue is surrounded by the root cap, which protects it from external stresses ( Kumar and Iyer-Pascuzzi, 2020 ). The phenotype of smb-3 mutants shows resemblance to the human skin disease hyperkeratosis. In healthy human skin, a pool of stem cells produces layers of cells that divide, differentiate, die, and are shed. Such developmental programs form a physical and dynamic barrier against environmental factors. Microbes attempting to establish themselves are consistently removed by skin exfoliation ( Dettmer, 2021 ). Patients with hyperkeratosis show an accumulation of dead cells on the outer skin layer, making them more susceptible to microbial infection ( Cheng et al., 1992 )

., 2014 ). Despite its importance in root morphology and plant development, little is known about the importance of dPCD and rapid cell corpse clearance on plant-microbe interactions. To address this question, we tested two well-characterized loss-of-function T-DNA insertion lines, smb-3 and bfn1-1, during colonization with Serendipita indica, a beneficial fungus of the order Sebacinales. As a root endophyte, S. indica colonizes the epidermal and cortex layers of a broad range of different plant hosts, conferring various beneficial effects, including plant growth promotion, protection against pathogenic microbes and increased tolerance to abiotic stresses ( Boorboori and Zhang, 2022; Mahdi et al., 2022; Fesel and Zuccaro, 2016 ). The colonization strategy of S. indica comprises an initial biotrophic interaction, followed by a growth phase associated with a restricted host cell death that does not, however, diminish the beneficial effects on the plant host. The induction of restricted cell death in the epidermal and cortex layers is a crucial component of the colonization strategy of S. indica and is accompanied by an increased production of fungal hydrolytic enzymes ( Zuccaro et al., 2011; Deshmukh et al., 2006 ). The switch between the biotrophic and the cell death-associated phase can vary depending on the host system and environmental conditions, but has been postulated to occur approximately 6–8 days post inoculation ( dpi ) in Arabidopsis ( Zuccaro et al., 2011 ). Although several effector proteins involved in fungal accommodation have been described ( Dunken et al., 2022; Nostadt et al., 2020; Nizam et al., 2019; Weiß et al., 2016; Wawra et al., 2016; Akum et al., 2015 ), the exact mechanism by which S. indica manipulates host cell death and the role of dPCD in fungal accommodation in the roots are largely unclear

. These data suggest that the lack of BFN1 activity in the root cap, xylem, and senescent epidermis creates a general cellular stress in the roots that affects proteostasis in the differentiation zone ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ). Similar to bfn1-1, WT roots colonized by S. indica showed increased Evans blue and Proteostat signal in the differentiation zone. Aggregated proteins were detected in colonized and adjacent non-colonized cells along the differentiation zone, suggesting a non-cell autonomous host response to the fungus ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ). To investigate the biological relevance of BFN1 downregulation during S. indica root colonization, we quantified extraradical fungal growth using the WGA-AF 488 stain. When comparing staining intensities of S. indica-inoculated bfn1-1 mutants and WT seedlings, we observed a significantly stronger fluorescence signal at the roots of bfn1-1 mutants, indicating a higher extraradical fungal colonization along the differentiation zone ( Figure 5E and F and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ). However, similar to WT roots, bfn1-1 mutants did not exhibit fungal colonization around the meristematic zone as observed in smb-3-colonized roots ( Figure 5E ). Quantification of intraradical colonization by qPCR, after removal of outer fungal mycelium, showed a significant increase of S. indica biomass in bfn1-1 mutants at later stages of interaction ( Figure 5G ). Together, these results emphasize that downregulation of BFN1 during colonization is beneficial for intra- and extraradical fungal accommodation in the differentiation zone. Next, we investigated the impact of other beneficial microbes on dPC processes in Arabidopsis. To this end, we analyzed the expression of cell death marker genes during colonization by the endophyte Pseudomonas syringae ( Figure 6 ). In contrast to S indica, P. syringae did not induce significant changes in BFN expression ( Figure 6A and C ). However, we observed a significant increase in LRC expression during colonization ( Figure 6A and C ). These results suggest that P syae may not manipulate host dPC processes like S indica, but rather induce cell death through other mechanisms.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Large vesicle extrusion from neurons may contribute to spreading pathogenic protein aggregates and promoting inflammatory responses, two mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative disease. Factors that regulate the extrusion of large vesicles, such as exophers produced by proteostressed C. elegans touch neurons, are poorly understood. Here, we document that mechanical force can significantly potentiate exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons. Exopher production from the C. elegans ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3, coinciding with the C. elegans reproductive peak. Genetic disruption of C. elegans germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period. Conversely, restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can strongly increase ALMR exopher production. Overall, genetic interventions that promote ALMR exopher production are associated with expanded uterus lengths and genetic interventions that suppress ALMR exopher production are associated with shorter uterus lengths. In addition to the impact of fertilized eggs, ALMR exopher production can be enhanced by filling the uterus with oocytes, dead eggs, or even fluid, supporting that distention consequences, rather than the presence of fertilized eggs, constitute the exopher-inducing stimulus. We conclude that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons. Our observations draw attention to the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and in aggregate spreading mechanisms, making a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease.

    C. elegans reproduction features physical expansion and contraction of multiple tissue/cell types--the gonad houses the expanding germline, and the spermatheca expands and retracts vigorously as each mature oocyte enters and exits. The uterus also stretches to house eggs and can contract locally as eggs transit or are expelled via the action of the vulval and uterine muscles. The filled reproductive apparatus can thus clearly exert both constitutive and sporadic pressure on surrounding tissues as it enacts its essential functions. What is the source of the force that promotes exopher production? Elegant work on the egg-laying circuit ( comprising the somatic gonad, the HSN and VC neurons, and the vulval, and uterine muscle ) has provided evidence for mechanical signaling within the egg-laying circuit that regulates initiation, promotion, and termination of egg-laying ( Medrano and Collins, 2023; Ravi et al., 2018; Kopchock et al., 2021; Ravi et al., 2021 ). Working backward, exopher-promoting force seems unlikely to derive from the vulva or vulval muscle contractions, since when these cells are genetically disrupted in lin-39 RNAi or in sem-2 mutants, high levels of exophers still are generated. Changes in spermatheca volume, which expands and contracts dramatically as mature oocytes enter via valve opening/closure ( Tan and Zaidel-Bar, 2015 ), might be sensed, but spermatheca contractions are reported to be normal in hyperactive egg-laying goa-1 ( Govindan et al., 2006 ), which is an exopher-suppressing background. Under no-sperm conditions, oocyte transit rates are lower than for fertilized eggs, and sperm-derived signals influence spermathecal valve opening ( McGovern et al., 2007; McCarter et al., 1999; Miller et al

. The requirement of sperm and oocytes for neuronal exopher production raises the obvious question as to whether fertilized eggs/embryos are required for ALMR exophergenesis ( Figure 1I ). C. elegans genes impacting fertilization and embryonic development have been studied in exquisite detail ( Greenstein, 2005; Stein and Golden, 2018; Rose and Gönczy, 2014; Schneider and Bowerman, 2003 ). We tested embryonic development genes known for roles at particular stages for impact on neuronal exopher levels using RNAi knockdown approaches. In C. elegans fertilization, as the mature oocyte encounters the sperm-filled spermatheca, a single sperm enters the mature ovulated oocyte ( fertilization time 0 ), triggering the rapid events of egg activation, which include polyspermy block, eggshell formation, completion of meiotic divisions and extrusion of polar bodies. The multi-step eggshell formation ( Figure 2A ) is completed within 5 min of sperm entry, by which time the zygote has been passed into the uterus, where the maternal chromosomes execute both meiotic divisions ( meiosis accomplished by ~20 min after fertilization ). After the establishment of egg polarity cues, the first mitotic cell division occurs ~40 min after fertilization ( Stein and Golden, 2018; Schneider and Bowerman, 2003 ). Eggs are held in the mother’s uterus until they are laid at the ~30- cell stage ( gastrulation ). In wild-type, ~8 fertilized eggs occupy the uterus when egg laying begins at ~6 hr of adult life ( Medrano and Collins, 2023 ). Our data revealed an unexpected theme: we found that disruption of tested early-acting genes essential for eggshell assembly ( chitin-binding domain protein cbd-1 González et al., 2018; Figure 2B, chitin precursor synthesis gene gna-2 Johnston et al., 2006; Figure 2C and D, permeability barrier-required CDP-ascarylose synthesis gene perm-1 Olson et al

. In sum, manipulation of uterine egg occupancy is strongly correlated with the extent of ALMR neuronal exophergenesis—high egg retention promotes high exophergenesis and low egg retention is associated with low exophergenesis. The ALML and ALMR anterior touch neurons share developmental, morphological, and functional similarities ( Chalfie and Sulston, 1981 ), yet paradoxically, ALMR consistently produces exophers at higher levels than ALML ( Melentijevic et al., 2017; also Figure 4G ). The ALM neurons are embedded within the C. elegans hypodermis, but the ALMR soma is situated in the vicinity of the gonad and its resident eggs, whereas the ALML soma, on the opposite side of the animal, is positioned closer to the intestine ( Figure 4A and B; Goodman, 2006 ). To ask if proximity to the gonad is correlated with exopher production, we randomly selected 128 Ad2 hermaphrodites that expressed mCherry in the touch receptor neurons, imaged in brightfield to visualize the egg zone of each animal, and imaged again in the red channel to visualize the touch neuron, recording the relative positions of ALMR and the egg zone ( Figure 4C ). We also assessed whether the ALMR neuron had produced an exopher or not. We found that 37/128 ALMRs examined had produced an exopher ( Exopher+ ), and that 36/37 ( 95% ) of the Exopher+ ALMR neuronal somas that had produced exophers were positioned within the visualized egg zone ( Figure 4D ). For the Exopher- ALMRs that had not produced exophers, 63/91 ( 70% ) had neuronal somas located in the egg zone. Thus, although ALMR soma positioning in the egg zone does not guarantee exophergenesis in the mCherryAg2 strain, the neurons that did make exophers were nearly always in the egg zone ( p<0. 01 in Chi-Square test, Figure 4D ). To further test for the association of egg zone proximity to ALMR and exopher production, we genetically shifted ALM position

. elegans. For example, in a strain that expresses GFP to label the hypodermis and expresses mCherry to label the touch neurons, the distortion of the hypodermis by eggs can be easily visualized as dark non-fluorescent eggs project through the observation plane of the hypodermis ( Figure 5A ). Thus, the uterus can approach and pressure surrounding tissue, including touch neurons. We quantitated the absolute uterine length as an indicator for stretch in relation to exopher production levels under representative conditions of high and low exophergenesis. We found that egg retention mutants that exhibit high exophergenesis, egl-3 ( Δ ) ( Figure 5B ), egl-9 ( Δ ) ( Figure 5C ), and sem-2 ( rf ) ( Figure 5D ), had significantly longer egg zones ( i. e. uterus length ) as compared to wild-type. In contrast, cbd-1 RNAi ( Figure 5E ), sperm-less induction with SPE-44 AID ( Figure 5F ), and hyperactive egg-laying mutant goa-1 ( Δ ) ( Figure 5G ), which we find to be strong exophergenesis suppressors, are all associated with short uterine egg zones. Knocking down either the 4 cell stage gene mex-3 or the gastrulation gene gad-1, which are associated with neither egg retention nor exopher elevation, does not have an extended egg zone/uter length ( Figure 5H and I ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: Increasing evidence supports a role for deficient Wnt signaling in Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ). Studies reveal that the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-3 ( DKK3 ) colocalizes to amyloid plaques in AD patients. Here, we investigate the contribution of DKK3 to synapse integrity in healthy and AD brains. Our findings show that DKK3 expression is upregulated in the brains of AD subjects and that DKK3 protein levels increase at early stages in the disease. In hAPP-J20 and hAPPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mouse AD models, extracellular DKK3 levels are increased and DKK3 accumulates at dystrophic neuronal processes around plaques. Functionally, DKK3 triggers the loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of the Wnt/GSK3β signaling with a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses via activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway. In contrast, DKK3 knockdown restores synapse number and memory in hAPP-J20 mice. Collectively, our findings identify DKK3 as a novel driver of synaptic defects and memory impairment in AD.

   ., 2012 ), changes in synapse number induced by silencing DKK3 is unlikely to be due to the formation of plaques as we observed similar synaptic changes when plaques are absent. In line with this view, knockdown of DKK3 does not affect the number or size of amyloid plaques in the J20 hippocampus. Moreover, our gain-of-function studies demonstrate that DKK3 directly affects the integrity of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Crucially, downregulation of DKK3 also improves cognitive function, particularly spatial memory, in J20 mice. The rescue of the synaptic and cognitive defects is specific to DKK3 downregulation as no differences in Dkk1 levels, a Wnt antagonist that affects synapses ( Marzo et al., 2016 ), are observed. Our functional studies in the J20 demonstrate a novel role for DKK3 in synaptic and cognitive function. In addition, our results using human AD brain samples provide strong support for the contribution of DKK3 to AD. Thus, DKK3 is a potential target for ameliorating excitatory and inhibitory synaptic impairment and memory dysfunction in AD.

. Here, we investigate the role of DKK3 in the integrity and function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in healthy and AD brains. Our RNAseq analyses reveal that DKK3 expression is increased in the brains of AD patients. Consistently, we found that DKK3 protein is increased in the human AD brain from early stages of the disease. In two AD mouse models, extracellular DKK3 is increased in the hippocampus before substantial plaque deposition. As the pathology progresses in the mouse AD brain, DKK3 accumulates in dystrophic neurites around amyloid plaques. Functionally, our confocal and electrophysiological studies demonstrate that increased levels of DKK3 trigger the loss of excitatory synapses with a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses in the adult mouse hippocampus through different Wnt pathways. Crucially, in vivo downregulation of DKK3 ameliorates excitatory and inhibitory synaptic defects in the hippocampus and improves memory in an AD mouse model. Together, our findings in humans and functional studies in mice identify DKK3 as a driver of synapse pathology and cognitive impairment in AD.

Synapse loss is the strongest correlate with cognitive impairment in AD ( Mucke and Selkoe, 2012; Selkoe and Hardy, 2016 ). However, the mechanisms that trigger synaptic changes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigated the function of the Wnt antagonist DKK3 on synaptic integrity and memory in the healthy and AD brain. Our functional analyses in AD models and our studies in human samples strongly support the notion that DKK3 contributes to synapse defects and memory impairment in AD. Our analyses of brain samples from AD patients show an upregulation of DKK3 at the mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, DKK3 elevation starts from early stages as we observed increased protein levels in Braak I-III subjects and in asymptomatic cases using a published proteomic dataset ( Johnson et al., 2022 ). These findings are in agreement with other proteomic studies showing increased levels of DKK3 in different brain areas, including the hippocampus and in cortical synaptosomes of AD patients ( Hesse et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019 ). Together, our findings in AD patients suggest that increased DKK3 levels in the brain could underlie synapse dysfunction in AD. Amyloid plaques are a prominent neuropathological feature of AD. A previous study revealed that DKK3 is present at Aβ plaques in the brains of AD subjects ( Bruggink et al., 2015 ), which was later confirmed by proteomic studies in human and mouse brains ( Drummond et al., 2017; Xiong et al., 2019 ). Consistent with these findings, we demonstrate that DKK3 accumulates at both diffuse and dense-core Aβ plaques in two AD mouse models: the NLGF and J20 lines. Moreover, our analyses revealed that DKK3 is specifically localized at axonal spheroids. DKK3 colocalized with LAMP1, suggesting that DKK3 is present in abnormally enlarged vesicles. This accumulation could indicate changes in DKK3 transport within dystrophic neurites affecting its degradation and/or secretion

. We found that 4-month-old J20 mice exhibited a 40–45% loss of excitatory synapses in the CA3 SR when compared to WT ( Figure 6B and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) as previously reported ( Hong et al., 2016 ). Remarkably, DKK3 knockdown restored excitatory synapse number in J20 mice ( Figure 6B and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ). In contrast to excitatory synapses, inhibitory synapses were increased by 20. 60% in J20 mice compared to WT ( Figure 6C and Figure 6—figure supplement 1C ). Importantly, DKK3 silencing decreased inhibitory synapse number in these mice ( Figure 6C and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ). Thus, in vivo DKK3 loss-of-function ameliorates synaptic defects in J20 mice, supporting the hypothesis that DKK3 is a key contributor to synaptic changes in this AD mouse model. A key feature of AD brains is the loss of synapses around Aβ plaques ( Koffie et al., 2012 ). Therefore, we investigated whether DKK3 affects synapse number around plaques in 9-month-old J20 mice ( Figure 6A ). We observed a significant effect of distance on the density of excitatory synapses from the core of the plaque ( F ( 6, 318 ) =27. 26, p-value <0. 0001 ) and inhibitory synapses ( F ( 6, 276 ) =23. 51, p-value <0. 0001 ) ( Figure 6D and E ). Importantly, DKK3 silencing significantly increased the number of excitatory synapses ( Figure 6D and Figure 6—figure supplement 1D ) but decreased the density of inhibitory synapses around plaques ( Figure 6E and Figure 6—figure supplement 1E ) when compared to J20 mice injected with Scr shRNA. Importantly, knockdown of DKK3 did not affect the number or size of plaques in the CA3 SR ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1F ). Given the role of DKK1 in synaptic changes and in AD ( Caricasole et al., 2004; Marzo et al., 2016; Purro et al., 2012 ), we next investigated whether modulation of DKK3 levels affected Dkk1 mRNA levels in the hippocampus of WT and J20 mice injected with Scr or Dkk3 shRNA

. However, no changes in Dkk1 mRNA levels were observed ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1G ). We next investigated whether increased Dkk1 led to changes in Dkk3 expression. For this, we used a transgenic mouse model that expresses Dkk1 upon induction ( iDkk1 mice; Galli et al., 2021; Galli et al., 2014; Marzo et al., 2016 ). After 14 days of Dkk1 expression and when synaptic changes are observed in these mice, we found that Dkk3 levels were unaltered in the hippocampus ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1H ). Thus, Dkk3’s expression is unaffected by Dkk1 and vice versa. Together, these results demonstrate that loss-of-function of DKK3 ameliorates excitatory and inhibitory synapse changes in J20 mice independently of DKK1 before plaque burden starts ( 4-months-old ), and later when amyloid plaque pathology is evident ( 9-month-old ). The finding that DKK3 loss-of-function reverses synaptic changes at early and late stages in J20 mice led us to test whether silencing DKK3 restores hippocampal-mediated learning and memory in these mice ( Figure 7A ). Knockdown of D3 significantly improved spatial memory in J20 compared to mice injected with ScrRNA ( Figure 7B and Figure 7— supplement ). Importantly, D3 silencing did not improve memory in WT mice ( Figure 7 and Figure— supplement ) indicating that the rescue of memory is specific to D3 downregulation.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The global rise of antibiotic resistance calls for new drugs against bacterial pathogens. A common approach is to search for natural compounds deployed by microbes to inhibit competitors. Here, we show that the iron-chelating pyoverdines, siderophores produced by environmental Pseudomonas spp., have strong antibacterial properties by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens. A screen of 320 natural Pseudomonas isolates used against 12 human pathogens uncovered several pyoverdines with particularly high antibacterial properties and distinct chemical characteristics. The most potent pyoverdine effectively reduced growth of the pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus in a concentration- and iron-dependent manner. Pyoverdine increased survival of infected Galleria mellonella host larvae and showed low toxicity for the host, mammalian cell lines, and erythrocytes. Furthermore, experimental evolution of pathogens combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance evolution compared to an antibiotic. Thus, pyoverdines from environmental strains have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens.

    We investigated whether pyoverdines produced by environmental Pseudomonas spp. have antibacterial activities against human opportunistic pathogens through iron sequestration and withholding this trace element from pathogens. Our screen involving 320 environmental isolates and 12 pathogen strains revealed five top pyoverdine candidates with broad-spectrum activity. These candidates could be distinguished from non-inhibitory pyoverdines by their high CCS values ( standing for larger and more complex molecules ) and their higher iron complexation stability. Experiments with crude- and HPLC-purified pyoverdines showed that pyoverdines completely stall the growth of A. baumannii and S. aureus, while showing intermediate activity against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. When administered as treatment to infected G. mellonella larvae, we observed significantly increased host survival rates in infections with A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, demonstrating that pyoverdine exhibits antibacterial activity in hosts. Furthermore, we found low toxicity of pyoverdines at effective concentrations and observed low potentials for resistance evolution. Overall, our results reveal pyoverdines from non-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp. as potent antibacterials against several human opportunistic pathogens. Our novel treatment approach assumes that pyoverdines sequester iron and thereby induce iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens. Several of our findings support this view. First, the growth-inhibiting effect of our top pyoverdine candidates exclusively occurred under iron-limited conditions, while pathogen growth was restored under iron-replete conditions ( Figure 1, Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ). Second, non-inhibitory ferri-pyoverdines were more prone toward CIU ( collision induced unfolding ) than inhibitory ferric-pyoverdines ( Figure 2D ), suggesting that inhibitory pyoverdines have a higher iron-binding affinity

. To test our hypothesis, we screened pyoverdines from a library of 320 environmental Pseudomonas strains, isolated from soil and freshwater habitats, for their activity against 12 strains of human opportunistic bacteria. For the most promising pyoverdine candidates, we elucidated the chemical structure to assess diversity and understand the chemical properties important for iron competition. Subsequently, we assessed the efficacy of the three top pyoverdine candidates against four human opportunistic pathogens ( Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus ) in vitro and/or in vivo via infections of the Greater wax moth larvae ( Galleria mellonella ). We further assessed their toxicity in the host, toward two mammalian cell lines and red blood cells. Finally, we used experimental evolution combined with whole-genome sequencing to study the potential of pathogens evolving resistance against pyoverdine treatment.

. Third, the pyoverdine precursor ferribactin did not inhibit pathogen growth ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). The two molecules are identical apart from one ring in the chromophore core that is not cyclized and not oxidized in ferribactin, which compromises the binding of iron. These findings suggest that pyoverdine does not target the pathogens directly, but rather indirectly via the induction of iron starvation. We observed that pyoverdines showed pathogen-specific efficacies in curbing bacterial growth ( Figure 3 ). We propose that differences can be explained by the various strategies of these pathogens to cope with iron stress. A. baumannii and S. aureus produce siderophores that have a much simpler chemical structures than pyoverdines and are expected to bind iron with lower affinity ( A. baumannii: acinetobactin [association constant: 1026 M–1], fimsbactin [1027 M–1], and baumannoferrin [unknown] [Bohac et al., 2019; Shapiro and Wencewicz, 2016; Sheldon and Skaar, 2020], S. aureus: staphyloferrin A+B [unknown] ) ( Hammer and Skaar, 2011 ) than pyoverdine ( 1032 M–1 ) ( Meyer and Abdallah, 1978 ). Hence, the growth suppression of A. baumannii and S. aureus most likely occurs because their siderophores are too weak to successfully compete with pyoverdine. The situation is different for K. pneumoniae, which produces enterobactin, the siderophore with the highest known iron affinity ( 1052 M–1 ) ( Harris et al., 1979 ). Consistent with the concept of iron competition, we observed that pyoverdine treatment is less effective against K. pneumoniae and was only potent for one out of three pyoverdines ( 3G07, Figure 3 ). Finally, pyoverdine treatment is not expected to work well against P. aeruginosa, which itself produces a version of this siderophore

To assess the antibacterial properties of pyoverdines, we performed a growth inhibition screen using a well-characterized collection of 320 natural Pseudomonas isolates ( Butaitė et al., 2017; Butaitė et al., 2018; Butaitė et al., 2021; Kramer et al., 2020 ). The isolates stem from freshwater and soil communities and belong to the group of fluorescent pseudomonads ( e. g., P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. syringae, P. chlororaphis ) that are non-pathogenic to humans and can produce and secrete pyoverdines, a group of high iron-affinity siderophores ( Meyer, 2000 ). Important to note is that several isolates are likely to produce secondary siderophores in addition to pyoverdine ( Cornelis, 2010 ). Given that secondary siderophores generally have lower iron affinity than pyoverdine, we anticipate treatment effects to be primarily driven by pyoverdines. In a first screen, we evaluated how the sterile pyoverdine-containing supernatants of the 320 isolates affect the growth of 12 human opportunistic pathogens ( Table 1 ). Specifically, we grew the pathogens in 70% fresh casamino acid medium ( CAA ) supplemented with 30% spent supernatant. We found high variation in the supernatant effect, ranging from complete pathogen growth inhibition to growth promotion compared to the control treatment ( 70% CAA supplemented with 30% sodium chloride 0. 8% solution ) ( Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). The mean supernatant effect across all pathogens showed a bimodal distribution with two peaks at 0. 47–0. 58 ( approximately 50% growth inhibition ) and 1. 00–1. 10 ( no growth inhibition ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ). Our observations are consistent with previous studies, in which supernatants containing siderophores can have both growth inhibitory and stimulatory effects ( Gu et al., 2020; Butaitė et al., 2018 )

. The two competing pyoverdines likely have similar iron affinities and the presence of pyoverdine receptors in the pathogen might foster the uptake of the supplemented pyoverdine. Our results indeed support the view that pyoverdine treatment is not effective against P. aeruginosa. Taken together, we predict that pyoverdine treatment could be highly potent against certain pathogens like A. baumannii and S. aureus that have less efficient siderophores and are unable to use the pyoverdine as iron source. For every new treatment, it is important to consider whether it has unintentional consequences for the targeted pathogen. Because our approach does not kill pathogens directly, there are multiple ways of how pathogens may react to pyoverdine treatment. For example, pathogens could increase the production of their own siderophores in response to the severe iron limitation induced by pyoverdines. Alternatively, siderophores can serve as signaling molecules in certain species like P. aeruginosa to induce biofilm formation and virulence factor production. In conclusion, pydines from non-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp have the potential to become a new class of antibacterials against human opportunistic pathogens.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Schizophrenia results in part from a failure of prefrontal networks but we lack full understanding of how disruptions at a synaptic level cause failures at the network level. This is a crucial gap in our understanding because it prevents us from discovering how genetic mutations and environmental risks that alter synaptic function cause prefrontal network to fail in schizophrenia. To address that question, we developed a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal local circuits that can explain the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits we recently observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. We analyze how the balance between AMPA and NMDA components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition in the network influence oscillatory spike synchrony to inform the biological data. We show that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting from a steady to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs such as might occur during behavior. These findings strongly parallel dynamic modulation of 0-lag spike synchrony we observed between neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex during behavior, as well as the suppression of this 0-lag spiking by administration of NMDAR antagonists. As such, our cortical network model provides a plausible mechanism explaining the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. 

    Supporting Text:
    NMDAR synaptic malfunction has been implicated as causal in schizophrenia ( Fromer et al., 2014; Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014; Timms et al., 2013 ), and loss of NMDAR synaptic function in prefrontal networks is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits as well as clinical symptoms in the disease ( Goldman-Rakic, 1999; Javitt et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013 ). However, we do not have a complete understanding of how NMDAR synaptic mechanisms influence neural dynamics in prefrontal networks, nor how the disruption of NMDAR synaptic mechanisms might cause prefrontal networks to malfunction. To address these questions, we recently investigated how blocking NMDAR altered neural dynamics and effective communication between neurons in prefrontal cortex of monkeys performing a cognitive control task measuring deficits in schizophrenia ( Blackman et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2010; Kummerfeld et al., 2020; Zick et al., 2018 ). We found that reducing NMDAR synaptic communication reduced the frequency of synchronous ( ‘0-lag’ ) spiking between neurons, as well as effective communication between neurons on timescales consistent with monosynaptic interactions between them ( Kummerfeld et al., 2020; Zick et al., 2022; Zick et al., 2018 ). Whereas these studies suggested that NMDAR synaptic function and spike timing in prefrontal networks were linked, they did not elucidate the circuit mechanisms responsible. In the current study, we developed a spiking neural network model to understand mechanisms that might mediate the link between NMDAR synaptic malfunction and neural dynamics ( reduced 0-lag synchronous spiking ) we observed in biological data ( Kummerfeld et al., 2020; Zick et al., 2022; Zick et al., 2018 )

. Although these modeling studies provide important mechanistic insight into prefrontal network dynamics underlying working memory, and potentially, working memory deficits in schizophrenia ( Goldman-Rakic, 1999 ), they do not address the topic of the current study, which is how slow NMDAR recurrent excitation and external input received by the network jointly influence spike timing dynamics at the neuron level and oscillatory dynamics at the population level in the presence of fast AMPA excitation and GABA inhibition. Thus, no prior modeling study captures the relationship between NMDAR synaptic mechanisms, spike timing, and network oscillations that we have observed in neural recordings ( Kummerfeld et al., 2020; Zick et al., 2018 ), and for which we provide a theoretical explanation in the current report. We previously hypothesized that reduced synchrony at the level of spiking neurons ( Zick et al., 2022; Zick et al., 2018 ) could disconnect prefrontal local circuits via spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity ( STDP; Dan and Poo, 2004; Feldman, 2012 ), contributing to the reduction in dendritic spine density that has been observed in postmortem analysis of prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia ( Glantz and Lewis, 2000; MacDonald et al., 2017 ). However, the interaction between neural synchrony and synaptic connectivity in networks incorporating STDP is hard to predict, as changes in connectivity patterns and neural dynamics are mutually dependent and interact in complex ways as connectivity and synchrony influence each other over time. Perhaps for this reason, prior theoretical studies incorporating STDP into spiking networks have obtained divergent results with respect to how STDP changes the pattern of synaptic connections between neurons in networks, and whether synchronous inputs to the neurons are required for STDP to influence the pattern of synaptic connections

. Third, and perhaps most importantly, we show that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents these networks from transitioning into oscillatory activity in response to extrinsic inputs, thereby preventing the emergence of 0-lag spike synchrony. Although prior modeling studies have addressed the relationship between NMDAR function and oscillatory activity in prefrontal networks ( Brunel and Wang, 2003; Compte et al., 2000; Kirli et al., 2014; Wang, 1999 ), none account for this range of experimental observations. The current results allow us to establish strong parallels between simulated and biological data, including the emergence of 0-lag synchronous spiking via recurrent synaptic interactions between neurons during behavior, the association between synchronous spiking and oscillatory population activity, as well as their joint dependence on NMDAR synaptic mechanisms, both in our current simulation and in the neural data ( Zick et al., 2018 ).

., 2018 ), although this remains a possibility. Network simulations that accurately incorporate as many of these biological variables as possible may be useful in predicting how spike timing changes that may emerge downstream of schizophrenia risk factors would be likely to influence synaptic connectivity in the human cortex. In addition, as noted, genetic linkage studies have implicated altered NMDAR function in schizophrenia ( Fromer et al., 2014; Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014 ). Since NMDAR play a central role in the molecular mechanisms that implement STDP in the brain, disruption of NMDAR synaptic transmission in schizophrenia may alter STDP directly, independently of the impact of disrupted NMDAR function on neural spiking dynamics in the disease state. We had previously reported that blocking NMDAR in monkeys ( Zick et al., 2018 ) and deleting a schizophrenia risk gene ( Dgcr8 ) in mice ( Zick et al., 2022 ), both reduced the frequency of synchronous, 0-lag spiking between prefrontal neurons. Dgcr8 encodes a protein involved in the synthesis of miRNA, which in turn bind to mRNA and suppress their translation into proteins, including mRNA coding for NMDAR subunits ( Corbel et al., 2015 ). Deleting Dgcr8 would therefore be expected to reduce miRNA synthesis and increase translation of mRNA coding for NMDAR subunits. Given these considerations, the convergent spike desynchronization we observed in monkey drug and mouse genetic models could be explained by an inverted U-shaped relationship wherein either too little NMDAR function ( as produced by NMDAR blockade in monkeys ) or too much NMDAR function ( as predicted to result from deletion of Dgcr8 in mice ) decreases the frequency of 0-lag spiking between prefrontal neurons ( Zick et al., 2022; Zick et al., 2018 )

. While our relatively simple model qualitatively is consistent with dynamical features of the firing rate and synchrony observed in primate PFC, there are, however, some quantitative discrepancies in firing rates. In addition, recorded neural activity exhibits complex dynamics following the response ( Figure 1B and D ), that are not evident in the simulation ( Figure 7B and D ). This presumably reflects temporal modulation of synaptic inputs to the recorded neurons in the biological data that are more complex than the ramp transient we implemented in the simulation. In summary, the analyses of simulations with stationary and transient external inputs suggest that when the prefrontal network model operates close to the boundary between asynchronous stationary and synchronous oscillatory regimes it has a considerable capacity to capture experimentally observed aspects of spike synchrony in both drug-naive and drug conditions. So far, in most of our analyses, we did not vary the balance between the tonic component of recurrent excitation mediated by NMDA and GABA inhibition, keeping it fixed at INMDA*/IGABA*=0. 15. We have only shown that the network frequency at the onset of oscillation essentially is independent of the INMDA/IGABA balance ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ), and that the characteristic features of the ( IAMPA/IGABA, IX, E/Iθ, E ) state diagram qualitatively similar to those observed in the data ( Figure 3— figure supplement 1 ). However, we did not explore the effect of varying INA/IG on the oscillatory dynamics of the network. In particular, we did not examine the effect of varying INAIG on the emergence of 0ag spiking in response to extrinsic inputs, nor the effect of varying INIG on the frequency of 0ag spiking in response to extrinsic inputs. This is an important issue because the balance between NAR and GABA in the prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia ( Goldmanak, 1999 ), and has been found to be altered in postmortem in schizophrenia ( Glantz and Lewis,2000; MacDonald et al,2017 ). In future work, we plan to investigate the effect of varying INAIG on the oscillatory dynamics of the network and the emergence of 0ag spiking in response to extrinsic inputs, as well as the effect of varying INIG on the frequency of 0ag spiking response to extrinsic inputs.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Angiogenesis is a morphogenic process resulting in the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, usually in hypoxic micro-environments. The initial steps of angiogenesis depend on robust differentiation of oligopotent endothelial cells into the Tip and Stalk phenotypic cell fates, controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell–cell communication. The dynamics of spatial patterning of this cell fate specification are only partially understood. Here, by combining a controlled experimental angiogenesis model with mathematical and computational analyses, we find that the regular spatial Tip–Stalk cell patterning can undergo an order–disorder transition at a relatively high input level of a pro-angiogenic factor VEGF. The resulting differentiation is robust but temporally unstable for most cells, with only a subset of presumptive Tip cells leading sprout extensions. We further find that sprouts form in a manner maximizing their mutual distance, consistent with a Turing-like model that may depend on local enrichment and depletion of fibronectin. Together, our data suggest that NOTCH signaling mediates a robust way of cell differentiation enabling but not instructing subsequent steps in angiogenic morphogenesis, which may require additional cues and self-organization mechanisms. This analysis can assist in further understanding of cell plasticity underlying angiogenesis and other complex morphogenic processes.

    A major challenge of the analysis of tissue development and homeostasis is understanding of how differentiation into distinct cell types can be robustly achieved, while also being sensitive to various pro-differentiation and morphogenic cues and, potentially affected by molecular noise in biochemical reactions. In the context of angiogenesis, this challenge more specifically relates to enabling effective vascular morphogenesis through robust yet environmentally responsive differentiation of endothelial cells into Tip and Stalk cells states. This process is guided by the multiple pro-angiogenic cues, such as VEGF and by the local tissue organization and mediated by the paracrine Delta–NOTCH cell signaling. Recent mathematical models of this process ( Galbraith et al., 2022; Koon et al., 2018 ) have considered the robustness of the Delta–NOTCH differentiation to molecular noise, concluding that noisy biochemical reactions can both disrupt and enhance the spatial differentiation patterns, depending on the magnitude and spatial distribution ( Galbraith et al., 2022 ). The effect of pro-angiogenic cues, such as VEGF on robustness of spatial differentiation patterning remains substantially less explored. Furthermore, compiling between modeling predictions and experimental validation has been challenged by the complexity of in vivo angiogenesis analysis, both on cellular and molecular levels. Here, we integrated engineered experimental angiogenic assay and a spatially resolved computational modeling analysis to explore the spatially and temporally resolved effects of VEGF on angiogenic cell specification. Our results suggest that VEGF can have a dual role in inducing the initial Tip–Stalk cell differentiation. On the one hand, a low level of exogenous VEGF is essential to induce Delta–NOTCH signaling and the classical ordered ‘salt-and-pepper’ pattern, with approximately 25% of the cells adopting the Tip cell fate, as expected ( Collier et al

Angiogenesis, that is, the formation of new blood vessels from the pre-existing ones, is a striking example of phenotypic plasticity in an adult differentiated endothelium. Pro-angiogenic factors secreted in response to hypoxic conditions, particularly the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ), specify differentiation of endothelial cells lining blood vessels into diverse phenotypic states, including the pro-migratory Tip cell phenotype. Tip cells can initiate invasive cell migration into the surrounding extracellular matrix ( ECM ), leading to sprouting and branching of the nascent vessels ( Adams and Alitalo, 2007; Potente et al., 2011 ). Tip cells are differentiated from Stalk cells, another phenotypic state, through juxtacrine cell–cell interaction between these cell types involving NOTCH1 signaling, triggered and modulated by induction of Dll4 and Jag1 ligands ( Benedito et al., 2009; Blanco and Gerhardt, 2013 ). Stalk cells can therefore form in immediate proximity of Tip cells, particularly, at the leading edge of an extending sprout, if the NOTCH signaling is sufficiently pronounced for the Tip–Stalk differentiation to occur. Proliferation of Stalk cells is as essential as the invasive migration of Tip cells for the emergence, extension and branching of growing sprouts, making the analysis of coordinated Tip and Stalk specification particularly important. The inputs specifying the cell fate can be potentially contradictory, for example, with pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, promoting the Tip cell fate, and the NOTCH signaling activated by the neighboring cells promoting the Stalk cell fate and thus suppressing the Tip cell identity in the same cell. These and other signaling inputs can thus be incoherent in terms of cell fate specification and can result in complex dynamic outcomes that are still poorly understood

. Such instabilities might lead to oscillatory-like fluctuations of NOTCH signaling as observed in other differentiation processes ( Zhang et al., 2021; Venzin and Oates, 2020; Kageyama et al., 2010 ) and in endothelial cell sheets under high VEGF concentration inputs ( Ubezio et al., 2016 ). Importantly, these instabilities may also underlie the striking observation of the continuous retraction and extension of mini-sprouts ( protruding Tip cells ) observed in our study. This dynamic fate-switching behavior can thus represent a signature of an unstable differentiation process that may either stabilize, in response to additional cues, leading to a specific morphogenetic outcome, such as the extension of a stable sprout, or display a prolonged instability resulting in a lack of pronounced morphogenesis. Such poised but unstable states may be similar to the undifferentiated state of neurogenic progenitors displaying oscillatory NOTCH signaling, which can proceed to differentiation after the oscillation is resolved into a temporally stable NOTCH activity ( Shimojo et al., 2008 ). The cues stabilizing cellular differentiation and morphogenesis can vary and represent the signature of both global and local pro- and anti-angiogenic environments. For instance, our prior analysis indicated that exposure of model parental vessels to VEGF only rather than a more complete pro-angiogenic cocktail of various factors, can result in formation of mini-sprouts ( and hence, effective Tip–Stalk cell differentiation ), but not full-fledged sprouts ( Kang et al., 2019 ). Sprout formation may also be modulated by the presence of mural cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can indirectly modulate the NOTCH activity, but could also have additional effects, serving to stabilize a specific differentiation outcome

., 2017; Bu et al., 2022 ). As expected for these types of transitions, increasing or decreasing the order-stabilizing Delta–NOTCH cell–cell signaling, resulted in the corresponding shifts of the ranges of VEGF inputs, over which the sharp order–disorder transition occurred. For example, a small increment or decrease in the cellular production of the Delta ligand shifted the order–disorder transition to either lower or higher VEGF inputs ( Figure 2F ). As the broad sweep of the VEGF inputs simulated in the mathematical model is likely beyond the range of receptor sensitivity for the experimental VEGF signaling, we contrasted the predicted fractions of Tip cells with the previously made observations in the 3D experimental angiogenesis model shown in Figure 1. We found that, for the VEGF = 10 ng/ml, the experimentally determined fraction of the Tip cells was 0. 02 ± 0. 08 ( mean ± standard deviation [SD] ), that is, encompassing the fraction of 0. 25 expected for the completely ordered, ‘salt-and-pepper’ Tip cell distribution pattern. However, for VEGF = 100 ng/ml the experimentally observed Tip cell fraction was 0. 32 ± 0. 01 ( mean ± SD ), which corresponded to the disordered state predicted by the model under higher VEGF inputs. We therefore concluded that the transition between order and disorder can occur in the 10–100 ng/ml range of VEGF concentration, allowing us to investigate the properties of the disordered state and its relationship to the spatial frequency of sprout formation. Based on the Tip/Stalk cell ratio, we calibrated the model’s parameters so that a VEGF input of 100 ng/ml matched the experimentally observed Tip/Stalk fractions at the same experimental VEGF input ( see Methods: Mathematical model of VEGF/NOTCH signaling )

. In the new model, we replicated within each cell the signaling network incorporating the NOTCH and VEGF pathways ( Figure 2A ). Prior analysis of this model on the level of two adjacent cells predicted the emergence of bistability between a ( high NOTCH, low Delta ) Stalk phenotype and a ( low NOTCH, high Delta ) Tip phenotype ( Boareto et al., 2015b ). This result is consistent with the overall expectation of the differentiation effect of Delta–NOTCH signaling, which in 2D is further expected to generate ‘salt-and-pepper’ patterns, with a single Tip cell surrounded by six Stalk cells ( Bocci et al., 2020 ), yielding the overall fraction of Tip cells in this arrangement of 0.25. However, the model also predicted the emergence of a disordered state at higher VEG inputs ( Figure 2B ), where the fraction of Tip cells increased to 0. 5, consistent with our experimental observations at VEG = 100 ng/ml ( Figure 1C ). The ordered and disordered states were separated by a sharp transition at VEG = 10 ng ( Figure 2C ), which is in agreement with the experimentally observed order–disorder transition in the 10–100 ng range of VEG ( Figure 1 ). In the disordered state, the model predicted that Tip and St cells were randomly distributed ( Figure 2D ), consistent with our observations of sprout formation at V = 100 ng/ml ( Figure 1 ), where Tip and St cells were intermingled. In the ordered state, Tip and St cells were segregated ( Figure 2E ), consistent with our observations at V = 10 ng ( Figure 1 ) where sprouts were not formed. The model also predicted that in the disordered state Tip cells were more likely to sprout ( Figure 2F ), consistent with our observations at V = 100/ml ( Figure 1 ) where sprouts were formed. In the ordered state, Tip cells were less likely to sprout ( Figure 2 ) consistent with our at V =10 ( Figure 1 ) where sprouts were not formed. The model further predicted that in the disordered state Tip and St cells were more likely to interact ( Figure 2 ) consistent with our observations at V =100 ( Figure 1 ) where Tip and St cells were interming. In the ordered state Tip and St were less likely to interact ( Figure 2 ) consistent with our at =10 ( Figure ) where sprouts were not formed. The model also predicted that in the disordered Tip cells were more likely to proliferate ( Figure 2 ) consistent with our at V =100 ( Figure 1 ) where sprouts were formed. In the ordered Tip were less likely to proliferate ( Figure 2 consistent with at =10 ( Figure ) where sprouts were not formed. The model predicted that in the disordered Tip were more likely to migrate ( Figure 2 ) consistent with our at V100 ( Figure 1 where sprouts were formed. In the ordered Tip were less likely to migrate ( Figure 2 consistent at10 Figure ) where sprouts were not formed. The model predicted that in the disordered Tip were more likely to differentiate ( Figure 2 ) consistent our at V100 ( Figure 1 where sprouts were formed. In ordered Tip were less likely differentiate ( Figure 2 consistent at10 ) where sprouts were not. The model also predicted in the disordered Tip were more likely to undergo apoptosis ( Figure 2 ) consistent our at V100 ( Figure 1 where sprouts were formed. In ordered were less likely undergo apoptosis ( Figure 2 consistent at10 ) where sprouts were not. The model predicted in the disordered Tip were more likely to undergo cell cycle ( Figure 2 consistent our at V100 Figure 1 where sprouts were formed. In ordered were less cycle ( Figure 2 consistent at10 ) sprouts were not formed. The model predicted in the disordered Tip were more likely to express ( Figure 2 consistent our V100 Figure 1 where sprouts were formed.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Locus coeruleus ( LC ) projections to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory. However, the precise timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and which LC-derived neurotransmitters are important for memory formation in the hippocampus are currently unknown. Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine, several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other cortical regions. In some cases, it appears that dopamine release from LC into the hippocampus may be more important for memory than norepinephrine. Here, we extend these data by characterizing the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace fear conditioning in mice. We find that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and that amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term memory formation. We also demonstrate that LC activity increases both norepinephrine and dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus and that the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during trace fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity. Finally, we show that hippocampal dopamine is important for trace fear memory formation, while norepinephrine is not.

    The locus coeruleus and its interaction with the hippocampus are known to be critical for hippocampus-dependent memory formation ( Compton et al., 1995; Kempadoo et al., 2016; Lemon et al., 2009; Takeuchi et al., 2016; Wagatsuma et al., 2018 ). However, due to the predominant use of spatial memory tasks in which the learned information is experienced diffusely in time, the precise temporal dynamics of learning-related LC and LC-HPC activity remain poorly understood. In these experiments, we used trace fear conditioning to examine the contribution of precisely timed phasic LC and LC-HPC activity to long-term memory formation. In the first experiment, we demonstrated that the LC exhibits responses to both neutral and aversive stimuli. This data is consistent with previous reports ( Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981; Hirata and Aston-Jones, 1994; Rasmussen and Jacobs, 1986 ). Given their relatively short duration and the fact that they are elicited specifically by salient sensory stimuli, we refer to these responses as ‘phasic responses’. However, because of the comparatively slow dynamics of fluorescent sensors relative to electrophysiology, we cannot rule out the possibility that these responses are somehow different in nature from previously reported phasic LC responses. Thus, some care must be taken in conflating the characteristics and/or function of the relatively short-lasting responses presented here and the extremely fast phasic responses to very brief ( μs to ms ) sensory stimuli reported previously. Our data also demonstrate that the size of the LC phasic response is modulated by the intensity, or salience, of sensory stimuli. This relationship between salience and LC response magnitude was particularly pronounced for the aversive foot-shock

. During the training session, 20 Hz blue light was delivered to the locus coeruleus in three two-second periods beginning at each of the trial events when consistent LC responses were observed in fiber photometry experiments: tone onset, tone termination, and shock onset ( Figure 4C ). The next day, animals underwent a memory test in a novel context in which they were repeatedly exposed to the training tone ( Figure 4D ). Freezing during the tone and the post-tone period was used as an index of fear memory retrieval. Phasic LC stimulation at the onset of all learning-related events significantly enhanced long-term memory formation. Cre-positive mice expressing ChR2 froze significantly more in the memory test during both the tones and the 20 s post-tone period corresponding to the trace-interval on the training day. These data indicate that increased phasic activation of the LC at specific learning-related time points during trace conditioning is sufficient to enhance long-term memory formation. Our data suggest that LC projections to the hippocampus are activated by salient learning-related events and that this LC activation can enhance long term memory formation. However, it remains unclear which neurotransmitter the LC releases into the dHPC during these responses. Canonically, the LC is known as the primary source of norepinephrine in the forebrain ( Jones and Moore, 1977; Lindvall and Björklund, 1974; Pickel et al., 1974; Schwarz and Luo, 2015 ). However, recent evidence suggests that the LC can co-release norepinephrine and dopamine into the hippocampus and other cortical areas ( Devoto and Flore, 2006; Kempadoo et al., 2016; Smith and Greene, 2012; Takeuchi et al., 2016; Wagatsuma et al., 2018 )

. In some cases, it appears that dopamine release from LC into the HPC may be more important for memory than norepinephrine ( Kempadoo et al., 2016; Takeuchi et al., 2016; Wagatsuma et al., 2018 ). However, studies examining the effect of LC on HPC-dependent memory have generally not distinguished between tonic and phasic LC activity or between dopamine and norepinephrine signaling. In some cases, this distinction is prevented by the use of temporally imprecise manipulations like lesions and drug infusions. In others, it is difficult to determine the importance of time-locked phasic firing because of the use of spatial memory tasks that are commonly used to assess hippocampus ( HPC ) -dependent memory. Because space is a temporally diffuse stimulus, it is difficult to know the exact moments during spatial learning when phasic responses might be important. This does not rule out the possibility that phasic LC activity and dopamine signaling is important for spatial learning, but the lack of experimental control over the animals’ sampling of the relevant stimuli makes this possibility opaque to examination. Studies that have used discrete reward learning tasks to examine dopamine function in the HPC have also not typically distinguished between tonic and phasic release. To address these issues, we used a trace fear conditioning task in which animals learn an association between a neutral and aversive stimulus that are separated in time. Because trace fear conditioning ( a ) requires intact hippocampal activity ( Chowdhury et al., 2005; Raybuck and Lattal, 2014; Wilmot et al., 2019 ) and ( b ) involves learning about discrete, well-controlled stimuli, it is ideally suited to characterize the rapid temporal dynamics of LC activity and LC-HPC communication during learning and examine their role in long term memory formation

The locus coeruleus ( LC ) supports an array of cognitive processes by modulating brain-wide arousal states and responding to salient events in the environment. LC neurons accomplish this via two distinct modes of activity: tonic and phasic. Changes in the frequency of tonic activity are associated with corresponding changes in psychological state. Low tonic activity ( ~0–2 Hz ) is associated with drowsiness or sleep and increasing levels of tonic activity ( ~3–10 Hz ) are associated with increased arousal, progressing from exploration and task engagement to agitation and anxiety states ( Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005 ). Bouts of phasic activity ( ~10–20 Hz ) are most often observed during intermediate levels of tonic activity in response to salient environmental events ( Aston-Jones et al., 1999 ). When locked to task-relevant events, these phasic responses are associated with improved cognitive performance across a variety of tasks ( Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005 for review ). A large body of research supports the idea that the LC is critically involved in memory formation. Monoamine depletion in the LC, noradrenergic and dopaminergic antagonism in multiple brain regions, and direct inhibition of the LC all impair memory across a number of tasks ( Giustino and Maren, 2018; Lisman and Grace, 2005; Selden et al., 1990; Uematsu et al., 2017; Wagatsuma et al., 2018 ). Conversely, LC stimulation as well as dopamine and norepinephrine agonism can enhance memory ( Bach et al., 1999; Kempadoo et al., 2016; Packard and White, 1991; Packard and White, 1989; Sara and Devauges, 1988 ). Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine, several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus ( HPC ) and other cortical regions ( Devoto and Flore, 2006; Smith and Greene, 2012 )

., 2000; Tully et al., 2007 ). Given our data showing that dopamine, and not norepinephrine, is required for trace fear memory formation, the most direct possibility is that the release of dopamine from the LC enhances learning-related plasticity in regions supporting trace fear conditioning. Our finding that systemic β-adrenergic receptor antagonism has no effect on trace fear memory formation was surprising in light of previous work demonstrating memory impairments after infusions of adrenergic antagonists into the hippocampus or amygdala ( Giustino and Maren, 2018 for review ). However, our data is consistent with the idea that dopamine, not norephineph, is involved in trace memory formation in the hippocampus. Our results also suggest that the timing of dopamine release in the hippocampus during trace conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity. This is consistent with the idea that the LC releases dopamine into the hippocampus in response to task-relevant stimuli and that this release is important for memory formation. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and that optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term formation. We also show that LC increases both norepine and dopamine in the hippocampus and that the timing of hippocal dopamine during fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity. Finally, we demonstrate that hippocal dopamine is important for fear formation while norephrine is not.
