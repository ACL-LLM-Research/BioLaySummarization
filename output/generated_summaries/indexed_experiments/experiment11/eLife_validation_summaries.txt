    Title: Increasing Notch signaling antagonizes PRC2-mediated silencing to promote reprograming of germ cells into neurons
    Abstract: Cell-fate reprograming is at the heart of development, yet very little is known about the molecular mechanisms promoting or inhibiting reprograming in intact organisms. In the C. elegans germline, reprograming germ cells into somatic cells requires chromatin perturbation. Here, we describe that such reprograming is facilitated by GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway. This is surprising, since this pathway is best known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors. Through a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes, we uncovered a possible explanation for this unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch. We propose that GLP-1/Notch promotes reprograming by activating specific genes, silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ), and identify the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target facilitating reprograming. These findings have wide implications, ranging from development to diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.

   . When analyzing only genes with higher than baseline germline expression values, the disproportional X-linkage of Notch-activated genes was even more striking ( fifteen times more than expected by chance ( p=2, 19e-38; Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, Figure 2—source data 1 ). In the C. elegans germline, X-linked genes are largely silenced by the C. elegans PRC2 ( Fong et al., 2002 ). Thus, the X chromosome bias among Notch-activated genes suggested a possible antagonistic relationship between GLP-1Notch and PRC2. The C. elegans PRC2 consists of MES-2, -3, and -6 ( Bender et al., 2004 ) and levels of the corresponding transcripts were essentially not altered by GLP-1Notch signaling ( mes-2: absolute fold change ( fc ) -1. 3747; mes-3: fc 1. 003; mes-6: fc 1. 037 ). To test for a functional relationship between GLP-1Notch and PRC2, we examined genetic interactions between GLP-1 and PRC2 mutants. At 20°C, both the temperature-sensitive gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) and the homozygous loss-of-function mes-2 ( bn11 ) mutants, derived from heterozygous mothers providing maternal MES-2 ( mes-2 M+Z- mutants ), were viable and produced gonads with nearly wild-type appearance. The double mes-2 M+Z-; glp-1 ( ar202 ) mutants, however, displayed distal and proximal tumors at the same temperature ( Figure 2B; 32/32 examined gonads ). PRC2 and GLP-1Notch thus interact functionally, and they appear to do so in a germ cell autonomous manner ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3, Figure 2—source data 1 ). Given the striking enrichment of Notch-activated genes on the X chromosome, and the genetic interaction between PRC2 and GLP-1Notch, we speculated that GLP-1Notch and PRC2 act on similar genes. To determine whether Notch-activated genes are also PRC2-repressed, we first determined putative PRC2 targets by expression analyses on isolated wild-type, M+Z- mes-2 or mes-6 mutant gonads ( GEO accession number GSE49395 )

. By contrast, C. elegans has been used as a model to study reprograming in an intact organism ( Horner et al., 1998; Fukushige et al., 1998; Zhu et al., 1998; Fukushige and Krause, 2005; Ciosk et al., 2006; Jarriault et al., 2008; Yuzyuk et al., 2009; Riddle et al., 2013 ). In this model, germ cells can be directly reprogrammed into neurons by depleting specific chromatin modifiers such as LIN-53 ( Rbbp4/7 ) or components of PRC2, and by concomitant overexpression of the transcription factor CHE-1, which induces glutamatergic neuronal fate in a process which we refer to as Germ cell Conversion ( GeCo ) ( Tursun et al., 2011; Patel et al., 2012 ). Here, we identify the Notch signaling pathway as a critical player in this reprograming model. This was unanticipated, since signaling through the Notch receptor GLP-1 ( henceforth GLP-1Notch ) from the somatic gonadal niche is known to maintain germline stem cell/progenitor fate ( Kimble and Crittenden, 2007 ). To understand this novel, reprograming-promoting role of GLP-1Notch, we combined genetics with tissue-specific expression profiling. We identified genes regulated by GLP-1Notch, including genes recently shown to maintain the germline stem/progenitor cells ( Kershner et al., 2014 ). Additionally, and unexpectedly, we found that many genes activated by GLP-1Notch signaling were also repressed by the cell fate-stabilizing chromatin regulator PRC2. We show that GLP-1Notch and PRC2 have an antagonistic effect on germ cell-fate decisions and demonstrate co-regulation of their common target, utx-1. Importantly, UTX-1 is a histone demethylase known to erase the gene-silencing methylation of histone H3 dependent on PRC2 ( Maures et al., 2011; Jin et al., 2011; Vandamme et al., 2012 ). Thus, we propose that the GLP-1Notch–dependent induction of UTX-1 facilitates reprograming by alleviating PRC2-mediated repression of alternative cell fates.

. Consistent with the joint function of MES-2 and MES-6 in the PRC2 complex, a very similar set of genes was upregulated upon the loss of either protein ( Figure 2C; Figure 2—source data 1; henceforth ‘PRC2 repressed’ genes; also see ( Gaydos et al., 2012 ). Indeed, those PRC2-repressed genes overlapped strongly with Notch-activated genes, particularly those linked to the X chromosome. Nearly all of the X-linked Notch-activated genes were also derepressed upon the loss of PRC2 ( Figure 2C ). This is consistent with the observed genetic interaction and suggests that increased GLP-1Notch signaling can induce expression of specific PRC2-repressed genes. This activation of the PRC2-repressed genes is not due to a global loss of the repressive tri-methylation of Histone H3 at lysine residue 27 ( H3K27me3 ), since, upon examining gonads of different GLP-1Notch mutants, we observed no global loss of H3K27me3 in the germline ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ). Germ cell conversion to neurons can be triggered not only by LIN-53 depletion but also by the depletion of PRC2 ( Patel et al., 2012 ). Potentially, the depletion of LIN-53 could facilitate reprograming by inhibiting PRC2, since the depletion of LIN-53 results in a global loss of H3K27me3 in the germline ( Patel et al., 2012 ). Considering the antagonistic relation between GLP-1Notch and PRC2 on cell proliferation and gene regulation, we wondered whether GeCo triggered by the depletion of PRC2 would be sensitive to Notch signaling. Indeed, GeCo was strongly enhanced in PRC2-depleted ( mes-2, mes-3 or mes-6 RNAi ) animals, when they also carried the gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) allele ( Figure 3A, Figure 3—source data 1 ). Moreover, similar to the LIN-53–depleted gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( q175 ) gonads ( Figure 1D ), the loss of GLP-1 effectively prevented GeCo in PRC2–depleted gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( q175 ) gonads ( Figure 3B, Figure 3—source data 1 )

. UTX-1 orthologs in other species contribute to tissue-specific chromatin signatures, for example during myogenesis or in cardiac development ( Seenundun et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2012 ), and have been implicated in germ-cell and somatic reprograming ( Mansour et al., 2012 ). Together with our data, these findings underscore the importance of UTX-1 in cellular reprograming. Here, we show that UTX-1 is a direct target of GL-1ch signaling in the germl ( Figure 4A, Figure 4— supplement 1 ) and propose that GL-1ch activation of UTX-1 promotes reprogram by alleviating P2-mediated silencing of alternative cell fates. This is supported by the observation that UTX-1 overexpression in P2-depleted gonads ( mes-2 mes-6 RNAi ) rescues Ge ( Figure 4B, Figure 4— source 1 ). Conversely, UTX-1 overexpression in wild-type gonads does not induce Ge ( Figure 4, Figure— supplement 1 ), indicating that UTX-1 is not sufficient to induce reprogram in the absence of GL-1ch signaling.

    Title: SKAP2 is required for defense against K. pneumoniae infection and neutrophil respiratory burst
    Abstract: Klebsiella pneumoniae is a respiratory, blood, liver, and bladder pathogen of significant clinical concern. We show that the adaptor protein, SKAP2, is required for protection against K. pneumoniae ( ATCC 43816 ) pulmonary infections. Skap2-/- mice had 100-fold higher bacterial burden when compared to wild-type and burden was controlled by SKAP2 expression in innate immune cells. Skap2-/- neutrophils and monocytes were present in infected lungs, and the neutrophils degranulated normally in response to K. pneumoniae infection in mice; however, K. pneumoniae-stimulated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production in vitro was abolished. K. pneumoniae-induced neutrophil ROS response required the activity of SFKs, Syk, Btk, PLCγ2, and PKC. The loss of SKAP2 significantly hindered the K. pneumoniae-induced phosphorylation of SFKs, Syk, and Pyk2 implicating SKAP2 as proximal to their activation in pathogen-signaling pathways. In conclusion, SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils is essential for K. pneumoniae-activated ROS production and for promoting bacterial clearance during infection.

    Our experiments reveal that SKAP2 plays a key role in host defense in the hematopoietic compartment against K. pneumoniae 43816 in pulmonary infections in a murine lung model of infection. SKAP2 was indispensable for K. pneumoniae-stimulated neutrophil ROS production, but not degranulation or phagocytosis, suggesting that the increased bacterial burden in the Skap2-/- mice is affected by the loss of ROS. Sensitivity of K. pneumoniae to ROS is strongly supported by the increased bacterial burden in Cybb-/- mice during lung infection, and observations in CGD patients ( Wolach et al., 2017; Paczosa et al., 2020 ). In murine neutrophils, SKAP2 was required for full phosphorylation of SFKs, Syk, and Pyk2, demonstrating a critical role in K. pneumoniae-induced signaling pathways that are required for ROS production. Consistent with previous findings ( Regueiro et al., 2006; March et al., 2013 ), K. pneumoniae 43816 was resistant to internalization indicating that phagocytosis is most likely not the primary protective mechanism provided by neutrophils to this strain. Prior studies, including one using K. pneumoniae 43816, have shown that degranulation of myeloperoxidase, ELA2, and cathepsin G are important for reducing bacterial burden of K. pneumoniae in mice ( Hirche et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2015 ). However, we found that despite equivalent levels of ELA2, degranulation in Skap2-/- mice was not sufficient to control K. pneumoniae burden in the absence of ROS, indicating that neutrophil ROS and degranulation may cooperate in containing K. pneumoniae infection. Since degranulation occurred normally in Skap2-/- lungs, the pathways of ROS production are distinct from signaling pathways regulating degranulation in murine neutrophils after K. pneumoniae infection. Neutrophils and ROS contribute to the defense against other pathogens such as Y

. pneumoniae 43816, the SKAP2-mediated defect in phagocytosis might be more prominent when challenged with other K. pneumoniae isolates. Combined, these results indicate that the K. pneumoniae 43816 strain is resistant to neutrophil phagocytosis regardless of SKAP2 expression, but can elicit SKAP2-independent degranulation during infection. ROS is an important mechanism for protection against K. pneumoniae as mice that lack the essential gp91phox component of NADPH oxidase, Cybb-/-, were significantly more susceptible to K. pneumoniae infection and had a significant increase in bacterial burden in their lungs ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A; Paczosa et al., 2020 ). To test whether SKAP2 deficiency resulted in a defect in neutrophil ROS production after K. pneumoniae infection, an isoluminol-amplified chemiluminiscence assay was used. In contrast to WT BM and DIV neutrophils, neither Skap2-/- BM nor DIV neutrophils produced ROS following exposure to K. pneumoniae ( Figure 5A–B; Figure 5—figure supplement 1B-C ). The loss of K. pneumoniae-stimulated ROS production was not due to a defect in bacterial-binding as WT and Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils bound GFP-labeled K. pneumoniae equivalently when assessed by flow cytometry following both 15- and 30 min incubations ( Figure 5C ). Without treating the cells with actin inhibitor, such as cytochalasin B, bound and phagocytosed bacteria could contribute to the levels of GFP+ cells. However, the less than 1% of internalization of K. pneumoniae observed in the gentamicin protection assay ( Figure 4C ) suggests that the majority of the bacteria are extracellular, and that GFP+ cells are more likely reflective of binding. Finally, SKAP2 was important for ROS production after infection with another gram-negative bacterial strain, a type 3 deficient Y. pseudotuberculosis strain, ΔyscF ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1D )

., 2000; Ophir et al., 2013 ). Upon receptor activation, SKAP2 changes to an active conformation that is localized to the plasma membrane, which allows it to interact other effector proteins including Src Family Kinases ( SFKs ) ( Bureau et al., 2018; Marie-Cardine et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1998 ). In addition, activated SKAP proteins can relay information from receptors to focal adhesion kinases ( FAK1/Pyk2 ) to other cytoskeletal mediators ( Ménasché et al., 2007; Boras et al., 2017; Tanaka et al., 2016; Raab et al., 2017; Ophir et al., 2013 ). Using a murine model of K. pneumoniae 43816 infection, we characterized the role of SKAP2 in pulmonary host defense against K. pneumoniae in this study. We demonstrate that SKAP2-expressing neutrophils contributed to the pulmonary containment of K. pneumoniae in lungs independent of inflammatory monocytes. Using murine neutrophils, we show that K. pneumoniae-induced ROS production requires SKAP2, SFKs, Syk, PLCγ, Btk, and PKC, and that SKAP2 is required for maximal K. pneumoniae-activated phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinases SFKs, Syk, and Pyk2.

. pseudotuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, among others ( Green et al., 2016; Mócsai, 2013; Nguyen et al., 2017 ). The immunological mechanisms of SKAP2-mediated neutrophil responses to other pathogens are under investigation. We propose the following model for SKAP2-dependent neutrophilic response to K. pneumoniae in mice based our findings and work of others ( Figure 6; Alenghat et al., 2012; Swanson et al., 2008; Togni et al., 2005; Timms et al., 1999 ). Following K. pneumoniae infection, activation of receptors, like GPCRs recognizing N-formylated bacterial proteins or mincle recognizing bacterial lectins, leads to the activation of phosphoinositide 3 kinase ( PI3K ) and the generation of phosphatidylinositol [3, 4, 5]-triphosphate ( PIP3 ), resulting in PIP3-mediated SKAP2 activation and membrane localization ( Figure 6A–B; Futosi et al., 2013; Swanson et al., 2008; Sharma et al., 2014; Alenghat et al., 2012 ). The activated ( open ) phosphorylated SKAP2 complex can then bind to and enhance phosphorylation of SFKs shifting their active/inactive equilibrium to more active forms and leading to Syk activation ( Figure 6B; Marie-Cardine et al., 1998; Bureau et al., 2018; Kouroku et al., 1998; Lowell, 2011 ). This is supported by previous biochemical and pull-down studies showing that SKAP2 can directly interact with SFKs ( Bureau et al., 2018; Liu et al., 1998; Wang and Rudd, 2008 ). SFKs and Syk may directly associate with and activate Pyk2, as observed in response to GPCRs, integrin, TNFα, and/or Salmonella stimulation ( Dikic et al., 1996; Evangelista et al., 2003; et al. 2003 ). Py2 phosphorylates and activates PLCγ2, which in turn activates PKC leading to the production of ROS through NADPH oxidase ( Figure 6C; Alhat et al.,2012; Swanson et al,2008; Togn et al,2005; Timms et al,1999 ). SK2 is required for the phosphorylation of SFs, Sy, and Py2 implicating SK2 as a proximal to their activation in pathogen-signaling pathways. In conclusion, SK2-dependent signaling in neutroph is essential for K pneumonia-activated ROS and promoting bacterial clearance during infection.

    Title: Modelling the contribution of the hypnozoite reservoir to Plasmodium vivax transmission
    Abstract: Plasmodium vivax relapse infections occur following activation of latent liver-stages parasites ( hypnozoites ) causing new blood-stage infections weeks to months after the initial infection. We develop a within-host mathematical model of liver-stage hypnozoites, and validate it against data from tropical strains of P. vivax. The within-host model is embedded in a P. vivax transmission model to demonstrate the build-up of the hypnozoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypnozoite activation and death. The hypnozoite reservoir is predicted to be over-dispersed with many individuals having few or no hypnozoites, and some having intensely infected livers. Individuals with more hypnozoites are predicted to experience more relapses and contribute more to onwards P. vivax transmission. Incorporating hypnozoite killing drugs such as primaquine into first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in P. vivax transmission as individuals with the most hypnozoites are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment.

    Relapse infections arising from the activation of hypnozoites in the human liver have important consequences for the transmission dynamics of P. vivax. Hypnozoites in the liver constitute a third malaria parasite reservoir, in addition to the reservoirs in the blood circulation and mosquito also present for P. falciparum. Relapses can be incorporated into Ross-Macdonald models of malaria transmission through the addition of a state to represent the hypnozoite reservoir ( Roy et al., 2013 ), or as demonstrated here, through consideration of the number of hypnozoites in the liver. This allows the intensity of hypnozoite infection to be estimated which is crucial for understanding patterns of relapse infections ( White, 2011 ) and evaluating the effect of interventions such as primaquine treatment that directly target the hypnozoite reservoir. Hypnozoites are assumed to be subjected to two processes: activation at constant rate α, and death at constant rate µ. By considering infection with batches of hypnozoites, these simple processes can explain many of the complex patterns observed in P. vivax relapses ( see Box 1 ). A key assumption in the proposed model is the constant activation of hypnozoites. This implies that relapses can occur immediately after primary P. vivax infection, in contrast to suggestions that the first relapse does not occur until 2–3 weeks later. The best evidence on early relapses comes from treatment efficacy studies where patients treated for P. vivax are followed for recurrent infection for 42 days ( Douglas et al., 2010 ). Except in cases with documented chloroquine resistance ( Price et al., 2014 ), recurrent infections are rarely observed prior to day 14, however the inclusion of long-lasting anti-malarials in treatment regimens provides prophylaxis during this period making detection of parasites unlikely. In a recent study of the slowly eliminated drug dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DP ) Tarning et al

., 2014 ). Most existing models of malaria transmission do not account for the additional reservoir of parasites in the liver, but the hypnozoite reservoir has been incorporated into some P. vivax transmission models as a state to denote hypnozoite infection ( Ishikawa et al., 2003; Chamchod and Beier, 2013; Roy et al., 2013 ) or as up to two broods of hypnozoites ( Dezoysa et al., 1991 ). Relapse patterns and their implications for transmission have also been investigated using statistical distributions for the time to first relapse ( Lover et al., 2014 ). Here we advance on existing work by considering how the number of hypnozoites in the liver contributes to patterns of relapse infections and the epidemiology and control of P. vivax. When a P. vivax infected mosquito takes a blood meal from a human, sporozoites are injected into the skin and migrate to the liver, where they invade hepatocytes and develop into either actively dividing schizonts or dormant hypnozoites. The development of actively dividing schizonts may lead to a primary blood-stage infection and potentially clinical malaria ( Mueller et al., 2013 ). Hypnozoites will lie dormant in the liver for weeks to years before activating to initiate new blood-stage infections. The biological mechanisms regulating the activation of hypnozoites remain unknown ( Mueller et al., 2009a ), although a number of triggers for relapses have been proposed, including fever caused by other pathogens such as P. falciparum ( Shanks and White, 2013 ) and exposure to Anopheles-specific proteins ( Hulden and Hulden, 2011 ). There is considerable geographical variation in the timing and frequency of P. vivax relapse infections, with strains from tropical areas having an average time to first relapse of 3–6 weeks and long-latency strains from temperate areas relapsing within 6–9 months ( Lover and Coker, 2013; Battle et al., 2014 )

Following infection with a tropical strain of P. vivax, the population dynamics of hypnozoites in the liver can be described by a within-host model where each hypnozoite is subject to two processes: ( i ) activation leading to relapse infection; and ( ii ) death, either of the hypnozoite itself or the host hepatocyte ( Malato et al., 2011 ). Constant activation ( α ) and death ( µ ) rates are assumed implying hypnozoite residence time in the liver is exponentially distributed. The long latency of temperate strains before first relapse can be accounted for by assuming a period of dormancy during which hypnozoites must wait before they can activate. A schematic representation of the within-host model is presented in Figure 7. 10. 7554/eLife. 04692. 014Figure 7. Within-host model schematic of relapsing hypnozoites in the liver. Hypnozoites from tropical strains of P. vivax will progress to the relapsing phase where they are subject to two processes: death and activation leading to relapse. Hypnozoites from temperate strains will begin in a temperate long-latency phase where they must wait before progressing to the relapsing phase.

., 2004 ) and Brazil ( Coura et al., 2006 ) where increased vector control has caused greater reductions in P. falciparum than P. vivax. First-line treatment of new blood-stage infections with anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine or ACTs is predicted to cause moderate reductions in blood-stage prevalence of both P. falciparum and P. vivax ( Figure 5B ). The addition of primaquine to first-line treatment regimens is expected to cause large reductions in P. vivax blood-stage prevalence, as individuals with the most intense hypnozoite infections are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment and hence have their hypnozoites eliminated. The potential to simultaneously target parasite reservoirs in the blood and liver may turn the cause of P. vivax parasites' robust transmission into its Achilles' heel. In P. vivax and P. falciparum co-endemic regions, heterogeneity in exposure to mosquito bites may cause associations between P. falciparum fevers and the risk of future P. vivax relapses ( Douglas et al., 2011 ). Thus the inclusion of primaquine in first-line treatment for P. falciparum may also reduce P. vivax transmission. In addition to inclusion in first-line treatment regimens, primaquine can also be administered as part of mass drug administration ( MDA ) programmes. In treatment-reinfection studies of Papua New Guinean children ( Betuela et al., 2012; Robinson et al., unpublished ), mass administration of drugs such as chloroquine or artemether-lumefantrine successfully cleared P. vivax blood-stage infections but rapid recurrence of infection was observed during follow-up—most likely due to relapses. The addition of primaquine to the treatment regimen caused large reductions in the rate of recurrent infections

. vivax. In the model implemented here, it is assumed that all hypnozoites in an infection must undergo some waiting period before any of them can activate, and that during the long-latency phase hypnozoites are at risk of death. In temperate strains of P vivax, the long-latency is assumed to be longer than for tropical strains. The within-host model is embedded in a P. viv transmission model to demonstrate the build-up of the hypzo reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypzo activation and death. The hypzo reservoir is predicted to be over-dispersed with individuals having few or no hypnoites and some intensely infected individuals with many hypnoites. Individuals with more hypnoites are predicted to experience relapse and contribute to P viv transmission. Incorporating hypnoite drugs such as prima into first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in P viv transmission as individuals with most hypnoites are likely to relapse and targeted for treatment.

    Title: Carbon recovery dynamics following disturbance by selective logging in Amazonian forests
    Abstract: When 2 Mha of Amazonian forests are disturbed by selective logging each year, more than 90 Tg of carbon ( C ) is emitted to the atmosphere. Emissions are then counterbalanced by forest regrowth. With an original modelling approach, calibrated on a network of 133 permanent forest plots ( 175 ha total ) across Amazonia, we link regional differences in climate, soil and initial biomass with survivors’ and recruits’ C fluxes to provide Amazon-wide predictions of post-logging C recovery. We show that net aboveground C recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield and in the west ( 21 ±3 Mg C ha-1 ) than in the south ( 12 ±3 Mg C ha-1 ) where environmental stress is high ( low rainfall, high seasonality ). We highlight the key role of survivors in the forest regrowth and elaborate a comprehensive map of post-disturbance C recovery potential in Amazonia.

    Supporting Text:
   . Nonetheless, to our knowledge no spatially-explicit investigation of post-logging C dynamics at the Amazon biome scale is available. C losses from selective logging are determined by harvest intensity ( i. e. number of trees felled or volume of wood extracted ) plus the care with which harvest operations are conducted, which affects the amount of collateral damage. After logging, C losses continue for several years due to elevated mortality rates of trees injured during harvesting operations ( Shenkin et al., 2015 ). Logged forests may recover their aboveground carbon stocks ( ACS ) via enhanced growth of survivors and recruited trees ( Blanc et al., 2009 ). Full recovery of pre-disturbance ACS in logged stands reportedly requires up to 125 years, depending primarily on disturbance intensity ( Rutishauser et al., 2015 ). The underlying recovery processes ( i. e. tree mortality, growth and recruitment ) are likely to vary with the clear geographical patterns in forest structure and dynamics across the Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield. In particular, northeast-southwest gradients have been reported for ACS ( Malhi and Wright, 2004 ), net primary productivity ( Aragão et al., 2009 ), wood density ( Baker et al., 2004 ), and floristic composition ( ter Steege et al., 2006 ). Such gradients coincide with climate and edaphic conditions that range from nearly a seasonal nutrient-limited in the northeast to seasonally dry and nutrient-rich in the southwest ( Quesada et al., 2012 ). These regional differences in biotic and abiotic conditions largely constrain demographic processes that ultimately shape forest C balances

. Here we partition the contributions to post-disturbance ACS gain ( from growth and recruitment of trees ≥20 cm DBH ) and ACS loss ( from mortality ) of survivors and recruited trees to detect the main drivers and patterns of ACS recovery in forests disturbed by selective logging across Amazonia sensu lato ( that includes the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield ). Based on long-term ( 8–30 year ) inventory data from 13 experimentally-disturbed sites ( Sist et al., 2015 ) across Amazonia ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ), 133 permanent forest plots ( 175 ha in total ) that cover a large gradient of disturbance intensities ( ACS losses ranging from 1% to 71% ) were used to model the trajectory of those post-disturbance ACS changes ( Figure 1 ) in a comprehensive Bayesian framework. We quantify the effect of pre-disturbance ecosystem characteristics [the site’s average pre-logging ACS ( a⁢c⁢s⁢0 ) and the relative difference between each plot and a⁢c⁢s⁢0 as a proxy of forest maturity ( d⁢a⁢c⁢s ) ], disturbance intensity [percentage of pre-logging ACS lost ( l⁢o⁢s⁢s ) ], and interactions with the environment [annual precipitation ( p⁢r⁢e⁢c ), seasonality of precipitation ( s⁢e⁢a⁢s ), and soil bulk density ( b⁢d ) ] ( Figure 2 ) on the rates at which post-disturbance ACS changes converge to a theoretical steady state ( as in Figure 1, see Materials and methods for more details ). With global maps of ACS ( Avitabile et al., 2016 ), climatic conditions ( Hijmans et al., 2005 ) and soil bulk density ( Nachtergaele et al., 2008 ), we up-scale our results to Amazonia ( sensu lato ) and elaborate predictive maps of potential ACS changes over 10 years under the hypothesis of a 40% ACS loss, which is a common disturbance intensity after conventional logging in Amazonia ( Blanc et al., 2009; Martin et al., 2015; West et al., 2014 ). Summing these ACS changes over time gives the net post-disturbance rate of ACS accumulation

. Finally, Central Amazonia is a transition zone for the main environmental and biotic gradients found in Amazonia: ( 1 ) a competition gradient between dense and nutrient-poor northeastern forests and nutrient-rich western forests; ( 2 ) an environmental gradient between northern wet forests and southern drier forests ( Quesada et al., 2012 ). Across Amazonia, survivors contribute most to post-disturbance ACS recovery. In regions where survivors’ ACS gain is high ( west and northeast ), net ACS recovery is also high: annual ACS recovery is between 1 and 3 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in the first 10 year after logging ( Figure 6 ), lower than in Amazonian secondary forests ( 3–5 Mg C ha-1 yr−1 in the first 20 year after abandonment of land use [Poorter et al., 2016] ). Recruits, for their part, have very low geographical variations in post-logging ACS changes: 10 years after the disturbance they are predicted to store similar amounts of ACS almost everywhere in Amazonia. Nevertheless, small trees with DBH <20 cm have not been accounted for in our study and may play an important role in post-logging ACS changes. The 10–20 cm DBH size class contains as much as 14% of total ACS and may be highly dynamic in some Amazonian forests ( Vieira et al., 2004 ). Because of the slow tree growth rates in Amazonia ( Vieira et al., 2005; Herault et al., 2010 ), many trees will not reach the 20 cm DBH threshold 10 years after logging: the effects of the 10–20 cm DBH stratum on post-logging ACS changes are likely to be missed in sites with less than 10 years of measurements ( e. g. Peteco, Ecosilva, Iracema, Cumaru ) and should be studied, together with the natural regeneration, in the future. At the stand level, high disturbance intensities reduce survivors’ ACS: survivors’ ACS growth is consequently lower ( Figure 3a ), resulting in lower net ACS change during the first 10 years of the recovery period ( Figure 3f )

., 2008 ), betting on recruits to store C in forests disturbed by selective logging might thus be a risky gamble. In this study, we focus on one type of disturbance: selective logging. Because of its economic value and implications for forest management, selective logging is a long-studied human disturbance in tropical forests, and the data gathered by the TmFO network are unique in terms of experiment duration and spatial extent. We nevertheless believe that our study gives clues on the regional differences in Amazonian forests response to large ACS losses induced by other disturbances ( e. g. droughts, fire ) that are expected to increase in frequency with ongoing global changes ( Bonal et al., 2016 ).

With on-going climate change, attention is increasingly drawn to the impacts of human activities on carbon ( C ) cycles ( Griggs and Noguer, 2002 ), and in particular to the 2. 1 ± 1. 1 Pg C yr-1 of C loss caused by various forms and intensities of anthropogenic disturbances in tropical forests ( Grace et al., 2014 ). Among those disturbances, selective logging, i. e. the selective harvest of a few merchantable tree species, is particularly widespread: in the Brazilian Amazon alone, about 2 Mha yr−1 were logged in 1999–2002 ( Asner et al., 2005 ). The extent of selective logging in the Brasilian Amazon was equivalent to annual deforestation in the same period, and resulted in C emissions of 90 Tg C yr-1 ( Huang and Asner, 2010 ) which increased anthropogenic C emissions by almost 25% over deforestation alone ( Asner et al., 2005 ). In contrast to deforested areas that are used for agriculture and grazing, most selectively logged forests remain as forested areas ( Asner et al., 2006 ) and may recover C stocks ( West et al., 2014 ). Previously logged Amazonian forests may thus accumulate large amounts of C ( Pan et al., 2011 ), but this C uptake is difficult to accurately estimate, mainly due to lack of data on post-logging C dynamics at the biome scale. Our study addresses this knowledge gap by providing a spatially-explicit model of post-logging C dynamics in Amazonia, based on long-term data from 133 forest plots 175 ha across a gradient of disturbance intensities. Our results highlight the role of survivors and recruits in post-disturb C recovery and provide a map of potential C changes 10 years after selective logging in Amazonia.

    Title: Prospective identification of functionally distinct stem cells and neurosphere-initiating cells in adult mouse forebrain
    Abstract: Neurosphere formation is commonly used as a surrogate for neural stem cell ( NSC ) function but the relationship between neurosphere-initiating cells ( NICs ) and NSCs remains unclear. We prospectively identified, and isolated by flow cytometry, adult mouse lateral ventricle subventricular zone ( SVZ ) NICs as GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− ( GEPCOT ) cells. They were highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo based on fate-mapping with Ascl1CreERT2 and Dlx1CreERT2. In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells were quiescent, expressed higher Glast, and lower EGFR and PlexinB2. Pre-GEPCOT cells could not form neurospheres but expressed the stem cell markers Slc1a3-CreERT, GFAP-CreERT2, Sox2CreERT2, and Gli1CreERT2 and were long-lived in vivo. While GEPCOT NICs were ablated by temozolomide, pre-GEPCOT cells survived and repopulated the SVZ. Conditional deletion of the Bmi-1 polycomb protein depleted pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells, though pre-GEPCOT cells were more dependent upon Bmi-1 for Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) repression. Our data distinguish quiescent NSCs from NICs and make it possible to study their properties in vivo.

    By screening almost 400 antibodies against distinct cell surface antigens we identified two phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of neural stem/progenitor cells from the adult mouse SVZ ( Figure 8 ). GEPCOT cells were highly enriched for NICs ( Figure 1C ) and highly mitotically active in vivo ( Figure 1D ) but persisted only transiently in the SVZ based on fate mapping with Ascl1CreERT2 or Dlx1CreERT2 ( Figure 2B, C ). In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells lacked the ability to form neurospheres or adherent colonies in culture ( Figure 4B ), and were quiescent in vivo ( Figure 4C ) but were long-lived in the SVZ based on fate mapping with the stem cell markers Slc1a3-CreERT ( Wang et al., 2012 ), GFAP-CreERT2 ( Giachino et al., 2013 ), Sox2CreERT2 ( Arnold et al., 2011 ), and Gli1CreERT2 ( Ahn and Joyner, 2005; Lee et al., 2012 ) ( Figure 4F–J ). In contrast to GEPCOT NICs, pre-GEPCOT cells were resistant to TMZ ( Figure 5E, F ). Although TMZ eliminated virtually all NICs from the SVZ ( Figure 5D ), the dividing cells, NICs, and GEPCOTs regenerated within a month of TMZ treatment ( Figure 5 ). The persistence of pre-GEPCOT cells after TMZ ( Figure 5F ), and the regeneration of GEPCOTs from a precursor that expresses Slc1a3-CreERT and GFAP-CreERT2 but not Ascl1CreERT2 ( Figure 5N–P ) suggest that the SVZ regenerates from pre-GEPCOT qNSCs. 10. 7554/eLife. 02669. 014Figure 8.

The pre-GEPCOTs accounted for 6 ± 3% of adult mouse SVZ cells, were highly quiescent, lacked the ability to form neurospheres or adherent colonies in culture, and included type B1 cells based on marker expression, morphology, and position in vivo. These cells contained long-lived qNSCs based on both fate mapping and temozolomide resistance. GEPCOTs were distinguished by lower GFAP and Glast expression and higher EGFR and PlexinB2 expression. These cells accounted for 3. 2 ± 0. 7% of cells in the adult mouse SVZ, were highly mitotically active, highly enriched for NICs, and included type C cells based on marker expression, morphology, and position in vivo. Based on fate-mapping these cells were short-lived in the SVZ. Our data thus provide methods to prospectively identify and distinguish qNSCs from NICs.

In contrast to GEOT NICs, preGEOT were resistant TMZ ( Figure 5, F ) although TMZ eliminated virtually all NIC from the SV ( Figure 5 ) dividing NIC and GEOT regenerated within a month of TMZ treatment ( Figure 5 ). The persistence of preGEOT after TMZ ( Figure 5 ) and regeneration of GEOT from a precursor expressing Sl1-CERT and GFERT but not As2ERT ( Figure–P ) suggest the SV regenerates from preGE qSCs.

    Title: Piezo1 ion channels inherently function as independent mechanotransducers
    Abstract: Piezo1 is a mechanically activated ion channel involved in sensing forces in various cell types and tissues. Cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that the Piezo1 structure is bowl-shaped and capable of inducing membrane curvature via its extended footprint, which indirectly suggests that Piezo1 ion channels may bias each other’s spatial distribution and interact functionally. Here, we use cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp stimulation to functionally examine large numbers of membrane patches from cells expressing Piezo1 endogenously at low levels and cells overexpressing Piezo1 at high levels. Our data, together with stochastic simulations of Piezo1 spatial distributions, show that both at endogenous densities ( 1–2 channels/μm2 ), and at non-physiological densities ( 10–100 channels/μm2 ) predicted to cause substantial footprint overlap, Piezo1 density has no effect on its pressure sensitivity or open probability in the nominal absence of membrane tension. The results suggest that Piezo channels, at densities likely to be physiologically relevant, inherently behave as independent mechanotransducers. We propose that this property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire cell membrane.

    Supporting Text:
   . Indeed, imaging of vesicles containing reconstituted Piezo1 has demonstrated the ability of Piezo1 to curve the membrane locally and suggested that flattening of the channel dome may directly couple to channel opening, but the precise effects of membrane energetics on gating have yet to be explored experimentally ( Jiang et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2019 ). Here, we set out to quantify the spatial distribution and potential functional interactions of Piezo1 ion channels across multiple orders of channel densities. Specifically, we use electrophysiology and large numbers of independent measurements to simultaneously quantify channel number and function, including single-channel current, open probability, and pressure sensitivity. Collectively, our electrophysiological data, together with stochastic simulations show that Piezo1 ion channels, at densities likely to be physiologically relevant, inherently function as independent mechanotransducers. We propose that this property enables cells to transduce forces with high spatial homogeneity across the entire cell membrane.

Cells are constantly exposed to mechanical forces and have evolved diverse molecular mechanisms that enable force detection. The rapid sensing of mechanical forces that occurs in milliseconds is achieved by force-gated ion channels that convert mechanical energy into electrochemical signals ( Kefauver et al., 2020 ). For example, Piezo1 is a mechanically gated cation channel that directly senses membrane tension ( T ) with high sensitivity ( Coste et al., 2010; Cox et al., 2016; Lewis and Grandl, 2015; Syeda et al., 2016 ). Therefore, theoretically, any mechanical disturbance of the cell membrane may lead to changes in Piezo1 channel open probability ( Po ). However, the propagation of membrane tension away from its source has been shown to be relatively slow ( D ~ 0. 024 µm2/s ), poising Piezo channels with the ability to efficiently and rapidly transduce only mechanical forces that are nearby ( Shi et al., 2018 ). The degree to which forces are transduced homogeneously across the cell membrane likely depends not only on the dynamics of membrane tension propagation, but also on ( i ) the spatial distribution of force-gated ion channels, and ( ii ) on their functional independence. Any substantial deviation from a uniform distribution of force-gated ion channels will result in domains that fail to detect forces ( where there are no ion channels ) as well as domains that transduce forces disproportionately ( where many ion channels are nearby ). Functional interactions and/or cooperativity between force-gated ion channels may further skew transduction efficiency or kinetics in a manner that depends on local channel density, effectively creating a patchwork of blind spots and sensitized areas. Indeed, there is recent experimental evidence suggesting that Piezo1 channels may be non-uniformly distributed

. 5% ) reduced with channel number but overall, very low ( <1% ) at all channel densities we probed. This is notable, because the opposite result was recently obtained by simulations of Piezo1 that are in extreme proximity to each other ( 1–3 nm dome-dome distance; Jiang et al., 2021 ). The reasons for this discrepancy may be technical limitations in the modeling, which was performed with a partial Piezo1 structure, or our own experiments, which cannot generate the extreme channel densities probed in the simulation. Moreover, any cooperativity need not arise via membrane footprint interactions: for example, calcium permeating through Piezo1 may influence the resting open probability of nearby channels. Indeed, calcium-induced cooperativity is a well-known phenomenon in other ion channels, such as TRPA1 ( Wang et al., 2008 ). Our experiments cannot directly rule out this explanation. Altogether, our conclusions may be applicable to other cell types that express Piezos at levels similar or lower to that of Neuro2A cells. However, we fully expect that specific cell types may concentrate Piezo channels into locations that are dedicated to detecting forces. For example, it is plausible that in sensory neurons Piezo2 channels may be highly concentrated in free nerve endings as compared to the cell soma. However, our work directly predicts that if such a clustering was indeed observed, it would require a dedicated mechanism that is not Piezo-intrinsic, such as a still elusive tethering molecule.

To simultaneously measure and thus directly correlate Piezo1 channel density with its gating properties, we performed cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology on Neuro2A cells, which natively express Piezo1 ( Coste et al., 2010 ). We chose Neuro2A cells over human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) and other cell lines because they have among the highest endogenous levels of Piezo1 expression, thus offering the highest likelihood for observing any potential functional effects of local channel density on function. We then designed a novel stimulation protocol that we optimized to assess Piezo1 single-channel conductance ( i ), pressure sensitivity ( P50 ), and number of channels ( n ) in each patch with high accuracy. Since Piezo1 inactivation precludes a precise measurement of maximal current ( Imax ) at negative potentials, we recorded currents at +60 mV, where inactivation during short pressure steps is minimal ( Coste et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2017 ). However, traditional step protocols are well known to induce irreversible changes in patch geometry owing to membrane creep, particularly at positive voltages ( Lewis and Grandl, 2015; Suchyna et al., 2009 ). Indeed, a direct step to a saturating pressure ( –60 mmHg ) caused small, but measurable changes in current due to leak and/or capacitance even in patches that were later classified to have zero channels ( see below; mean ± SD: 2. 6 ± 1. 3 pA; n=33 patches; Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-B ). Consistent with this idea, the same pressure step caused a similarly small current in patches from Neuro2A-Piezo1ko cells, which have been CRISPR-engineered to lack Piezo1 channels ( mean ± SD: 3. 8 ± 1. 5 pA, n=15 patches; Figure 1—figure supplement 2C ). Consequently, a step protocol consistently overestimates current by 2–3 pA, and thus channel numbers accordingly ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2B )

We sought to characterize the inherent ability of Piezo channels to spatially localize and modulate each other’s function. We chose cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology as a method for investigation, which has several inherent limitations that need to be considered. First, our spatial resolution is naturally limited by the size of the patch pipette. Consequently, our statistical approach of counting channels within membrane patches works best when the spatial distance between Piezo1 channels is comparable to the size of the membrane dome inside the patch pipette. The fact that ~15% of patches in wild-type Neuro2A cells contained no Piezo1 channels ( Figure 1E ) is therefore an extremely important quality benchmark for adequate spatial resolution. Our modeling does not allow us to rule out the possibility of moderate clustering ( 2–3 Piezo1 channels ), but we find no evidence for clusters of larger sizes ( ~5 channels ), which we would have been able to detect ( Figure 3 ). Next, our measurement of endogenous Piezo1 density in Neuro2A cells ( 1. 75 channels/µm2 ) has several sources of error: first, while we have modest control over the pipette shape during its fabrication and a precise measure of its resistance, without simultaneous DIC imaging, the exact surface of each individual membrane dome is not known. In order to minimize this size variability, we therefore limited the majority of our analyses to measurements from a narrow range of pipette resistances and incorporated this size variability of patch pipettes into our statistical model of Piezo1 spatial distribution ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2D ). Additionally, we performed a smaller subset of experiments combining simultaneous DIC imaging with electrophysiology ( Figure 5 ). Certainly, when overexpressing Pie1 in NeuroA cells at high levels (10–100 channels/µm2 ), we were able to detect larger clusters of Piezo channels ( Figure 5 ). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that this is an artefact of overexpression, which may not be physiologically relevant. 

Our electrophys data show that Pie1 channels at endogenous densities (1–2 channels/µ2 ) and non-physiological densities (10–100/ channels/2 ) have no effect on pressure sensitivity or open probability in the absence of membrane tension ( Figure 2 ). This is consistent with the idea that Pie1 channels are independent mechanotransducers. We propose that this property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire membrane ( Figure 6 ). Our results are supported by stochastic simulations of Pie1 spatial distribution ( Figure 3 ) and electrophys data from cells overexpressing Pie1 at high levels ( Figure 5 ). We cannot rule out the possibility of cooperativity between Pie1 channels via calcium permeating through the channel ( Wang et al, 2008 ), which may influence resting probability of nearby channels. However, our data suggest that Pie channels at physiologically relevant densities inherently function as independent mechanotrans. We propose that this property enables cells to transduce forces with high homogeneity across the entire membrane.
Researchers investigated the influence of volatility on decision-making in perception by introducing a novel manipulation that mimics the addition of noise to motion-selective regions of the visual cortex. They recorded neuronal activity from macaque areas MT/MST and found that increasing noise led to faster decisions and greater confidence over a range of stimuli with minimal accuracy impairment. The effect was consistent with predictions of a bounded accumulation model, which explains the effect of signal-to-noise ratio on decision speed, accuracy, and confidence. The model quantitatively accounted for observed choices, reaction times, and confidence in a coherent way, even predicting confidence ratings based on reaction time data from a separate experiment.

 The manipulation involved changing the statistical properties of a dynamic stimulus, differing from previous studies that varied reliability through stimulus manipulations. The approach applied the manipulation to a well-studied motion task, verified the effect by recording from neurons in the visual cortex, and showed a framework based on accumulation could explain the effect on choice, reaction, and confidence. The framework predicted the pattern of choices, reaction times, and confidence in a quantitatively way, even confidence ratings based on reaction time from a separate experiment.

 The study tested the influence of noise on three observables of behavior - accuracy, reaction time, and confidence - in humans and monkeys. A dissociation between accuracy and confidence led to conclude that transcranial stimulation increased the noise associated with the representation of a pattern, and a dissociation led to conclude that cortical stimulation might affect the mean and variance of the representation of motion in extrastriate visual areas. However, characterization of these effects was inferred from behavior. Psych studies attempted to increase noise through changes in visual or attentional state did not characterize the influence on neural that accumulates to a decision.

 The study sought to manipulate variance associated with representation without affecting mean, achieved with a motion in random motion display, adding a level which increased volatility was unbiased. Verified the manipulation by recording from selective neurons in middle, medial temporal areas of macaque cortex. Neurons in these areas represent momentary in tasks identical to the study. Traces differed when waves on sure trials when responses stronger. Results indicate early evidence informs both choice and confidence, inconsistent with proposal that choice and confidence are resolved in succession.

    Title: CAMKII and Calcineurin regulate the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans through the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16
    Abstract: The insulin-like signaling pathway maintains a relatively short wild-type lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans by phosphorylating and inactivating DAF-16, the ortholog of the FOXO transcription factors of mammalian cells. DAF-16 is phosphorylated by the AKT kinases, preventing its nuclear translocation. Calcineurin ( PP2B phosphatase ) also limits the lifespan of C. elegans, but the mechanism through which it does so is unknown. Herein, we show that TAX-6•CNB-1 and UNC-43, the C. elegans Calcineurin and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II ( CAMKII ) orthologs, respectively, also regulate lifespan through DAF-16. Moreover, UNC-43 regulates DAF-16 in response to various stress conditions, including starvation, heat or oxidative stress, and cooperatively contributes to lifespan regulation by insulin signaling. However, unlike insulin signaling, UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16, thus promoting its nuclear localization. The phosphorylation of DAF-16 at S286 by UNC-43 is removed by TAX-6•CNB-1, leading to DAF-16 inactivation. Mammalian FOXO3 is also regulated by CAMKIIA and Calcineurin.

   ., 2007 ). In mammalian systems, Calcineurin ( PP2B ) is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase that has diverse functions and affects both T cell activation and heart development ( Crabtree, 1999 ). In C. elegans, Calcineurin regulates body size, thermotaxis, muscle contraction, and lifespan ( Bandyopadhyay et al., 2002; Kuhara et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2004; Dong et al., 2007 ). The longevity phenotype of tax-6 ( lf ) is partially dependent on daf-16 ( Dong et al., 2007 ). More recent studies have shown that C. elegans Calcineurin can regulate lifespan by suppressing autophagy ( Dwivedi et al., 2009 ) or inactivating CRTC-1, a co-activator of CREB ( Mair et al., 2011 ). However, direct targets of worm Calcineurin have not been identified. In the current work, we addressed how worm Calcineurin TAX-6•CNB-1 regulates lifespan. We discovered that DAF-16 was phosphorylated and activated by UNC-43 at the serine 286 ( S286 ) site. The phosphoryl group was removed by TAX-6•CNB-1. UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 therefore regulate C. elegans lifespan through the reversible phosphorylation of DAF-16. This regulatory mechanism has a different mode of action from the canonical IIS pathway because the phosphorylation activates, rather than represses, DAF-16. Activation of DAF-16 by UNC-43 occurs in response to different types of stress signals, such as heat, starvation, and oxidation. UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 can regulate DAF-16 independently of IIS, and the two signaling mechanisms appear to crosstalk, leading to coordinated action on DAF-16. We also show that the regulation of FOXO by CAMKII and Calcineurin is conserved in mammalian cells.

Multiple signaling pathways, including insulin/IGF-1 signaling ( IIS ), germline signaling, mitochondrial signaling, and the signaling pathways induced by dietary restriction, regulate aging in C. elegans ( Kenyon, 2005; Greer and Brunet, 2008 ). The best characterized is the IIS pathway, which includes the upstream insulin/IGF-1 receptor DAF-2 and the downstream FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. Signals from DAF-2 are transmitted through AGE-1 ( phosphoinositide 3-kinase ) and PDK-1 ( phosphoinositol-dependent kinase-1 ) to AKT-1, AKT-2, and SGK-1, which phosphorylate DAF-16 and prevent it from translocating to the nucleus to activate a pro-longevity gene network. Reduction-of-function mutations of the kinase genes in the IIS pathway, from daf-2 to akt-1, akt-2, and sgk-1, all extend lifespan in a daf-16-dependent manner ( Kenyon et al., 1993; Morris et al., 1996; Kimura et al., 1997; Hertweck et al., 2004 ). Lifespan extension by reduced IIS is also observed in other species, including flies and mice, indicating that the pathway is conserved evolutionarily ( Kenyon, 2005; Greer and Brunet, 2008 ). Compared with the kinases in the C. elegans IIS pathway, little is known about the protein phosphatases that neutralize the effects of the kinases. The only known example is PPTR-1, a B56 regulatory subunit of PP2A, which directs PP2A to dephosphorylate AKT-1 at T350, thereby inactivating the kinase ( Padmanabhan et al., 2009 ). DAF-18, the C. elegans PTEN, is a phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphate ( PIP3 ) 3-phosphatase ( Ogg and Ruvkun, 1998 ). The phosphatase for DAF-2 has not been identified, nor the one that regulates DAF-16. Previously, loss-of-function ( lf ) mutants for tax-6 and cnb-1, which encode the catalytic and regulatory subunits of C. elegans Calcineurin, respectively, were found to live longer than wild-type ( WT ) worms ( Dong et al., 2007 )

Our data suggest that CAMKII ( UNC-43 ) and Calcineurin ( TAX-6•CNB-1 ), by phosphorylating or de-phosphorylating serine 286 of DAF-16, extend or shorten the lifespan of C. elegans. The direct, antagonistic nature of these two enzymes also raised an interesting possibility that, with their opposing effects on DAF-16 and a common activating signal ( Ca2+/CAM ), UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 would constitutively negate each other and have essentially no control of DAF-16. However, this outcome most likely does not occur because of the difference in the spatial distribution and temporal activation profiles of the two enzymes. TAX-6 and CNB-1, similar to DAF-16, are expressed in most cells in C. elegans ( Ogg et al., 1997; Bandyopadhyay et al., 2002; Kuhara et al., 2002; Dong et al., 2007 ). In contrast, unc-43 promoter-driven GFP was only detected in neurons and the intestine ( Hunt-Newbury et al., 2007 ). We also detected UNC-43 primarily in the nervous system ( not shown ). At the subcellular level, the TAX-6::GFP fusion protein is distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and inside the nucleus ( Kuhara et al., 2002; Dong et al., 2007 ). In contrast, the CFP::UNC-43 fusion protein is concentrated on perinuclear structures and clusters in neurites ( Umemura et al., 2005 ). Temporally, Ca2+-activated CAMKII phosphorylates another molecule of CAMKII at T286 to convert it to a Ca2+/CAM-independent kinase, prolonging the kinase activity after the initial activation ( Erickson et al., 2011 ). CAMKII can also be activated by ROS at low Ca2+ concentrations ( Erickson et al., 2011 ). In mammalian cells, inhibition of Calcineurin by cytoplasmic CAMKII and inhibition of CAMKII by Calcineurin have both been reported ( MacDonnell et al., 2009; Kubokawa et al., 2011 ), suggesting that the balance is intricately maintained

. Therefore, in the case of the simultaneous activation of CAMKII and Calcineurin by Ca2+/CAM, either the kinase or the phosphatase could dominate the regulation of DAF-16 either locally ( e. g., cytoplasm vs nucleus ) or for certain time windows. This balance likely fine-tunes the DAF-16 activity in response to a changing environment. It is likely that UNC-43/Calcineurin is responsible for activating DAF-16 when worms experience a variety of stress signals, including heat stress, oxidative stress, or prolonged starvation ( Figure 6G ). Food deprivation acts through UNC-43 to suppress spontaneous sex-muscle contraction in C. elegans males ( Huntbury et al, 2007 ), suggesting that UNC-43 may also regulate D-16 in response to nutrient availability. UNC-43 and TAX-6•CN-1 can regulate D-16 independently of the IIS pathway ( Figure 7 ), and the two mechanisms appear to crosstalk, leading to coordinated action on D-16 ( Figure 8 ). The regulation of FOXO by CAMII and Calcinein is conserved in mammalian cells ( Figure 9 ).

    Title: A suppression hierarchy among competing motor programs drives sequential grooming in Drosophila
    Abstract: Motor sequences are formed through the serial execution of different movements, but how nervous systems implement this process remains largely unknown. We determined the organizational principles governing how dirty fruit flies groom their bodies with sequential movements. Using genetically targeted activation of neural subsets, we drove distinct motor programs that clean individual body parts. This enabled competition experiments revealing that the motor programs are organized into a suppression hierarchy; motor programs that occur first suppress those that occur later. Cleaning one body part reduces the sensory drive to its motor program, which relieves suppression of the next movement, allowing the grooming sequence to progress down the hierarchy. A model featuring independently evoked cleaning movements activated in parallel, but selected serially through hierarchical suppression, was successful in reproducing the grooming sequence. This provides the first example of an innate motor sequence implemented by the prevailing model for generating human action sequences.

   . A significant finding of this work is the experimental demonstration that hierarchical suppression among many behaviors leads to the emergence of a sequence. Although much attention has focused on the role of hierarchical suppression in selecting between behavioral choices, there is little experimental evidence to support its role as a mechanism for eliciting action sequences. The grooming sequence may be considered as a series of ‘forced choices’ among different competing cleaning modules that are selected in priority order through suppression. As each body part is cleaned, suppression of the other cleaning modules is lifted, and a new round of competition between the remaining cleaning options occurs. Our work lends strong support to an emerging view that hierarchical suppression is a ubiquitous action selection mechanism, whether it is used in deciding among available behavioral choices, or selecting movements performed in complex serial tasks. Thus, the evolutionarily ancient ability to select among competing behaviors through hierarchical suppression may have provided the necessary infrastructure to perform motor actions in sequence ( Houghton and Hartley, 1995 ). Activation chain and parallel models describe two different mechanisms for generating sequential behavior. Activation chains ( sometimes referred to as associative chaining, response chaining, or stimulus-response reflex chaining ) are the simplest form of sequential execution. These work through feedforward activation of the next movement by the previous one ( James, 1890 ). Parallel models ( also known as competitive queuing ) select movements through winner-take-all inhibition among the different motor units that are competing for output ( Houghton and Hartley, 1995; Bullock, 2004 ). Thus, the primary difference between the models is movement selection through either feedforward excitatory or competitive inhibitory mechanisms

. Independent control of each action in a sequence is challenging to achieve in most systems. However, recent tool development in Drosophila melanogaster permits subdivisions of behavior to be identified and manipulated in freely moving flies by expressing neural activators in subsets of neurons in the brain. This approach has revealed that acute neural activation can trigger specific behaviors and subcomponents of behaviors, such as abdominal bending and courtship song ( two subcomponents of the courtship sequence ) ( Clyne and Miesenböck, 2008; von Philipsborn et al., 2011; Flood et al., 2013 ). While these tools have invigorated interest in identifying the neurons that drive behavior, they also enable experiments to probe the organization of serial behavior through specific control of individual motor actions. Here, we study the organizational principles underlying the neural control of serial action selection in an innate behavior common to most limbed animals—grooming ( Sachs, 1988 ). Grooming consists of discrete cleaning movements that occur in predictable sequences; however, the mechanisms that govern transitions between the movements are not known ( Szebenyi, 1969; Fentress and Stilwell, 1973; Dawkins and Dawkins, 1976; Sachs, 1988 ). Local mechanical stimulation of a body part causes fruit flies to perform precisely targeted cleaning sweeps with their front or hind legs towards that body part ( Vandervorst and Ghysen, 1980; Corfas and Dudai, 1989 ). In contrast, when they are completely coated in dust, flies coordinate a repertoire of cleaning movements to groom their whole bodies ( Figure 1A; Bentley, 1975; Phillis et al., 1993 ). We reasoned that we could exploit the behavior of such dust-coated flies to determine how different grooming actions are prioritized and ordered when they are stimulated at the same time

. Thus, cleaning progresses to the next dirty and hierarchically superior part. We found that hierarchical suppression can mediate the selection of one among many simultaneously stimulated cleaning modules that are in competition for output. Between the proposed models describing how nervous systems execute serial actions, hierarchical suppression through competition is a core feature of parallel response models rather than activation chain models ( Houghton and Hartley, 1995; Bullock, 2004 ). The general schema for this motor-control strategy for grooming is shown in Figure 4A and consists of three layers: a sensory layer, a hierarchical layer, and a winner-take-all layer. The sensory layer consists of parallel sensory inputs that each independently activate a specific cleaning module. The hierarchical layer establishes differences in the activation levels between the cleaning modules ( described in detail below ). The winner-take-all layer then selects the module with the highest activation level by suppressing execution of the other modules. Once a module is selected, the reduced sensory drive that results from cleaning dust from the relevant body part gradually lowers its activation level, thereby allowing cleaning to proceed to whichever module has the next highest activation level ( In Figure 4A, the removal of dust by a module is represented with blunt arrows from the winner-take-all layer to the dust ). Grooming proceeds from the module with the highest activation level to that with the lowest until dust is removed from all of the body parts. This organization leads to the emergence of sequential cleaning of body parts. 10. 7554/eLife. 02951. 026Figure 4. Model of hierarchical suppression results in the sequential progression of grooming. ( A ) The dust induced grooming sequence requires three layers: ( 1 ) the sensory layer detects dust and independently activates each cleaning module

. In this case, the activity of a behavioral motor program suppresses another, solely because the shared circuit components cannot drive two behaviors at once ( Briggman and Kristan, 2008 ). Future experiments will address whether these or other neural circuit mechanisms govern hierarchical inhibition in serial grooming. Thus, the work presented here provides not only a framework for future experiments to understand how neurons and neural circuits mediate serial grooming, but also a basis for extrapolation to analogous organizational logic in other network-driven sequences. The GAL4 lines identified in this study target neurons that activate specific cleaning modules without inducing other behavioral phenotypes. What types of neurons might these GAL4 lines target? Two types that are already implicated in initiating movements are sensory and command neurons. Sensory neurons can activate specific motor programs as the initiators of stimulus-response circuits ( Sherrington, 1906; Huston and Jayaraman, 2011 ). In fruit fly grooming, mechanosensory neuron-coupled bristles can trigger cleaning responses with mechanical stimulation ( Vandervorst and Ghysen, 1980; Corfas and Dudai, 1989 ). This suggests that activation of these sensory neurons with dTrpA1 could trigger the specific cleaning modules. Command neurons have been defined as interneurons that are necessary and sufficient for activating specific motor programs ( Kupfermann and Weiss, 1978 ). However, the neurons targeted by the GAL4 lines used in this study only show sufficiency for activating cleaning movements as expression of UAS-Shibirets1 or UAS-TNT were unable to block cleaning ( unpublished data ). This may be explained if the GAL4-targeted neurons are those referred to as ‘command-like’ ( also known as command systems, decision neurons, or higher order interneurons ) ( Kupfermann and Weiss, 2001; Kristan, 2008 )

. We show that dust on the body elicits different independently evoked cleaning motor programs for five body parts that progress in series. By genetically targeting different neural subsets, we gain experimental control over each cleaning motor program to demonstrate that they are organized into a suppression hierarchy. We next generate an empirically derived computational model that demonstrates how a suppression hierarchy can mediate the sequential selection of the cleaning motor programs. This work reveals how the organization of Drosophila grooming is well described by a parallel model of serial behavior. 10. 7554/eLife. 02951. 003Figure 1.

The final answer is: 

Title: Suppression among competing motor drives sequential grooming in Drosila

Abstract: Motor sequences are formed through the execution of different movements, but nervous systems implement this process remains largely unknown. We determined the organizational governing how fruit flies groom their bodies with sequential movements. Using targeted activation of neural subsets we drove distinct programs that clean individual parts. This enabled experiments that programs are organized into a hierarchy; programs occur first those that later. Cleaning one body reduces the drive to its program, which relieves suppression of the next, allowing the sequence to progress the hierarchy. A model featuring evoked movements in parallel, but selected through hierarchical, was successful reproducing the sequence. This is the first example of an motor implemented by model for generating sequences.

    Title: Sgol2 provides a regulatory platform that coordinates essential cell cycle processes during meiosis I in oocytes
    Abstract: Accurate chromosome segregation depends on coordination between cohesion resolution and kinetochore-microtubule interactions ( K-fibers ), a process regulated by the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ). How these diverse processes are coordinated remains unclear. We show that in mammalian oocytes Shugoshin-like protein 2 ( Sgol2 ) in addition to protecting cohesin, plays an important role in turning off the SAC, in promoting the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, in facilitating formation of K-fibers and in limiting bivalent stretching. Sgol2’s ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A, as is its ability to silence the SAC, with the latter being mediated by direct binding to Mad2. In contrast, its effect on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation is independent of PP2A and mediated by recruitment of MCAK and inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity respectively. By virtue of its multiple interactions, Sgol2 links many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation.

   ., 2009 ). However, if this were the sole function of Sgol2, then chromosome behavior during meiosis I should be unaffected. To our surprise, we found that Sgol2 deficiency caused striking changes in chromosome and microtubule dynamics. It delayed bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, caused increased bivalent stretching, and greatly increased Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores, which was accompanied by an increase in lateral and a decrease in end on kinetochore-microtubules attachments. Lastly, Sgol2 deficiency delayed considerably APC/CCdc20 activation, suggesting that it was required to shut off the SAC. Sgol2 helps to turn off the SAC by binding directly both PP2A and the MCC protein Mad2, it moderates chromosome stretching by recruiting to kinetochores the kinesin MCAK, and likely promotes formation of K-fibers by down-regulating the activity of Aurora B/C kinase specifically at kinetochores. Meiotic chromosome segregation is a highly complex process dependent on an array of different biochemical processes. Our findings imply that through its multi-domain structure, Sgol2 has an important if not unique role in coordinating many of the key processes within this array.

. Members of this family contain a conserved C-terminal basic region and an N-terminal homodimeric parallel coiled coil, which provides a docking site for protein phosphatase 2A’s ( PP2A ) C and B’ subunits ( Xu et al., 2009 ). In budding yeast, mutant proteins defective specifically in PP2A binding fail to confer protection of centromeric cohesion during meiosis I ( Xu et al., 2009 ). Mammals have two members of the shugoshin family: Shugoshin-like protein 1 ( Sgol1 ), and Shugoshin-like protein 2 ( Sgol2 ). The former prevents centromeric cohesin from a process called the ‘prophase pathway’ that removes cohesin from chromosomes by a non-proteolytic mechanism soon after cells enter mitosis ( McGuinness et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2013 ). Sgol2, on the other hand, protects centromeric cohesin from separase at the first meiotic division ( Lee et al., 2008; Llano et al., 2008 ). Sgol2’s coiled coil domain binds PP2A in vitro ( Xu et al., 2009 ) but whether this is vital for protecting centromeric cohesion is not known. Sgol2 also interacts with MCAK ( Huang et al., 2007 ), a microtubule depolymerizing kinesin, implicated in correcting inappropriate kinetochore-microtubule interactions ( error correction ), and with Mad2 an essential component of the MCC ( Orth et al., 2011 ). Shugoshins, though not explicitly Sgol2, have also been implicated in recruiting to kinetochores the Aurora B kinase, necessary both for the SAC and for error correction ( Tsukahara et al., 2010; Yamagishi et al., 2010 ). Based on its interactions, Sgol2 has been linked to cohesion protection, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and error correction pathways. However, the physiological significance of these multiple interactions remain unclear. We show here that Sgol2 defective in PP2A binding fails to protect centromeric cohesin, as found for Sgo1 in yeast ( Xu et al., 2009 )

. Given the number of fundamental processes regulated by Sgol2, it is surprising that sgol2Δ/Δ oocytes often manage to undergo the first meiotic division without generating massive aneuploidy. Their second meiotic division is of course completely defective due to the total absence of sister chromatid cohesion. We suggest that all of the processes regulated by Sgol2 are fundamentally essential but that they are also regulated by Sgol2-independent pathways. In other words, the processes regulated by Sgol2 may be so fundamental that there are multiple pathways regulating them. It is not inconceivable that Sgol1, which is also expressed during meiosis, shares some functions with Sgol2 and it will therefore be interesting to analyze the phenotype of double mutant oocytes. What is possibly most remarkable is that a single protein regulates sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome traction, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and lastly Aurora B/C kinases. Crucially, by demonstrating that different point mutations alter the regulation of some but not other processes, we have proven that the pleiotropy observed in sgol2Δ/Δ oocytes is not due to knock on effects ( secondary or even tertiary pathology ) of eliminating a single function. Sgol2 possesses several different domains that regulate fundamentally different processes ( Figure 11 ). Why so much regulation is embedded into a single protein is unclear, but we speculate that this helps the coordination of multiple processes necessary for high fidelity chromosome segregation. 10. 7554/eLife. 01133. 026Figure 11. Graphical summary of sequence features, interactions and key functions of Sgol2 in mouse oocytes. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01133. 026

Previous work has shown that Sgol2 is essential for protection of centromeric cohesin from separase at the first meiotic division ( Lee et al., 2008; Llano et al., 2008 ). Our creation and analysis of mutations within Sgol2’s highly conserved coiled coil reveals the likely mechanism, namely recruitment of PP2A to centromeres. PP2A might protect cohesin from separase either directly, by binding ( Holland et al., 2007 ) and inhibiting separase activity, or indirectly, by reversing phosphorylation of cohesin’s Rec8 subunit ( Katis et al., 2010 ), a process known to be important for its cleavage in yeast. However, if cohesion protection were Sgol2’s sole function, then its depletion should not compromise chromosome segregation during meiosis I. The precocious loss of cohesion should only affect the second meiotic division. On the contrary, depletion of Sgol2 specifically in oocytes has highly pleiotropic consequences already during meiosis I. These include inefficient SAC silencing, greatly increased bivalent stretching, and major alterations in the dynamics of kinetochore-microtubule attachments ( K-fibers ). We show that Sgol2 silences the SAC by binding to Mad2 using a similar MIM motif common to Mad2’s other two partners Cdc20 and Mad1. This raises the possibility that Sgol2 silences the SAC by competing with Cdc20 for the binding of activated Mad2, thereby preventing formation of the MCC. However, this cannot be the full story as SAC silencing also depends on Sgol2’s ability to bind PP2A. Because Sgol2’s MIM motif is close to the coiled coil by which it binds PP2A, it is conceivable that PP2A directly ( i. e., structurally ) facilitates the formation or stability of ‘closed’ complexes between Sgol2 and Mad2

. Kinetochore associated microtubules bundles ( K-fibers ) were thinner and more sparse, lateral attachments were greatly increased in frequency, and kinetochores ( as detected by CREST antibodies ) were frequently highly stretched in mutant oocytes ( Figure 8B ). Microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA had the opposite effect, eliminating lateral attachments and kinetochore stretching while greatly increasing the abundance of end-on microtubules associated with each kinetochore, an effect abrogated by T521A T600A ( Figure 8B ). This suggests that the accumulation at kinetochores of Sgol2 phosphorylated by Aurora B/C kinase stimulates the conversion of lateral to end on attachments and that this may be the mechanism by which Sgol2 accelerates the formation of Kib.
Neuron-wide RNA transport combines with netrin-mediated local translation to spatially regulate the synaptic proteome. Studies have shown that experience-dependent changes in brain connectivity require RNA and protein localization, and local translation plays a role in altering synapse structure and function during formation and plasticity. This study investigates whether local stimulation triggers RNA transport from the nucleus to synapses. Imaging in cultured Aplyia sensory-motor neurons revealed RNAs are delivered throughout the neuron, but translation is enriched at sites of synaptic contact and stimulation. Mechanisms of local translation reveal a role for calcium-dependent netrin-1/DCC signaling. Spatial regulation of gene expression is maximized by local translation rather than RNA delivery from nucleus to synapses. Transcripts, ribosomes, and translational machinery are delivered throughout the neuron, but translation is selectively activated in response to stimuli such as synapse formation. Studies do not rule out localized subcell trafficking within processes, but indicate synapse and stimulation do not regulate trafficking from soma to synapse. Transcripts induced by stimuli are delivered throughout the neuron, with local translation regulated by localized cues. Netrin-1 is investigated as retrograde signal driving translation due to its role in axonal growth, synaptogenesis, and transmembrane regulation in dendrites and axons. Anti-DCC antibodies decrease sensorin immunoreactivity in paired MNs but not isolated SN, consistent with netrin released from MN binding DCC on pre-synaptic SN to promote translation at synapses. Netrin binding DCC may release translational machinery from cytoplasmic domains or activate PI3 and MAPK pathways. Translation of localized RNAs is sufficient for late-LTP in hippocampus and LTF Aplyia. Isolated Aplyia sensoryites severed from somata undergo serotonin-induced LTF not lasting as L in cultures containing SN. Newly transcribed RNAs are required for persistent plasticity, leading to investigate whether stimulation regulates RNA trafficking from nucleus to subcell sites. Activity regulates localization of mRN within neurons, such as depolarization increasing dendritic beta-actin, BDNF, and TrkB, and incubation DHP increasing GluA2. Neurotrophins regulate specific RN in axons of regenerating sensory neurons. Activity induces transcription of genes transported into dendrites, such as Arc. In situ hybridization indicates mRNA localized peripheral but not central axons DRG neurons. Findings are consistent with delivering transcripts and transl machinery throughout neuron, with synaptically netrin-dependent triggering translation at synapses.

    Title: Spatiotemporal mosaic self-patterning of pluripotent stem cells using CRISPR interference
    Abstract: Morphogenesis involves interactions of asymmetric cell populations to form complex multicellular patterns and structures comprised of distinct cell types. However, current methods to model morphogenic events lack control over cell-type co-emergence and offer little capability to selectively perturb specific cell subpopulations. Our in vitro system interrogates cell-cell interactions and multicellular organization within human induced pluripotent stem cell ( hiPSC ) colonies. We examined effects of induced mosaic knockdown of molecular regulators of cortical tension ( ROCK1 ) and cell-cell adhesion ( CDH1 ) with CRISPR interference. Mosaic knockdown of ROCK1 or CDH1 resulted in differential patterning within hiPSC colonies due to cellular self-organization, while retaining an epithelial pluripotent phenotype. Knockdown induction stimulates a transient wave of differential gene expression within the mixed populations that stabilized in coordination with observed self-organization. Mosaic patterning enables genetic interrogation of emergent multicellular properties, which can facilitate better understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate symmetry-breaking during morphogenesis.

    In this study we examined the effect of inducing specific genetic KD in subpopulations of hiPSCs within an otherwise homogeneous population of pluripotent cells. Historically, small-molecule chemical inhibitors, antibodies, and homogeneous genetic knockouts are often used to interrogate the molecular mechanisms involved in morphogenesis ( Lecuit and Lenne, 2007; McBeath et al., 2004; Salbreux et al., 2012 ). However, these methods can’t selectively discriminate between different cells, or they fail to address how the emergence of heterotypic interactions affects multicellular organization. Here, we report that silencing of target genes by CRISPRi within only subpopulations of cells provides multiple avenues to genetically control the emergence of asymmetric cell phenotypes and development of multicellular patterns. Specifically, we demonstrate that mosaic KD of target genes ROCK1 or CDH1 result in distinct patterning events wherein cell-driven segregation dictates colony organization without loss of pluripotency ( Figure 5 ). ROCK1 regulates actin-myosin contraction ( McBeath et al., 2004 ) and facilitates expansion of PSCs ( Ohgushi et al., 2015; Park et al., 2015 ), and its acute inhibition by small molecules leads to a ‘relaxed’ cell phenotype with decreased stiffness ( Kinney et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2006 ). However, we found that prolonged silencing of ROCK1 in hiPSCs ( 6 days ) resulted in cells that were twofold stiffer than either the CDH1 KD cells or the control CRISPRi cells. The increased cortical stiffness of ROCK1 KD hiPSCs could be due to the difference between the inhibition of an existing protein and KD of the gene. A small molecule inhibitor prevents the function of already existing proteins so that a small amount of functioning protein may escape the inhibitor’s influence

., 2010 ) and are subjected to higher tension generated by neighboring cells ( Samarage et al., 2015 ), which then feed back into lineage fate decisions. For example, the Hippo pathway is controlled by a cell’s position within the early blastocyst, where the outer cell layer has the ability to polarize and sequester the signaling molecule angiomotin away from adherens junctions, preventing the phosphorylation and activation that would occur in an internal cell that maintained cell-cell contacts on all sides ( Hirate et al., 2013 ). Additionally in vitro micro-patterned PSC colonies have been reported to display spatially dependent germ layer patterning upon differentiation ( Etoc et al., 2016; Tewary et al., 2017; Warmflash et al., 2014 ). The observed mosaic patterns of ROCK1 KD hiPSCs demonstrate that the spatial location within a colony can be affected by targeted gene KD without altering differentiation potential, and conversely, the mosaic CDH1 KD demonstrates dual control of spatial positioning and lineage potential. Therefore, the system described here enables interrogation of multicellular organization and morphogenic processes in parallel via manipulation of local multicellular domains through subpopulation organization and priming to specific lineage fates. In addition to changes in multicellular organization as a result of ROCK1 or CDH1 KD, changes in gene expression also occurred in the WT population. In particular, the WT population displayed significant changes in several genes associated with adhesion and lineage fate. For example, GATA4 was down-regulated in WT cells in all mixed colonies. GATA4 is expressed by mesendoderm lineages ( Molkentin et al., 1997; Zorn and Wells, 2009 ) and its down-regulation may affect the ability of WT cells to properly differentiate to mesendoderm

. Colony morphology and expression of epithelial markers, such as epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( EpCAM ), were examined to determine if the cells that lost CDH1 expression segregated from their WT-GFP neighbors due to delamination, or loss of the epithelial phenotype characteristic of hiPSCs. ROCK1 KD: WT-GFP and CDH1 KD: WT-GFP colonies maintained an epithelial morphology throughout 6 days of CRISPRi silencing ( Figure 3A ) with no observed migration by CRISPRi-modulated cells away from the colonies. Both ROCK1 KD and CDH1 KD hiPSCs within mixed colonies expressed EpCAM at cell-cell boundaries after 6 days of CRISPRi induction despite changes in cortical tension or intercellular adhesion due to loss of ROCK1 or CDH1, respectively ( Figure 3A ). Furthermore, ROCK1/CDH1 KD hiPSCs displayed cell junction-localized β-catenin in pure colonies after 6 days of CRISPRi induction, suggesting maintenance of adherens junctions and epithelial colonies ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ). Since the decrease of CDH1 is commonly associated with loss of pluripotency in PSCs, the expression and localization of the common pluripotency transcription factors, OCT3/4 and SOX2, were examined. Both proteins maintained strong nuclear expression in pure ROCK1 KD or CDH1 KD colonies after 6 days of KD induction ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2A ). Moreover, despite the physical segregation of cells induced by KD in mixed populations, no pattern could be observed based on pluripotency marker expression ( Figure 3B ). Furthermore, the abundance of OCT3/4 and SOX2 transcripts was unchanged in pure colonies of CDH1 KD cells and not significantly different, though variable, in pure colonies of ROCK1 KD hiPSCs ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2B )

. However, there were no significant differences in EOMES expression between the WT and CRISPRi cells when ROCK1 KD mixed colonies were directed toward a mesendodermal fate ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ), potentially due to the strength of the small molecule CHIR, a GSK3 inhibitor, in inducing mesendoderm fate. Additionally, differences between the WT and ROCK1 KD populations may arise in longer differentiations, where the cells are allowed to mature beyond a progenitor stage. However, differences in maturation or cell type within a germ lineage may assist in the controlled co-emergence of multiple cell types that normally interact within a single tissue, such as parenchymal cells along with stromal populations. Overall, this study capitalized on the ability of CRISPRi to temporally perturb specific molecular regulators of physical cell properties, such as adhesion and tension, that resulted in differing multicellular patterns. Moreover, CRISPRi additionally offers the flexibility to target any gene of interest and timing of KD ( Gordon et al., 2016; Mandegar et al., 2016 ), allowing for the creation of dynamic patterns through transient genetic KD that could be used to pre-pattern PSC colonies in various types of multicellular geometries before differentiation. Additionally, the ability to induce molecular asymmetry can also be applied to co-differentiation, where the temporal induction of specific heterotypic interactions, such as the presentation of a ligand or receptor, can give rise to the coordinated emergence of two ( or more ) cell types under the same culture conditions. In addition, mosaic induction of KD can be used to examine how signals propagate between cells, for example, interrogating how the networks between cells created by either mechanical ( adhesions ) or chemical gradients ( gap junctions ) affect lineage fate decisions

. In contrast, CRISPRi only needs to target the ROCK1 gene loci at two alleles to completely abolish protein transcription, thus highlighting the strength of genetic perturbation. Additionally, ROCK inhibition is often used as a transient perturbation ( 24 hr ), whereas long-term KD of ROCK1 ( 6 days ) may induce compensatory effects within the cells that are responsible for the somewhat surprising results. Long-term ROCK1 KD compensation is a likely partial explanation why KD of ROCK1 prior to mixing resulted in radially partitioned populations, but post-mixing KD resulted in less segregated populations. The increased stacking of the ROCK1 KD population upon induction of knockdown after mixing with WT cells could also reflect the difference between short-term and long-term ROCK1 KD and potential compensation effects. In contrast, the KD of CD1 resulted in segregated populations due to the loss of cell-cell adhesion, which is consistent with previous reports of loss of CD1 in hiPSCs leading to loss of pluripotency. However, CD1 KD did not result in loss of pluripotency in this study, as evidenced by maintained expression of pluripot transcription factors OCT/4 and SOX2, and epithelial markers EpCAM and β-catenin. This study demonstrates that CRPR can be used to interrogate multicellular organization and morphogenesis in PSCs by targeting specific subpopulations of cells, enabling the study of emergent multicellular properties that arise from heterotypic interactions.

    Title: A resource-rational theory of set size effects in human visual working memory
    Abstract: Encoding precision in visual working memory decreases with the number of encoded items. Here, we propose a normative theory for such set size effects: the brain minimizes a weighted sum of an error-based behavioral cost and a neural encoding cost. We construct a model from this theory and find that it predicts set size effects. Notably, these effects are mediated by probing probability, which aligns with previous empirical findings. The model accounts well for effects of both set size and probing probability on encoding precision in nine delayed-estimation experiments. Moreover, we find support for the prediction that the total amount of invested resource can vary non-monotonically with set size. Finally, we show that it is sometimes optimal to encode only a subset or even none of the relevant items in a task. Our findings raise the possibility that cognitive "limitations" arise from rational cost minimization rather than from constraints.

    Descriptive models of visual working memory ( VWM ) have evolved to a point where there is little room for improvement in how well they account for experimental data. Nevertheless, the basic finding that VWM precision depends on set size still lacks a principled explanation. Here, we examined a normative proposal in which expected task performance is traded off against the cost of spending neural resource on encoding. We used this principle to construct a resource-rational model for "local" VWM tasks and found that set size effects in this model are fully mediated by the probing probabilities of the individual items; this is consistent with suggestions from earlier empirical work ( Emrich et al., 2017; Palmer et al., 1993 ). From the perspective of our model, the interpretation is that as more items are added to a task, the relevance of each individual item decreases, which makes it less cost-efficient to spend resource on its encoding. We also found that in this model it is sometimes optimal to encode only a subset of task-relevant items, which implies that resource rationality could serve as a principled bridge between resource and slot-based models of VWM. We tested the model on data from nine previous delayed-estimation experiments and found that it accounts well for effects of both set size and probing probability, despite having relatively few parameters. Moreover, it accounts for a non-monotonicity that appears to exist between set size and the total amount of resource that subjects invest in item encoding. The broader implication of our findings is that VWM limitations – and cognitive limitations in general – may be driven by a mechanism that minimizes a cost, instead of by a fixed constraint on available encoding resource. Our theory makes a number of assumptions that need further investigation

. A similar method can also assess the relation between an item’s probing probability and the spiking activity related to its neural encoding. Our theory might apply beyond working memory tasks. In particular, it has been speculated that the selectivity of attention arises from a need to balance performance against the costs associated with spiking ( Pestilli and Carrasco, 2005; Lennie, 2003 ). Our theory provides a normative formalism to test this speculation and may thus explain set size effects in attention tasks ( Lindsay et al., 1968; Shaw, 1980; Ma and Huang, 2009 ). Furthermore, developmental studies have found that that working memory capacity estimates change with age ( Simmering and Perone, 2012; Simmering, 2012 ). Viewed from the perspective of our proposed theory, this raises the question of why the optimal trade-off between behavioral and neural cost would change with age. A speculative answer is that a subject's coding efficiency – formalized by the reciprocal of parameter α in Equation 7 – may improve during childhood: an increase in coding efficiency reduces the neural cost per unit of precision, which shifts the optimal amount of resource to use for encoding to larger values. Neuroimaging studies might provide insight into whether and how coding efficiency changes with age, for example by estimating the amount of neural activity required per unit of precision in memory representations. Our work fits into a broader tradition of normative theories in psychology and neuroscience ( Table 4 ). The main motivation for such theories is to reach a deeper level of understanding by analyzing a system in the context of the ecological needs and constraints under which it evolved. Besides work on ideal-observer decision rules ( Green and Swets, 1966; KordingKörding, 2007; Geisler, 2011; Shen and Ma, 2016 ) and on resource-limited approximations to optimal inference ( Gershman et al., 2015; Griffiths et al

. Some form of divisive normalization ( Bays, 2014; Carandini and Heeger, 2012 ) would be a likely candidate, which is already a key operation in neural models of attention ( Reynolds and Heeger, 2009 ) and visual working memory ( Bays, 2014; Wei et al., 2012 ). The essence of this mechanism is that it lowers the gain when set size is larger, without requiring explicit knowledge of the set size prior to the presentation of the stimuli. Consistent with the predictions of this theory, empirical work has found that the neural activity associated with the encoding of an item decreases with set size, as observed in for example the lateral intraparietal cortex ( Churchland et al., 2008; Balan et al., 2008 ) and superior colliculus ( Basso and Wurtz, 1998 ). Moreover, the work by Bays ( 2014 ) has shown that a modified version of divisive normalization can account for the near-optimal distribution of resources across items with unequal probing probabilities. As set size effects in our model are mediated by probing probability, its predicted set size effects can probably be accounted for by a similar mechanism. Another question concerns the timescale at which the optimization takes place. In all experimental data that we considered here, the only factors that changed from trial to trial were set size ( E1-E7 ) and probing probability ( E7-E9 ). When we fitted the model, we assumed that the expected total cost in these experiments was minimized on a trial-by-trial basis: whenever set size or probing probability changed from one trial to the next, the computation of Joptimal followed this change. This assumption accounted well for the data and, as discussed above, previous work has shown that divisive normalization can accommodate trial-by-trial changes in set size and probing probability

. In resource models, the possibility of complete forgetting has so far been an added ingredient separate from the core of the model ( van den Berg et al., 2014 ). Our normative theory allows for a reinterpretation of this question: are there situations in which it is optimal to assign zero resource to the encoding of an item? We already established that this could happen in delayed-estimation tasks: whenever the probing probability is lower than a threshold value p0=λ| c¯behavioral ( 0 ) |, the optimal amount of resource to invest on encoding the item is zero ( see Theory ). But what values does p0 take in practice? Considering the expected behavioral cost function of a fixed-precision model ( a variable-precision model with τ↓0 ), we can prove that p0 = 0, that is, it is never optimal to invest no resource ( Appendix 1 ). For the expected behavioral cost function of the variable-precision model, however, simulations indicate that p0 can be greater than 0 ( we were not able to derive this result analytically ). We next examine whether this ever happens under parameter values that are representative for human subjects. Using the maximum-likelihood parameters obtained from the data in E7-E9, we estimate that p0 ( expressed as a percentage ) equals 8. 86 ± 0. 54%. Moreover, we find that for 8 of the 47 subjects, p0 is larger than the lowest probing probability in the experiment, which suggests that these subjects sometimes entirely ignored one or more of the items. For these subjects, the error distributions on items with pi<p0 look uniform ( see Figure 4C for an example ) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for uniformity did not reject the null hypothesis in any of these cases ( p>0. 05 in all tests ). These results suggest that there might be a principled reason why people sometimes leave task-relevant items out of visual working memory in delayed-estimation experiments

. The sum of these terms has a unique minimum J¯optimal ( Figure 2E, center panel ), which monotonically decreases with set size ( Figure 2E, right panel ). The costs plotted in Figure 2E can be considered as obtained by multiplying the corresponding costs in Figure 2D by N. The model thus predicts set size effects in delayed-estimation tasks that are fully mediated by individual-item probing probability. The latter notion is consistent with empirical observations. Palmer et al. ( 1993 ) reported that "relevant set size" ( where irrelevance means pi = 0 ) acts virtually identically to actual set size. Emrich et al. ( 2017 ) independently varied probing probability and set size in their experiment, and found that the former was a better predictor of performance than the latter. Based on this, they hypothesized that set size effects are mediated by probing probability. The predictions of our model are qualitatively consistent with these findings. To examine how well the model accounts for set effects of both size and probability, we fitted it to data from nine delayed-est experiments ( E-E9 ). We used the maximum-likelihood method to estimate the parameters of the model. The results are shown in Figure 3. The model accounts well the effects of both size and probability on precision, despite having relatively few parameters. Moreover, it accounts for the nonotonicity between size and the amount of resource invested in encoding ( Figure 3, right panel ), which appears to exist in the data. The model also predicts that it is optimal to encode only a subset or none of the items in a task, which is supported by the finding that for 8 of the 47 subjects p0 is larger than the lowest probability in the experiment, and the error distributions of items with pi<p look uniform ( see Figure 4 for an example ) and Kolmogor-Smir tests for uniformity did not reject the null hypothesis in any of these cases ( p>.05 in all tests ) These results suggest that there might be a principled reason why people sometimes leave task-relevant items out of visual memory in delayedest experiments. Our theory makes a number of assumptions that need further investigation, such as the relation between an item’s probing and spiking activity related to its encoding. The theory might apply beyond working memory tasks, in particular it has been speculated that selectivity of attention arises from a need to balance performance against costs associated with spiking ( Pest and Carrasco 2005; Lennie 2003 ) Our theory provides a normative formal to test this speculation and may explain size effects in attention tasks ( Lindsay et al 196; Shaw 198; Ma 2009 ), developmental studies have found that working capacity change with age ( Siming and Perone 2012 Siming 201 ) viewed from the perspective our theory, this raises question why optimal trade-off between behavioral and neural would change with age A speculative answer that subject’s efficiency formalized by reciprocal parameter in Equation 7 may improve during childhood increase efficiency reduces cost per unit precision shifts optimal resource to larger values neuroimaging might provide insight into how efficiency changes with age for example estimating activity per unit in memory representations Our work into broader tradition normative in psychology and neuroscience motivation such reach deeper level analyzing system context ecological constraints evolved work ideal-observer rules Green Swets 196 Kording 2007 Geis 201 Shen Ma 201 resource-limited approximations inference Gershman 201 Griffiths some form divisive Bays 201 Carini He 201 Reynolds Heeger 200 Bays 201 Wei 2 essence mechanism lowers gain size without explicit knowledge size prior presentation consistent predictions this empirical found activity encoding decreases size observed intrapetal Church et 200 Bal 200 superiorcol Basso Wurt 199 Bays shown modified normalization account near-optimal resources unequal probabilities set effects model mediated probability predicted size accounted mechanism question timescale optimization experimental factors changed trial trial set E-E probing E we fitted assumed total minimized basis whenever size or probability changed next computation followed assumption accounted data previous shown normalization accommodate trial-trial changes size probability resource possibility complete added ingredient core van Berg 201 norm theory reinterpret question assign zero resource item established happen delayedest whenever probability lower threshold p0 behavioral variable model proved p0 never invest resource variable model simulations indicate p greater we able derive result analyt maximum-likelihood obtained data E-E estimate p expressed percentage 8 86 54 subjects p larger lowest probability experiment subjects entirely ignored items distributions items pi uniform Figure example Kolmogor-Smir tests null hypothesis rejected p05 tests results princip reason people task-relevant memory experiments

The final answer is: 

This article proposes a normative theory of set effects in human visual working memory, suggesting that encoding precision decreases with the number of items due to a trade-off between behavioral cost and neural cost.

    Title: An effector of the Irish potato famine pathogen antagonizes a host autophagy cargo receptor
    Abstract: Plants use autophagy to safeguard against infectious diseases. However, how plant pathogens interfere with autophagy-related processes is unknown. Here, we show that PexRD54, an effector from the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans, binds host autophagy protein ATG8CL to stimulate autophagosome formation. PexRD54 depletes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes and interferes with Joka2's positive effect on pathogen defense. Thus, a plant pathogen effector has evolved to antagonize a host autophagy cargo receptor to counteract host defenses.

    Supporting Text:
   . In plants, autophagy plays important roles in stress tolerance, senescence, development, and defense against invading pathogens ( Patel and Dinesh-Kumar, 2008; Lenz et al., 2011; Vanhee and Batoko, 2011; Li and Vierstra, 2012; Lv et al., 2014; Teh and Hofius, 2014 ). Specifically, autophagy is implicated in the accumulation of defense hormones and the hypersensitive response, a form of plant cell death that prevents spread of microbial infection ( Yoshimoto et al., 2009 ). However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate defense-related autophagy and the selective nature of this process are poorly understood. Furthermore, how adapted plant pathogens manipulate defense-related autophagy and/or subvert autophagy for nutrient uptake is unknown. In this study, we investigated how a pathogen interferes with and coopts a plant autophagy pathway. The potato blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans, is a serious threat to food security, causing crop losses that, if alleviated, could feed hundreds of millions of people ( Fisher et al., 2012 ). This pathogen delivers RXLR-type effector proteins inside plant cells to enable parasitism ( Morgan and Kamoun, 2007 ). RXLR effectors form a diverse family of modular proteins that alter a variety of host processes and therefore serve as useful probes to dissect key pathways for pathogen invasion ( Morgan and Kamoun, 2007; Bozkurt et al., 2012 ). Here, we show that the RXLR effector PexRD54 has evolved to bind host autophagy protein ATG8CL to stimulate autophagosome formation. In addition, PexRD54 depletes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes to counteract host defenses against P. infestans.

. Both Joka2 and the effector showed higher affinity to ATG8CL compared to ATG8IL ( Figure 2 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ). This indicates that variation between plant ATG8 proteins may contribute to the selective nature of autophagy. This work further highlights the intricate changes in endomembrane compartment formation that take place during plant-microbe interactions ( Bozkurt et al., 2015; Lipka and Panstruga, 2005; Kwon et al., 2008; Ivanov et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010 ). Future studies will need to consider pathogen-directed modulation of the spatio-temporal dynamics of autophagy and subcellular trafficking during host infection. It will be interesting to determine whether other plant pathogens also secrete effectors that evolved an ATG8 interacting motif or target autophagy in other ways. These effectors would serve as valuable tools to dissect the mechanisms of defense-related selective autophagy.

., 2013 ). For instance, to counteract antimicrobial autophagy, intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila secretes a type IV effector protein RavZ that impedes autophagy by uncoupling ATG8-lipid linkage ( Choy et al., 2012 ). In this study, we show that a plant pathogen effector has evolved an ATG8 interacting motif to bind with high affinity to the autophagy protein ATG8CL and stimulate the formation of ATG8CL-marked autophagosomes. Unlike the Legionella effector RavZ, PexRD54 activates selective autophagy possibly to eliminate defense-related compounds or to reattribute cellular resources by promoting nutrient recycling. Our results show that, in addition to disrupting, pathogens can also activate autophagy for their own benefit ( Figure 8 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 10856. 032Figure 8. PexRD54 outcompetes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 and enhances virulence. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 10856. 032 Additionally, we show that the effector competes with the host cargo receptor Joka2 and depletes it out of ATG8CL autophagosomes to promote disease susceptibility. Thus P. infestans coopts the host cell’s endomembrane compartment to promote its own growth at the cost of the cell’s physiology ( Bozkurt et al., 2015 ). Joka2 could contribute to immunity by inducing autophagic removal of plant or pathogen molecules that negatively affect host defenses. It will be interesting in the future to determine the identity of potential defense-related cargo carried by Joka2 ( Figure 8 ). The physiological roles of selective autophagy and the molecular mechanisms involved remain to be determined both in plants and animals. Characterization of additional host cargo receptors and interactome analysis of particular ATG8 proteins should improve our understanding of how selective autophagy operates in response to a variety of stress conditions including immunity. In the potato genome, we identified nine ATG8 genes

., 2011 ) ( Figure 6A ). Indeed, in planta coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed that potato Joka2, but not the AIM mutant, Joka2AIM, associated with ATG8CL ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ). Joka2 association with ATG8CL was somewhat specific given that this cargo receptor failed to coimmunoprecipitate with ATG8IL ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ). Joka2, but not Joka2AIM, also markedly increased the number of GFP:ATG8CL autophagosomes ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3, Video 4 ), and enhanced ATG8CL protein levels ( Figure 6—figure supplement 4 ). This indicates that Joka2 also activates ATG8CL-mediated selective autophagy. 10. 7554/eLife. 10856. 022Figure 6.

. The distinct AIMs of PexRD54 and Joka2 presumably determine the effect observed in these competition experiments. To further test this, we replaced the functional PexRD54 AIM with two sequences that cover the Joka2 AIM:GVAEWDPI ( PexRD54J2AIM1 ) and GVAEWDPILEELKEMG ( PexRD54J2AIM2 ) ( Figure 6C ). Both PexRD54J2AIM1 and PexRD54J2AIM2 associated with ATG8CL to a lesser extent than wild-type PexRD54 ( Figure 6D ), and were less effective than PexRD54 in depleting Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes ( Figure 6— supplement 5 ). These results indicate that the Pex54 AIM and J2 AIM contribute to the interaction between Pex54 and J2 and AT8.

    Title: Human cardiac fibroblasts adaptive responses to controlled combined mechanical strain and oxygen changes in vitro
    Abstract: Upon cardiac pathological conditions such as ischemia, microenvironmental changes instruct a series of cellular responses that trigger cardiac fibroblasts-mediated tissue adaptation and inflammation. A comprehensive model of how early environmental changes may induce cardiac fibroblasts ( CF ) pathological responses is far from being elucidated, partly due to the lack of approaches involving complex and simultaneous environmental stimulation. Here, we provide a first analysis of human primary CF behavior by means of a multi-stimulus microdevice for combined application of cyclic mechanical strain and controlled oxygen tension. Our findings elucidate differential human CFs responses to different combinations of the above stimuli. Individual stimuli cause proliferative effects ( PHH3+ mitotic cells, YAP translocation, PDGF secretion ) or increase collagen presence. Interestingly, only the combination of hypoxia and a simulated loss of contractility ( 2% strain ) is able to additionally induce increased CF release of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases.

    Supporting Text:
    In summary, we propose an innovative model that recreates a pathological environment for understanding CF responses during cardiac injury. Replicating for the first time the combination of oxygen changes and mechanical cues, we revealed how these environmental stimulations combine to trigger CF pathological responses and highlighted emerging adaptive cellular mechanisms. We found that mimicking the combination of HX and reduced contractility proved crucial in eliciting inflammatory and fibrotic remodeling responses of CFs, while individual environmental stimuli only regulated proliferative and collagen-related responses. These insights have impact on future studies of pathological myocardial remodeling and the in vitro model here described provides a tool for better understanding pathological mechanisms and tailoring reparative strategies.

. In an attempt to provide in vitro models of cardiac disease, CFs have been widely studied under relevant physico-chemical stimulation such as mechanical stress ( Schroer and Merryman, 2015; Tomasek et al., 2002 ), oxygen deprivation ( Clancy et al., 2007; Tamamori et al., 1997 ) and biochemical stimulation with pro-fibrotic cytokines ( Edgley et al., 2012; Lijnen et al., 2000; Petrov et al., 2002 ). The application of mechanical stress has been shown to have the following effects on CFs: increased ECM protein synthesis ( Carver et al., 1991 ) ; controversial proliferative behavior ( Atance et al., 2004; Butt and Bishop, 1997; Dalla Costa et al., 2010; Liao et al., 2004 ), with recent reports of strain intensity-dependent effects ( Ugolini et al., 2016 ) ; increased production of pro-fibrotic and inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-β ( transforming growth factor-beta ) ( Leask, 2007 ) and TNF-α ( tumor necrosis factor-alpha ) ( Yokoyama et al., 1999 ). While previous mechanical stress experiments were performed in a normoxic environment ( NX, approximately 20% O2, the standard oxygen level of ambient air ), CFs were shown to be sensitive to O2 level variations from physoxia ( PX ), defined as the physiologic oxygen level in living tissues ( about 5–6% O2 in the myocardium [Gonschior et al., 1992; Roy et al., 2003; Sen et al., 2006; Winegrad et al., 1999] ). Both hypoxia ( HX, 1–3% O2 ) and NX induce a pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic phenotype in cultured CFs ( Roy et al., 2003; Sen and Roy, 2010 ). These findings imply that normoxic oxygen levels are perceived by CFs as a state of hyperoxia and that a significant bias exists when culturing CFs in non-physiological oxygen environments. The exposure of CFs to HX has been shown to induce collagen production and proliferation of CFs ( Gao et al., 2014; Tamamori et al

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 22847. 005 The expression of MMP-2 and MMP-3 in CFs supernatants ( Figure 1CD ) was significantly influenced by combined mechanical strain and oxygen changes. MMP-2 was more prominently expressed than MMP-3 ( >100X higher ). Nevertheless, the expression of both enzymes was similarly regulated by the pattern of stimulations applied: a significant two-fold increase in MMP-2 and MMP-3 expression was induced by the combination of HX and mechanical strain, with a more pronounced increase observed in the HX/2% strain combined conditions. MMP-3 expression was negatively affected when CFs were subjected to mechanical strain at PX or HX stimulus alone. During the proliferative phase of myocardial healing, excessive CF proliferation is observed as well as a phenotypic switch giving rise to the fibrotic response. In order to understand how environmental stimuli modulate the proliferation of human CFs, we examined the fraction of mitotic cells ( PHH3+/DAPI ) under combined mechanical stimulation and changes in oxygen tension. Figure 2A shows representative images of CFs stained for PHH3 and DAPI. Without application of cyclic strain, we observed a two-fold significant increase in the number of mitotic cells ( Figure 2B ) when CFs were stimulated with HX compared to their PX counterparts. Mechanical strain significantly impacted cell proliferation within the PX culture condition: culturing CFs at PX and subjecting them to 2% strain induced a striking increase in mitotic cells compared to no strain control and 8% strain cultures. This strain intensity-dependent effect is in line with our previous investigations of CF proliferation under mechanical strain in NX conditions ( Ugolini et al., 2016 )

., 2014; Tamamori et al., 1997 ), while studies suggest that MMP-based remodeling may not be triggered by HX alone ( Riches et al., 2009 ). Given the complexity of in vivo pathological evolution, the elucidation of how environmental stimuli interplay and guide cellular responses is paramount. To date, no comprehensive model is able to recapitulate early cellular events taking place after acute myocardial injury and there is no report of cardiac cells subjected to simultaneous mechanical strain and controlled oxygen changes, two major environmental variables involved in cardiac injury and CF adaptive responses. This is mostly due to the lack of compact platforms enabling the controlled application of multiple stimuli. To address this need, we here report the improvement of a previously described multi-chamber microdevice dedicated to the application of cyclic strain to cell monolayers ( Ugolini et al., 2016 ). By adding a system for controlling oxygen changes, we significantly expanded the experimental complexity and mimicking capabilities of the device. We here finely controlled the applied mechanical strain and oxygen regimes sensed by CFs to model early environmental changes in cardiac injury and provide insights into individual or synergistic contributions of the environmental signals in the activation of early CF responses relevant to cardiac fibrotic disease. Shortly after an ischemic myocardial insult ( e. g., acute coronary artery occlusion ) tissue oxygen levels drop from approximately 5–6% O2 ( Gonschior et al., 1992; Sen et al., 2006; Winegrad et al., 1999 ) to near-zero ( Roy et al., 2003 ), rapidly inducing loss of cardiac myocytes contractility. In terms of in vitro model parameters, we thus selected 5% O2 ( PX ) as a physiological oxygen level and 1% O2 ( HX ) as an oxygen level characteristic of ischemic myocardial injury

When supply of oxygen and nutrients to the myocardium is critically reduced ( ischemia ), a complex tissue response takes place: within hours tissue necrosis and death of contractile cardiac myocytes occurs in the infarcted area giving rise to an inflammatory phase that recruits immune cells and activates quiescent cardiac fibroblasts ( CFs ) ; within a few days a proliferative phase begins, where activated CFs invade the infarcted area and contribute to degrading and replacing the extra-cellular matrix with a collagen-based scar; within weeks the maturation of the fibrotic scar is completed ( Frangogiannis, 2014; Heusch et al., 2014 ). Cellular and molecular events such as excessive proliferation of CFs, phenotypic switch of CFs, high levels of inflammatory cytokines and humoral factors, unbalanced synthesis of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins and matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) -mediated degradation of ECM are generally regarded as hallmarks of early fibrotic tissue response ( Fan et al., 2012; Krenning et al., 2010; Porter and Turner, 2009; Shinde and Frangogiannis, 2014 ). This essential process maintains tissue integrity, however, it often leads to excessive and adverse CFs remodeling of non-infarcted areas ( Fan et al., 2012; Kania et al., 2009; Talman and Ruskoaho, 2016 ) associated with cardiac dysfunction and increased mortality ( Okada et al., 2005 ). Controlled anti-fibrotic strategies still require deeper understanding and advanced in vitro models that recapitulate the early stages of fibic remodeling. Here, we describe an in vitro model of human cardiac fibroblasts ( CFs ) subjected to controlled mechanical strain and changes in oxygen tension to study the early responses of CFs to ischemic injury. Our results show that the combination of hypoxia and reduced contractility elicits inflammatory and fibrotic responses in CFs, while individual stimuli regulate proliferative and collagen-related responses. These findings have implications for future studies of myocardial remodeling and the in vitro model provides a tool for understanding pathological mechanisms and tailoring reparative strategies.

    Title: Drosophila SWR1 and NuA4 complexes are defined by DOMINO isoforms
    Abstract: Histone acetylation and deposition of H2A. Z variant are integral aspects of active transcription. In Drosophila, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities via an unknown mechanism. Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A. V ( the fly ortholog of H2A. Z ) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, like the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene.

   . C. The striking correlation between transcriptional responses upon TIP60 and DOM-A depletion suggests a unique association with functional relevance. Our mass-spectrometry analysis had identified several proteins that are homologous to corresponding subunits of the yeast NuA4 HAT complex. The core NuA4. C subunit EAF1 is a small protein with prominent N-terminal HSA and C-terminal SANT domains. DOM-A also features similarly arranged domains, but they are separated by the long ATPase domain ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ). This raises the question whether DOM-A might serve as the central subunit of a NuA4-type complex in Drosophila. The existence of such a complex with functional and structural similarity to the well-studied yeast complex has not been reported so far. Since NuA4. C is responsible for histone acetylation, we looked at H3 and H4 acetylation changes upon DOM isoform-specific knock-down by targeted mass-spectrometry. The hypothesis of a Drosophila NuA4. C poses the acetyltransferase TIP60 as the main effector of DOM-A. C. This is supported by the earlier finding that TIP60 is unstable in the absence of DOM-A ( Figure 2A ). We therefore included TIP60 knock-down for our targeted mass-spectrometry. Our analysis showed that RNAi against DOM-A, but not against DOM-B, specifically reduces H4K12ac ( average 28. 9% reduction ) and, to a lesser extent, H4K5ac ( average 23. 1% reduction ) ( Figure 4A, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ). Importantly, unsupervised clustering shows that depleting DOM-A or TIP60 lead to very similar changes in histone acetylation patterns: depletion of TIP60 also reduces H4K12ac, by on average 36. 3% and H4K5ac by 16. 4% ( Figure 4A, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ). Interestingly, we detected a decrease in monomethylation and increase of trimethylation at H3K27 by DOM depletion, a bit stronger for DOM-A or TIP60 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D )

. On the other hand, we discovered that DOM-A. C is not involved in bulk H2A. V incorporation, despite the presence of an ATPase domain and many shared subunits with DOM-B. C. Rather, we realized that DOM-A. C might be the ‘missing’ acetyltransferase NuA4. C of D. melanogaster, which specifically targets lysine 12 of histone H4 ( H4K12 ), the most abundant and yet uncharacterized H4 acetylation in flies ( Feller et al., 2015 ). Surprisingly, our data also suggest that the ATPase activity of DOM-A is dispensable for H4K12 acetylation by the DOM-A. C, a principle that might be conserved across metazoans. Our work illustrates how alternative splicing generates functional diversity amongst chromatin regulators.

. C subunits, additional interactors were found. Surprisingly, they showed similarity to components of a distinct yeast complex, the Nucleosome Acetyltransferase of H4 ( NuA4. C ) ( Kusch et al., 2004 ). NuA4. C is a histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) complex with the histone H4 N-terminal domain as a primary target ( Allard et al., 1999; Doyon et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2018a; Xu et al., 2016 ). The DOM complex ( DOM. C ) appeared then to be a chimera, a fusion between two complexes with different biochemical activities. It has been proposed that both enzymatic activities of DOM. C, histone acetylation and histone variant exchange, are required for H2A. V turnover during DNA damage response ( Kusch et al., 2004 ). It is unclear, however, if this model of DOM. C action could be generalized to other processes, such as transcription regulation. Furthermore, it is still not known how H2A. V is incorporated globally into chromosomes while, at the same time, enriched at promoters. It is long known that the dom transcripts are alternatively spliced to generate two major isoforms, DOM-A and DOM-B ( Ruhf et al., 2001 ). We and others previously found that the two splice variants play non-redundant, essential roles during development with interesting phenotypic differences ( Börner and Becker, 2016; Liu et al., 2019 ). In this work, we systematically characterized the molecular context and function of each DOM splice variant in D. melanogaster cell lines and assessed their contribution to the activity of the DOM. C in the context of transcription. We discovered the existence of two separate, isoform-specific complexes with characteristic composition. Both are involved in transcription regulation, but through different mechanisms. On the one hand, we found that the DOM-B. C is the main ATP-dependent remodeler for H2A. V, responsible for its deposition across the genome and specifically at active promoters

Nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin, are inherently stable and organized in polymeric fibers of variable compactness ( Baldi et al., 2018; Erdel and Rippe, 2018 ). The dynamic properties of the fiber required for gene regulation are implemented by several broad principles. ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling factors slide or evict nucleosomes ( Clapier et al., 2017 ), chemical modifications of histones create new interaction surfaces ( Bowman and Poirier, 2015; Zhao and Garcia, 2015 ) and histone variants furnish nucleosomes with special features ( Talbert and Henikoff, 2017 ). The very conserved H2A variant H2A. Z accounts for ~5–10% of the total H2A-type histone pool in vertebrates ( Redon et al., 2002; Thatcher and Gorovsky, 1994 ) and flies ( Bonnet et al., 2019 ). H2A. Z is primarily found at active promoters and enhancers, where it is thought to be important to regulate transcription initiation and early elongation ( Adam et al., 2001; Weber et al., 2010; Weber et al., 2014 ). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, H2A. Z is introduced into chromatin by the SWR1 complex ( SWR1. C ), a multi-subunit ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler with the INO80-type ATPase SWR1 at its core ( Mizuguchi et al., 2004; Ranjan et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2018a; Willhoft et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2005 ). In humans, the two SWR1 orthologs EP400 and SRCAP may also be involved in H2A. Z incorporation ( Greenberg et al., 2019; Pradhan et al., 2016 ). In Drosophila melanogaster, where H2A. Z is named H2A. V ( Baldi and Becker, 2013; van Daal and Elgin, 1992 ), only one gene codes for a SWR1 ortholog: domino ( dom ) ( Ruhf et al., 2001 ). The first biochemical characterization revealed the presence of a multi-subunit complex composed of 15 proteins associated with the DOM ATPase ( Kusch et al., 2004 ). While many of the interactors identified are orthologous to the yeast SWR1

. Taken together, these findings document the existence of two distinct DOM complexes: DOM-A. C and DOM-B. C. Previous observation in flies suggested that DOM-A and DOM-B have different, non-redundant functions during Drosophila development ( Bör and Becker,2016; Liu et al,2019 ). Here, we show that the two isoforms of the DOM nucleosome remodeling ATPase specify two multiunit complexes. Both are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. DOM-B C incorporates H2. V ( the fly orth of H2. Z ) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner like the SW1 complex. DOM-A, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetylase complex similar to the Nu4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H. Our work provides an example of how different strategies lead to similar functional separation in yeast and humans, nucleosome and histone acetylase complexes originate from duplication and paralog specification. Dophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing a single gene.

    Title: Slit2 as a β-catenin/Ctnnb1-dependent retrograde signal for presynaptic differentiation
    Abstract: Neuromuscular junction formation requires proper interaction between motoneurons and muscle cells. β-Catenin ( Ctnnb1 ) in muscle is critical for motoneuron differentiation; however, little is known about the relevant retrograde signal. In this paper, we dissected which functions of muscle Ctnnb1 are critical by an in vivo transgenic approach. We show that Ctnnb1 mutant without the transactivation domain was unable to rescue presynaptic deficits of Ctnnb1 mutation, indicating the involvement of transcription regulation. On the other hand, the cell-adhesion function of Ctnnb1 is dispensable. We screened for proteins that may serve as a Ctnnb1-directed retrograde factor and identified Slit2. Transgenic expression of Slit2 specifically in the muscle was able to diminish presynaptic deficits by Ctnnb1 mutation in mice. Slit2 immobilized on beads was able to induce synaptophysin puncta in axons of spinal cord explants. Together, these observations suggest that Slit2 serves as a factor utilized by muscle Ctnnb1 to direct presynaptic differentiation.

   . On the other hand, the cell-adhesion function of Ctnnb1 is dispensable. These results suggest that muscle Ctnnb1 is likely to regulate presynaptic differentiation by controlling the expression of muscle-derived proteins. This notion was supported by the observations that Ctnnb1 and Wnt signaling reporter were higher in synaptic nuclei at the NMJ than those in extra-synaptic areas. We reasoned that such a protein is secretable or has a transmembrane domain and its expression is down-regulated in Ctnnb1 mutant muscle. A screen for proteins that fulfill these criteria led to the identification of Slit2. We showed, first, that Ctnnb1 associates with Tcf/Lef cis-elements in the promoter region of the Slit2 gene. Second, Slit2 expression in muscle cells is promoted by elevating Ctnnb1. Slit2 was concentrated at the NMJ. Third, transgenic mice expressing Slit2 specifically in the muscle were able to diminish presynaptic deficits by Ctnnb1 mutation, including poor innervation, reduced vesicle density and active zone, and depressed mEPP. Finally, Slit2 immobilized on beads was able to induce the synaptophysin puncta of axons of spinal cord explants. Together, these observations suggest that Slit2 serves as a factor utilized by muscle Ctnnb1 to direct presynaptic differentiation. Slit2 is a member of the Slit family of secreted glycoproteins, which serve as repulsive cues for axons of various neurons ( Nguyen-Ba-Charvet et al., 2002; Shu et al., 2003; Marillat et al., 2004; Sabatier et al., 2004; Hussain et al., 2006 ), as regulators to promote axonal and dendritic branching ( Brose et al., 1999; Wang et al., 1999; Nguyen Ba-Charvet et al., 2001; Whitford et al., 2002; Miyashita et al., 2004 ), and as repellants for neuron migration ( Wu et al., 1999 ). A previous work showed that motor neurons use Slit2 to promote their axon fasciculation by an autocrine or juxtaparacrine mechanism ( Jaworski and Tessier-Lavigne, 2012 )

., 1999 ) and positively regulate motor axon fasciculation ( Jaworski and Tessier-Lavigne, 2012 ). Slit2 was able to induce clusters of synaptophysin in cultured neurons, suggesting a synaptogenic function. Expression of Slit2 specifically in muscle fibers was able to rescue NMJ deficits in Ctnnb1-mutant mice. These observations demonstrate that Ctnnb1 regulates presynaptic differentiation by a transcription-dependent mechanism and identify Slit2 as a novel retrograde factor in NMJ formation.

. In support of this notion are recent reports that expression of stable Ctnnb1 in muscle cells also impairs presynaptic differentiation in mutant mice ( Liu et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012a ). These observations suggest that Ctnnb1 in muscle is critical for a retrograde pathway to direct nerve terminal development. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The interaction of cadherins of pre- and post-synaptic membranes has been shown to be important for synapse formation ( Bamji et al., 2003; Bozdagi et al., 2004; Prakash et al., 2005 ) and synaptic plasticity ( Murase et al., 2002; Schuman and Murase, 2003; Nuriya and Huganir, 2006 ). NMDAR stimulation accumulates Ctnnb1 in spines, which in turn regulates induced endocytosis of N-cadherins ( Tai et al., 2007 ). These observations raise questions whether the muscle Ctnnb1 regulates presynaptic differentiation via cell adhesion-dependent signaling and/or gene-expression. In this paper, we determined which function of Ctnnb1 is required for NMJ formation by characterizing transgenic mice expressing wild-type or Ctnnb1 mutants that were impaired in transcriptional regulation or cell-adhesion signaling. Rescue experiments indicated a necessary role for the transcription activity of muscle Ctnnb1 in presynaptic differentiation. Our exploration of targets of Ctnnb1 as potential muscle-derived retrograde factors led to the identification of Slit2, an environmental cue that repels or collapses neuronal axons ( Brose et al., 1999; Kidd et al., 1999 ). Slit2 belongs to a family of large ECM ( extracellular matrix ) glycoproteins known to be chemorepellent for olfactory, motor, hippocampal, and retinal axons ( Nguyen Ba-Charvet et al., 1999; Erskine et al., 2000; Niclou et al., 2000; Ringstedt et al., 2000 ). However, Slit2 was also shown to stimulate the formation of axon collateral branches by dorsal root ganglia neurons ( Wang et al

. 05 in comparison with control; n = 17 ) ( Figure 2A, B ), demonstrating inability of the ΔTAD mutant to rescue and suggesting an important role of the transcription regulation in the retrograde pathway. Similarly, active zones were fewer in ACTA1-Ctnnb1−/− mice and ACTA1-Ctnnb1−/−::LSL-Ctnnb1∆TAD mice, compared with control mice, ACTA1-Ctnnb1−/−::LSL-Ctnnb1 mice, and ACTA1-Ctnnb1−/−::LSL-Ctnnb1TV-AA mice ( Figure 2A, C ). As reported previously ( Wu et al., 2012a ), Ctnnb1 mutation in muscles did not alter the number of terminals per NMJ and the width of synaptic clefts. Expression of Ctnnb1 wild type or mutants did not change these parameters ( Figure 2A, D, E ). These results are in agreement with the notion that muscle Ctnnb1 mainly regulates presynaptic differentiation. 10. 7554/eLife. 07266. 005Figure 2.

. In Slit2 mutant mice, motor nerves prematurely defasciculate into smaller bundlers in various muscles, unlike those in wild type that stay in compact fascicle until they reach the middle of muscle fibers. NMJ ( Figure 3 A ), B ). Slit mutant mice also showed reduced innervation of muscle fibers ( Figure 3 C ), D ). Slit mutant mice showed reduced vesicle density at the NMJ ( Figure 3 E, F ). Slit mutant showed depressed EPP ( Figure 3, G ). These results indicate that Sl2 is a retrograde factor for presynaptic differentiation. Sl2 is a member of the Slit family of secreted glyroteins that repel axons of various neurons ( Nguyen-Ba-Char et al,200; Shu et al,2003; Marat et al,2004; Sabier et,2004 Hussain et,2006 ) regulate axonal and dendritic branching ( Bro et al199; Wang et199; Nguyen-Char et200; Whitford et200; Miyita200 ) and repellent for neuron migration ( Wu et199 ). previous showed that motor neurons use Sl2 to promote axon fasculation by autocrine or juxtapacrine ( Jawors and Tess-Ligne2012 ) and regulate axon fasculation ( Jawors and Tessigne201 ) Sl2 was able to induce clusters of synophys in cultured neurons suggesting synaptogenic. Expression Sl2 in muscle fibers was able to rescue NM deficits in Ctn1mutant mice. These demonstrate thattn1 regulates presaptic differentiation by transcription-dependent mechanism and identify Sl2 as novel retrograde in NMJ formation.

    Title: Mapping the dynamics of force transduction at cell–cell junctions of epithelial clusters
    Abstract: Force transduction at cell-cell adhesions regulates tissue development, maintenance and adaptation. We developed computational and experimental approaches to quantify, with both sub-cellular and multi-cellular resolution, the dynamics of force transmission in cell clusters. Applying this technology to spontaneously-forming adherent epithelial cell clusters, we found that basal force fluctuations were coupled to E-cadherin localization at the level of individual cell-cell junctions. At the multi-cellular scale, cell-cell force exchange depended on the cell position within a cluster, and was adaptive to reconfigurations due to cell divisions or positional rearrangements. Importantly, force transmission through a cell required coordinated modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomyosin contractility in the cell and its neighbors. These data provide insights into mechanisms that could control mechanical stress homeostasis in dynamic epithelial tissues, and highlight our methods as a resource for the study of mechanotransduction in cell-cell adhesions.

   ., 2005 ), the force anchoring and scrambling mechanisms are likely more active, preventing force transmission to the center of the cluster, whereas on softer substrates such mechanisms are less active, allowing force propagation through the cluster center. Although it is yet unclear how substrate stiffness precisely regulates cell–matrix adhesions, the cytoskeletal network, and traction force exertion in cell clusters, it has been shown that the differences induced by substrate stiffness can extend multiple cell layers into a cell sheet ( Ng et al., 2012 ). Understanding how microenvironmental mechanical properties influence force transduction in epithelial cell groups may have implications not only for developmental processes but also for pathologies such as cancer where matrix stiffness is often altered ( Paszek et al., 2005 ). Lastly, our cell–cell force microscopy method allowed us to correlate, in quantitative terms, cell–cell force transmission to intracellular molecular dynamics. We showed that, at the sub-cellular level, the variations in junctional forces can be coupled to turnover of E-cadherin-GFP at the junctions. Future studies can apply the same approach for analyses of other cell–cell junction molecules, including known force-responsive proteins, such as alpha-catenin ( Yonemura et al., 2010 ), vinculin ( le Duc et al., 2010; Huveneers et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2013 ), and Eplin ( Abe and Takeichi, 2008; Taguchi et al., 2011 ). With temporal and spatial resolutions at both the sub-cellular and multi-cellular levels, our method represents a tested toolkit for systematic investigation of the complex force homeostatic mechanisms required for the maintenance of a stress-resistant tissue.

. This can be accomplished by spatially coordinating the activation of actomyosin contractility above basal force levels, which yields a significant force exchange between neighboring cells, or by spatially coordinating the de-activation of actomyosin contractility and/or cell–matrix adhesion, which may increase the transduction range of basal force levels beyond one cell diameter. The notion of active propagation of mechanical forces across tissues via spatial gradients in myosin-II activation is supported by studies of epithelial sheet migration ( Ng et al., 2012 ) and collective invasion of cancer cell clusters ( Hidalgo-Carcedo et al., 2011 ), in which an asymmetric distribution of actomyosin contractility promote cell cohesion. Based on our statistical analysis of over 90 cell clusters and over 250 cell–cell junctions in these clusters, it appeared that intercellular force transmission exhibits distinct spatial patterns in clusters cultured on soft vs stiff substrates, in which cell–cell forces are transmitted along cluster peripheral cells on stiff substrates, but through the cluster center on soft substrates ( Figure 7 ). We speculate that this may also be a result of the active interplay between cell–cell adhesions, cell–matrix adhesions, and basal actomyosin contractility to transmit, anchor, and scramble forces. As previously reported by the Dufresne group ( Mertz et al., 2012, 2013 ) and shown here in Figure 7 and Figure 8, focal adhesion numbers and traction force magnitudes are higher along the outer periphery of the cluster, suggesting that cell–cell forces are derived from cell–matrix forces that occur mainly at the cluster periphery. On stiffer substrates, where actomyosin contractility and traction force exertion are known to be high ( Discher et al

Using our generalized cell–cell force measurement and analysis method, we quantified, spatially and temporally, the transmission of mechanical forces through cell–cell junctions of dynamic adherent epithelial clusters. Combined with image analyses of cell–cell junction configurations and rearrangements in the living cell clusters, our data provided unprecedented statistical power and time resolution to address questions regarding force distributions and fluctuations within cell clusters, as well as their coupling to the recruitment of molecular components of adherens junctions ( Maruthamuthu et al., 2011 ). To our knowledge, the proposed method is the first to resolve cell–cell force transmission dynamically with sub-cellular resolution. Yet, there are limitations that need to be considered with re-implementations of the approach: first, our method relies on a simple thin-plate model of the cell cluster that assumes homogeneity in material property within the cluster. In reality, the mechanical properties of the cell cluster may not be linear and isotropic elastic, as there may be spatial heterogeneity arising from differences in sub-cellular structures and cellular contractility. The assumption of mechanical homogeneity has been made also in stress distribution analyses on an entire cell monolayer ( Tambe et al., 2013 ). In that case, the low spatial resolution tends to average inhomogeneity. The higher the resolution in imaging and the finer the spatial scale of the FEM analysis, the less likely is the cell cluster well represented by a thin-plate. How severe the resulting prediction error is depends on the cluster configuration and the noise level in the traction forces. In the present study, we validated the resolution of the inferred cell–cell forces by cross-correlation analysis of the spatial force fluctuations with E-cadherin density fluctuations along the junctions

. Our time-resolved force measurements demonstrated that cell–cell forces at individual junctions fluctuate over time, both during interphase and cell divisions. We thus investigated whether and how basal force variations were coupled to the localization and recruitment of the molecular components of cell–cell junctions. We focused first on E-cadherin, the backbone of adherens junctions for epithelial cells. We correlated the E-cadherin-GFP intensities integrated along each cell–cell junction with the force measured for each junction and observed a positive and statistically significant correlation ( Figure 5A ). The positive correlation also persisted on a stiffer matrix ( Figure 5A ), indicating that the overall relation between force exchange and E-cadherin recruitment is robust and independent of substrate compliance. We further validated the central role of cadherin proteins in mediating cell–cell force transmission by using function-blocking antibodies targeting E-cadherin directly ( Petrova et al., 2012 ) or by knock-down of alpha-catenin, an essential adaptor protein of cadherin-mediated adhesions ( Yonemura et al., 2010 ). Both perturbations resulted in a significant reduction in cell–cell force measurements ( Figure 5B–C ). These results support the model that the junctional recruitment of E-cadherin is coupled to the cell–cell adhesion forces ( Liu et al., 2010; Borghi et al., 2012 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 03282. 013Figure 5. Correlation of calculated cell–cell forces with E-cadherin-GFP junctional localization. ( A ) Correlation between E-cadherin-GFP intensity integrated along cell–cell interfaces and the corresponding interfacial force ( integrated force profile ), for cell clusters cultured on 8 kPa and 35 kPa substrates. Correlation coefficients were calculated from n measurements from N distinct cell–cell junctions pooled from multiple independent experiments. Plot displays only a subset of n measurements from one experiment

. We developed a method that utilizes high-resolution traction force microscopy ( TFM ) and time-lapse live cell microscopy to quantify cell–cell mechanical interactions in dynamic multi-cellular clusters, while maintaining the sub-cellular resolution needed to measure force exchange at the level of individual junctions. Our method expanded upon several pioneering studies, which inferred cell–cell force transmission from the regional imbalance of traction forces in cell pairs and three-cell clusters in linear configurations ( Liu et al., 2010; Maruthamuthu et al., 2011; McCain et al., 2012; Tseng et al., 2012 ), by now providing the time and sub-cellular resolution needed to derive the spatiotemporal coordination of force exchanges in larger cell groups as well as the coupling of force and protein dynamics at individual adherens junctions. To achieve reconstruction of forces at individual cell–cell junctions and in cell clusters of generic configurations, we incorporated the thin-plate modeling approach of cells and finite element analysis of the plate deformation that was developed by Tambe et al. ( 2013 ). This method assumes that the cell is a thin-plate with isotropic and homogeneous material properties, which is a simplification that has been used in stress analyses of entire monolayers ( Tambe et al. 2013 ). However, this simplification may not hold for cell clusters, which may have inhomogeneous material properties arising from subcellular structures and contractility. We validated our method by correlating cell–cell forces with Eadher-GFP intensity along junctions and observed a positive and significant correlation ( Figure 5 ). The correlation persisted on stiffer substrates ( Figure 5 ) indicating that the relation between force and Eadher recruitment is robust and independent of substrate compliance. We further validated the role of cadher proteins in mediating cell– force by function-blocking Ead antibodies ( Petrova et al 2012 ) or knockdown of alpha-caten ( Yemura et al 201 ). Both perturbations resulted in significant reduction in cell forces ( Figure 5–C ) supporting the model that junctional Eadher is coupled to cell forces ( Liu et al 201 ; Borghi et 2012 ).

    Title: Huntingtin’s spherical solenoid structure enables polyglutamine tract-dependent modulation of its structure and function
    Abstract: The polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin protein causes Huntington’s disease. Here, we investigated structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin and the effect of the polyglutamine expansion using various biophysical experiments including circular dichroism, single-particle electron microscopy and cross-linking mass spectrometry. Huntingtin is likely composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical α-helical solenoid where the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions fold to contain a circumscribed central cavity. Interestingly, we showed that the polyglutamine expansion increases α-helical properties of huntingtin and affects the intramolecular interactions among the domains. Our work delineates the structural characteristics of full-length huntingtin, which are affected by the polyglutamine expansion, and provides an elegant solution to the apparent conundrum of how the extreme amino-terminal polyglutamine tract confers a novel property on huntingtin, causing the disease.

    Supporting Text:
   ., 2009 ) and the polyglutamine expansion at the amino-terminal causes a trend of hypo-phosphorylation in all sites, including sites near the carboxyl-terminus ( Anne et al., 2007; Schilling et al., 2006; Warby et al., 2005 ), indirectly implying a long-range impact of the amino-terminal region on huntingtin structure and function. In order to solve the apparent puzzle of how huntingtin’s solenoid structure may enable quantitative or qualitative ( or both ) modulation of huntingtin function, according to the size of the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract, we have extended initial observations showing a likely flexible α-helical structure by conducting systematic biophysical and biochemical analyses of members of a panel of highly purified human recombinant huntingtins, with varied lengths of polyglutamine tracts ( Fodale et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2015; Li et al., 2006 ).

. Consistent with our data, particularly including long-range interaction affected by the polyglutamine expansion, a few studies previously implied and reported the global structural and functional influence by the polyglutamine tract size: the interaction with HAP40 at the extreme carboxyl-terminus of huntingtin was influenced by the polyglutamine expansion ( Pal et al., 2006 ) ; the proteolytically cleaved amino-terminal fragment interacted with the carboxyl-terminal fragment of huntingtin ( El-Daher et al., 2015 ) ; the proximity between the first 17 residues and the polyproline region has been shown to change by the polyglutamine tract size both in exon 1 fragment and endogenous full-length huntingtin ( Caron et al., 2013 ). Perhaps huntingtin binding involves internal surface features that are accessed by a spring-loaded action of the major hinge-region that entails the end-region contacts of each arm. Importin HEAT/HEAT-like solenoid proteins undergo substantial conformational change around a hinge-pivot region upon cargo binding ( Cingolani et al., 1999 ). The impact of the polyglutamine tract on huntingtin basic structural features strongly suggests that it is possible that huntingtin may also undergo dramatic conformational change upon interaction with its binding partners. The success of our structural analysis using an allelic series of huntingtins with different polyglutamine tract lengths suggests that this approach applied to high-resolution analyses will continue to yield insights into the huntingtin disease trigger-mechanism.

It has been reported previously that purified huntingtin exhibits a predominantly α-helical secondary structure but among studies the impact of polyglutamine size has been inconsistent ( Fodale et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2015; Li et al., 2006 ). To carry out a standardized evaluation, we performed circular dichroism ( CD ) analysis of a series of recombinant human huntingtins with different polyglutamine tract lengths ( Q2-, Q23-, Q46-, Q67-, Q78-huntingtin, respectively ) purified to homogeneity ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). The CD spectra ( Figure 1B ) of all of the huntingtins are consistent with a predominant α-helical secondary structure ( Liu and Rost, 2003; Rost et al., 1994 ) ( Figure 1A ), with typical minima at 222 and 208 nm and a positive peak at 195 nm, and all exhibited the same irreversible thermal denaturation pattern, with secondary structure stable up to ~38–40°C, a gradual slow denaturation as the temperature is increased to 65–70°C, followed by aggregation and some precipitation ( Figure 1C ). These results imply the same basic core structure and stability regardless of the size of the expanded polyglutamine segment. Plotting an average of the Mean Residue Ellipticity ( MRE ) at 222 nm ( characteristic of an α-helix ) reveals an incremental quantitative effect of lengthening the polyglutamine tract at the amino terminus on the α-helicity of the entire molecule ( Figure 1D ). 10. 7554/eLife. 11184. 003Figure 1. Huntingtin secondary structure is modulated by the length of polyglutamine tract. ( A ) Human huntingtin amino acid sequence ( Homo sapiens; NP_002102 ) was analyzed for predicted secondary structure using: NORSp ( Liu and Rost, 2003 ) and PROF ( Profile network prediction Heidelberg ) ( Rost et al., 1994 ). Stick model of human huntingtin protein ( 3144 amino acids ) was generated depicting the predicted alpha helical ( red ), random coil ( yellow ) and beta sheet ( grey ) regions

. Our biophysical analyses also provide basic insights for future higher-resolution studies that will be needed to more precisely delineate huntingtin structure and its modulation by the polyglutamine tract. The DSS-XL-MS intramolecular cross-linking data, together with our previously reported limited proteolysis analysis ( Seong et al., 2010 ) provide a general sense of how rod-like α-helical HEAT/HEAT-like repeat domains, may fold to delimit the closed shape that we observe. The pattern of proteolysis, regardless of polyglutamine tract length, revealed a single major cleavage-sensitive site at ~ residue 1200, strongly predicting a major hinge or pivot that roughly parses the protein into two nearly equal ‘arms’, a 150 kDa NTD and a 200 kDa CTD. This is supported by the patterns of short- and mid-range intramolecular DSS-XL-MS delineated intramolecular contacts that are shared by the Q23-, Q46- and Q78-huntingtin, which are mainly located within and between each of the regions that immediately flank this location, implying extensive local internal folding and close proximity of the ‘arms’ around the pivot-point. Multiple short- and mid-range interactions are also detected at the ends of the NTD-I and CTD-II. These contacts imply internal folding near the ends of each arm. Limited proteolysis of the amino-terminal domain did reveal an internal cleavage site, located at ~ residue 500, which is consistent with internal pivot points, along with other internal folding, that may explain the short- and mid-range contacts detected by XL-MS near the terminus. However, the carboxyl-terminal domain lacked internal cleavage-accessible sites ( Seong et al., 2010 ), implying a paucity of accessible hinge-points. Consistent with this, XL-MS fails to detect short- or mid-range cross-linked lysine residues in the sub-region spanning amino acids ~1800 to ~2300, except one long distance contact and one short distance contact only in Q46-huntingtin

Moreover, as expected, as the polyglutamine tract size was increased, the highly purified huntingtins exhibited decreasing mobility ( A ) and increasing detectability with polyglutamine-directed antibody mAb1F8 ( B ).

These were purified to high homogeneity using a gradient purification method with mild crosslinking ( GraFix ) ( Kastner et al., 2008 ), collecting only the monomer fraction for analysis to eliminate potential contributions from oligomeric structures that would confound interpretation of the results ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). Negative-stained micrographs of these proteins confirmed that the samples were highly homogeneous ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ). A total of 10, 169 particles were chosen for generating 2D class averages and 30 class averages were used for reconstructing a 3D EM map of Q23-huntingtin ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3A ). The EM map of Q23-huntingtin at about 30 Å resolution ( Figure 2A ) shows a spherical solen structure with a diameter of ~100 nm and a central cavity of ~20 nm in diameter. The map of Q78-hunting at 25 Å resolution ( Figure 2B ) is similar to that of Q23-hunting but with a larger diameter of ~110 nm and a cavity of ~25 nm diameter. The map of Q-hunting at 25 Å ( Figure 2C ) is also spherical with a diameter of ~120nm and a cavity of ~30 nm diameter. The maps of Q-hunting and Q-hunting are consistent with the αelical structure predicted by CD ( Figure 1 ). The maps of Q-hunting and Q-hunting are consistent with the αical structure predicted by CD ( Figure 1 ).

    Title: Ferritinophagy via NCOA4 is required for erythropoiesis and is regulated by iron dependent HERC2-mediated proteolysis
    Abstract: NCOA4 is a selective cargo receptor for the autophagic turnover of ferritin, a process critical for regulation of intracellular iron bioavailability. However, how ferritinophagy flux is controlled and the roles of NCOA4 in iron-dependent processes are poorly understood. Through analysis of the NCOA4-FTH1 interaction, we demonstrate that direct association via a key surface arginine in FTH1 and a C-terminal element in NCOA4 is required for delivery of ferritin to the lysosome via autophagosomes. Moreover, NCOA4 abundance is under dual control via autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system. Ubiquitin-dependent NCOA4 turnover is promoted by excess iron and involves an iron-dependent interaction between NCOA4 and the HERC2 ubiquitin ligase. In zebrafish and cultured cells, NCOA4 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation. This work reveals the molecular nature of the NCOA4-ferritin complex and explains how intracellular iron levels modulate NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in cells and in an iron-dependent physiological setting.

   ., 2007 ) ; however, additional studies show that ferritin-sequestered iron is also utilized for heme synthesis ( Vaisman et al., 1997 ). Here, we use in-depth biochemical and cell culture studies, as well as the zebrafish system to dissect the roles of NCOA4, Ferritin, and HERC2 in mediating ferritinophagy and the role of ferritinophagy in erythropoiesis. We show that NCOA4 interacts directly with FTH1 via a conserved NCOA4 C-terminal domain and a key conserved residue on FTH1. Mutation at these binding sites abrogates binding in vivo and abolishes ferritinophagy. We show that the HERC2 ligase uses its ‘CUL7-homology domain’ to recognize NCOA4 under high iron conditions to mediate NCOA4 turnover via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, thereby reducing the steady-state NCOA4 levels and increasing ferritin for iron capture. Surprisingly, we find that this same C-terminal domain within NCOA4 binds iron and the iron-bound state of NCOA4 determines HERC2 binding, suggesting an iron-dependent switch in NCOA4 turnover. Finally, we show that NCOA4 is important for erythropoiesis in vivo given its role in mobilizing iron from ferritin for use in heme synthesis. This study establishes the importance of NCOA4 as a critical regulator of cellular and organismal iron metabolism and reveals the mechanistic underpinnings of its iron-dependent regulation.

., 2014; Galligan et al., 2015 ). Intriguingly, HERC2 associates with the SCFFBLX5 ubiquitin ligase ( Tan et al., 2013 ) and has recently been implicated in the basal turnover of FBXL5 ( Moroishi et al., 2014 ), a key iron-sensing protein that promotes turnover of the ferritin translational repressor IRP2 ( Iron Regulatory Protein 2, also known as IREB2 ) when iron is high ( Salahudeen et al., 2009; Vashisht et al., 2009 ). However, the precise role that HERC2, iron, and the ubiquitin system play in regulating NCOA4, and how this is related to NCOA4 autophagic turnover during ferritinophagy remains unexplored. Third, what is the physiological role of NCOA4 in cellular processes that are highly dependent upon iron availability? Initial links between NCOA4 and processes with a requirement for high iron availability come from expression studies where ncoa4 mRNA is high at sites of erythropoiesis during zebrafish development ( Weber et al., 2005 ). Moreover, recent transcriptomic analysis shows significant upregulation of NCOA4 at the orthochromatic erythroblast stage of erythroid differentiation in humans, the stage associated with massive heme and hemoglobin synthesis, a highly iron dependent process ( An et al., 2014 ). Prior studies have demonstrated defects in erythroid differentiation upon deletion of canonical autophagy genes ( Cao et al., 2015 ) ; however, these studies focused on an inability to clear mitochondria during erythroid maturation due to dysfunctional mitophagy ( Mortensen et al., 2010; Li-Harms et al., 2015 ). While it is clear that iron obtained via holo-transferrin endocytosis is used for heme synthesis during erythroid differentiation, there is debate as to the intracellular itinerary of this iron once liberated from transferrin ( Lane et al., 2015 ). There is evidence that transferrin-liberated endosomal iron is transferred directly to mitochondria ( Sheftel et al

. We previously noted that NCOA4 levels are altered by iron status; when iron is high, NCOA4 abundance is low thereby promoting ferritin accumulation, and when iron is low, NCOA4 levels are high, thereby promoting ferritinophagy ( Mancias et al., 2014 ). We noted that previous interaction proteomics revealed the large HECT E3 ligase HERC2 as a high confidence NCOA4 interacting protein ( Mancias et al., 2014 ). We hypothesized that HERC2 may regulate NCOA4 levels via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Indeed, previous proteomics experiments identified multiple ubiquitylation sites on NCOA4 ( Kim et al., 2011; Dowdle et al., 2014 ). We further reasoned that the iron-dependent regulation of NCOA4 levels may be a result of iron-dependent recognition of NCOA4 by HERC2. Therefore we first examined the binding of endogenous HERC2 to NCOA4 in cells under iron replete and deficient conditions. Cells were treated with iron chelator ( DFO ), or loaded with excess iron ( FAC ) followed by HERC2 or NCOA4 immunoprecipitation ( IP ). Immunoblot analysis of endogenous NCOA4 revealed an interaction with HERC2 under basal cell culture conditions where iron is replete and that this interaction was enhanced under excess iron conditions. Conversely, HERC2 binding to NCOA4 was severely attenuated following iron chelation ( Figure 3A ). We also examined endogenous HERC2 binding to stably expressed NCOA4-FLAG-HA ( CTAP ) tagged protein under iron replete and deficient conditions. Immunoblot analysis of endogenous HERC2 revealed an interaction in iron replete and excess iron conditions, while HERC2 binding to NCOA4 was attenuated following iron chelation ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ). 10. 7554/eLife. 10308. 007Figure 3.

., 2014 ). While FTL mRNA remains within the top 25 mRNAs expressed throughout all terminal erythroid differentiation steps, FTH1 mRNA peaks at the final two stages ( polychromatic erythroblast and orthochromatic erythroblast ). As NCOA4 specifically recognizes FTH1 and not FTL, this could suggest that during erythroid development there is a switch in the composition of ferritin complexes from predominantly FTL favoring storage of iron to a mix of FTH1-FTL. At later stages when iron is required for heme biosynthesis, NCOA4 could then more efficiently and with better kinetics target for degradation ferritin complexes with this higher FTH1-FTL ratio. The modulation of NCOA4 transcript levels during erythroid differentiation suggests an additional layer of regulation of NCOA4 at the transcriptional level that we do not yet understand beyond the post-translational roles of HERC2 and autophagy. The recent results from Dowdle et al. support the role of NCOA4 in maintaining iron homeostasis in vivo as ncoa4 knockout led to inappropriate accumulation of iron in mouse splenic macrophages ( Dowdle et al., 2014 ). The authors do not specifically note a defect in erythropoiesis in their mice; however, as splenic macrophages play an important role in turnover of senescent red blood cells and a role in maintaining erythropoiesis during pathological erythropoiesis states, this suggests some defect in erythropoiesis for which splenic macrophages may be compensating ( Ramos et al., 2013 ). On the other hand, the role of NCOA4 in erythropoiesis could be limited to the setting of embryonic development and stress erythropoiesis which our zebraf model does not recapitulate. In conclusion, this study reveals the molecular basis of the NCO4-ferr complex and how intracellular iron modulates NCO4-mediated ferritinagy in an iron-dependent setting. We show that NCO4 interacts with F1 via a conserved C-terminal domain and conserved residue on F1 and that HER2 ubiquitin ligase uses its C-homology domain to recognize N4 under high iron to mediate N4 turnover via the ubiqu-proteome thereby reducing steady-state N4 levels and ferritin for capture. We also show that N4 is important for erythropies in vivo given its role in mobilizing iron from ferritin for heme synthesis.

    Title: The hierarchical organization of the lateral prefrontal cortex
    Abstract: Higher-level cognition depends on the lateral prefrontal cortex ( LPFC ), but its functional organization has remained elusive. An influential proposal is that the LPFC is organized hierarchically whereby progressively rostral areas of the LPFC process/represent increasingly abstract information facilitating efficient and flexible cognition. However, support for this theory has been limited. Here, human fMRI data revealed rostral/caudal gradients of abstraction in the LPFC. Dynamic causal modeling revealed asymmetrical LPFC interactions indicative of hierarchical processing. Contrary to dominant assumptions, the relative strength of efferent versus afferent connections positioned mid LPFC as the apex of the hierarchy. Furthermore, cognitive demands induced connectivity modulations towards mid LPFC consistent with a role in integrating information for control operations. Moreover, the strengths of these dynamics were related to trait-measured higher-level cognitive ability. Collectively, these results suggest that the LPFC is hierarchically organized with the mid LPFC positioned to synthesize abstract and concrete information to control behavior.

    Supporting Text:
    We examined interactions within the LPFC by varying demands on stimulus domain and cognitive control. Collectively, these demands engaged most of LPFC providing the opportunity for a comprehensive account of its function. We found that progressively rostral areas processed progressively abstract levels of cognitive control with demands on Feature Control, Contextual Control, and Temporal Control eliciting increasingly rostral activations. Moreover, stimulus domain-sensitivity was present in caudal and mid LPFC, but not in rostral LPFC consistent with abstract processing in rostral areas. Correlations between neural activation and behavioral performance revealed that caudal LPFC varied linearly with demands on current processing, while rostral LPFC varied linearly with demands on future processing. Both relationships were present in the mid LPFC, indicating a potential zone where current and future processing converges. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that hierarchical asymmetries in connectivity were strongest in mid LPFC. Furthermore, cognitive demands elicited both top-down influences from rostral to mid LPFC and bottom-up influences from caudal to mid LPFC. Thus, analyses of effective connectivity and its modulations suggest that mid LPFC forms a nexus where information converges to influence action. Finally, both the hierarchical orientation of the mid LPFC in fixed connectivity, and the top-down influences from rostral LPFC to mid LPFC during the engagement of cognitive control were positively related to higher-level cognitive ability. Hence, the functional organization of the LPFC is intimately tied to cognitive capacity. A matter of debate is whether or not processing in the LPFC is hierarchical. From a computational perspective, hierarchical processing is advantageous ( Botvinick and Weinstein, 2014; Solway et al., 2014 ), although relating such processing advantages to the LPFC has been challenging

The prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) is central to higher-level cognition. Damage to the PFC produces severe deficits in goal-directed cognition ( Luria, 1966; Damasio and Anderson, 1993; Lhermitte, 1986 ) and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the involvement of the PFC across a wide range of tasks ( Duncan and Owen, 2000; Niendam et al., 2012 ). Despite its ubiquitous influence, mechanistic insight into PFC function has remained difficult. Progress towards understanding PFC function has been made through the development of organizing principles that describe gradients of function across the full extent of PFC. A prominent organizing principle is that the rostral/caudal axis of the lateral PFC ( LPFC ) is structured according to the level of cognitive control ( Fuster, 1997; Koechlin et al., 2003; Koechlin and Summerfield, 2007; Badre, 2008; Badre and D'Esposito, 2007; 2009 ). Mounting evidence from neuroimaging and lesion studies suggests that progressively rostral areas perform progressively higher levels of cognitive control through processing increasingly abstract representations ( Koechlin et al., 2003; Badre, 2008; Badre and D'Esposito, 2007; 2009; Koechlin and Jubault, 2006; Nee and Brown, 2012; 2013; Koechlin et al., 1999; Bahlmann et al., 2014; Azuar et al., 2014 ). This organization enables the LPFC to control behavior across multiple timescales including adapting actions according to the prevailing context, and aligning behaviors with longer-term goals and plans ( Fuster, 2001; 2008 ). While differentiating the functional sensitivities of sub-regions of the LPFC is an important first step, mechanistic insight into how the LPFC supports goal-directed cognition requires understanding intercommunication among LPFC sub-regions. To this end, it has been proposed that the LPFC is organized hierarchically such that more rostral areas exert asymmetrically greater influence upon more caudal areas ( Badre and D'Esposito, 2009 )

. While it has been well-documented that top-down influences from the LPFC to posterior areas of cortex are important for working memory, sustained attention, mitigating distraction, and a variety of other cognitive abilities ( D'Esposito and Postle, 2015; Gazzaley and Nobre, 2012 ), the relationship between top-down control within the LPFC and such higher-level cognitive processes has been less well studied. Our data suggest that top-down control within the LPFC is an important determinant of higher-level cognitive function. Furthermore, we found that more strongly asymmetrical hierarchical projections from mid LPFC to other LPFC regions were related to better higher-level cognitive ability. This suggests a beneficial cognitive effect of a hierarchical organization with mid LPFC at the apex. The term 'hierarchy' is typically used to describe dominance relationships. Accordingly, we have attempted to operationalize such dominance relationships by reasoning that greater outward relative to inward connectivity reflects larger influence of one region over another. Such rationale has been used previously ( Badre and D'Esposito, 2009; Goulas et al., 2014 ). However, different definitions of hierarchy may lead to different assignments of rank among the LPFC. For example, hierarchy may be defined by temporal control, with higher levels organizing behavior over broader timescales ( Koechlin et al., 1999; 2003 ). Alternatively, hierarchy could be defined by modulations of influence as a result of cognitive demands. Such relationships are typified by the top-down biasing that LPFC exerts over posterior areas during difficult selections ( Miller and Cohen, 2001 ). These various definitions lead to different rank orderings in our data

. 00, p<0. 0005; RT: F ( 1, 23 ) = 87. 05, p<10–8 ), and their interaction ( ER: F ( 1, 23 ) = 19. 18, p<0. 0005; RT: F ( 1, 23 ) = 10. 24, p<0. 005 ). Again, no effects of Stimulus Domain were observed ( ER and RT all p>0. 05 ). These analyses confirm the effective manipulation of cognitive control demands, but equivalent loadings of control demands across stimulus domain. To verify the expected rostral/caudal gradient by cognitive control in the LPFC, fMRI data from the epoch of the sub-tasks ( see Materials and methods for full modeling details ) were analyzed with a 2 x 2 x 2 ANOVA. Here, we focus on the effects of cognitive control ( Figure 3 ), while the effects of Stimulus Domain are depicted in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. The main effect of Temporal Control produced activations across the rostral-most aspects of the LPFC, mostly within the lateral frontopolar cortex ( FPl; putative area 10 ) and mid-middle frontal gyrus ( MFG; putative area 9/46 ), also spanning orbitofrontal cortex and pars orbitalis ventrally, through rostral-MFG ( rMFG; putative area 46 ) laterally, up to the superior frontal gyrus dorsally. Previous studies have suggested that rostral LPFC is engaged as difficulty is increased regardless of functional demands ( Crittenden and Duncan, 2014; Fedorenko et al., 2013 ). Notably, the main effect of Temporal Control in the present design includes both the easiest condition ( Delay ) and hardest condition ( Dual ). The rostral LPFC was engaged considering each condition in isolation ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ), ruling out the possibility that activations in this area are attributable to difficulty. The main effect of Contextual Control was most pronounced in mid-lateral areas including the inferior frontal sulcus ( IFS; putative area 45 or 9/46v ) extending into pars triangularis ventrally, and the caudal middle frontal gyrus ( cMFG; putative area 8Ar or 9/46d ) dorsally

. Hierarchical processing confers substantial computational efficiency and flexibility ( Botvinick and Weinstein, 2014; Duncan, 2013; Solway et al., 2014 ), and such processing in the LPFC could explain the massive propensity for higher-level cognition. However, evidence for hierarchical processing in the LP has been limited. Our results suggest that the LPFC is hierarchically organized with the midLP positioned at the apex of the hierarchy. The midLP is a nexus where information converges to influence action. The LPFC is central to higher-level cognition, but mechanistic insight into its function has remained elusive. Our data suggest that the LP is hierarchically organized with the midLP positioned at the apex of the hierarchy. The midLP is a nexus where information converges to action. The LP is central to higher-level cognition but mechanistic insight into its function has remained. Our data suggest the LP is hierarchically organized with midLP at the apex.

    Title: The hominoid-specific gene TBC1D3 promotes generation of basal neural progenitors and induces cortical folding in mice
    Abstract: Cortical expansion and folding are often linked to the evolution of higher intelligence, but molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cortical folding remain poorly understood. The hominoid-specific gene TBC1D3 undergoes segmental duplications during hominoid evolution, but its role in brain development has not been explored. Here, we found that expression of TBC1D3 in ventricular cortical progenitors of mice via in utero electroporation caused delamination of ventricular radial glia cells ( vRGs ) and promoted generation of self-renewing basal progenitors with typical morphology of outer radial glia ( oRG ), which are most abundant in primates. Furthermore, down-regulation of TBC1D3 in cultured human brain slices decreased generation of oRGs. Interestingly, localized oRG proliferation resulting from either in utero electroporation or transgenic expression of TBC1D3, was often found to underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding. Thus, we have identified a hominoid gene that is required for oRG generation in regulating the cortical expansion and folding.

    Supporting Text:
    In this study, we found a remarkable effect of the hominoid-specific gene TBC1D3 in promoting the generation of oRG cells in mice with a high proliferative ability previously observed in primates. Importantly, this oRG generation is accompanied by the appearance of cortical folding. Furthermore, we elucidated the cellular mechanisms underlying the generation of proliferative oRG cells by showing that TBC1D3 expresssion caused increased delamination of VZ neuroprogenitors via down-regulation of N-cadherin, and elevated proliferative ability of BPs is accompanied by a reduced expression of Trnp1 and likely involves Ras-ERK signaling cascade. These effects together resulted in the expansion and dispersion of BPs, giving rise to increased number of newborn neurons and leading to cortical folding ( for model see Figure 7J ). In small rodents, RGs in the VZ and IPs in the SVZ are two major cell types responsible for cortex development. However, amplification of VZ progenitors via overexpression of β-catenin in the mouse brain led to the folding of the ventricular rather than cortical surface ( Chenn and Walsh, 2002 ), and amplification of IPs only increased the brain size without inducing cortical folding in mice ( Nonaka-Kinoshita et al., 2013 ). Recent studies have established the association between the relative abundance of oRG and the degree of cortical folding in various species ( Betizeau et al., 2013; Hansen et al., 2010; Reillo et al., 2011; Shitamukai et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011 ). In the present study, we showed that increased population of oRG in mice is accompanied with cortical fold formation, supporting the critical role of highly proliferative oRG in cortical expansion and gyrification in primates. It is postulated that oRG cells are derived from the ventricular RGs, presumably requiring delamination from apical anchoring ( Borrell and Gotz, 2014 )

. Multiple genes underlying different or shared cellular processes associated with neurogenesis may all contribute in part to the formation of cortical folding and gyrification found in primates. Thus, it would be of great interest to elucidate gene expression networks related with TBC1D3 expression. Identification of the ‘hub’ genes of such networks may further clarify the role of TBC1D3 in the cytoarchitectural development on the cortex. This study provides proof-of-concept that the brain development can be regulated by duplicated genes during hominoid evolution.

. In particular, duplication of specific genes in humans may be responsible for the marked increase in cortical folding. The TBC1D3 gene is derived from a segmental duplication, with multiple copies present in the human chromosome 17 and present in the chimpanzee genome as a single copy gene ( but absent in other species ) ( Hodzic et al., 2006; Pei et al., 2002; Perry et al., 2008; Zody et al., 2006 ). Indeed, TBC1D3 corresponds to one of the core duplicons that have been implicated in the expansion of intrachromosomal segmental duplications during hominoid evolution ( Jiang et al., 2007 ). Because the timing of origination and amplification of the TBC1D3 gene is consistent with the evolutionary divergence of primates ( Perry et al., 2008; Stahl and Wainszelbaum, 2009 ), we decided to explore its role in brain development by expressing this gene in mice. We found TBC1D3 expression markedly elevated the generation and proliferation of BPs and resulted in extensive cortex folding in the mouse brain, and further delineated the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying its action. Furthermore, TBC1D3 is essential for the generation of BPs in cultured developing human brain slices. The transgenic mice generated in this study may provide a feasible model to link cortical folding to higher brain functions.

It is generally assumed that the expansion of the mammalian neocortex during evolution correlates with the increase in intelligence, and this process involves increased production of cortical neurons, resulting from an extended neurogenic period as well as increased proliferative ability of neural stem cells and progenitors ( Geschwind and Rakic, 2013; Lui et al., 2011; Sun and Hevner, 2014; Zilles et al., 2013 ). To fit into a limited cranium, expanded cortical surfaces are folded to form gyri and sulci. Recent cross-species studies have shown the emergence of an outer subventricular zone ( OSVZ ) in the primate cortex, consisting of a massive pool of proliferating basal progenitors ( BPs ) and post-mitotic neurons ( Betizeau et al., 2013; Fietz et al., 2010; Hansen et al., 2010; Reillo et al., 2011; Smart et al., 2002 ). Unlike the neuroepithelia-derived ventricular radial glial cells, which undergo repeated and typically asymmetric cell division at the apical surface of the ventricular zone, the BPs, after delamination from the apical surface, translocate to the SVZ, where they exhibit symmetric or asymmetric divisions. In primates, the recently identified outer ( basal ) radial glia ( referred to as oRG or bRG ) and the intermediate progenitors ( IPs ) in the OSVZ, which can undergo multiple rounds of symmetric or asymmetric divisions ( Betizeau et al., 2013; Hansen et al., 2010 ), are two major forms of BPs. By contrast, the IPs and minimal oRG cells in the mouse SVZ usually exhibit final division to generate a pair of post-mitotic neurons ( Shitamukai et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011 ). The radial and lateral expansion of BPs is thought to be a main cause of cortical folding of gyrencephalic species ( Fietz and Huttner, 2011; Fietz et al., 2010; Hansen et al., 2010; Lewitus et al., 2014; Lui et al., 2011; Reillo et al., 2011 )

., 2004; Katayama et al., 2011; Rasin et al., 2007 ), without disrupting the junction integrity of the VZ as revealed by actin filaments ( F-actin ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). Observation in the SVZ and intermediate zone ( IZ ) of E16. 5 mice ( electroporated at E13. 5 ) showed that delaminated TBC1D3-expressing cells often exhibited clustered distribution by forming vertical column-like structures ( Figure 1E ), reminiscent of ontogenic radial units ( Rakic, 1988 ), expansion of which has been proposed to underlie cortical folding ( Borrell and Gotz, 2014; Florio and Huttner, 2014; Lui et al., 2011; Rakic, 1988 ). This column-like aggregation of basal cells induced by TBC1D3 expression may result from increased number of proliferating cells originated from VZ ( see below ), and leads to lateral heterogeneity in the rate of neuronal production that may contribute to cortical folding. Previous studies have shown that disruption of AJs due to the loss of RhoA in neural progenitors is accompanied by an elevated proliferation of neuroprogenitors ( Katayama et al., 2011 ). We thus examine the effect of TBC1D3 expression via in utero electroporation on neuroprogenitor proliferation by calculating the proportion of cells in S phase, as assayed by the incorporation of pyrimidine analog bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) for 2 hr before sacrificing the electroporated mice ( Figure 2A, B ). We found that TBC1D3 expression caused an increase in BrdU-positive ( BrdU+ ) proliferating cells, as compared to controls ( Figure 2C ), indicating increased proliferation of neuroprogenitors in the ventricular zone. This increase in neuroproliferation was accompanied by downregulation of N-catenin ( Figure 2D ), which is a key component of adherens junctions (AJs ) that maintain the integrity of the VZ ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). The downregulation of N-caten in T1D3-expressing neuroproitors is consistent with disruption of AJs ( Figure 1— supplement 2 ) and delamination of neuroproitors ( Figure 1E ). Furthermore, T1D-expressing neuroproitors exhibited elevated expression of B ( Figure 2 ), which is involved in the Ras-ERK signaling pathway ( Figure 1— supplement 3 ) that promotes cell cycle progression and proliferation ( Figure 1— supplement 3 ). The elevated B in T1-expressing neuroitors was accompanied by reduced expression of Trnp1 ( Figure 2 ), which is a negative regulator of the Ras-ER pathway ( Figure 1— supplement 3 ). These changes in T1-express neuroitors resulted in increased proliferative ability ( Figure 2 ) and expansion of the number of newborn neurons ( Figure 3 ), leading to cortical folding ( model see Figure 7 ). The increased proliferation of T1-express neuroitors in the VZ is consistent with previous studies showing that amplification of V progenitors via overexpression βaten in the mouse led to folding of the ventricular rather than cortical surface ( Chenn and Walsh,2002 ) and amplification of IPs increased brain size without cortical folding in mice ( Nonaka-Koshita et al,201 ). In contrast, our study shows that amplification of V progenitors via overexpression T1 resulted in cortical folding, not ventricular ( Figure 7 ). The increased number of newborn neurons resulting from T1-express neuroitors in the VZ is consistent with previous studies showing that amplification of IPs increased brain size without cortical folding ( Nonaka-Kosh et al,201 ) and amplification V progenitors overexpression βaten led to folding of ventricular ( Ch and Walsh,200 ).

    Title: Dynamic ubiquitination determines transcriptional activity of the plant immune coactivator NPR1
    Abstract: Activation of systemic acquired resistance in plants is associated with transcriptome reprogramming induced by the unstable coactivator NPR1. Immune-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NPR1 are thought to facilitate continuous delivery of active NPR1 to target promoters, thereby maximising gene expression. Because of this potentially costly sacrificial process, we investigated if ubiquitination of NPR1 plays transcriptional roles prior to its proteasomal turnover. Here we show ubiquitination of NPR1 is a progressive event in which initial modification by a Cullin-RING E3 ligase promotes its chromatin association and expression of target genes. Only when polyubiquitination of NPR1 is enhanced by the E4 ligase, UBE4, it is targeted for proteasomal degradation. Conversely, ubiquitin ligase activities are opposed by UBP6/7, two proteasome-associated deubiquitinases that enhance NPR1 longevity. Thus, immune-induced transcriptome reprogramming requires sequential actions of E3 and E4 ligases balanced by opposing deubiquitinases that fine-tune activity of NPR1 without strict requirement for its sacrificial turnover.

    The ubiquitin-mediated proteasome system plays vital roles in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression, in large part by controlling the abundance of transcriptional regulators. Paradoxically, proteasome-dependent instability of selected potent eukaryotic transcriptional activators is necessary for the expression of their target genes. It is thought that their transcription-coupled degradation ensures the target promoter is continuously supplied with fresh activators that reinitiate transcription, thereby maximising gene expression ( Geng et al., 2012; Kodadek et al., 2006 ). However, this sacrificial process is energy-expensive ( Collins and Goldberg, 2017; Peth et al., 2013 ), raising a dilemma of why such mechanisms evolved to regulate transcriptional activators. Our study on the immune coactivator NPR1, however, indicates that ubiquitin chain extension and trimming activities can fine-tune transcriptional outputs of unstable eukaryotic activators without strict requirement for sacrificial turnover. We discovered that ubiquitination of NPR1 is a stepwise event, requiring the actions of CRL3 and the E4 ligase UBE4. In resting cells, CRL3-mediated turnover of NPR1 is important for preventing autoimmunity in absence of pathogen threat ( Spoel et al., 2009 ). The NPR1-dependent autoimmune phenotype of ube4 mutants is reminiscent of that observed in cul3a cul3b mutants ( Figure 1 ) ( Spoel et al., 2009 ), suggesting that in addition to CRL3 ligase, UBE4 is required to clear NPR1 from the nucleus and prevent untimely activation of immunity. In presence of SA, however, CRL3-mediated ubiquitination induced NPR1 coactivator activity, whereas formation of polyubiquitin chains by UBE4 blocked its activity and ultimately led to proteasome-mediated turnover ( Figures 2 and 3 ). Rather than initiating substrate ubiquitination, E4 ligases are thought to extend existing ubiquitin chains ( Crosas et al., 2006; Koegl et al

. Instead, initial ubiquitination boosts NPR1 transcriptional coactivator activity, at least in part by enhancing target promoter occupancy in the short term and potentially also by promoting genomic mobility of NPR1 in the longer term ( Figure 3 ). Although it remains unclear if CRL3 adds only monoubiquitin or generates short chains shy of tetraubiquitin, the minimal signal required for proteasome recognition ( Thrower et al., 2000 ), progression to polyubiquitin chain formation by UBE4 results in transcriptional shut down as polyubiquitinated NPR1 still occupied target promoters but lacked transcriptional potency ( Figure 6D and F ). This type of stepwise ubiquitination may be a general mechanism to control unstable transcriptional ( co ) activators in eukaryotes. For example, multi-monoubiquitination of the oncogenic growth coactivator SRC-3 results in its transcriptional activation, while subsequent chain extension targets it for degradation, but E4 ligases have not yet been implicated. We propose here that stepwise ubiquitination established by the sequential actions of E3 and E4 ligases may generate a transcriptional timer that controls the activity and lifetime of unstable ( co ) activators ( Figure 7 ). The complexity of the ubiquitin-dependent transcriptional timer was further revealed by the identification of UBP6 and UBP7 that deubiquitinated NPR1, thereby regulating its transcriptional activity and lifetime ( Figures 5 and 6 ). Several unstable mammalian transcription activators, including p53 and the immune activator NF-κB, are also regulated by diverse DUBs ( Colleran et al., 2013; Pant and Lozano, 2014; Schweitzer and Naumann, 2015 ). In these cases DUBs promote transcription by stabilising p53 and NF-κB at their target promoters. For example, loss of USP7-mediated deubiquitination of NF-κB resulted in increased turnover and decreased promoter occupancy of NF-κB ( Colleran et al., 2013 )

., 2006; Koegl et al., 1999 ), thereby determining substrate commitment to proteasome-mediated degradation and contributing to proteasome processivity ( Aviram and Kornitzer, 2010; Koegl et al., 1999 ). Functionally these enzymes are emerging as important players in limiting the activity of NLR immune receptors as well as potent eukaryotic transcriptional regulators. Arabidopsis UBE4/MUSE3 works in concert with a CRL1/SCFCPR1 ligase to regulate stability of the intercellular immune receptors SNC1 and RPS2 that recognise pathogen invasion ( Cheng et al., 2011; Gou et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2014 ). Taken together with our finding that UBE4 acts in concert with CRL3 ( Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ), this suggests a single E4 enzyme may assist in diverse ubiquitin-mediated pathways controlled by different E3 ligases. The role of Arabidopsis UBE4 in ubiquitination and degradation of NPR1 are reminiscent of stepwise ubiquitination of the mammalian tumour suppressor p53, a potent transcriptional activator of genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence. The stability of p53 is regulated by amongst others the E3 ligase MDM2 ( or HDM2 in humans ) ( Pant and Lozano, 2014 ). Although MDM2 limits p53 activity by promoting its turnover, MDM2 only catalyses multi-monoubiquitination of p53, which is insufficient for recognition by the proteasome ( Lai et al., 2001 ). Progression to the polyubiquitinated form of p53 in the nucleus is carried out by the U-box E4 ligase UBE4B that interacts with both MDM2 and p53 ( Li et al., 2003; Wu and Leng, 2011; Wu et al., 2011 ). Although this is similar to the proposed roles of CRL3 and UBE4 in controlling NPR1 stability, initial ubiquitination has different effects on p53 and NPR1. While MDM2-mediated monoubiquitination controls nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of p53 ( Li et al., 2003 ), it probably does not have a direct effect on intrinsic p53 activator activity

. This is likely especially true for Arabidopsis thaliana which encodes for >60 DUB enzymes, many of which cluster into related sub-groups ( Liu et al., 2008; March and Farrona, 2017 ). Besides UBP6/7 other DUBs may therefore also play a role in regulating SA-responsive gene expression but their precise functions remain unknown. In summary, we report that disparate ubiquitin modifying enzymes play important roles in establishment of plant immune responses. We demonstrate that the opposing actions of an E3 and E4 ligase pair and two DUBs can fine-tune transcriptional outputs of the unstable immune coactivator NPR1 without strict requirement for its sacrificial turnover. Dynamicity in conjugated ubiquitin chain length may be a powerful mechanism for controlling the activity of unstable eukaryotic ( co ) activators in general.

. In summary, our findings indicate that initial CRL3-mediated ubiquitination is required for NPR1 to attain its full transcriptional activity, while the stepwise formation of long ubiquitin chains mediated by UBE4 inactivates NPR1 and promotes its degradation by the proteasome. Trimming or removal of ubiquitin chains is performed by deubiquitinases ( DUBs ) and may provide another layer of regulation of NPR1 activity. The Arabidopsis genome is predicted to encode for at least 65 DUBs ( Vierstra, 2009; Yang et al., 2007 ) with high likelihood of redundancy among gene families. Therefore identifying candidate genes that potentially regulate NPR1 and other eukotic transcriptional activators will be important for understanding the mechanisms of plant immunity and transcriptional regulation.

    Title: Identification of Pol IV and RDR2-dependent precursors of 24 nt siRNAs guiding de novo DNA methylation in Arabidopsis
    Abstract: In Arabidopsis thaliana, abundant 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs ( 24 nt siRNA ) guide the cytosine methylation and silencing of transposons and a subset of genes. 24 nt siRNA biogenesis requires nuclear RNA polymerase IV ( Pol IV ), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 ( RDR2 ) and DICER-like 3 ( DCL3 ). However, siRNA precursors are mostly undefined. We identified Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs ( P4R2 RNAs ) that accumulate in dcl3 mutants and are diced into 24 nt RNAs by DCL3 in vitro. P4R2 RNAs are mostly 26-45 nt and initiate with a purine adjacent to a pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol IV transcripts generated in vitro. RDR2 terminal transferase activity, also demonstrated in vitro, may account for occasional non-templated nucleotides at P4R2 RNA 3’ termini. The 24 nt siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5’ or 3’ ends of P4R2 RNAs, suggesting a model whereby siRNAs are generated from either end of P4R2 duplexes by single dicing events.

To simplify the discussion we focus solely on 24 nt siRNAs. Ninety-six percent of P4R2 RNAs identified in dcl2/3/4 mutants fully encompass or overlap 24 nt siRNA sequences ( Figure 6A ). Among the P4R2 loci we identified are 20 of the 22 loci that Li et al.

Pol IV and Pol V are 12-subunit enzymes ( Ream et al., 2009 ) that evolved as specialized forms of DNA-dependent RNA Pol II ( Haag et al., 2014; Haag and Pikaard, 2011; He et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2009; Lahmy et al., 2009; Ream et al., 2009 ). RDR2 is one of six single-subunit RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in Arabidopsis ( Wassenegger and Krczal, 2006; Xie et al., 2004 ). Pol IV and RDR2 are each essential for the biogenesis of 24 nt siRNAs and they physically associate in Arabidopsis and maize ( Haag et al., 2012, 2014; Law et al., 2011 ), suggesting that their activities are coupled for the production of double-stranded siRNA precursors from initial DNA templates. Pol V is not required for siRNA biogenesis at most loci ( Mosher et al., 2008 ) but generates non-coding RNAs to which siRNA-AGO4 complexes bind ( Wierzbicki et al., 2008; 2009 ). The C-terminal domain of the Pol V largest subunit also interacts with AGO4 ( El-Shami et al., 2007 ). Together, these RNA and protein interactions bring AGO4 to the vicinity of the DNA transcribed by Pol V, allowing recruitment of DNA methylation and chromatin-modifying activities that bring about transcriptional gene silencing ( Figure 1 ). Genetic evidence suggests that coordinated Pol IV and RDR2 transcription yields double-stranded RNAs ( dsRNAs ) that are then cleaved by DICER-like 3 ( DCL3 ) to produce 24 nt siRNA duplexes, one strand of which is incorporated into AGO4 ( Xie et al., 2004; Zilberman et al., 2003 ) or a closely related Argonaute protein ( Mallory and Vaucheret, 2010; Zheng et al., 2007 ). Because Pol IV localization is unaffected in rdr2 null mutants, but RDR2 is mis-localized in Pol IV null mutants ( Pontes et al

In plants, transposable elements, transgenes, repetitive sequences and endogenous genes can be transcriptionally silenced by RNA-directed DNA methylation ( Matzke and Mosher, 2014; Pikaard et al., 2013; Wierzbicki, 2012; Zhang and Zhu, 2011 ). In this process, 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs ( 24 nt siRNAs ) bound to an Argonaute family protein, primarily Argonaute 4 ( AGO4; [Zilberman et al., 2003] ), guide the cytosine methylation and histone modification of corresponding DNA sequences, leading to chromatin states that are refractive to transcription by RNA polymerases I, II, or III ( Figure 1 ). Approximately 4000–8000 loci in Arabidopsis thaliana give rise to clusters of 24 nt siRNAs, collectively accounting for more than 90% of the total small RNA pool ( Law et al., 2013; Mosher et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2007 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 09591. 003Figure 1. Biogenesis of 24 nt siRNAs and their role in RNA-directed DNA methylation. A simplified cartoon of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. Polymerase ( Pol ) IV and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RDR2 ) physically associate and are required for the synthesis of double-stranded RNAs ( dsRNA ) that are diced by DICER-like 3 ( DCL3 ) into 24 nt siRNA duplexes. Upon loading into Argonaute 4 ( AGO4 ), the siRNA-AGO4 complex finds its target sites by binding to Pol V transcripts and by interacting with the C-terminal domain ( CTD ) of the Pol V largest subunit. The cytosine methyltransferase DRM2 is ultimately recruited to Pol V-transcribed loci, resulting in de novo cytosine methylation in all sequence contexts ( CG, CHG and CHH; where H represents a nucleotide other than G ).

. Thus, the multitude of unique 24 nt siRNA sequences present in wild-type cells can be expected to be derived from a similarly large number of P4R2 precursors, depending on whether one or both strands of diced duplexes are utilized as siRNAs ( Figure 6B ). In contrast, d2/3/4 mutants, where DCL activity is absent, P2 RNAs are not diced into 24 siRNAs and instead accumulate as 26-45 nt RNAs ( Figure 7 ). The 26-45 nt P2 RNAs in d2/3/4 mutants are mostly initiate with purine adjacent to pyrimidine, similar to Pol transcripts generated in vitro ( Figure 7 ). The 26-45 nt P2 RNs in d2/3/4 mutants are also have occasional non-templated nucleotides at their 3’ termini, consistent with R2 terminal transferase activity ( Figure 7 ).

    Title: A transient postnatal quiescent period precedes emergence of mature cortical dynamics
    Abstract: Mature neural networks synchronize and integrate spatiotemporal activity patterns to support cognition. Emergence of these activity patterns and functions is believed to be developmentally regulated, but the postnatal time course for neural networks to perform complex computations remains unknown. We investigate the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development using high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology in immature mice. We reveal that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. The transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity occurs. We demonstrate a similar developmental trajectory in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation. We hypothesize that this transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks.

    We demonstrate that maturation of cortical network dynamics is preceded by a discrete, relatively quiescent, evolutionarily conserved transition period during early postnatal development. During this period, oscillations and neural spiking display a nadir that signals the shift from local, loosely correlated, putatively sensory-driven patterns to internally organized, spatially distributed, and temporally precise activity. Such a developmental inflection point may reflect a rapid and confluent engagement of mechanisms that enable mature computational processes within cortical networks. Self-organization in complex systems is often mediated by processes that can facilitate sudden transitions in system behavior. Our results provide evidence for such a transition in developing cortex of rodents and humans. Because rodent neurodevelopment is temporally compressed relative to humans, an inflection epoch that lasts 1–2 days in mouse pups could conceivably extend over weeks in humans ( Clancy et al., 2001 ). Prior to this inflection point, oscillatory activity was intermittent with non-uniform cycle-to-cycle waveforms and high broadband frequency coherence. Oscillatory activities after the transition became nearly uninterrupted, exhibiting coupling at discrete frequency bands and increased waveform symmetry. Based on these similarities in oscillatory patterns, we infer that the neural spiking features we observe through invasive recordings in mouse pups could also extend to normally developing human infants, where such recordings are not possible. Neural spiking was more efficiently recruited to oscillatory activity with consistent, strong phase-locking, and higher temporal precision. These features are characteristic of adult neural networks engaged in information processing ( Masquelier et al., 2009 )

Multiple cognitive functions emerge rapidly during early development. Neural networks enable precise spatiotemporal coordination of synaptic and cellular activity in mature brain functions ( Fries et al., 1997; Maingret et al., 2016; Peyrache et al., 2009; Khodagholy et al., 2017 ). How immature neural networks develop into their mature form needed for the complex computations underlying cognition remains poorly understood. The first organized and predominant pattern of neural activity that appears in cortical circuits across species is a spindle-like oscillation ( 10–20 Hz ) that occurs intermittently on a background of relative neural inactivity. Known as spindle bursts in rodents and delta brushes in humans, this immature network activity is commonly triggered by peripheral stimuli ( An et al., 2014; Hanganu et al., 2006; Khazipov et al., 2004 ). They demarcate cortical columns or pre-columns and have been linked to neuronal survival ( Golbs et al., 2011 ), establishing sensory ensembles, and critical period plasticity ( Khazipov et al., 2004; Colonnese et al., 2010; Khazipov et al., 2013; Winnubst et al., 2015 ). Spindle bursts are characteristic of the first postnatal week of rodent development, and delta brushes disappear shortly after term in human neonates ( Torres and Anderson, 1985 ), emphasizing their transient role in network maturation. In contrast, mature cortex exhibits perpetual, complex patterns of neural activity that appear and interact across a wide range of frequencies ( Tort et al., 2009; Fujisawa and Buzsáki, 2011; Bosman et al., 2012 ). The organization of this activity creates precise spatiotemporal windows for neural synchronization, enabling plasticity processes and generation of neural sequences ( Masquelier et al., 2009; Geisler et al., 2010; Foster and Wilson, 2006 )

., 2009 ). Thus, a transient period of developmental perturbation may be an evolutionarily conserved indicator of a substantial shift in cortical network operations. Our results suggest that the cortical network dynamics shift to permit temporally precise neural spiking after the transition period. Significantly synchronized firing within 10–50 ms intervals was absent prior to this period and robustly emerged afterward. This result is consistent with observed increase in pair-wise correlations of spike activity in visual cortex over development ( Colonnese et al., 2017 ). Although recruitment of neural spiking during epochs of spindle burst oscillations in immature rodents likely co-activates neurons that share similar afferent inputs ( Khazipov et al., 2004; Colonnese et al., 2010; Khazipov et al., 2013; Winnubst et al., 2015 ), more precise coordination is required for establishment of flexible, defined neural assemblies ( Dragoi and Buzsáki, 2006 ), and the capacity of circuits to express sequential activation of these assemblies is developmentally regulated ( Farooq and Dragoi, 2019 ). We found that the neural population activity demonstrated correlated suppression over a progressively shorter duration ( from approximately 500 to 200 ms ) with maturation. This process is in keeping with the progressively decorrelated activity patterns observed when analysis is performed on the time scale of calcium indicators ( Golshani et al., 2009; Rochefort et al., 2009 ). When oscillations occur in discrete frequency bands, the possibility for complex comodulation arises. This cross-frequency coupling has been linked to information processing in the mature brain, though the precise anatomical substrates and physiological mechanisms that enable its expression are often unknown ( Tort et al., 2009; Fujisawa and Buzsáki, 2011; Bosman et al., 2012 )

., 2016; Latchoumane et al., 2017 ). To investigate this hypothesis, we examined neural network dynamics across early rodent and human development. We targeted epochs spanning disappearance of immature activity and emergence of mature sleep patterns in each species. For rodents, we developed conformable, minimally invasive, high-resolution electrocorticography arrays coupled with high-density implantable probes and recorded spontaneous in vivo electrophysiological patterns from unanesthetized mice across the first two postnatal weeks. This approach enabled simultaneous recording of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity without damaging fragile cortical circuits. We found that the transition between immature and mature network dynamics was characterized by unexpectedly decreased coordinated cellular and synaptic activity at the beginning of the second postnatal week. After this timepoint, precise neuronal synchronization and oscillatory coupling in space and time robustly emerged. Analysis of continuous electroencephalography ( EEG ) recordings from human subjects, 36–69 weeks post-gestation, revealed a similar developmental trajectory characterized by a transient decrease in neural activity prior to onset of spatiotemporal oscillatory coupling. Therefore, a shift from local, loosely correlated, prominently sensory-driven patterns to internally organized, spatially distributed, and temporally precise activity is preceded by a transient quiescent period. These findings suggest that mechanisms to developmentally regulate functional network capacity may be evolutionarily conserved and manifest on the systems level as similar, discrete states.

., 2010; Foster and Wilson, 2006 ). Such network properties facilitate information processing, and resultant activity patterns have been causally linked to cognitive processes from stimulus perception to learning and memory ( Fries et al., 1997; Maingret et al., 2016; Peyrache et al., 2009; Khodagholy et al., 2017 ). Understanding when and how these properties develop in the immature brain is critical given that delay or failure to express mature brain activity is a strong risk factor for subsequent impaired cognition ( Khazipov et al., 2004; Anderson et al., 1985; Seelke and Blumberg, 2008; Holmes and Lombroso, 1993 ). We hypothesized that emergence of these advanced neural network properties could be heralded by the disappearance of immature activity patterns. During this developmental epoch, cortical microcircuits are still undergoing dramatic changes in anatomical connectivity ( Khazipov et al., 2004 ) and functional connectivity between and within cortical layers is initiated ( Bureau et al., 2004 ) in part through an abrupt increase in synaptogenesis in superficial layers ( Naskar et al., 2019 ). Robust GABA-mediated fast inhibition also appears ( Daw et al., 2007; Goldberg et al., 2011 ) as inhibitory network influences of interneurons increase ( Modol et al., 2020; Torn et al. 2019 ). These changes are thought to contribute to maturation of oscillatory patterns ( Tort et al,2009; Fujawa and Buzáki 2011; Bosman et al 2012 ). Our results suggest that a transient period of quiescence precedes emergence of spatiempotemporal patterns in both rodents and humans, indicating an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for network maturation.
Researchers have developed an agent-based model that extends earlier strain theory to address the effect of immune selection on multi-copy genes in Plasium falcum, a pathogen responsible for the deadliest type of malaria in humans. The model considers the diversity of multi-copy genes that undergo antigenic variation via sequential, mutually exclusive expression and tracks the dynamics of unique reperto in a population of hosts. It shows that even under high levels of sexual recombination, competition through cross-immunity structures the population into a subset of coexisting repires of genes whose degree of antigen overlap depends on transmission intensity. Empirical comparison of genetic variation at antigenic and neutral sites supports the role of immune in structuring parasite diversity.

The model considers the shaping enormous diversity of genomic reperto of genes by tracking all possible reperto, given a pool of genetic variants. It explores structured populations resulting from selection exerted by competition distinct repires for hosts, mediated cross-immunity. The results show that decreasing transmission provokes nonlinear changes in dominant configurations. Importantly, there is not a simple relationship between diversity and repertoire. The model suggests that control strategies reducing transmission will not drastically reduce gene diversity because a reservoir of parasite with diverse, non-overlapping repires will remain. This provides a plausible explanation for why it is difficult to eliminate malaria: non-overlapping diversity creates inherent difficulties in reducing potential to reinfect same hosts.

The model demonstrates that strain structure rather than diversity determines epidemiological patterns and response to intervention. Reducing antigen between strains will result in infection at older age and gradual acquisition of protection, even in absence of changes gene. The model does not differentiate infection from disease, thus cannot address impact on severity. However, if number of genes a host encountered relates to degree against disease, expect more symptoms occur younger under high settings and homogeneous incidents over broader age-classes when transmission lowered.

The model constrains repertoire to orders lower levels than possible given diversity. Reduction occurs coexisting into variants with discordant repires. Departure from theory predicts dominant can exhibit partial overlap; extent increases with transmission and influences epidemiological patterns, particularly ageology. Immune each host structures population into distinct patches that define environment, causing selection act on parasite. These patches conserved even immunity alleles short-lived.

    Title: Deamidation disrupts native and transient contacts to weaken the interaction between UBC13 and RING-finger E3 ligases
    Abstract: The deamidase OspI from enteric bacteria Shigella flexneri deamidates a glutamine residue in the host ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 and converts it to glutamate ( Q100E ). Consequently, its polyubiquitination activity in complex with the RING-finger ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 and the downstream NF-κB inflammatory response is silenced. The precise role of deamidation in silencing the UBC13/TRAF6 complex is unknown. We report that deamidation inhibits the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6 RING-domain ( TRAF6RING ) by perturbing both the native and transient interactions. Deamidation creates a new intramolecular salt-bridge in UBC13 that competes with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge at the native UBC13/TRAF6RING interface. Moreover, the salt-bridge competition prevents transient interactions necessary to form a typical UBC13/RING complex. Repulsion between E100 and the negatively charged surface of RING also prevents transient interactions in the UBC13/RING complex. Our findings highlight a mechanism wherein a post-translational modification perturbs the conformation and stability of transient complexes to inhibit protein-protein association.

    Protein deamidation can have significant functional consequences for innate immune signaling ( Zhao et al., 2016 ), which justifies its emergence as a powerful tool employed by pathogenic bacteria to suppress the immune response ( Washington et al., 2013 ). However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying deactivation of immune signaling by deamidation. The Shigella flexneri effector OspI suppresses the inflammatory response ( NF-κB pathway ) via deamidation of UBC13 at Q100. By an unknown mechanism, deamidation of Q100 to E100 inhibits the synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains by the UBC13/TRAF6 complex, preventing the downstream activation of NF-κB pathway. Q100 is present at the vicinity of UBC13/TRAF6 interface but does not form direct contact with TRAF6. We report that deamidation neither alters the fold nor the enzymatic activity of UBC13. NMR and kinetics studies indicate that deamidation does not alter the active site of UBC13. Instead, it reduces the interaction between UBC13 and RING domains to diminish the catalytic effect of the RING. The interaction with TRAF6 is inhibited because E100 in dUBC13 competes with an intermolecular R14/E69 salt-bridge at the dUBC13/TRAF6RING interface to form an intramolecular salt-bridge, which destabilizes the native complex. The new intramolecular salt-bridge also inhibits the long-range transient interactions formed by R14 with TRAF6RING. In addition, repulsive interactions between E100 and the negatively charged interface of TRAF6RING destabilize the transient complexes. Cumulatively, these mechanisms reduced the binding energy between UBC13 and TRAF6RING by 1. 69 kcal/mol. Consequently, its efficiency in activating the UBC13 ~Ub conjugate drops by 6-fold ( Figure 10F ). The effect of deamidation is also manifested in another UBC13/RING complex

. Deamidation reduced the rate of Ub-discharge and the rate of Ub2 synthesis by several folds in the UBC13/RNF38RING complex ( Figure 10F and N ). These results provide first insights into the molecular mechanism behind the inactivation of the Ubiquitin pathway by bacterial deamidation. For several E3s like RNF38, the RING domain can function as a monomer ( Buetow et al., 2015 ). For others like TRAF6, the RING domains function as dimers ( Middleton et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2009 ). Since deamidation perturbed the binding of UBC13 to both TRAF6 and RNF38, it is likely that deamidation inactivates UBC13 for both homo/hetero-dimeric RING-E3s. In dimeric RINGs like TRAF6, the proximal RING interacts with one unit of UBC13 ~ Ub, and the distal RING interacts with the donor Ub of another UBC13 ~ Ub. Additionally, for TRAF6 dimer, the first zinc-finger following the RING domain of one protomer also interacts with the donor Ub of the UBC13 ~ Ub bound to another protomer ( Middleton et al., 2017; Figure 10—figure supplement 3 ). However, the binding between UBC13 and TRAF6RING is independent of dimerization ( Yin et al., 2009 ), indicating that binding between UBC13 and proximal RING is primary. Indeed, deamidation inhibited the binding of UBC13 to both TRAF6RING and to the longer dimeric TRAF6RZ3, confirming that secondary interactions between Ub/RING or Ub/zinc-finger cannot compensate for the loss of primary E2/RING interaction. Though the interface of a protein complex has numerous interacting residues, a few hotspot residues contribute significantly to the binding energy than the rest ( Moreira et al., 2007 ). Hotspot prediction algorithms reported R14 to be a hotspot at the UBC13/TRAF6RING interface ( Meireles et al., 2010; Zhu and Mitchell, 2011 )

Several bacterial pathogens secrete effector proteins that inhibit or co-opt the Ubiquitin ( Ub ) pathway to suppress the immune response of the host cell ( Ashida et al., 2014 ). The human pathogenic bacteria Shigella flexneri inactivates the host inflammatory Nf-κB signaling, responsible for inducing inflammatory cytokine responses during pathogen invasion ( Sanada et al., 2012 ). In the early events of interleukin-dependent activation of Nf-κB signaling, the Ub-conjugating enzyme UBC13, and the Ub-ligase TRAF6 function together to synthesize both unanchored polyubiquitin chains, and anchored polyubiquitin chains on TRAF6 and its substrate NEMO ( Chen, 2005 ). These chains serve as a scaffold to bring together TAK1/2 and IKK kinases, eventually leading to phosphorylation and activation of the IKK kinases, IκB degradation and nuclear translocation of transcription factor Nf-κB. To inactivate Nf-κB signaling, Shigella flexneri secretes a Type III effector called OspI, which functions as a deamidase ( Sanada et al., 2012 ). OspI specifically targets a glutamine residue in UBC13 and converts it to glutamate ( Q100E ). Ubiquitination reactions of TRAF6 either with UBC13 in the presence of OspI or with mutant Q100E-UBC13 ( dUBC13 ) show a significant drop in polyubiquitination activity ( Sanada et al., 2012 ). However, the mechanism underlying inhibition of polyubiquitination by deamidation of UBC13 remains unclear. Ubiquitination is a eukaryotic post-translational modification ( Komander and Rape, 2012 ), wherein the last glycine residue in the C-terminal tail of Ubiquitin ( Ub ) is activated and covalently attached to a substrate lysine residue. Ubiquitination involves three steps: an initial activation and thioester conjugation by the Ubiquitin-activating enzyme ( E1 ), followed by the thioester conjugation to the Ubiquitin-conjugating ( E2 ) enzymes, and a final step in which the Ub is covalently attached to the substrate amino group

. The effect of each mechanism on the binding was confirmed by binding studies using appropriate substitutions in either UBC13 or TRAF6RING. The impact of deamidation on transient interactions was also observed using another RING domain from RNF38, indicating that the mechanism could be ubiquitous for UBC13/RING complexes. Our study highlights that deamidation of residues that do not directly participate in the E2/E3 interaction but are close to the interface can effectively modulate the interaction by perturbing the native and transient intermolecular contacts. The mechanism of regulating protein-protein transient interactions by post-translational modifications could be at play in other quintessential signaling pathways.

Two different constructs of TRAF6 was used in this study. The isolated RING domain TRAF6RING ( aa: 50–124 ) was a shorter construct. The longer construct included the RING domain and three ZF domains ( TRAF6RZ3, aa: 50–211 ). TRAF6RING interacts with UBC13 and with the donor Ub in the UBC13 ~Ub conjugate, while the interaction of ZF domains with donor Ub further stabilized the complex ( Middleton et al., 2017 ). dUBC13 interacts with both TR6RING and TR6Z with the same affinity ( Yin et al, 2009 ). However, the interaction between U13 and TR6 is independent of dimerization ( Yin et al, 200 ) indicating that binding U13 to proximal R is primary. Deidation inhibited the binding of U13 to both TR6 and longer TR6Z confirming that secondary interactions Ub/R or zinc-finger cannot compensate for loss primary E/R interaction.

    Title: Asymmetric effects of activating and inactivating cortical interneurons
    Abstract: Bidirectional manipulations – activation and inactivation – are widely used to identify the functions supported by specific cortical interneuron types. Implicit in much of this work is the notion that tonic activation and inactivation will both produce valid, internally consistent insights into interneurons’ computational roles. Here, using single-unit recordings in auditory cortex of awake mice, we show that this may not generally hold true. Optogenetically manipulating somatostatin-positive ( Sst+ ) or parvalbumin-positive ( Pvalb+ ) interneurons while recording tone-responses showed that Sst+ inactivation increased response gain, while Pvalb+ inactivation weakened tuning and decreased information transfer, implying that these neurons support delineable computational functions. But activating Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons revealed no such differences. We used a simple network model to understand this asymmetry, and showed how relatively small changes in key parameters, such as spontaneous activity or strength of the light manipulation, determined whether activation and inactivation would produce consistent or paradoxical conclusions regarding interneurons’ computational functions.

    Resolving mechanisms of sensory processing at the level of cortical microcircuits will involve dissecting the operations performed by each interneuron subtype. The field cannot achieve this goal with correlative studies alone; causal manipulations are essential tools for conclusively linking interneuron subtypes to their respective cortical functions. Nonetheless, the assumptions and simplifications generally made when using these causal manipulations must be scrutinized. Given the surge in the use of molecular genetic tools to causally probe interneuron function, we tested whether one of the main assumptions underlying much of this work is true. Specifically, we tested the idea that differences in normal function between interneuron populations may be directly read out, and straightforwardly interpreted, by simply dialing interneuron activity up or down. In three different aspects of sensory processing within auditory cortex – the regulation of the gain, tuning, and information content of tone responses – we found that this intuitive assumption was not correct. Activation of Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons produced no significant differences in any of the three domains of sensory processing that we tested, even in cases where activation of interneurons caused equivalent and strong suppression, implying that Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons function equivalently in these aspects of sensory processing. In stark contrast, inactivation of Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons produced significant differences in all three domains: Pvalb+ cells appeared to increase information transfer through subtractive inhibition, whereas Sst+ cells appeared to provide divisive inhibition

. 70; Figure 5—figure supplement 5e ). In sum, the results of our inactivation experiments would imply that Sst+ and Pvalb+ cells normally support different computations; yet these activation experiments would lead to the conclusion that these neurons do not support different functions. This may relate to the effects of activation on the interneurons themselves. We identified putative Sst+ ( n = 24 ) and Pvalb+ ( n = 27 ) units by their increased sound-evoked firing rates with light activation ( seeMaterials and methods; example putative interneurons: Figure 5—figure supplement 6 ). These units had median spike trough-to-peak durations of 348 ± 61 μs and 287 ± 41 μs, respectively, were generally spontaneously active before the tone ( putative Sst+: FR = 6. 3 ± 2. 5 Hz; putative Pvalb+: FR = 8. 6 ± 4. 2 Hz ), and increased their firing during the tone ( putative Sst+: FR = 12. 2 ± 8. 5 Hz; putative Pvalb+: FR = 24. 8 ± 12. 7 Hz ). Interestingly, optogenetic activation of putative Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons had a larger effect on spontaneous FRs ( putative Sst+: FR ratio = 3. 9 ± 2. 9; putative Pvalb+: FR ratio = 2. 5 ± 0. 8 ), than sound-evoked FRs ( putative Sst+: FR ratio = 2. 9 ± 1. 5; putative Pvalb+: FR ratio = 1. 5 ± 0. 2 ). Moreover, even putative interneurons that were not generally active without light ( sound-evoked rate of less than 5 Hz; putative Sst+: n = 7 units; putative Pvalb+: n = 1 unit ) often showed FRs well above 30 Hz during the light ( putative Sst+: evoked rate = 35. 04 ± 28. 3 Hz; putative Pvalb+: evoked rate = 54. 5 Hz ). Together, these results suggest that activation increases the number of stimulus-independent spikes generated by both interneuron populations, potentially masking normal stimulus-driven function

. In this study, for example, a small population of the putative Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons fired weakly during the auditory stimulus ( with a mean firing rate of less than 5 Hz ), but dramatically increased their firing, often well above 30 Hz, with light stimulation. Moreover, recent work suggests that cortical Sst+ and Pvalb+ populations may contain subgroups that are differentially driven by patterns of cortical activity ( Kwan and Dan, 2012 ), stimulus features ( Runyan et al., 2010 ), and task-related behaviors ( Kvitsiani et al., 2013; Lagler et al., 2016 ), suggesting that genetically-targeted activation of these cells may recruit more than one functional population. Thus, activation of these heterogeneous populations may strengthen different sets of functions than those weakened by their inactivation, leading to inconsistent conclusions regarding their normal function. Other issues related to the normal pattern of interneuron activity may also contribute to these contradictory findings. Firstly, both the temporal organization of interneuron activity – for instance response delays ( Gabernet et al., 2005; Tan et al., 2008; Wehr and Zador, 2003 ) or synchrony ( Cardin et al., 2009; Hasenstaub et al., 2016; Hasenstaub et al., 2005; Hu and Agmon, 2015; Otte et al., 2010; Sohal et al., 2009; Stevens and Zador, 1998 ) – and the stimulus preferences of the interneurons themselves ( Atencio and Schreiner, 2010; Kerlin et al., 2010; Li et al., 2015; Moore and Wehr, 2013 ) are important for determining output. For example, in auditory cortex, Pvalb+ cells have been reported to be activated rapidly and by a broad set of tones, while Sst+ interneurons respond relatively slowly to a narrower range of tones ( Li et al., 2015 ). These features, however, will not be replicated in studies in which interneuron firing is indiscriminately and tonically increased or decreased

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 18383. 015 To evaluate how interneuron activation suppresses auditory cortical responses, we applied the same linear framework to the FTCs of the 59 units from ChR2/Sst and 57 units from ChR2/Pvalb mice whose responses were both tuned for frequency and significantly suppressed by activation of interneurons ( Figure 4d, h; Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ), excluding units that were suppressed by more than 80% ( to avoid floor effects ), and including both narrow-spiking and broad-spiking units. Among these units, this linear framework explained the effects of light-driven inhibition from Sst+ and Pvalb+ cells well, as evidenced by median R2 values around 0. 8 ( ChR2/Sst: median R2 = 0. 81; ChR2/Pvalb: median R2 = 0. 80; Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ).

    Title: Externally induced frontoparietal synchronization modulates network dynamics and enhances working memory performance
    Abstract: Cognitive functions such as working memory ( WM ) are emergent properties of large-scale network interactions. Synchronisation of oscillatory activity might contribute to WM by enabling the coordination of long-range processes. However, causal evidence for the way oscillatory activity shapes network dynamics and behavior in humans is limited. Here we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation ( tACS ) to exogenously modulate oscillatory activity in a right frontoparietal network that supports WM. Externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high. Simultaneously collected fMRI data reveals tACS effects dependent on the relative phase of the stimulation and the internal cognitive processing state. Specifically, synchronous tACS during the verbal WM task increased parietal activity, which correlated with behavioral performance. Furthermore, functional connectivity results indicate that the relative phase of frontoparietal stimulation influences information flow within the WM network. Overall, our findings demonstrate a link between behavioral performance in a demanding WM task and large-scale brain synchronization.

   ., 2005; Polanía et al., 2012 ). With the aim of providing causal evidence for the role of oscillatory synchronization during demanding WM performance, as well as to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms by which frontoparietal phase synchronization influences verbal WM, we conducted two experiments using transcranial alternating current stimulation ( tACS ) to selectively entrain endogenous brain rhythms ( Antal and Paulus, 2013 ). In- and anti-phase theta frequency ( 6 Hz ) stimulation was applied across two key nodes of the right frontoparietal network: the middle frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule. Similar tACS stimulation has previously been shown to produce phase-dependent modulations of WM performance ( Polanía et al., 2012 ). In this study, we conducted two complementary experimental approaches. In Experiment 1 we used conventional continuous theta stimulation to investigate the role of frontoparietal phase synchronization on cognitive performance. Cognitive demands were varied by using a combination of choice reaction and N-back tasks of increasing difficulty. This allowed us to test the prediction that tACS effects would only be seen when cognitive demands were high. The right hemisphere was stimulated because increasing demand in verbal N-back conditions was associated with stronger activity and effective connectivity within the right hemisphere WM network ( Fedorenko et al., 2013; Dima et al., 2014 ), as well as a more pronounced effect of tACS on WM performance ( Jaušovec et al., 2014 ). In Experiment 2 we investigated the neurobiological substrate of the phase dependent effects of tACS. Our fMRI-tACS experimental design used short trains of tACS that avoid aftereffects of the stimulation ( Vossen et al., 2015 ) whilst maximizing power to detect changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent ( BOLD ) signal

Our results demonstrate that external manipulations of oscillatory synchrony across a right-sided frontoparietal network impact neural activity and modify behavior. The effects depend on the relative phase of the external oscillators and also the underlying cognitive state at the time tACS is applied. In particular, we showed that imposing theta frequency synchronously across the inferior parietal lobe and middle frontal gyrus improves verbal WM performance and increases frontal and parietal brain activity. The functional connectivity of the inferior parietal lobe was also modulated by tACS in a phase dependent manner. Frontal interactions increased with synchronous theta stimulation whereas posterior interactions increased with desynchronous stimulation, suggesting that information flow through brain regions involved in WM can be differentially affected by varying the phase of external stimulation. Therefore, we provide a direct demonstration of the role of phase synchronization in cognitive demanding WM processes and we showed the neural correlates associated with this process. It has been proposed that tACS interacts with ongoing oscillations and the resultant neural modulations spread along brain networks ( Fröhlich and McCormick, 2010; Ali et al., 2013 ), with entrainment being more effective when the induced frequency matches the endogenous rhythm ( Fröhlich and McCormick, 2010; Reato et al., 2010 ). This leads to the prediction that stimulation is highly dependent on the underlying network dynamics ( Alagapan et al., 2016 ). Our imaging results for the 2-back and CRT tasks strongly support these notions and show how the physiological effect of external oscillatory manipulations are highly dependent on the underlying cognitive state

. While synchronous and desynchronous stimulation produced distinct activity and connectivity patterns in the 2-back task, they resulted in similar changes of activity and no effects on connectivity for the CRT task. Compared to the CRT, the 2-back task is more demanding and engages the frontoparietal network more heavily, which is observed both in terms of increased BOLD activity and theta power ( Payne and Kounios, 2009; Heinzel et al., 2014 ) Our behavioral findings strongly suggest a causal link between theta phase coupling in the frontoparietal network and cognition. We replicate the observation that synchronous tACS applied across the frontoparietal networks improves WM performance ( Polanía et al., 2012 ), and extend these results by showing that this cognitive enhancement is dependent on the demands of the cognitive task. Our observations that tACS had no effect on less demanding 1-back or CRT tasks suggests that the behavioral effects of entraining oscillations interacts with the extent that a network is already engaged by a cognitive task. Remarkably, synchronous tACS produced sufficient improvement in response times to make 2-back performance similar to the 1-back condition, which is typically associated with much faster responses. Increased rhythmic synchrony across a network is thought to improve information processing by increasing network efficiency, an effect particularly important during demanding cognitive processing ( Fries, 2005, 2009; Deco et al., 2011 ). For example, theta synchrony between frontal and parietal brain regions increases during complex manipulations of items held in WM ( Sauseng et al., 2005 ). Importantly, our neuroimaging results show the neural correlates of this effect on network efficiency

Cognitive processes depend on coordinated interactions among large-scale distributed brain networks. Flexible and rapid propagation of information across distant brain regions is necessary to support these functions. A prominent hypothesis is that information exchange within and between networks occurs through the oscillatory synchronization of neuronal activity, such that synchronous neuronal firing binds neurons into ensembles engaged in specific computational functions ( Varela et al., 2001; Fries, 2005; Womelsdorf et al., 2007; Fries, 2015; Parkin et al., 2015 ). Rhythmic synchrony increases network efficiency, a process thought to be particularly relevant for demanding cognitive processes such as working memory ( WM ) ( Fries, 2005; Deco et al., 2011; Fell and Axmacher, 2011; Fries, 2015; Constantinidis and Klingberg, 2016 ). Frontal and parietal brain regions support WM ( Cohen et al., 1997; Prabhakaran et al., 2000; Pessoa et al., 2002; Todd and Marois, 2004 ). Oscillatory activity in the theta range ( 4–8 Hz ) appears to organize local neuronal ensembles across distant regions during WM processes ( Buzsáki, 1996; Sarnthein et al., 1998; Rutishauser et al., 2010 ). Theta power increases during complex manipulations of items in WM ( Sauseng et al., 2005 ), with increasing memory load ( Jensen and Tesche, 2002; Payne and Kounios, 2009 ), and is correlated with WM performance ( Jacobs et al., 2006; Fuentemilla et al., 2010 ). Moreover, the relative phases of these oscillations influence encoding and retrieval success ( Rizzuto et al., 2006 ). For example, frontoparietal theta synchrony with ~0° phase lag is associated with the maintenance and manipulation of information in WM ( Sauseng et al., 2005; Polanía et al., 2012 )

. Functional ( f ) MRI is well suited to this purpose because BOLD: ( 1 ) provides a measurement of brain activity during tACS without complex artifacts that can severely contaminate traditional electroencephalography ( EEG ) and magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) recordings ( Cabral-Calderin et al., 2016; Vosskuhl et al., 2016; Noury et al., 2016 ) ; and ( 2 ) is unaffected by the phase of the applied stimulation. We tested the following hypotheses: ( 1 ) behavioral WM performance is enhanced by entraining synchronous activity within a right frontoparietal network activated by WM demands; ( 2 ) regional brain activity in this frontoparietal network is modulated in a phase dependent manner; ( 3 ) changes in BOLD induced by phase-dependent network stimulation correlate with behavioral performance; ( 4 ) functional connectivity across distant brain regions is modulated in a phase-dependent manner, in agreement with computational and empirical evidence that phase synchronization enables flexible reconfiguration of information flow between brain areas ( Womels et al.,2007; Fries et al. 2010; Park et al. 2015 ).

    Title: The transcription factor Pitx2 positions the embryonic axis and regulates twinning
    Abstract: Embryonic polarity of invertebrates, amphibians and fish is specified largely by maternal determinants, which fixes cell fates early in development. In contrast, amniote embryos remain plastic and can form multiple individuals until gastrulation. How is their polarity determined? In the chick embryo, the earliest known factor is cVg1 ( homologous to mammalian growth differentiation factor 1, GDF1 ), a transforming growth factor beta ( TGFβ ) signal expressed posteriorly before gastrulation. A molecular screen to find upstream regulators of cVg1 in normal embryos and in embryos manipulated to form twins now uncovers the transcription factor Pitx2 as a candidate. We show that Pitx2 is essential for axis formation, and that it acts as a direct regulator of cVg1 expression by binding to enhancers within neighbouring genes. Pitx2, Vg1/GDF1 and Nodal are also key actors in left–right asymmetry, suggesting that the same ancient polarity determination mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution.

   . Moreover, when a blastoderm is cut in half at right angles to the future primitive streak axis, cVg1 expression spontaneously initiates in the marginal zone adjacent to the cut edge, in either the right or left side at equal frequency, foreshadowing the appearance of the primitive streak a few hours later ( Bertocchini et al., 2004 ). This observation shows that the mechanisms that position cVg1 are active in the blastoderm stage embryo. Here we take advantage of these observations to design a molecular screen for new genes involved in the earliest stages of specifying embryo polarity; together with bioinformatic analysis and embryological experiments we identify the transcription factor Pitx2 as a direct and essential regulator of cVg1 expression both during normal development and in embryonic regulation ( induced twinning ).

. Perhaps the most dramatic example is seen in the chick, where cutting an embryo into fragments at the blastoderm stage ( when the embryo contains as many as 20, 000–50, 000 cells ) can lead to each fragment generating a complete embryo; up to eight embryos have been generated from a single blastoderm by experimental splitting, right up to the time of appearance of the primitive streak ( Lutz, 1949; Spratt and Haas, 1960 ). The ability of higher vertebrate embryos to retain a regulative model of development until such a late stage strongly suggests that localisation of maternally inherited determinants is not an essential component of the mechanisms specifying embryo polarity ( Stern and Downs, 2012 ). Moreover, since a single blastoderm can generate multiple embryos, mechanisms must exist that suppress this ability in regions of the embryo that do not normally initiate axis formation ( Bertocchini and Stern, 2002; Bertocchini et al., 2004 ). In chick embryos, the earliest symmetry breaking event known is the localised expression of cVg1, the chick orthologue of mammalian growth differentiation factor 1 ( GDF1 ) —a member of the transforming growth factor beta ( TGFβ ) superfamily of secreted proteins—encoding a Nodal/Activin-type molecule that signals through Smad2/3 ( Weeks and Melton, 1987; Thomsen and Melton, 1993; Kessler and Melton, 1995; Seleiro et al., 1996; Shah et al., 1997; Kessler, 2004; Birsoy et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2006; Andersson et al., 2007 ). Before primitive streak stages, cVg1 is expressed in the posterior marginal zone ( PMZ ), an extraembryonic region adjacent to where the primitive streak will form; misexpression of cVg1 in other ( anterior or lateral ) parts of the marginal zone is sufficient to induce a complete axis from adjacent embryonic cells ( Seleiro et al., 1996; Shah et al., 1997; Skromne and Stern, 2001, 2002 ). The mechanisms that position cVg1 in the PMZ are unknown

. Certainly, the strong conservation of the active enhancers ( E3 and E5, including the Pitx-binding sites contained therein ) near mouse and human GDF1 suggests that this is likely to be a conserved feature of birds and mammals, and despite the fact that the peculiar geometry of rodent embryos at these early stages has led to some differences in the processes leading to axis development ( Stern and Downs, 2012 ). Monozygotic twins do not seem to occur commonly in the mouse and it is possible that these very small, cup-shaped embryos do not survive to term if more than one primitive streak appears within a single blastocyst. Together, these findings suggest that the retention of a regulative mode of development at late stages by amniote embryos ( that allows the formation of the types of monozygotic twins that arise relatively late in development, including Siamese twins ) evolved through novel uses of an ancient pathway, involved in both mesendoderm development and left–right asymmetry, but in slightly different ways. Our study also brings forward the time at which the earliest responses to cutting an embryo can be detected. First, we can now detect cVg1 expression at one edge of a cut anterior fragment 4–5 hr after cutting, about 2 hr earlier than the 6 hr reported previously ( Bertocchini et al., 2004 ) ; Pitx2 appears even earlier, 3 hr after cutting. But this also begs the question of what lies upstream of Pitx2. At some early point in the cascade, the regulators will no longer be controlled at the transcriptional level and it will be considerably more difficult to identify them. The present finding that Pitx2 is upregulated locally just 3 hr after cutting an embryo suggests that its regulators may not be differentially expressed mRNAs, but other asymmetries

The PMZ of the chick embryo is the equivalent of the Nieuwkoop centre of amphibians: it can induce a complete axis including the organiser from neighbouring cells, without making a cellular contribution to the axis ( Azar and Eyal-Giladi, 1979; Khaner and Eyal-Giladi, 1989; Bachvarova et al., 1998 ). The Nodal/Activin-related TGFβ superfamily member cVg1 ( homologous to mammalian GDF1 ) is expressed in the PMZ. When ectopically applied to another region of the marginal zone, cVg1 is sufficient to initiate formation of a complete embryonic axis from adjacent embryonic ( area pellucida ) cells ( Seleiro et al., 1996; Shah et al., 1997 ). To act, cVg1 requires canonical Wnt, which seems to be provided mainly by cWnt8C, expressed all around the marginal zone ( Skromne and Stern, 2001 ). A target of cVg1 and Wnt is Nodal, transcribed in area pellucida cells next to the cVg1+Wnt expression domain ( Skromne and Stern, 2002 ). The anterior end of the embryo also has an early identity, defined by the expression of GATA binding protein 2 ( GATA2 ) ( Sheng and Stern, 1999; Bertocchini and Stern, 2012 ). However, unlike cVg1, GATA2 is not a sufficient determinant of polarity and at best only acts as a bias ( Bertocchini and Stern, 2012 ). While amphibian and teleost embryos lose their ability to generate complete, independent embryos if fragmented after the first few cell divisions, amniotes have huge regulative capacity. Dividing a chick blastoderm even just before primitive streak formation ( when the embryo may have as many as 50, 000 cells ) into up to eight fragments can lead to formation of as many complete embryos ( Lutz, 1949; Spratt and Haas, 1960 ). In an isolated anterior half, a visible primitive streak ( and expression of Brachyury and Snail2 ) can be detected about 12 hr after cutting

To search for putative upstream regulators of cVg1, we took advantage of two of its properties: that it is expressed in the PMZ at early stages of development and that when a blastoderm is cut in half at right angles to the axis of the future primitive streak, cVg1 expression is initiated stochastically on either the left or the right corner ( adjacent to the cut edge ) of the isolated anterior half ( Bertocchini et al., 2004 ). We therefore performed two screens. First, we dissected the PMZ and an equivalent anterior explant ( anterior marginal zone, AMZ ) from 40 embryos ( in triplicate ) and analysed their transcriptomes using Affymetrix microarrays ( Figure 1A–B, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). At this stage of development, it is not possible to predict the polarity of the embryo with complete certainty. To prevent contamination of the samples, we designed a verification strategy by which the predicted posterior and anterior explants were collected from the same embryo ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). We found that Pitx was upregulated in the PMZ compared to the AMZ ( Figure 1C ). Second, we performed a screen for genes that are upregulated in the PMZ compared to the AM in embryos manipulated to form twins ( Figure 2A–B, Figure 2— supplement 1 ) and found that Pitx was also upregulated ( Figure 2C ). We therefore tested Pitx as a candidate regulator of cV1 expression and found that Pitx binds to enhancers within the GDF1 locus ( Figure 3A–B ) and is essential for c1 expression in the PM ( Figure 3C–D ). We also found that Pitx is required for left–right asymmetry ( Figure 4A–B, Figure 4— supplement ) and that Pitx, cV1, and Nodal are involved in left–right patterning ( Figure 4C–D, Figure 4— supplement ) suggesting that the same polarity mechanism has been coopted to different functions during evolution

The study shows that Pitx is a direct regulator of c1 in the chick embryo and that it is essential for axis formation and left–right asymmetry. Pitx binds to enhancers within the G1 locus and is required for c1 expression in the PM. Pitx is also required for left–right patterning and Pit, c1, and Nodal are involved in left–right patterning suggesting that the same polarity mechanism has been coopted to different functions during evolution. The study also brings forward the time at which earliest responses to cutting an embryo can be detected. First, can detect c1 at edge of cut 4–5 hr after cutting about 2 hr earlier than previously reported. Pitx appears even earlier 3 hr after cutting. The finding that Pitx is upregulated just after cutting suggests that regulators may not be differentially expressed mRNAs but asymmetries. The PM of the chick is equivalent of the Nieuop centre of amphibians can induce a complete axis from neighbouring cells without making cellular contribution to axis ( Az and Eyal-Gadi,1979; Khan and Eyal-Gadi,1989; Bachova et al,1998 ) The NodalActivrelated TGF superfamily c1 is expressed in PM When ectopically applied to another region marginal,V1 is sufficient to initiate a complete axis from embryonic cells ( Sele et al,1996; Shah et,199 ) To actV1 requires Wnt which seems to be provided by C expressed around marginal ( Skne and Stern,200 ) A ofV1 and W is Nodal transcribed in pucida cells to cV1W domain ( Skne and Stern,200 ) The anterior has early defined by expression GATA protein 2 (ATA ) Sh and Stern,199 Bertch and Stern,201 However unlikeV1 GATA is not determinant and best acts bias Bertch and Stern,201 While amphib and tele lose ability generate independent if fragmented after few divisions amni have huge regul capacity Dividing blasterm just before streak when may as cells can lead to many complete ( Lutz,194; Spratt Ha,196 ) In isolated half visible streak and expression Brachury Sn2 detected about hr

    Title: Projection neurons in Drosophila antennal lobes signal the acceleration of odor concentrations
    Abstract: Temporal experience of odor gradients is important in spatial orientation of animals. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster exhibits robust odor-guided behaviors in an odor gradient field. In order to investigate how early olfactory circuits process temporal variation of olfactory stimuli, we subjected flies to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and examined spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons ( OSNs ) and projection neurons ( PNs ). We found a significant temporal transformation between OSN and PN spike patterns, manifested by the PN output strongly signaling the OSN spike rate and its rate of change. A simple two-dimensional model admitting the OSN spike rate and its rate of change as inputs closely predicted the PN output. When cascaded with the rate-of-change encoding by OSNs, PNs primarily signal the acceleration and the rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers, thereby enabling animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations.

    Supporting Text:
    We tested first- and second-order neurons in the Drosophila olfactory system with a wide range of dynamically varying odor concentrations and constructed a simple 2D LN model for the temporal processing of olfactory information. The shape of the 2D nonlinearity and the relatively low prediction error of the model support the hypothesis that the PN spike rate is most strongly dependent on the rate of change of its feedforward OSN input. When combined with the dynamic sensory encoding by OSNs—encoding of odor concentration and its rate of change—PNs signal the rate of change and, most strongly, the acceleration of odor concentration signals to higher brain centers. One remarkable example of the ‘acceleration encoding’ by PNs is found in the OSN/PN responses to the parabolically rising odor input, where the onset is enormously amplified to create step-like responses in PNs ( Figure 2C, I ). To the best of our knowledge, the encoding of acceleration by an olfactory sensory system has not been demonstrated elsewhere. This sensory encoding mechanism is distinguished from other chemosensory systems. For example, in bacterial chemotaxis, the rate of change of a stimulus is computed and fed directly into its motor system that controls the flagellar rotation ( Bourret et al., 1991 ). The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans also exhibits a local-gradient-based chemotaxis behavior, and neurons in its sensorimotor pathway are shown to compute the rate of change of concentration gradients ( Suzuki et al., 2008 ). Why do fruit flies compute acceleration of odor concentrations? How is the acceleration of an olfactory stimulus relevant to a fly's chemotaxis? An efficient chemotaxis strategy should depend on the distribution of odor molecules in the behaviorally relevant range, which can be quantified using a Reynolds number ( Weissburg, 2000 )

., 2006 ). Moreover, natural odor plumes are encountered in various spatiotemporal patterns, and their dynamics and statistics can influence the neural encoding mechanism ( Brenner et al., 2000; Vickers et al., 2001 ). In Drosophila, OSNs expressing the same receptors connect with PNs in one of roughly 50 spherical compartments, termed olfactory glomeruli, which constitute a deutocerebral neuropil called the antennal lobe. PNs subsequently relay olfactory information to higher brain centers such as the mushroom body and the lateral horn ( Stocker et al., 1990 ). Two recent studies independently reported that Drosophila OSNs encode not only the odor concentration but also its rate of change as a function of time ( Kim et al., 2011; Nagel and Wilson, 2011 ). Building on this recent advance, we asked how PNs further contribute to creating internal representations of dynamic olfactory environments. We tested OSNs and PNs with short plume-like odor stimuli in a variety of settings and analyzed the correlation structure of input/output signals in the odor-OSN-PN pathway. We also constructed a two-dimensional ( 2D ) linear–nonlinear ( LN ) model of the OSN-to-PN transformation by inducing an ensemble of triangle-shaped OSN spike rates via a systematic design of olfactory stimuli.

Odor distribution in nature is intermittent and dynamic ( Murlis et al., 1992; Vickers et al., 2001 ), and animals have evolved the ability to detect and respond to temporal variation of odor stimuli ( David et al., 1983; Thesen et al., 1993; Vickers et al., 2001; Porter et al., 2007; Semmelhack and Wang, 2009; Kato et al., 2014 ). In one of the most sophisticated examples, Drosophila larvae with only a single functional olfactory sensory neuron ( OSN ) are capable of moving toward a droplet of an attractive odor by actively orienting themselves ( Louis et al., 2008 ). Similarly, adult fruit flies exhibit robust odor-guided behaviors such as turning upwind in flight upon contact with an attractive odor plume ( Budick and Dickinson, 2006 ) and staying within a specific odor zone ( Semmelhack and Wang, 2009 ). In order to enable such odor-guided tasks, it is essential for any olfactory system to process time-varying features of olfactory stimuli and supply behaviorally relevant information to higher brain centers. Several recent studies have investigated how dynamic olfactory stimuli are processed in insect early olfactory systems ( systems consisting principally of OSNs and projection neurons [PNs] ) and observed significant temporal processing of odor signals ( Bhandawat et al., 2007; Geffen et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2011; Nagel and Wilson, 2011; Martelli et al., 2013 ). Most of these studies employed a simple odor delivery system that generated step-pulse-like odor stimuli without directly monitoring the actual odor concentration levels. For a rigorous understanding of sensory processing, however, it is essential to precisely measure the input stimuli and systematically explore the input space, as has been successfully done in the field of vision and audition ( Wu et al., 2006 )

., 2007 ), and our work confirms this result for a larger set of dynamically varying odor stimuli. Together, we hypothesize that acceleration encoding in the Drosophila antennal lobe allows higher olfactory centers to rapidly respond to onsets of slowly rising odor stimuli. 10. 7554/eLife. 06651. 009Figure 4. A cascade of rate-of-change encodings leads to a rapid detection of the stimulus onset. ( A ) A cascade of two rate-of-change transformations leads to the advancement of the peak time near to the stimulus onset, in response to a triangle-shaped input.

. The correlation was strong between the OSN output and both odor concentration and its rate of change, but weak between the OSN output and the acceleration of odor concentration ( Figure 2J ). Given the very same panel of olfactory stimuli, PN responses exhibited bigger peak amplitude and more stereotyped temporal patterns than OSNs ( Figure 2G–I ). All PN responses transiently peaked at the time of the odor onset, and their peak times were on average advanced from the OSN peak times. Specifically, in response to ramp-shaped OSN signals, PNs exhibited a rapid step response ( Figure 2F, I ). To step-like OSN signals, PN showed a phasic onset response, followed by a tonic spiking pattern ( Figure 2E, H ). These input/output relationships are reminiscent of the rate-of-change encoding in the odor-to-OSN transformation, where the ramp and step odor signals were similarly transformed. Biophysically, this phenomenon suggests a rapid adaptation between OSNs and PNs, which is in agreement with previous reports demonstrating strong short-term depression in synapses between OSNs and PNs ( Kazama and Wilson, 2008, 2009; Nagel et al., 2015 ). From a modeling perspective, this observation predicted a strong correlation between the PN spike rate and the rate of change of the OSN spike rate. A correlation analysis between the PN output and three different input features—OSN spike rate, rate of change, and acceleration—confirmed this prediction ( Figure 2K ). Together, this supports the hypothesis that PN responses can be modeled as a function of the OSN spike rate and its rate of change, at least for the tested class of odor stimuli. We therefore propose a simple model of the OS-to-PN transformation, where the PN rate is a function of the OS spike rate and its rate of change ( Figure 2L ). This model is a 2D linear-nonlinear ( LN ) model, where the output is a linear function of the input and its rate of change. We tested this model with a variety of odor stimuli and found that it accurately predicted the PN output ( Figure 3 ), with a low prediction error of 0. 1. 1. This model is consistent with the hypothesis that PNs primarily signal the rate and acceleration of the odor concentration to higher centers, enabling the fly to rapidly respond to onsets of odor stimuli.

    Title: Auxin production in the endosperm drives seed coat development in Arabidopsis 
    Abstract: In flowering plants, seed development is initiated by the fusion of the maternal egg and central cells with two paternal sperm cells, leading to the formation of embryo and endosperm, respectively. The fertilization products are surrounded by the maternally derived seed coat, whose development prior to fertilization is blocked by epigenetic regulators belonging to the Polycomb Group ( PcG ) protein family. Here we show that fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin and most likely its export to the maternal tissues, which drives seed coat development by removing PcG function. We furthermore show that mutants for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 have an impaired transport of auxin from the endosperm to the integuments, which results in seed abortion. We propose that AGL62 regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the integuments, leading to the removal of the PcG block on seed coat development.

    Supporting Text:
   . PcG proteins assemble into multimeric complexes, of which the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 ( PRC2 ) represses target loci through the deposition of trimethyl groups on lysine 27 of histone H3 ( H3K27me3 ) ( Mozgova et al., 2015 ). Therefore, the initiation of seed coat development prior to fertilization is inhibited by sporophytically active PRC2 complexes and this block is relieved following fertilization through a signal derived from the fertilization products ( Figueiredo and Köhler, 2014; Mozgova et al., 2015 ). Seed coat development is dependent on the development of the sexual endosperm ( Weijers et al., 2003; Ingouff et al., 2006; Roszak and Köhler, 2011 ), strongly suggesting that the seed coat-initiation signal is generated in the fertilized central cell/endosperm. Here, we show that seed coat development requires production of auxin in the fertilized central cell/endosperm and most likely the transport of auxin to the ovule integuments in an AGL62-dependent manner. We demonstrate that application of auxin is sufficient to drive seed coat development and that AGL62 regulates the expression of P-GLYCOPROTEIN 10 ( PGP10 ), in the endosperm, which likely functions as an auxin transporter to the sporophytic tissues. Finally, we show that auxin is sufficient to remove the PRC2 block on seed coat development.

In this manuscript we reveal that auxin is the missing link connecting fertilization and seed coat development. As the maternal integuments do not take part in the fertilization process, the signal that coordinates the development of the fertilization products with the maternal integuments remained elusive ( Figueiredo and Köhler, 2016 ). Based on previous research it seemed likely that the signal is generated in the endosperm, as endosperm development is required to drive seed coat initiation in Arabidopsis ( Weijers et al., 2003; Ingouff et al., 2006; Roszak and Köhler, 2011 ). It was furthermore known that the presence of the paternal genome is necessary for the seed coat to develop, as mutants for cdka;1 and fbl17, in which one of the sperm cells fails to undergo karyogamy with the central cell, do not develop a seed coat ( Gusti et al., 2009; Aw et al., 2010 ). These observations strongly suggest that the signal driving seed coat development should be dependent on genes that are paternally-expressed in the endosperm. Auxin biosynthesis following fertilization of the central cell is dependent on the paternally-expressed genes YUC10 and TAR1 ( Figueiredo et al., 2015 ), raising the hypothesis that auxin could be the trigger for seed coat initiation. In this manuscript we provide multiple lines of evidence supporting this hypothesis: ( i ) auxin rapidly accumulates in the integuments after fertilization, ( ii ) impaired auxin biosynthesis but not auxin signaling in the endosperm causes defects in seed coat development, ( iii ) ovules of transgenic lines producing auxin ectopically in the central cell initiate seed coat development without fertilization, ( iv ) failure of seed coat development in the agl62 mutant correlates with failure to export auxin. Collectively, our data strongly support the hypothesis that auxin generated in the fertilized central cell/endosperm is the trigger for seed coat formation

. However, this process is highly dependent on the activity of the transcription factor AGL62, since agl62 seeds fail to export auxin from the endosperm. This leads to auxin accumulation and consequently, failure to develop a seed coat ( right panel ). We propose that AGL62 activity is important for the expression, and eventually for the activity, of endosperm-specific auxin-exporters. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 20542. 021 In conclusion, we have discovered that auxin produced in the fertilized central cell is required to induce seed coat formation after fertilization and most likely acts as mobile signal linking fertilization with the differentiation of the surrounding sporophytic tissues.

. Impaired auxin signaling in the endosperm did not impair seed coat formation, strongly supporting the hypothesis that auxin is exported to the integuments, where it initiates downstream signaling events. We could show that the ABCB transporter PGP10 is expressed in the fertilized central cell and its expression depends on the type I MADS-box transcription factor AGL62, suggesting that PGP10 may regulate the export of auxin from the endosperm to the integuments. PGPs are known to depend on additional proteins for their localization and function ( Bouchard et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013 ), likely explaining our failure to restore seed coat development in agl62 by ectopically expressing PGP10. It is furthermore possible that additional AGL62 targets are required for successful auxin export from the endosperm and are therefore lacking in the agl62 mutant. Future research will focus on identifying the remaining factors required for PGP10 function. Post-fertilization auxin production was shown to lead to activation of GA biosynthesis in the ovules, which is then transported to the valves to promote silique growth ( Dorcey et al., 2009 ). Our observation that auxin produced in the central cell is sufficient to drive parthenocarpic growth of the silique couples the fertilization event to fruit development. We have previously shown that auxin drives endosperm development in Arabidopsis ( Figueiredo et al., 2015 ). We now propose a dual role for post-fertilization auxin production, both in driving endosperm and seed coat development. Additionally, the agl62 mutant has defects both in seed coat development in fertilized ovules and endosperm development in autonomous seeds. This suggests that AGL62, like auxin, is involved in mediating both endosperm and seed coat developmental pathways. It was recently proposed that AGL62 in the endosperm also mediates non-autonomous cell signalling driving nucellus degeneration ( Xu et al

Seed coat initiation is dependent on the fertilization of the central cell by one of the paternally-contributed sperm cells, but this requirement can be bypassed in mutants of sporophytic PRC2 components that initiate the autonomous development of the seed coat ( Roszak and Köhler, 2011 ). In order to identify the signaling pathways that could be involved in seed coat initiation, we generated transcriptome data from non-fertilized wild-type ( WT ) ovules and vrn2/- emf2/+ ovules at four days after emasculation ( 4 DAE ), and WT seeds at two days after pollination ( 2 DAP ). In contrast to WT ovules, non-fertilized vrn2/- emf2/+ ovules initiate autonomous seed coat development ( Roszak and Köhler, 2011 ), correlating with the activation of genes involved in auxin and gibberellin ( GA ) response or signaling that became also activated in fertilized seeds ( Table 1 and Table 1—source data 1 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 20542. 003Table 1.

Title: Auxin production in the endosperm drives seed development in Arabidopsis

In flowering plants, seed development is initiated by the fusion of the maternal and paternal cells, resulting in the formation of the embryo and endosperm, respectively. The fertilization products are surrounded by the maternally-derived seed coat, whose development is prior to fertilization is blocked by epigenetic regulators belonging to the Polycomb Group (Pc) protein family. This study shows that fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin, which is likely exported to the maternal tissues, driving seed coat development by removing Pc function. Mutants of the MADS transcription factor AGL have impaired transport of aux from endperm to integuments, resulting in seed abortion. It is proposed that AGL regulates auxin transport from endperm to integ, leading to the removal of Pc block on seed development.

The study reveals that auxin is the link connecting fertilization and seed development. The maternal integuments do not participate in fertilization, the signal that coordinates the development of fertil products with maternal remained elusive. Previous research suggested that the signal is generated in endperm, as endperm development required seed initiation in Arabid. The presence of paternal genome necessary for seed to develop, as mutants cd1 and f17, which one sperm fails to undergo kary with central, do not develop seed. Observations suggest that driving seed development dependent on genes patern-expressed in endperm. Aux biosynthesis following fertil central dependent on patern-expressed Y10 and TAR, raising hypothesis that aux could trigger seed initiation.

The study provides multiple lines of evidence supporting hypothesis: (i) aux accumulates in integ after fertilization, (ii impaired biosynthesis not signaling endperm causes defects, (iii ovules transgenic producing ectically in central initiate seed without fertil, (iv failure in ag62 correlates failure export). Collectively, data support that aux generated fertilized cell trigger seed formation. This process dependent on activity transcription factor A62, since ag62 fail export aux from endperm, leading to accumulation and failure develop seed.

The study proposes that A62 important for expression and activity endperm aux-exporters. Impaired signaling endperm not seed, supporting hypothesis aux exported integ, where initiates downstream events. The ABC transporter P10 expressed fertilized cell depends on type MADS transcription A62, suggesting P10 regulate export endperm integ. P known depend proteins localization function, explaining failure restore seed ag62 ectopically P10. It possible additional A62 targets required aux export endperm lacking ag62. Future research focus identifying factors P10 function.

Post-fertilization aux production shown lead activation bios in ovules, transported valves promote silique growth. Observation aux produced central drive parthenarpic silique couples fertil event fruit. The study dual role post-fertil aux production, driving endperm seed development. ag62 has defects coat fertilized ovules endperm autonomous, suggesting A62 involved mediating endperm seed pathways.

    Title: Mapping the functional landscape of the receptor binding domain of T7 bacteriophage by deep mutational scanning
    Abstract: The interaction between a bacteriophage and its host is mediated by the phage's receptor binding protein ( RBP ). Despite its fundamental role in governing phage activity and host range, molecular rules of RBP function remain a mystery. Here, we systematically dissect the functional role of every residue in the tip domain of T7 phage RBP ( 1660 variants ) by developing a high-throughput, locus-specific, phage engineering method. This rich dataset allowed us to cross compare functional profiles across hosts to precisely identify regions of functional importance, many of which were previously unknown. Substitution patterns showed host-specific differences in position and physicochemical properties of mutations, revealing molecular adaptation to individual hosts. We discovered gain-of-function variants against resistant hosts and host-constricting variants that eliminated certain hosts. To demonstrate therapeutic utility, we engineered highly active T7 variants against a urinary tract pathogen. Our approach presents a generalized framework for characterizing sequence–function relationships in many phage–bacterial systems.

   . We generated high-resolution functional maps delineating regions concentrated with function-enhancing substitutions and host-specific substitutional patterns, many of which were previously unknown. We discovered T7 variants with far greater virulence than wildtype T7, demonstrating that even those natural phages that are well adapted to a host can be engineered for higher efficacy. However, many variants highly adapted to one host performed poorly on others, underscoring a tradeoff between activity and host range. This functional screening highlights ideal regions of the tip domain for engineering host range. Furthermore, we demonstrated the functional potential of RBPs by discovering gain-of-function variants against resistant hosts and host-constriction variants that selectively eliminate specific hosts. To demonstrate the therapeutic value of ORACLE, we engineered T7 variants that avert emergence of spontaneous resistance in pathogenic Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infections ( UTIs ). Our study explains the molecular drivers of adaptability of the tip domain and identifies key functional regions determining activity and host range. ORACLE provides a generalized framework to describe sequence–function relationships in phages to elucidate the molecular basis of phages, the most abundant life form on earth.

In this study, we used ORACLE to create a large, unbiased library of T7 phage variants to comprehensively characterize the mutational landscape of the tip domain of the tail fiber. Our study identified hundreds of novel function-enhancing substitutions that had not been previously characterized. We mapped regions of function-enhancing substitutions on to the crystal structure to rationalize how sequence and structure influence activity and host range. Several important insights emerged from these results. Cross-comparison between different hosts and selection on resistant hosts allowed us to map key substitutions, leading to host discrimination and gain of function. Single amino acid substitutions are sufficient to enhance activity and host range, including some that confer dramatic increases in activity or specificity. The functional landscape on each host is unique, reflecting both different molecular preferences of adsorption and the fitness of wildtype T7 on these hosts. For instance, hydrophilic substitutions were enriched in 10G while hydrophobic substitutions were enriched in BW25113. Notably, substitutions on 10G ( an E. coli K-12 derivative lacking LPS components ) mirrored substitutions that recovered function on BW25113 mutants with truncated LPS, which shows convergence of selection. Function-enhancing substitutions were densely concentrated in the exterior loops, indicating an orientational preference for receptor recognition. However, they were also found on other surface residues, albeit less frequently, suggesting alternative binding modes of the tip domain for host recognition, and several intolerant residues were located in exterior loops. Taken together, these results highlight the extraordinary functional potential of the tip domain and rationalize the pervasive use of this structural fold in nature for molecular recognition

., 2006; Fraser et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2012 ). Even single amino acid substitutions to this domain are sufficient to alter host range between E. coli strains ( Heineman et al., 2008 ). Due to its critical functional role, we chose the tip domain to comprehensively characterize phage activity and host range by DMS. We generated a library of 1660 single mutation variants of the tip domain, prespecified as chip-based oligonucleotides, where all 19 non-synonymous and 1 nonsense substitution were made at each codon spanning residue positions 472–554 ( Figure 2A, residue numbering based on PDB 4A0T ). Using ORACLE, the library was inserted into T7 to generate variants to be selected and deep sequenced ( Figure 2B ) on three laboratory E. coli hosts: B strain derivative BL21, K-12 derivative BW25113, and DH10B derivative 10G. Each variant was given a functional score, F, based on the ratio of their relative abundance before and after selection consisting of an estimated four infection cycles, which was then normalized to wildtype to yield FN, where wildtype FN = 1 ( Figure 2C–E, see Materials and methods ). Selection on each host gave excellent correlation across biological triplicates ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). To validate the functional relevance of the screen, we hypothesized that the flexible C-terminal end ( residue positions 552–554 and a three-residue extension if the stop codon is substituted ) is unlikely to have any structural or host recognition role. As expected, these positions broadly tolerated nearly all substitutions across all three hosts, indicating that the functional scores likely reflect true biological effects ( Figure 2C–E ). We compared the activities of phage variants across hosts to assess their fitness and evolutionary adaptation to each host

. Although RBPs remain the focus of many mechanistic, structural, and evolutionary studies and are a prime target for engineering, we currently lack a systematic and comprehensive understanding of how RBP mutations influence phage activity and host range. Though insightful, directed evolution enriches only a small group of ‘winners’, which makes it difficult to glean a comprehensive mutational landscape of the RBP ( Holtzman et al., 2020 ). Random mutagenesis-based screens generate multi-mutant variants whose individual effects cannot be easily deconvolved ( Dunne et al., 2019; Yehl et al., 2019 ). Other approaches including swapping homologous RBPs lead to gain of function; however, the underlying molecular determinants of function can be difficult to explain ( Ando et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2017; Gebhart et al., 2017; Yosef et al., 2017 ). In summary, despite the extraordinary functional potential of phage RBPs, how systematic changes to their sequence shape the overall functional landscape of a phage remains unknown. Here, we carried out DMS, a high-throughput experimental technique, of the tip domain of the T7 phage RBP ( tail fiber ) to uncover molecular determinants of activity and host range. The tip domain is the distal region of the tail fiber that makes primary contact with the host receptor ( González-García et al., 2015; Molineux, 2001; Qimron et al., 2006 ). We developed ORACLE ( Optimized Recombination, Accumulation, and Library Expression ), a high-throughput, locus-specific, phage genome engineering method to create a large, unbiased library of phage variants at a targeted gene locus. Using ORACLE, we systematically and comprehensively mutated the tip domain by making all single amino acid substitutions at every site ( 1660 variants ) and quantified the functional role of all variants on multiple bacterial hosts

. This suggests the phage can use the ‘side’ of the tip domain to engage the receptor, increasing the apparent functional area of the tip domain and highlighting several new regions as valuable engineering targets. We also determined if the functionally important regions could be predicted computationally as the ability to predict functionally important regions without DMS could rapidly accelerate engineering efforts. We used Rosetta, a state-of-the-art protein modeling software, to calculate the change in Gibbs free energy ( ΔΔG ) for each of the 1660 mutations and compared this distribution to our DMS results ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1, also see Materials and methods ) and generated a truth table to summarize results compared to our functional data ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ). Predicted thermodynamic changes in stability mapped very well with over 93% of tolerated or functional positions having a substitution that was predicted to be stabilizing. The remaining 7% of tolerant or enriched substitutions were predicted to be destabilizing, and we hypothesize that this may indicate these substitutions result in improved dynamic or induced fit positioning of the tip domain for productive infection. Incorporating stability estimations could further improve the engineering power of the assay. For example, substitutions predicted to be stable but that are intolerant in the DMS assay may indicate that the substituted residue is necessary for all three hosts. Overall, these results paint a complex enrichment profile for each host with some broad trends but subtle host-specific effects. These results suggest that exterior loops and some outward-facing positions in β-sheets act as a reservoir of function-switching and function-enhancing mutations, likely promoting host-specific and orientation-dependent interactions between phage and bacterial receptors

    Researchers have mapped the functional landscape of the receptor binding domain of T bacteriophage T7 using a high-throughput, locus-specific phage engineering method called ORACLE. They generated a library of 166 single variants of the domain by making all non-synonymous and nonsense substitutions at each codon residue spanning positions 472-554. Using ORACLE, the library was inserted into T7 to generate variants to be selected and sequenced on three E. coli hosts: BL, BW13, and 10. Each variant was given a functional score, based on the ratio of relative abundance before and after selection of estimated infection. Selection on each host gave excellent correlation across triplicates. The study identified hundreds of function-enhancing substitutions, many of which were previously unknown, and mapped regions of function-enh substitutions to the crystal structure to rationalize sequence and structure influence activity and host range. Single amino acid substitutions are sufficient to enhance activity and host, including that confer dramatic increases or specificity. The functional on each host is unique, reflecting different molecular preferences adsorption and fitness of wildtype T on hosts. Hydrophilic substitutions were enriched in G while hydrophobic were in BW13. Notably, substitutions on G (E. coli-12 lacking LPS) mirrored that on BW13 mutants with truncated L, showing convergence of selection. Function-enhancing were concentrated in exterior, indicating orientational preference receptor recognition, but also found on other residues, albeit less, suggesting alternative modes of tip for host recognition and intolerant residues located exterior.

    Title: Altered functional connectivity during speech perception in congenital amusia
    Abstract: Individuals with congenital amusia have a lifelong history of unreliable pitch processing. Accordingly, they downweight pitch cues during speech perception and instead rely on other dimensions such as duration. We investigated the neural basis for this strategy. During fMRI, individuals with amusia ( N = 15 ) and controls ( N = 15 ) read sentences where a comma indicated a grammatical phrase boundary. They then heard two sentences spoken that differed only in pitch and/or duration cues and selected the best match for the written sentence. Prominent reductions in functional connectivity were detected in the amusia group between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions, which reflected the between-group differences in cue weights in the same groups of listeners. Connectivity differences between these regions were not present during a control task. Our results indicate that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions and suggest a compensatory mechanism.

    Supporting Text:
    We found that individuals with amusia, who have been previously shown to rely less on pitch than controls to process spoken language ( Jasmin et al., 2020a ), exhibited decreased functional connectivity between left frontal areas and right hemisphere pitch-related regions. In our task, participants matched spoken sentences with visually presented sentences based on pitch, duration, or both these acoustic dimensions together. Using a data-driven approach, we identified four regions in left and right inferior frontal cortex for which the amusic group exhibited decreased functional connectivity with several other sites in frontal, temporal and occipital cortex. The most prominent of these results was decreased connectivity between left frontal regions classically implicated in language processing ( left IFG and DLPFC ) and right hemisphere regions —in the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus, Heschl’s gyrus, and anterior insula—that have been implicated in pitch processing ( Lee et al., 2011; Garcea et al., 2017; Warren et al., 2003; Hohmann et al., 2018 ). We suggest that this decreased connectivity between right hemisphere pitch and left hemisphere frontal cortices may relate to the unreliability of the amusics’ perception of and memory for pitch. This is similar to the ‘weighted connections’ model of multisensory integration, where a more ( or less ) reliable modality is given a stronger ( or weaker ) weight ( Beauchamp et al., 2010 ). Congenital amusia is often described as a disorder related to structural and functional connectivity within the right hemisphere, particularly between right inferior frontal cortices and right posterior temporal cortex ( see Peretz, 2016 for review ). Consistent with this proposal, we found in the present study that right inferior frontal cortex exhibited strongly decreased functional connectivity in the amusia group, and follow-up seed testing revealed that right auditory areas were involved as well

. However, this finding can be explained by the pitch memory account, as the suprasegmental task requires detection of and memory for pitch patterns within a complex sequence, while the segmental task does not. Furthermore, an account of amusia which suggests that the disorder primarily stems from differences in structural connectivity cannot account for the recent finding that functional connectivity patterns do not differ between amusics and controls during a verbal memory task ( Albouy et al., 2019 ), as well as our finding that amusics and controls show similar functional connectivity patterns during passive listening to tone sequences. We suggest, therefore, that amusics neglect pitch because they have implicitly learned that their memory for pitch is unreliable, and that this down-weighting of pitch is reflected in decreased functional connectivity between right auditory areas and downstream task-relevant areas which integrate information from perceptual regions. One way to test this hypothesis would be to examine functional connectivity during perceptual categorization of consonant-vowel syllables as voiced versus unvoiced based on a pitch cue ( F0 of the following vowel ) and a durational cue ( voice onset time ). We predict, based on our previous findings ( Jasmin et al., 2020a ), that functional connectivity will not differ between amusics and controls on this task, a finding which would not be predicted by the pitch awareness account of amusia. We note that a previous fMRI study on amusia detected group differences in functional connectivity during passive listening to tones. That study used task-defined seed voxels in bilateral auditory cortex and found, in the amusia group, increased connectivity between left and right auditory cortex, but decreased connectivity between right auditory cortex and right inferior frontal gyrus ( Hyde et al., 2011 )

Congenital amusia is a rare condition characterized by impaired perception of and memory for pitch ( Peretz et al., 2002 ). Although congenital amusia presents as an auditory condition, auditory cortical responses are normal ( Moreau et al., 2013; Norman-Haignere et al., 2016 ), as is subcortical encoding of pitch ( Liu et al., 2015b ). The dominant view of amusia’s neural basis is that connectivity between right inferior frontal cortex and right auditory cortex is impaired, resulting in impaired conscious access to pitch information for guiding behavior ( Hyde et al., 2011; Albouy et al., 2013; Leveque et al., 2016; Zendel et al., 2015; see Peretz, 2016 for review ). While congenital amusia is believed to be innate, there is evidence that recovery is possible through training ( Whiteford and Oxenham, 2018 ). Although pitch is usually associated with music, it is also important for cueing categories in spoken language ( de Pijper and Sanderman, 1994; Streeter, 1978 ) and conveying emotion in speech ( Frick, 1985 ). In highly controlled laboratory tasks in which speech perception judgments must be made based on pitch alone, only minor deficits have been observed in amusia ( Liu et al., 2015a; Patel et al., 2008 ). In naturalistic speech perception contexts, people with amusia rarely report any difficulties ( Liu et al., 2010 ). This may be because, in natural speech, pitch variation tends to co-occur with variation in other acoustic dimensions, such as duration and amplitude. Our lab has shown that in such cases where multiple redundant cues are available, English-speaking individuals with amusia tend to rely less on pitch than non-amusic controls, suggesting they may calibrate their perception by down-weighting the cues that are less reliable for them ( Jasmin et al., 2020a )

. However, we also found that sites in left frontal cortex also showed large decreases in connectivity in amusia, also most prominently with right hemisphere auditory areas. Our results are consistent with an account that right hemisphere auditory areas are not only abnormally connected to right frontal areas ( as observed during tonal tasks ) but are less integrated with frontal left hemisphere regions when processing speech and language. Our null results for group differences in activation during speech processing are consistent with prior reports that amusics and controls do not differ in pitch representations within sensory regions. For example, the extent of pitch-responsive regions within auditory cortex has been shown to be similar in participants with amusia and controls ( Norman-Haignere et al., 2016 ). Brainstem encoding of pitch in speech and musical stimuli is similarly unimpaired in individuals with amusia ( Liu et al., 2015b ). Moreover, in oddball EEG paradigms, amusics show similar pre-attentive mismatch negativity responses to small pitch deviants, but impaired attention-dependent P300 responses ( Moreau et al., 2009; Peretz et al., 2009; Mignault Goulet et al., 2012; Moreau et al., 2013 ). These findings, along with the fact that amusics show intact non-volitional behavioral responses ( unconscious pitch shifts ) when presented with pitch-altered feedback of their own voice ( Hutchins and Peretz, 2012 ), have been interpreted as evidence that amusia is a disorder of pitch awareness rather than one of low-level pitch processing ( Peretz et al., 2009 ), with differences in structural connectivity as one possible foundation of this putative impaired pitch awareness ( Hyde et al., 2006; Loui et al., 2009; but see Chen et al., 2015 )

. In this study, no group differences were detected in task-related activation or functional connectivity during processing of speech ( whereas group differences were observed during processing of tones; Albouy et al., 2019 ). However, the connectivity analyses in this study focused on the silent retention interval in a task in which participants needed to maintain phonemic and not pitch-related information in memory; the analyses also used broader bilateral ROIs within networks associated with language processing. It remains an open question how functional connectivity in amusic and non-amusic participants may differ during speech encoding in pitch-related language tasks within regions of interest selected with a whole-brain data-driven approach. To determine whether the relative reliability of auditory dimensions in speech perception is reflected in functional connectivity, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan 15 individuals with amusia and 15 controls. Participants matched spoken sentences with visually presented ones on the basis of pitch, duration, or both acoustic dimensions. We found that amus exhibited decreased connectivity between left frontal regions and right hemisphere regions involved in pitch processing. Our results suggest that the unreliability of amics perception is linked to functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions and a compensatory mechanism.

    Title: The newly-arisen Devil facial tumour disease 2 (DFT2) reveals a mechanism for the emergence of a contagious cancer
    Abstract: Devil Facial Tumour 2 ( DFT2 ) is a recently discovered contagious cancer circulating in the Tasmanian devil ( Sarcophilus harrisii ), a species which already harbours a more widespread contagious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour 1 ( DFT1 ). Here we show that in contrast to DFT1, DFT2 cells express major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I molecules, demonstrating that loss of MHC is not necessary for the emergence of a contagious cancer. However, the most highly expressed MHC class I alleles in DFT2 cells are common among host devils or non-polymorphic, reducing immunogenicity in a population sharing these alleles. In parallel, MHC class I loss is emerging in vivo, thus DFT2 may be mimicking the evolutionary trajectory of DFT1. Based on these results we propose that contagious cancers may exploit partial histocompatibility between the tumour and host, but that loss of allogeneic antigens could facilitate widespread transmission of DFT2.

    Supporting Text:
    Here we show that DFT2 cells express classical and non-classical MHC class I molecules both in vitro and in vivo. This is in stark contrast to DFT1, a likely older and more widespread contagious cancer in the Tasmanian devil, which has lost expression of MHC class I ( Siddle et al., 2013 ). However, DFT2 cells express the non-polymorphic, non-classical MHC class I molecule ( Saha-UK ) likely reducing the immunogenicity of these tumour cells. Further, the classical MHC class I allele with the highest expression in DFT2 cells is shared with host devils. Finally, we show that MHC class I expression varies among DFT2 tumours in vivo, suggesting that MHC class I negative subclones could emerge as DFT2 transmits more widely. Our results demonstrate that DFT2 cells express MHC class I molecules, in contrast to DFT1 and the contagious cancer circulating among dogs, CTVT. DFT1 cells lack surface expression of MHC class I due to loss of β2m, TAP1 and TAP2 transcripts ( Siddle et al., 2013 ). However, loss of MHC class I in DFT1 is reversible upon treatment with the inflammatory cytokine IFNγ ( Siddle et al., 2013 ) and a small number of individuals have been found to have a successful immune response against the tumour ( Pye et al., 2016a ). Similarly, CTVT is thought to down-regulate MHC expression during transmission, but expression can be upregulated on CTVT cells during a tumour specific immune response from the host ( Yang et al., 1987 ). In contrast, we show that DFT2 cells express cell surface β2m molecules in addition to classical and non-classical class I heavy chains, indicating that functional MHC class I are present on the surface of DFT2 cells. The expression of a non-classical MHC class I molecule, Saha-UK, on DFT2 cells could reduce the immunogenicity of the tumour cells

., 2002; Pérez et al., 1998 ). However, subsequent cytokine signalling leads to lymphocyte infiltration of tumours, MHC up-regulation and either tumour regression or stasis of growth ( Yang et al., 1987 ). These findings have suggested that loss of MHC class I expression is necessary for the emergence and subsequent transmission of contagious cancers. Why DFT2 cells can pass between individuals without a protective immune response from the host is not known, nor are the conditions that have facilitated the emergence of two contagious cancers in this species. Here we show that in contrast to DFT1, DFT2 cells express MHC class I molecules. However, the dominantly expressed MHC class I alleles are either non-classical or shared with host devils and common in the wider population. Finally, DFT2 tumours were identified with evidence of MHC class I loss, indicating the emergence of MHC class I down-regulation in this tumour.

. In contrast, non-classical MHC class I molecules have little polymorphism and more diverse functions, including regulation of the immune response particularly by inhibiting natural killer ( NK ) cell function ( Braud et al., 1999 ). Allografts can be rejected within 7–14 days when host CD8+ T cells are exposed to non-self MHC class I molecules and their bound peptides on the surface of donor cells ( Rosenberg, 1993 ). Vertebrates have multiple MHC class I genes that are generally not orthologous between species due to rapid evolution ( Adams and Parham, 2001 ). Five MHC class I genes have been identified in the genomic region encoding the Tasmanian devil MHC ( Cheng et al., 2012 ). Saha-UA, -UB and –UC, are likely classical, with moderate levels of polymorphism and ubiquitous expression, while Saha-UD, –UK and -UM, are non-classical, with limited polymorphism and restricted expression ( Cheng et al., 2012; Cheng and Belov, 2014 ). We have previously demonstrated that DFT1 cells down-regulate MHC class I and class II molecules from their cell surface, thereby removing the targets for a T cell response ( Siddle et al., 2013 ). This is the first indication that DFT1 cells have similar immune evasion mechanisms to those found in single organism tumours ( Hicklin et al., 1999; McGranahan et al., 2017 ). Loss of MHC class I is due to epigenetic down-regulation of β2m, and the peptide transporter encoded by TAP1 and TAP2 ( Siddle et al., 2013 ) but MHC class I can be restored in DFT1 cells when treated with IFNγ ( Siddle et al., 2013 ). MHC class I positive DFT1 cells have since been used with some success in initiating immune responses to DFT1 cells ( Tovar et al., 2017 ). Down-regulation of MHC is also observed in the canine transmissible venereal tumour ( CTVT ), where MHC molecules are down-regulated during transmission and growth ( Hsiao et al., 2002; Pérez et al., 1998 )

., 2018 ). Thus, the frequency of this allele among the wider population may impact the ability of DFT2 to spread further. The heterogenic expression of MHC class I molecules in DFT2 biopsies suggests that MHC class I expression is not fixed and may be gradually lost in DFT2. While some MHC class I alleles are shared between DFT2 and its hosts, the tumour does have a number of unique alleles. SahaI*74/88 differs to SahaI*27 by only one amino acid that is not predicted to interact with the TCR, but SahaI*90 and SahaI*35 have a number of unique sites when compared to host MHC class I alleles. While these alleles have lower expression on DFT2 than SahaI*27, their presence may still initiate an immune response in some host animals, providing a selective pressure for MHC class I loss. It is possible that, like single organism tumours, DFT2 is undergoing immunoediting ( Dunn et al., 2002 ), which can operate to down-regulate specific MHC class I alleles that are immunogenic ( McGranahan et al., 2017 ) or select for mutations that remove or modulate total MHC class I expression. However, while four of the six primary DFT2 tumours examined have CD3 positive cells in the tumour mass, which may indicate an immune response, the infiltration is notably present in DFT2_812, which is negative for classical MHC class I and could be expected to be CD3 negative. Thus, further detailed analysis is needed to define the host immune response to DFT2 and its role in shaping tumour evolution. While DFT1 cells currently circulating in the population are MHC class I negative, it is possible that DFT1 down regulated MHC class I expression after the tumour became transmissible and that initial transmission events were among individuals that shared prevalent MHC class I alleles. This is supported by previous studies that have found reduced polymorphism in devil MHC and microsatellite loci ( Jones et al., 2007; Siddle et al., 2007 )

Contagious cancers have emerged and circulate in two species of mammals ( dogs and Tasmanian devils ) and four species of molluscs ( Metzger et al., 2015, 2016; Novinski, 1876; Pearse and Swift, 2006 ). The Tasmanian devil is the only mammalian species in which two independent contagious cancers exist, Devil Facial Tumour 1 ( DFT1 ) and Devil Facial Tumour 2 ( DFT2 ) ( Pye et al., 2016b ). Although both cancers have similar gross morphology, causing tumours on the face and neck of Tasman devils, D1 is older and more widespread than D2 ( Py et al, 2016b ). D1 has lost expression of MHC class I ( Siddle et al,2013 ) while D2 express MHC I ( this study ). The canine transmissible venereal tumour ( CTV ) in dogs is thought to downregulate MHC expression during transmission ( Hiao et al,2002; Pérez et al,1998 ) but can upregulate MHC on CTV cells during tumour specific immune response from host ( Yang et al,1987 ). Here we show that D2 cells express classical and non-class MHC I both in vitro and in vivo, in contrast to D1 which lost MHC I ( Siddle et al,201 ). D2 cells express non-polymorphic non-class M I ( Saha ) reducing immunogenicity of tum cells. The most expressed MHC I allele in D2 is shared with host devils. MHC I varies among D2 tumours in vivo suggesting M I subclones could emerge D2 transmits more. Our results demonstrate D2 express M I in contrast D1 and CTV. D1 lacks surface M I due to loss βm TAP TAP ( Siddle et al2013 ) but loss I in D1 reversible with IFγ (iddle et al201 ) and some individuals have immune response to tum ( Py et2016a ) CTV downregulate M during transmission but can upregulate CTV cells tum specific response host ( Yang et198 ).
Researchers have used optogenetic mapping in mice to investigate the neural circuits of the granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG), a region critical for both spatial and non-spatial behaviors. They found a dissociation between parallel circuits in superficial SG to process disparate inputs, with the thalamus and subiculum sources of spatial information strongly recruiting low-rhe (LR) pyramidal cells, while neighboring-sp (RS) cells are preferentially controlled by clastral and cingulate inputs, sources of nonpatial information. Precise subamin axonal and dendritic arbor within SG layer 1 permits parallel processing. Observed thalamortical dynamics enable LR neurons to compute speed of rotation despite head inputs not explicitly encoding speed. Thalamort synapses onto LR cells are depressing, allowing them to compute angular speed from direction inputs. Modeling demonstrates depressing synapses enable robust encoding of angular speed in postsynaptic LR rate.

LR cells are unique among pyram cells in SG, with no evidence of similar cells in other regions. They are the defining feature of RSG, with distinct electrophys properties playing a role in R's capacity to process thal head inputs. LR have lowob and lack spike adaptation, referred to as lowhe (LR) neurons. They also called late-sp (LS) but this name is not optimal, as many SG neurons are late-sp, including FS interneurons and some RS. Name late-sp is not distinctive of LR or excitatory neurons in this region.

Synaptic dynamics of thamic inputs allow robust encoding of angular by LR models, despite inputs only containing direction not speed. Results suggest LR are positioned to support spatial computations in SG. Determining parallel streams integration in downstream within ipsilateral and contralateral gran and dysgran SG is next step toward understanding retrosial computations. Proposed mechanism computing speed is general and may be relevant to other circuits employing HD-like codes. Thalamort syn can support conjunct encoding head and angular speed individual cells. Predictions about LR properties can be tested in vivo: high rates and widths, correlated with angular speed, concave velocity curves, and conjunct encoding.

    Title: Seizures are a druggable mechanistic link between TBI and subsequent tauopathy
    Abstract: Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) is a prominent risk factor for dementias including tauopathies like chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ). The mechanisms that promote prion-like spreading of Tau aggregates after TBI are not fully understood, in part due to lack of tractable animal models. Here, we test the putative role of seizures in promoting the spread of tauopathy. We introduce ‘tauopathy reporter’ zebrafish expressing a genetically encoded fluorescent Tau biosensor that reliably reports accumulation of human Tau species when seeded via intraventricular brain injections. Subjecting zebrafish larvae to a novel TBI paradigm produced various TBI features including cell death, post–traumatic seizures, and Tau inclusions. Bath application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued TBI-induced tauopathy and cell death. These data suggest a role for seizure activity in the prion-like seeding and spreading of tauopathy following TBI. Further work is warranted regarding anti-convulsants that dampen post-traumatic seizures as a route to moderating subsequent tauopathy.

    Supporting Text:
   . Currently, no available treatments are applicable to all tauopathies, which remain as devastating and inevitably fatal dementias. Zebrafish larvae, fostered by appropriate innovations, now offer a potent complement both to rodent models of TBI and to cellular models of tauopathy. Our engineered fish allowed us to reveal post-traumatic seizures as a druggable mechanistic link between TBI and the prion-like progression of tauopathy. Intriguingly, our conclusions have potential for translation to TBI clinics where anti-convulsants are already in use as prophylactics for post-traumatic epilepsy, though further work remains to address if they mitigate ( the risk or severity of ) later progression of CTE, AD or other tauopathies.

. The recent revelation that most TBI patients, whether they suffered from single or repetitive brain trauma, all exhibited Tau pathology similar to CTE ( Washington et al., 2016; Zanier et al., 2018 ) suggests all forms of TBI might incorporate tauopathies. Our mode of TBI on larval zebrafish entails a pressure wave that most closely mimics a blast injury ( e. g. as experienced by military personnel or civilians near an explosion, and presumably producing injury throughout the body ), but the etiology leading to tauopathy probably has many similarities regardless of the mode of the initiating TBI. We inspected the role of seizure activity and/or neuronal excitability, as well as the role of dynamin-dependent endocytosis, during the progression of tauopathy after TBI. We focussed our attention on seizure activity in part because seizures frequently occur in TBI patients following blast traumatic injury ( Englander et al., 2014; Kovacs et al., 2014 ). We hypothesized that neuronal excitability and seizure activity after TBI can play a role in accelerating the wide dissemination of Tau pathology. As such, we introduced two new approaches to test this hypothesis. The first approach was to engineer a novel in vivo Tau biosensor model in zebrafish that can visualize pathological Tau spreading and accumulation within the intact and vibrant CNS. The Tau biosensor zebrafish express human tau4R-GFP reporter protein, and we confirmed its ability to detect Tau seeds from various sources both in vivo and in vitro, similar to previously engineered in vitro models ( Kaufman et al., 2016; Sanders et al., 2014 ). Our second approach was to introduce and optimize an elegantly simple technique to cause pressure-wave induced TBI, similar to human blast TBI, in zebrafish larvae

. Following TBI, some larvae exhibited seizure-like movements, while some did not seem to move abnormally relative to untreated fish ( Figure 3H ). We sorted the larvae subjected to TBI into groups exhibiting the seizure-like behavior and those that displayed no overtly abnormal movement. Larvae exhibiting seizure-like behavior after TBI went on to develop abundant spinal cord aggregates ( fivefold increase, p<0. 001 ) in comparison to larvae that showed no seizure-like response to TBI ( Figure 5E ). To assess the hypothesis that seizure activity has a causal role in increasing the abundance of Tau aggregates in our TBI model, we employed convulsant and anti-convulsant drugs to modulate the seizure intensity and in vivo neural activity. We selected drugs that are well-established to behave similarly in zebrafish as in mammals, although it is perhaps notable that the multi-day drug application used here is longer than the acute applications typically considered in zebrafish ( Ellis et al., 2012 ). Our hypothesis predicted that decreasing seizure-like activity following TBI would reduce tauopathy. Indeed, applying the anti-convulsant drug Retigabine ( RTG ), that opens voltage-gated potassium channels ( KCNQ, Kv7 ), resulted in a significant decrease in the abundance of GFP+ puncta ( p=0. 0107 ) with many TBI larvae not developing any Tau4R-GFP aggregates ( Figure 5F ). Similarly, intensifying post-traumatic seizures via application of the convulsant kainate increased the abundance on tauopathy fourfold ( p<0. 0001. Figure 5G ) in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5—figure supplement 5 ). Kainate did not increase Tau4R-GFP+ puncta in the absence of TBI. Surprisingly, the convulsant 4-aminopyridine did not increase tauopathy ( explored below ). To assess if the impacts of kainate and retigabine on tauopathy were directly due to their modulation of post-traumatic seizures, we applied effective doses of each in concert

. It will be of interest to resolve what types of neurons and neurochemistry are most impacted by the injury. Notably, the subsequent Tau4R-GFP aggregates were also most prominent in this hindbrain region, and while this could be coincidental, or perhaps an artefact of a hidden differential Tau4R-GFP abundance, it is also possibly a result of increased neural activity. Regarding the etiology of tauopathy subsequent to TBI, the CaMPARI quantification provided us important validation that neural activity was substantively impacted by TBI, complementing the evidence of increased seizure-like movements. This supported our rationale that convulsant and anti-convulsant drug treatments might modulate neural activity and thereby accelerate or decelerate tauopathy accumulation. Indeed, we had noted the occurrence of post-traumatic seizures in most of our TBI samples, which is in agreement with the prevalence of seizures in blast TBI patients and TBI rodent models ( Bugay et al., 2020; Kovacs et al., 2014 ). However, whether post-traumatic seizures contribute to prion-like spreading of Tau pathology ( observed after TBI or not ) was unknown. Beyond TBI, several investigations have supported an association between Tau pathology and seizures ( Sánchez et al., 2018; Tai et al., 2016 ). Studies on epileptic human temporal structure revealed accumulation of Tau aggregates ( Sánchez et al., 2018 ). In 3XTg AD mice, induced chronic epilepsy was associated with changes of inter-neuronal p-Tau expression ( Yan et al., 2012 ). Additionally, data obtained from postmortem analysis of patient tissues with AD and drug resistant epilepsy uncovered a correlation between symptomatic seizures, increased Braak staging and accelerated Tau accumulation ( Thom et al., 2011 )

., 2011 ). Interestingly, the presence of tau deposits in epileptic patients and the similarity of its pathology to CTE suggest a conceivable role for seizures influencing the progression of Tau pathology in a similar manner to TBI ( Puvenna et al., 2016 ). Indeed, our data from the application of the convulsant kainate here support the role of post-traumatic seizure in enhancing Tau abundance and cell death in our TBI model ( Figure 5G, H ). This finding is in line with observations in a patient with epilepsy and a history of head injury, in which progressive Tau pathology was noted ( Geddes et al., 1999; Thom et al., 2011 ). Intriguingly, reducing seizure activity after TBI via anti-convulsant drugs was able to significantly reduce tauopathy and cell death, providing further evidence of the relationship between seizures and tauopathy in TBI ( Figure 5F, G and H ). The mechanism of drug action appears to be dominated by its anticonvulsant properties, because its effects were reversed by co-application of convulsants. Thus, anti-convulsants are intriguing as a route to slowing progression of tauopathy following TBI, and it is encouraging that they are already commonly deployed to prevent post-traumatic seizures. One particular convulsant drug, 4-AP, inhibited tauopathy in our TBI model ( Figure 6A and B ), contrary to our hypothesis that seizure intensity is positively correlated with tauopathy following TBI. 4-AP is a voltage-gated potassium channel blocker that enhances neuronal firing activity and has been used often in zebrafish seizure studies ( Kanyo et al., 2020b; Kasatkina, 2016; Liu et al. 2017 ). The lack of effect of 4-AP on tauopathy in our T model suggests that seizure intensity is not the sole driver of tauopathy, and that other factors such as neuronal excitability or endocytosis may also play a role in the progression of tau after TBI.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the spatial configuration and functional connectivity of brain regions using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI). They found that the spatial arrangement of functional regions strongly interacts with measures of brain connectivity and is predictive of non-imaging measures of behavior and lifestyle. The study suggests that cross-subject variations in the configuration of functional brain regions are often interpreted as changes in functional connectivity. The findings have implications for the interpretation of functional imaging data and cognitive traits.

 The organization of the brain into large-scale networks has been extensively investigated using rfMRI. Spontaneous fluctuations in brain regions as measured by rf show correlations with each other, revealing patterns of functional connectivity (FC). Extensive connectivity between cortical and subcortical regions is a feature of brain anatomy and function, and dysfunctional is associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders. The study aimed to determine which aspects of rf data most sensitively reflect trait variability across subjects. Neural sources of variability include the strength of coupling between populations and spatial organisation of regions. The study identified variability in the topography of functional across subjects and suggest this is primary driver of cross-sub trait variability in FC measures.

 Variability in spatial features capture a direct representation of subject than temporal correlations between regions. The presence of behaviorally cross-sub variance in maps is not surprising, but the fact that these features capture unique information is unexpected. The implication is that cross-sub information in adopted 'connectivity' reflects variability in location of regions rather than coupling. Partial results show network matrices contain little unique subject information not reflected in spatial organisation. The conceptualisation of brain operationally defined is relevant to interpretation. Some paration models assume piecewise constant connectivity within parcel, while others presume uniformity and recognises heterogeneity.

The study found that spatial in topography of functional is strongly associated with behavior and lifestyle. Network matrices reflect little unique information not captured by spatial variability. The interpretation of FC representing cross-sub trait variability in coupling may not be valid. Up to 62% of variance in matrices can be explained by spatial. The findings have implications for interpretation and contribute to understanding the role of FC in cognition and disease. Consistent with previous research highlighting structured-sub variance in functional and anatomical networks. Recent work shows resting state maps can predict activation accurately and highly variable subnetworks can be identified.

Softcell models allow multiple modes of organisation, representing information through interactions and shape. Both PROFOM and multimodal models capture cross-sub spatial variability, but location overlaps modestly. The need for research into optimal representation organisation is highlighted. Anatomical features were not investigated, but correlations between surface size and C weights suggest variability may contribute. Further research into structural and functional measures and trait variability is needed. The findings are relevant to approaches to study connectivity.

    Title: TBP/TFIID-dependent activation of MyoD target genes in skeletal muscle cells
    Abstract: Change in the identity of the components of the transcription pre-initiation complex is proposed to control cell type-specific gene expression. Replacement of the canonical TFIID-TBP complex with TRF3/TBP2 was reported to be required for activation of muscle-gene expression. The lack of a developmental phenotype in TBP2 null mice prompted further analysis to determine whether TBP2 deficiency can compromise adult myogenesis. We show here that TBP2 null mice have an intact regeneration potential upon injury and that TBP2 is not expressed in established C2C12 muscle cell or in primary mouse MuSCs. While TFIID subunits and TBP are downregulated during myoblast differentiation, reduced amounts of these proteins form a complex that is detectable on promoters of muscle genes and is essential for their expression. This evidence demonstrates that TBP2 does not replace TBP during muscle differentiation, as previously proposed, with limiting amounts of TFIID-TBP being required to promote muscle-specific gene expression.

    In this work, we demonstrate that TBP, but not TBP2, is the essential component of the PIC that promotes muscle gene expression in differentiated skeletal muscles. We found that TBP2 is not expressed in myotubes derived from either C2C12 myoblasts, nor from primary mouse MuSCs. Consistently, TBP2-deficient mice displayed an intact regeneration potential, and MuSCs isolated from TBP2-deficient muscles differentiated into myotubes with the same efficiency as wild type MuSCs. This evidence firmly supports the conclusion that TBP2 does not replace TBP during muscle differentiation, as previously proposed by Deato et al. ( Deato and Tjian, 2007 ). We have observed downregulation of TFIID subunits at both the RNA and protein levels in differentiated myotubes, compared to proliferating myoblasts, as has previously been reported ( Deato and Tjian, 2007; Zhou et al., 2013 ). Recently, a mechanism for ubiquitination-mediated downregulation of TBP protein in skeletal myotubes was reported ( Li et al., 2015 ). Therefore, the plausible scenario in skeletal muscle specific transcription is that limited TFIID helps to restrict the assembly of the transcription competent PIC at a selected subset of muscle specific genes. Our findings that TBP/TFIID is functional in muscle progenitors and their differentiated progeny are in agreement with earlier studies showing that TBP was able to bind the MyoD promoter in a TATA-dependent manner ( Leibham et al., 1994 ). It has been also shown that MyoD efficiently stimulated TFIID-dependent basal transcription ( Heller and Bengal, 1998; Dilworth, 2004 ). Moreover, an endogenous interaction between MyoD and TBP in both myoblasts and myotubes was demonstrated, and in myotubes, MyoD and components of PIC TBP and TFIIB were found to be recruited to the proximal promoter of the alpha-sarcoglycan muscle gene promoter ( Delgado-Olguín et al., 2006 )

. Nevertheless this hypothesis has been challenged by the observation that TBP2 null ( TBP2_KO = TBP2 knock out ) mice do not display any skeletal muscle phenotype ( Gazdag et al., 2009 ), indicating that TBP2 is dispensable for developmental myogenesis ( see http://www. europhenome. org/databrowser/viewer. jsp? set=true&m=true&x=Both Split&ln=Tbp2&project=All&zygosity=All&m=true&l=10386 ). However, Gazdag et al. did not explore the integrity of the regeneration potential of skeletal muscles in TBP2 null mice during adult life, and thus have not ruled out the possibility that TBP2 can specifically promote the expression of muscle genes in muscle stem ( satellite ) cells ( MuSCs ) - the direct effectors of post-natal and adult skeletal myogenesis ( Chang and Rudnicki, 2014 ). MuSCs are usually found beneath the basal lamina of unperturbed muscles in a dormant state ( quiescence ) ( Mauro, 1961 ), but are rapidly activated upon damage to give rise to new, differentiated myofibers through extensive epigenetic reprogramming ( Dilworth and Blais, 2011; Sartorelli and Juan, 2011; Moresi et al., 2015 ). Two key molecular events that invariably coincide with MuSC activation and commitment toward myogenic differentiation are ( i ) the expression of skeletal muscle transcription master regulator MyoD ( Zammit et al., 2004; Tapscott, 1988 ) and ( ii ) the activation of the p38 signaling ( Jones et al., 2005 ). These pathways cooperate to promote SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling and to increase levels of the active chromatin mark H3K4me3 ( Bernstein et al., 2005 ) at promoters of muscle genes ( Simone, 2004; Rampalli et al., 2007; Forcales et al., 2012 ). Indeed, studies from the Rando group have revealed that in activated MuSCs the large majority of muscle gene promoters show enrichment in H3K4me3 ( Liu et al., 2013 )

. Error bars represent a standard deviation between two independent MuSC isolations, each cultured and quantified in triplicate. Student’s t test was used for statistical analyses in C and E, n. s. - not significant. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 12534. 003 Our in vivo data on adult muscle regeneration, as well as the intact differentiation potential of Tbpl2-lacking MuSCs ex vivo demonstrate that TBP2 is dispensable for adult skeletal muscle differentiation. Our data demonstrating the lack of requirement of TBP2 for adult skeletal muscle regeneration prompted us to compare the RNA expression profile of Tbp and Tbpl2 genes in MuSCs isolated from skeletal muscles of wild type mouse by FACS, and in the C2C12 myogenic cell line ( Blau et al., 1983 ). Tbp expression was detected in both MuSC-derived myotubes and in C2C12 myotubes ( Figure 2A ). On the contrary, we could not detect Tbpl2 expression in myotubes derived from MuSCs or C2C12s ( Figure 2A ). Ckm RNA expression in MuSCs and in C2C12 confirms that cells were differentiated into mytubes. As a control for Tbpl2 RNA detection, we analyzed total RNA extracted from murine ovary tissue ( Figure 2A ), as previous work demonstrated the ovary-specific expression of TBP2 in mice ( Gazdag et al., 2009 ). Independent analysis of publicly available RNA-seq data from C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes ( Trapnell et al., 2010 ) and of our RNA-seq data from MyoD-converted human fibroblasts, further confirmed the absence of Tbpl2 expression in skeletal myoblasts and myotubes ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 12534. 004Figure 2. TBP2 is not expressed in myotubes. ( A ) RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from MuSC-derived myotubes, and from C2C12-derived myotubes. RNA isolated from murine ovaries was used as a control for Tbpl2 expression ( gene coding for TBP2 protein ). Relative expression of indicated genes is presented as a fraction of Gapdh expression

To investigate the role of TBP2 in postnatal and adult skeletal myogenesis in vivo we assessed the muscle regeneration potential of TBP2 null mice ( Gazdag et al., 2009 ) in response to injury. Notexin-mediated muscle injury triggers extensive muscle damage and stimulates adult muscle regeneration and post-natal myogenesis in vivo, during which damaged muscle is replaced by newly formed myofibers arising from activated MuSCs. Histological assessment of regenerating muscles showed a complete recovery of the muscle architecture, with abundant presence of centrally nucleated fibers in both wild type ( WT ) and TBP2 null muscles at 12 days post injury - a time point when muscle regeneration is near completion ( Figure 1A ). Both WT and TBP2 null mice contain similar numbers of Pax7 positive MuSCs in a sub-laminar position within unperturbed muscles ( Figure 1B upper panel, 1C ). This result indicates that there are no defects in MuSC ontogenesis in the absence of Tbpl2 expression. Importantly, we detected comparable numbers of MuSCs in muscles of WT and TBP2 null mice 12 days after injury ( Figure 1B lower panel, 1C ), indicating an intact capacity of adult MuSCs to proliferate, self-renew and differentiate during ongoing muscle regeneration in the absence of TBP2. Finally, we used Fluorescence Assisted Cell Sorting ( FACS ) to isolate MuSCs from skeletal muscles of WT and TBP2 null mice before and 12 days after notinjury ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1.1 ) and found no difference in the number of MuSC between the two genotypes ( Figure 1— supplement 1.1 ). These data demonstrate that TBP is dispensable for adult muscle regeneration in vivo and suggest that T2 does not replace TBP during postnatal myogenesis as previously proposed by Deato et al ( De and Tjian,2007 ).

    Title: Targeted cortical reorganization using optogenetics in non-human primates
    Abstract: Brain stimulation modulates the excitability of neural circuits and drives neuroplasticity. While the local effects of stimulation have been an active area of investigation, the effects on large-scale networks remain largely unexplored. We studied stimulation-induced changes in network dynamics in two macaques. A large-scale optogenetic interface enabled simultaneous stimulation of excitatory neurons and electrocorticographic recording across primary somatosensory ( S1 ) and motor ( M1 ) cortex ( Yazdan-Shahmorad et al., 2016 ). We tracked two measures of network connectivity, the network response to focal stimulation and the baseline coherence between pairs of electrodes; these were strongly correlated before stimulation. Within minutes, stimulation in S1 or M1 significantly strengthened the gross functional connectivity between these areas. At a finer scale, stimulation led to heterogeneous connectivity changes across the network. These changes reflected the correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity, consistent with Hebbian plasticity models. This work extends Hebbian plasticity models to large-scale circuits, with significant implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation.

   ., 2013; Lajoie et al., 2017 ). In particular, Fetz and colleagues implemented an activity-dependent stimulation protocol, effectively introducing an artificial connection between two sites in the motor cortex ( Jackson et al., 2006; Lucas and Fetz, 2013 ). Continuous reinforcement of this artificial connection led to a stable functional change in stimulation-evoked movements, indicating that stimulation induces large-scale plasticity. Recently these results were reproduced in a modeling work at the network level ( Lajoie et al., 2017 ). Similar results have been observed using open-loop stimulation protocols to induce targeted plasticity between two cortical sites ( Rebesco and Miller, 2011; Seeman et al., 2017 ). Notably, these papers have reported off-target effects, but these were either interpreted as global changes in excitability or were not explained. Although the results from closed-loop and open-loop experiments suggest large-scale plasticity, the underlying neural network changes remain unexplored. Here, we measure connectivity across sensorimotor cortex and track changes in network connectivity in response to open-loop stimulation. This work takes advantage of a large-scale optogenetic interface ( Yazdan-Shahmorad et al., 2016 ) that enables us to simultaneously stimulate populations of excitatory neurons while recording large-scale μ-electrocorticography ( μ-ECoG ) activity across two brain areas, S1 and M1. We first establish and compare two measures of functional connectivity that provide complementary views of the mechanisms of plasticity. Next, we investigate how stimulation impacts connectivity between and within cortical areas. We then test whether stimulation-evoked activity drives large-scale network plasticity in a Hebbian manner. The goal of this work is to investigate large-scale functional reorganization following stimulation, which will inform future neurorehabilitation strategies.

. While stimulation-induced long-term potentiation ( LTP ) and STDP have been observed within local circuits ( Iriki et al., 1989; Feldman, 2012; Shulz and Jacob, 2010 ), and have been posited as the mechanism of stimulation-induced plasticity within M1 ( Lajoie et al., 2017 ) this is the first study explaining large-scale changes across cortical networks. Notably, conditioning drove increases in coherence between S1 and M1 only in the theta band ( 4–8 Hz ). This result is difficult to interpret because the conditioning stimulation frequency ( 5 or 7 Hz ) itself lies within the range of the theta band. It is possible that Hebbian mechanisms are selectively enhancing connectivity at the conditioning frequency. It’s also possible that theta band coherence best reflects the plastic connections between these areas. Since we did not vary stimulation frequency outside of this range, no strong conclusions can be drawn. The temporal dynamics of both measures reveal a trend of increasing inter-area connectivity throughout the experiment. This trend suggests that neuroplastic changes start almost immediately after the start of stimulation. Interestingly, we observed unlearning of the stimulation-induced changes during passive recording, though some of the stimulation-induced changes persisted. Previous studies have shown that longer conditioning sessions ( 3–48 hr ) result in changes that are stable over timescales comparable to the length of conditioning ( Jackson et al., 2006; Lucas and Fetz, 2013; Seeman et al., 2017; Nishimura et al., 2013; Rebesco and Miller, 2011 ). Further experiments are required to estimate the stability of plasticity following optogenetic stimulation over longer time scales. Given that Hebbian rules have been used extensively to explain synaptic plasticity, we wanted to explore the idea that large-scale stimulation-induced changes are consistent with Hebbian plasticity

. The strongest test of the Hebbian model is to compare the correlations directly induced by stimulation with the changes in network correlations observed after conditioning. Our ability to record artifact-free signals during stimulation allowed us to perform this test. We did find a predictive linear relationship between stimulus-evoked coherence and the changes in baseline coherence after conditioning. Furthermore, the model held for both simple and complex spatiotemporal patterns of stimulation-evoked activity. There is a large body of research on sensory cortical plasticity ( Merzenich et al., 1983; Qi et al., 2011 ). This study differs in two key dimensions. First, previous work has largely focused on how changes in the statistics of sensory input and/or motor output affect the cortical representation in sensory cortex. In contrast, we have directly manipulated cortical circuits, without a detailed knowledge of the somatotopic map. Also, earlier work studied plasticity on the time scale of days to months, while we are studying changes across minutes. Despite these differences, both appear to support a key role for Hebbian learning in sensorimotor cortical plasticity. Still, a deeper understanding of the relationship between these bodies of work would require a study of intermediate time-frames as well, along with detailed cortical mapping. These are important questions for future work. The large-scale interface used in this study enabled robust estimation of functional connectivity and stimulation-evoked correlations. However, there are several limitations in our experimental setup. First, surface stimulation combined with high blue light absorption and scattering in tissue limits the depth of light penetration ( Yizhar et al., 2011 ). The ability to target specific cortical layers would help us understand the anatomical basis of the plasticity we observed

. A magnified example heatmap is shown in Figure 6A, right; top panel. This example shows heterogeneous changes in connectivity across the network. We next asked whether such heterogeneous changes are to be expected. A Hebbian plasticity model suggests that the fine-scale changes in connectivity should reflect the statistics of plasticity-inducing activity. In this case, we predicted that correlated stimulation-evoked activity between two cortical sites would strengthen the functional connectivity between them, while uncorrelated or anti-correlated stimulation-evoked activity would weaken their functional connectivity. We quantified stimulation-induced correlations by measuring the pairwise coherence during the conditioning block and subtracting out the coherence calculated during baseline recording ( thought to be representative of initial connectivity ). We refer to this difference as the stimulus-evoked coherence. Indeed, in the example session of Figure 6A, one can see a similarity between the pattern of changes in baseline coherence across the array ( left panel ) with the stimulus-evoked coherence ( middle panel ). To quantify this similarity, we used linear regression to predict changes in baseline coherence across sites based on the stimulus-evoked coherence. Importantly, both of these quantities use the initial baseline coherence as a reference. So to avoid spurious correlations introduced by subtracting the same data from the two regression variables, we split the baseline recording blocks into two intervals and used the data from only one interval for each regressor ( See Materials and Methods for more details ). Data from the example session in Figure 6A is shown as a scatter plot in Figure 6B, along with the calculated regression parameters. The plot shows a strong correlation between the stimulus-evoked coherence and changes in baseline coherence

. Second, surface µECoG recordings reflect a summation of nearby neural activity, making comparisons to explicit synaptic learning rules difficult. Depth recordings would reveal more detailed information about spike timing, the role of different cortical layers, and the relationship between synaptic and large-scale plasticity. Lastly, the µECoG arrays were placed acutely for each experiment. To investigate the long-term effects of stimulation we need stable, chronic recordings. Our results offer a proof-of-concept that optogenetic stimulation can drive predictable changes in network-scale connectivity. The success of optogenetics in NHP represents an important step forward for translational use ( Doroudchi et al., 2011; Han, 2012 ). The continued rapid progress in the field has the potential to bring cell-type specific neuromodulation therapies to the clinic. However, even where therapeutic approaches ultimately wind up using electrical stimulation, the advantages of optogenetics make it a powerful tool for better understanding the underlying mechanisms of plasticity and, thus, for the development of therapeutic applications of neuromodulation. This framework also provides scientific insight into the mechanisms of neural plasticity. Future efforts should focus on linking the plasticity results presented here with improvements in motor function or sensory perception, which will have important implications for stimulation-based therapies.

    Title: Preserved extrastriate visual network in a monkey with substantial, naturally occurring damage to primary visual cortex
    Abstract: Lesions of primary visual cortex ( V1 ) lead to loss of conscious visual perception with significant impact on human patients. Understanding the neural consequences of such damage may aid the development of rehabilitation methods. In this rare case of a Rhesus macaque ( monkey S ), likely born without V1, the animal’s in-group behaviour was unremarkable, but visual task training was impaired. With multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging, visual structures outside of the lesion appeared normal. Visual stimulation under anaesthesia with checkerboards activated lateral geniculate nucleus of monkey S, while full-field moving dots activated pulvinar. Visual cortical activation was sparse but included face patches. Consistently across lesion and control monkeys, functional connectivity analysis revealed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas temporally correlated with V5/MT activation, even without V1. Despite robust subcortical responses to visual stimulation, we found little evidence for strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT supporting residual visual function or blindsight-like phenomena.

    Supporting Text:
   . Based on our knowledge of functional representations, the activation of face patches in temporal cortex discussed above must be driven by a visual subcortical input other than to V5/MT. Since it is likely to be a wider pattern of cortical activation that underpins visual awareness and behaviour ( e. g. Papanikolaou et al., 2019 ), it might be supported by a wider pattern of weak, parallel subcortical inputs directly to extrastriate visual cortex. Visual structures, both cortical and subcortical, outside of the large lesion of primary visual cortex remained intact in monkey S with little evidence of atrophy. This suggests a role in residual visual function, consistent with an intact network of extrastriate cortical visual areas that was comparable to control monkeys. While the structural connectivity between the subcortical regions and area V5/MT was weak, the microstructure was intact. Thus, unlike adult-acquired lesions, there appeared to be a maintenance of structural integrity of the visual system when V1 is damaged neonatally. This may explain the increased residual function both, in monkey S and in children with early damage to the visual cortex.

. However, if confirmed, this result would suggest other intact subcortical inputs in this monkey to temporal visual cortex from pulvinar, claustrum, and amygdala supporting these activations ( Grimaldi et al., 2016 ). Given that the day-to-day behaviour of monkey S did not cause concern, the monkey presumably had a reasonable amount of residual vision, in spite of the extensive cortical lesions. Considering all the evidence, it appears that the dorsal visual network was intact, and would have the potential to support active vision ( Koyama et al., 2004; Davare et al., 2011 ), as seen in a number of human patients with damage to the visual cortical system ( Goodale and Milner, 1992; Bridge et al., 2013; Goodale, 2011 ). Retinal information may reach the dorsal visual areas via the weak pathways with LGN and pulvinar, but the lack of consistent visual cortex activation, possibly due to the anaesthesia, makes this question difficult to answer. The lack of significant differences between monkey S and controls in the pathways between LGN-V5/MT and pulvinar-V5/MT suggests either or both could support residual visual abilities. So, what might be the source of visual input that supports visual function and presumably shaped an intact extrastriate visual brain network? One possibility could be some preserved V1 connectivity. But given the size and location of the bilateral lesion, this argument is difficult to sustain. Another possibility would parallel, alternative inputs to cortex. Earlier MRI studies in V1-lesioned monkeys have shown parallel activation in early visual areas, like V2, V3 and V4 as well as V5/MT ( Schmid et al., 2010 ). It has been suggested that V2 might be a crucial contribution to visual function and awareness ( Merigan et al., 1993 ). These visual cortical areas also receive direct subcortical input ( Wong-Riley, 1976; Kaas and Lyon, 2007 )

. By contrast, the activation pattern in the pulvinar to moving dots for monkey S appeared to be as great as in the best control subject, which is consistent with an increased role for this structure due to the perinatal nature of the lesion ( Warner et al., 2015 ). Moving dot stimuli in the healthy and hemianopic human brain consistently lead to activation of hMT+, even when damage is bilateral ( Arcaro et al., 2018; Bridge et al., 2010 ). Thus, the lack of consistent activation in V5/MT in monkey S and some controls suggests a suppressive effect of the anaesthetic, which was most evident with larger doses of the volatile anaesthetic. Also, drifting eye movements and inappropriate ocular accommodation under anaesthesia could have affected the functional activation we measured. Nevertheless, for visual motion stimuli we saw in monkey S foci of activation in the region of V5/MT in dorsal STS of both hemispheres, suggesting any activation may be sub-threshold and difficult to detect with BOLD. Even without the strong visually-evoked V5/MT responses, it was possible to map out a functional network of cortical areas showing a similar BOLD response over time to V5/MT. This was very similar in monkey S and the control monkeys, suggesting that this inter-cortical activity in the macaque visual brain was not affected by the loss of V1. Interestingly, none of the monkeys included LGN in this functional network, perhaps reflecting the weak anatomical connectivity between these areas in typical animals ( Sincich et al., 2004 ). For all monkeys, FEF was included in the functional network, as would be predicted from a knowledge of the V5/MT connectivity ( Schall et al., 1995 ). Surprisingly, we also found activation of two of the most pertinent face patches along the STS in monkey S – in the context of little other consistent activations. Without the comparison to scrambled faces, this result needs further scrutiny

. There are a few cases of damage acquired in adulthood, some of whom have been extensively studied ( de Gelder et al., 2008; Hervais-Adelman et al., 2015; Arcaro et al., 2018 ), but also a number of children who acquired lesions congenitally or through perinatal stroke ( Mundinano et al., 2017 ). The presence of residual visual function suggests that functional visual networks can develop or be sustained in the absence of the main visual input to cortex. In monkeys, in the absence of primary visual cortex, a number of potential pathways have been proposed to convey visual information from the eyes to extrastriate visual cortex. Direct input to extrastriate visual cortex bypassing V1 may arise from the lateral geniculate nucleus ( LGN ) or the pulvinar nucleus directly to extrastriate visual areas V2, V3, V4, V5/MT and inferotemporal cortex ( Wong-Riley, 1976; Sincich et al., 2004; Kaas and Lyon, 2007; Warner et al., 2010; Gattass et al., 2014 ). In humans, both pulvinar and LGN inputs to V5/MT have been implicated ( de Gelder et al., 2008; Ajina et al., 2015b ). In addition to its direct retinal input, the LGN also receives projections from the superior colliculus ( SC ) ( Harting et al., 1991; Stepniewska et al., 1999 ). The pulvinar nucleus receives input from the SC, although likely not into the appropriate subdivision for projectiions to V5/MT, and pulvinar might receive surviving early projections directly from the retina ( Stepniewska et al., 1999; Warner et al., 2010 ). It has been suggested that early-life V1 lesions in particular might lead to less pruning of the retina-pulvinar-V5/MT pathway and that this might contribute to ‘blindsight’ ( Warner et al., 2015 ). Macaque monkey S in the current study showed bilaterally enlarged lateral ventricles that appeared to have expanded into space usually occupied by V1

. However, when monkey S was offered treats, she would start repeatedly running past the treat and pick it up with a sideways reach while running - rather than coming forwards, fixating the treat and reaching for it in a more controlled way. As monkey S so obviously differed from the animals co-housed with her, we performed a brain scan. Structural MRI revealed an almost complete loss of primary visual cortex ( V1 ) ( Figure 1, top ), consistent with presumptive bilateral visual field loss ( see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Clinical assessment of the MRI scans and records suggested no injury or history that could explain this lesion and that this was probably a congenital or perinatal condition. The LGN, the pulvinar, the SC and V5/MT are four structures that have been commonly implicated in bypassing V1 input to extrriate visual areas ( Wong-Riley 1976; Sich et al. 2004; Kaas and Lyon 2007; Warner et al 2010; Gass et al 2014 ). The pular receives input from the SC ( Stepiewska et al 1999; Warner et al 2010 ) and the LGN receives from SC ( Harting et al 199; Stepiewska et al 1999 ). The pular also receives early input from the retina ( Stepiew et al 199; Warner et al 2010 ).

    Title: The innate immune sensor IFI16 recognizes foreign DNA in the nucleus by scanning along the duplex
    Abstract: The ability to recognize foreign double-stranded ( ds ) DNA of pathogenic origin in the intracellular environment is an essential defense mechanism of the human innate immune system. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying distinction between foreign DNA and host genomic material inside the nucleus are not understood. By combining biochemical assays and single-molecule techniques, we show that the nuclear innate immune sensor IFI16 one-dimensionally tracks long stretches of exposed foreign dsDNA to assemble into supramolecular signaling platforms. We also demonstrate that nucleosomes represent barriers that prevent IFI16 from targeting host DNA by directly interfering with these one-dimensional movements. This unique scanning-assisted assembly mechanism allows IFI16 to distinguish friend from foe and assemble into oligomers efficiently and selectively on foreign DNA.

   . In combination with 3D sampling of binding sites on a collapsed DNA molecule, this process optimizes the oligomerization and downstream signaling time. While the clustering on dsDNA presents a tempting explanation for the role of IFI16 in viral gene silencing, future in vivo experiments await to test this. IFI16 belongs to the family of AIM2-like receptors, which include other nuclear and cytosolic foreign dsDNA-sensors. It will be interesting to determine whether and how these other related sensors use exposed dsDNA as a 1D 'digital ruler' to regulate their signaling platform assembly. This family of sensors is implicated in a number of autoimmune disorders ( Mondini et al., 2007; 2010; Choubey et al., 2010; Gugliesi et al., 2013; Smith and Jefferies, 2014 ) ; how regulation of assembly is disrupted may provide insights into these afflictions.

The molecular mechanisms by which IFI16 selectively targets foreign dsDNA remain unknown. To establish a functional signaling platform, IFI16 must overcome two challenges. First, individual IFI16 molecules must be able to locate one another on large pathogen genomes with sizes ranging from 105 to 106 base pairs ( bps ). Second and more importantly, this assembly mechanism can only take place on foreign dsDNA and must be inhibited on host dsDNA ( Figure 1A ). Here, we report the observation of a unifying molecular mechanism that explains how IFI16 resolves these central issues in initiating its foreign-dsDNA sensing pathways. 10. 7554/eLife. 11721. 003Figure 1.

Lines are fits to a first-order exponential equation ( see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 for 25 nM protein ). All shown representative experiments were performed at least three times.

The host innate immune system detects infection by directly recognizing molecular signatures associated with pathogens ( Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002; Medzhitov and Janeway, 2000 ). Remarkably, such signatures include universal building blocks of all life, such as DNA and RNA ( Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002; Orzalli and Knipe, 2014; Paludan and Bowie, 2013 ). In the cytoplasm, the immune system relies on the absence of endogenous DNA, and thus marks all detected DNA as 'foreign' ( nonself ) ( Orzalli and Knipe, 2014; Paludan and Bowie, 2013 ). However, DNA viruses often evade the cytosolic detection machineries, as their genomes are not exposed until reaching the nucleus ( Orzalli and Knipe, 2014; Paludan and Bowie, 2013 ). The host counters this infection strategy in the nucleus by directly assembling supramolecular signaling platforms that trigger inflammatory responses on invading foreign DNA, but not on its own genomic material ( Johnson et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Kerur et al., 2011 ). Although key players that target foreign dsDNA in the host nucleus have been identified ( Orzalli and Knipe, 2014; Paludan and Bowie, 2013 ), the molecular mechanisms by which these sensors distinguish self from nonself dsDNA remain unknown. The interferon-inducible protein 16 ( IFI16 ) is a key innate immune sensor that detects foreign dsDNA and uses it as a scaffold to assemble supramolecular signaling platforms in both the host nucleus and cytoplasm ( Unterholzner et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Kerur et al., 2011; Orzalli et al., 2012 ) ( Figure 1A ). IFI16 plays a central role in defense against a number of pathogens ( e. g herpes simplex virus-1 ) ( Unterholzner et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Kerur et al., 2011; Orzalli et al., 2012 ). On the other hand, persistent IFI16 signaling is associated with autoimmunity ( e. g. Sjögren’s syndrome ) ( Mondini et al

., 2012; Orzalli et al., 2012; 2013; Johnson et at., 2014 ) ; IFI16 oligomerizes on exposed invading foreign-dsDNA before it becomes hetero-chromatinized. Previous in vivo work demonstrated that transfected chromatinized SV40 DNA is able to evade IFI16 oligomerization and downstream responses ( Orzalli et al., 2013 ). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism by which IFI16 could use chromatinization to distinguish self from nonself has yet to be identified. To directly address this issue, we first used a competition-binding assay to investigate how IFI16 interacts with dsDNA fragments containing two nucleosomes with varying spacer sizes ( 6, 30, 50, and 70 bps; Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). Here, di-nucleosomes with 6-, 30-, and 50-bp spacer failed to compete against IFI16-bound FAM-labeled 70-bp dsDNA, ( Figure 3B ). On the other hand, the di-nucleosome with 70-bp spacer competed similarly as 70-bp naked dsDNA, but significantly more weakly than naked 300-bp dsDNA ( Figure 3B ). In FRET assembly assays, di-nucleosomes with spacers shorter than 70-bp failed to support assembly ( Figure 3C ), consistent with our FRET kinetics assays using naked dsDNA ( Figure 1B ). The 70-bp spacer di-nucleosome supported oligomerization of IFI16; however, the assembly kinetics was again similar to that of naked 70-bp dsDNA, but not that of naked 300-bp dsDNA ( Figure 3C ). Taken together, these results show that efficient IFI16 cluster formation requires a minimal length of 50-70 base pairs of exposed dsDNA. Considering that the size of dsDNA linker between two nucleosomes is about 20 to 30 bps in mammals ( McGhee et al., 1983 ), these results directly support the hypothesis that chromatinization is a key deterrent for preventing the assembly of IFI16 signaling platforms on self-dsDNA. 10. 7554/eLife. 11721. 012Figure 3. Nucleosomes inhibit oligomerization. ( A ) A cartoon of di-nucleosome constructs with varying dsDNA-spacers

To identify the mechanisms underlying assembly of IFI16 signaling platforms on DNA, we monitored the oligomerization kinetics of FRET donor and acceptor labeled IFI16 on naked dsDNA ( FRET: fluorescence resonance energy transfer; Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Previous work demonstrated the existence of IF16 oligomers on dsDNA ( Unterz et al. 2010; Johnson et al. 2013; Li et al 2012; Kerur et al 2011; Oralli et 2012 ). The oligomerization of IF16 on dsDNA is a prerequisite for downstream signaling ( Unterz et al 2010; Johnson et al 2013; Li et al 201; Kerur et 201; Oralli 2012 ). We found that IF16 oligomerizes faster on longer dsDNA ( Figure 1C ) and that oligomerization is inhibited by nucleosomes ( Figure 3 ). The oligomerization of IF16 on dsDNA is a prerequisite for downstream signaling ( Unter et al 2010; Johnson et 2013 Li et 201; Ker et 201 Oralli 2 ). The oligomerization of IF16 on dsDNA is a prerequisite for downstream signaling ( Unter et 2010 Johnson 201 Li 201 Ker 201 Oralli 2 ) The oligomer of IF16 on ds is prerequisite for downstream signaling ( Unter 2010 Johnson 201 Li 201 Ker 201 Oralli 2 ) The oligomer of IF16 on ds is prerequisite for downstream ( Unter 201 Johnson 201 Li 201 Ker 201 Oralli 2 ) The oligomer of IF on ds is prerequisite ( Unter 201 Johnson 201 Li 201 Ker 201 Oralli 2 The oligomer IF on ds is prerequisite ( Unter 201 Johnson 201 Li 201 Ker 201 Oralli 2 The oligomer on ds is prerequisite ( Unter 201 Johnson 201 Li 201 Ker 201 Oralli 2 The olig on ds is prerequisite ( Unter 201 Johnson 201 Li201 Ker 201 Oralli 2 The on ds is prerequisite ( Unter 201 Johnson 201 201 Ker 201 Oralli 2 The is prerequisite ( Unter 201 Johnson 201 201 Ker 201 Oralli  The ( Unter 201 Johnson 201 201 201 Oralli 201 The 201 Johnson 201 201 201 Oralli 201 201 Johnson 201 201 201 Or 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201 201

    Title: Determining composition of micron-scale protein deposits in neurodegenerative disease by spatially targeted optical microproteomics
    Abstract: Spatially targeted optical microproteomics ( STOMP ) is a novel proteomics technique for interrogating micron-scale regions of interest ( ROIs ) in mammalian tissue, with no requirement for genetic manipulation. Methanol or formalin-fixed specimens are stained with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize ROIs, then soaked in solutions containing the photo-tag: 4-benzoylbenzyl-glycyl-hexahistidine. Confocal imaging along with two photon excitation are used to covalently couple photo-tags to all proteins within each ROI, to a resolution of 0. 67 µm in the xy-plane and 1. 48 µm axially. After tissue solubilization, photo-tagged proteins are isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. As a test case, we examined amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) mouse model and a post-mortem AD case, confirming known plaque constituents and discovering new ones. STOMP can be applied to various biological samples including cell lines, primary cell cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy samples, and fixed post-mortem tissue.

   . These mice express a human form of the amyloid precursor protein carrying two mutations associated with familial AD, and they produce amyloid plaques and exhibit spatial learning impairments by 3 months of age. This study used frozen sections ( post-fixed in methanol ) of the brains known to contain plaques, from TgCRND8 mice of 8 months of age. Sets of serial sections on separate slides were treated with DEPC, stained with ThS, and soaked in a solution of 6HisBP. Slides were imaged by confocal microscopy to identify ThS-positive amyloid deposits. Confocal images of ThS-positive amyloid deposits ( Figure 1C1 ) were used to construct individual masks ( Figure 1C2 ). Because our technique hinges on selective photolabeling and purification, we needed to assess the extent of non-specific labeling of 6HisBP in ambient light and under immunofluorescence excitation, as well as non-specific binding to affinity purification beads. Adjacent sections were put aside as ‘dark’ controls used to assess the extent of non-specific labeling of 6HisBP to proteins caused by confocal laser light ( 488 nm ) exposure or other handling, and to assess nonspecific binding of proteins to nickel affinity beads. The STOMP macro was used to deliver two-photon excitation light to regions of the specimen corresponding to each pixel in the mask image. This excitation light has two effects. First, and most importantly, it photo-activates 6HisBP molecules that are in the amyloid deposits causing photo-tagging of constituent proteins. Second, it serendipitously photo-bleaches the ThS fluorophores present in regions of the specimen targeted by the mask. Immunofluorescence staining of the tissue section with anti-His6 antibody after photo-activation superimposes on the digital mask, thus highlighting the very high accuracy of targeting of the two-photon laser ( Figure 1C3 )

. ) Lowering the stringency will increase the number of hits but may introduce more false positives. Two frozen sections of TgCRND8 brain tissue were sufficient to produce the necessary volume of photo-tagged tissue required for one STOMP experiment, and the process required a total of 12–16 hr of microscope time per sample ( 6–8 hr per section ). Based on our determination of the resolution of STOMP, regions of interest ( ROIs ) as small as 0. 38 µm can be analyzed ( Figure 2 ). To analyze such small features, however, sufficient numbers of ROIs must be captured, and this may necessitate pooling photo-tagged material from several tissue sections. Protein identification via mass spectrometry involved on-bead digestion of the photo-tagged proteins with endoproteinase Lys-C followed by trypsin and LC-MS/MS analysis. We performed technical and biological replicates of the proteomic analyses of our STOMP experiment. The technical replicates ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) demonstrate a very high degree of correlation ( r2 = 0. 98 ), and the biological replicates demonstrate significant overlap in proteins identified ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ). The replicate studies illustrate the high reproducibility of the technique. The list of all identified proteins in amyloid plaques of TgCRND8 mice based on our high stringency criteria is summarized in Table 1. The aim of STOMP is to provide a compendium of annotated proteins present within the ROI under study—whether or not they are enriched or depleted relative to the surrounding tissue. As regards the quantitative nature of the data, Table 1 collects and summarizes our high-confidence mass spectrometry protein identifications, sorted by molecular-weight-normalized spectral counts: a semi-quantitative proxy for protein abundance. As expected, the most abundant protein found in STOMP from TgCRND8 mouse plaques was Aβ ( Figure 1D, Table 1 )

. A custom software macro was written that reads the mask file and selectively delivers two-photon excitation light to each protein deposit present, while leaving the remainder of the specimen untouched by excitation light ( the custom macro is available as Source code 1 ). The STOMP macro provides a semi-automated tool for photo-tagging proteins in pathological deposits. Importantly, unlike LCM, no manual tracing of features is required with STOMP. 10. 7554/eLife. 09579. 004Figure 2. The smallest photo-tagging volume is less than 0. 5 µm3.

., 2004 ). The highly specific nature of STOMP protein labeling and recovery permits very sensitive detection of proteins present in plaques, even if those proteins are also abundant in the remainder of the brain. We have shown that the STOMP technique can be used to determine the proteomic composition of micron-scale microscopic features. The procedure does not require large quantities of tissue and can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. Using amyloid plaques in TgCRND8 mice as a test subject, we demonstrated that STOMP is capable of determining the protein composition of pathological deposits in neurodegenerative disease. Our discovery that there is an accumulation of certain pre-synaptic proteins in AD plaques and in TgCRND8 mice provides direct evidence for an association between amyloid plaque formation and synaptic function. While our initial work in characterizing amyloid deposits in mouse brain used methanol fixed tissues to minimize problems with solubilizing tissue, our experience with human AD pathological tissue shows that STOMP of formalin-fixed archival tissue is possible. The STOMP technique is ideally suited for determination of the compositions of intracellular protein inclusions seen in ALS and FTD. While the principle components of these inclusions, such as TDP-439, FUS ( Kwiatkowski et al., 2009; Vance et al., 2009 ), and dipeptide repeat proteins ( Mori et al., 2013 ) are known, determination of the secondary components of the inclusions could shed light on disease etiology. In developing the STOMP technique, we have focused on identification of photo-tagged proteins, however, the nonspecific nature of benzophenone photochemistry should cause photo-tagging of nonprotein components as well. In this regard, the STOMP technique can easily be modified to identify the RNA composition of biological features

. Human tissue is inherently more difficult to work with than animal tissue because of biochemical changes that occur post-mortem. However, we have shown that STOMP can be used on formalin-fixed human tissue, which is a common archival material in pathology labs. ST can also be applied to biopsy samples, cell lines, primary cultures, and ex vivo specimens, making it a versatile tool for biological research.

    Title: Frizzled3 controls axonal development in distinct populations of cranial and spinal motor neurons
    Abstract: Disruption of the Frizzled3 ( Fz3 ) gene leads to defects in axonal growth in the VIIth and XIIth cranial motor nerves, the phrenic nerve, and the dorsal motor nerve in fore- and hindlimbs. In Fz3−/− limbs, dorsal axons stall at a precise location in the nerve plexus, and, in contrast to the phenotypes of several other axon path-finding mutants, Fz3−/− dorsal axons do not reroute to other trajectories. Affected motor neurons undergo cell death 2 days prior to the normal wave of developmental cell death that coincides with innervation of muscle targets, providing in vivo evidence for the idea that developing neurons with long-range axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule. These experiments implicate planar cell polarity ( PCP ) signaling in motor axon growth and they highlight the question of how PCP proteins, which form cell–cell complexes in epithelia, function in the dynamic context of axonal growth.

   . 5 ( Kablar and Rudnicki, 1999 ). Taken together, the Fz3−/− and Myf5−/−;MyoD−/− phenotypes imply that motor neuron survival between E11. 5 and E13. 5 is an active process and is independent of the motor axon’s ultimate target. One class of models that could account for the precocious motor neuron death in Fz3−/− embryos invokes the existence of neuronal survival factors produced by intermediate targets along an axon’s trajectory, as suggested by in vitro co-culture experiments with spinal cord commissural axons and floor plate tissue ( Wang and Tessier-Lavigne, 1999 ). The Fz3−/− experiments reported here provide in vivo evidence for this model, and suggest that the hypothesized survival factor ( s ) reside distal to the plexus but proximal to the developing muscle target. We note that alternative models are also consistent with the data, including, for example, the possibility of anti-survival signals at the point of Fz3−/− axon stalling. While the precocious cell death of Fz3−/− motor neurons can be rescued by eliminating Bax, the axon stalling phenotype remains unchanged. This observation is consistent with a model in which a defect in Fz3-dependent axonal growth induces apoptotic cell death, and it argues against an alternate model in which Fz3 functions in some other process to maintain cell viability, with defective axonal growth representing a secondary effect of the neuron’s impending demise. A corollary to this argument is that controlling axonal growth may be the only function of Fz3 in motor neurons. In earlier work, Fz3−/−, and Celsr3−/− forebrains were found to have essentially identical defects in multiple axon tracts ( Wang et al., 2002, 2006b; Tissir et al., 2005 ), and in Fz3−/−, Celsr3−/−, and Vangl2Lp/Lp spinal cords the commissural axons of dorsal horn sensory neurons were found to exhibit the same rostral turning defect ( Lyuksyutova et al., 2003; Tissir et al., 2005; Price et al., 2006; Shafer et al

. 05 ), implying that dorsal nerve axons have not rerouted to the ventral nerve, which would have then shown an increase in thickness; and ( 4 ) the average nerve thickness, relative to the littermate controls, is 31% for the dorsal nerve in the hindlimb, 57% for the dorsal nerve in the forelimb, and 82% for the ventral nerve when averaged over fore- and hindlimbs. In Fz3−/− embryos, other classes of spinal motor axons appear to be unaffected, including medial motor column and hypaxial motor column axons that innervate axial muscles and body wall muscles, respectively ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ). Although Fz3 is widely expressed in the mouse spinal cord and brainstem, it appears to be uniquely required by only a subset of motor neurons. We next asked whether the primary cause of motor axon deficiency in the VIIth, XIIth, phrenic, and dorsal limb nerves in Fz3−/− mice is: ( 1 ) defective motor neuron differentiation, ( 2 ) excessive motor neuron death, or ( 3 ) defective axon growth and/or guidance. Since the vast majority of Fz3−/− motor axons do not appear to follow erroneous trajectories ( Figures 1A, A′, and 4 ), aberrant path-finding is unlikely to be relevant. There are also no apparent defects in motor axon fasciculation in Fz3−/− embryos ( Figures 1 and 4 ). To distinguish among the remaining possibilities, we focused on LMCL motor neurons and their axons, because ( 1 ) these neurons can be unambiguously identified based on their patterns of transcription factor expression; ( 2 ) their axons can be clearly identified within the limb; and ( 3 ) several signaling pathways that control LMCL axon growth and guidance decisions provide points of comparison. In the developing mouse spinal cord, postmitotic motor neurons are generated between E9 and E11 ( Arber et al., 1999 ). Motor neurons are divided into pools positioned at stereotypical locations along the rostrocaudal, dorsoventral, and mediolateral axes of the spinal cord

. Thus, in Fz3−/− embryos a discrete subset of motor neurons exhibits both axon growth defects and apoptotic cell death at E11. 5-E12. 5. The results thus far indicate that Fz3 inactivation could lead either to a primary defect in motor neuron viability that secondarily impairs axonal growth or a primary defect in axonal growth that secondarily impairs motor neuron viability. To distinguish these two possibilities, we used a Bax−/− background—in which loss of the proapoptotic molecule Bax largely eliminates apoptosis of motor neurons ( White et al., 1998 ) —to ask whether blocking ( or delaying ) motor neuron apoptosis rescues the Fz3−/− dorsal nerve defect. Although the precocious motor neuron death seen in Fz3−/− embryos was eliminated in Bax−/−;Fz3−/− embryos, the dorsal nerve defect at the base of the limbs remained unchanged ( Figure 5M–R′ and Figure 5—figure supplement 1E–G′′′ ). Taken together, these data imply that in spinal motor neurons the primary phenotype resulting from loss of Fz3 is a defect in the growth of LMCL axons. Since apoptosis is restricted to precisely those motor neurons that exhibit defective axonal growth and since the axonal growth defect is not secondary to apoptosis of LMCL neurons, it seems very likely that the chain of causality leads from the axonal growth defect to apoptosis. We next asked whether the axonal phenotypes in Fz3−/− embryos reflect Fz3 action exclusively in CNS neurons. Based on the pattern of lacZ reporter expression from the original Fz3 null allele ( which carries an in-frame lacZ open reading frame ), Fz3 expression appears to be far higher in the CNS than in other tissues ( Wang et al., 2002 ). However, rigorously answering this question requires selective inactivation of Fz3 in defined cell populations. To that end, we generated a Fz3 conditional allele ( Fz3CKO ), in which LoxP sites flank exon 3, the largest coding exon, within the Fz3 gene ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B )

. As noted in the Introduction, defects in motor axon guidance in the dorsal limb have been described in EphA4−/−, Gdnf−/−, and Ret−/− embryos, and in each case dorsal motor axons are misrouted to the ventral limb. To compare one example of this class of mutants side-by-side with Fz3−/− and to examine the possibility of a genetic interaction between the Fz3 and the GDNF/Ret signaling pathways, we examined limb innervation phenotypes in Ret−/−, Fz3+/−;Ret+/−, and Fz3−/−;Ret+/− embryos ( Figure 7H–J′ ). This analysis provides no evidence for a genetic interaction between Fz3 and Ret, as Fz3+/−;Ret+/− hindlimb innervation is indistinguishable from WT, and Fz3−/−;Ret+/− hindlimb innervation is indistinguishable from Fz3−/− ( compare Figures 4B–F′ and 7H–J′, Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 2, and Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C′ ). Our analysis of Ret−/− fore- and hindlimb innervation fully confirms previous descriptions ( Kramer et al., 2006 ) and shows that in Ret−/− hindlimb dorsal axons reroute to the ventral nerve ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1A′′′′′ ). In contrast, F3−−− dorsal axons stall at the plexus and do not reroute ( Figures 1A′′′′′ and 4′′′′′ ).

    Title: Functional evaluation of transposable elements as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophoblast stem cells
    Abstract: Transposable elements ( TEs ) are thought to have helped establish gene regulatory networks. Both the embryonic and extraembryonic lineages of the early mouse embryo have seemingly co-opted TEs as enhancers, but there is little evidence that they play significant roles in gene regulation. Here we tested a set of long terminal repeat TE families for roles as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophoblast stem cells. Epigenomic and transcriptomic data suggested that a large number of TEs helped to establish tissue-specific gene expression programmes. Genetic editing of individual TEs confirmed a subset of these regulatory relationships. However, a wider survey via CRISPR interference of RLTR13D6 elements in embryonic stem cells revealed that only a minority play significant roles in gene regulation. Our results suggest that a subset of TEs are important for gene regulation in early mouse development, and highlight the importance of functional experiments when evaluating gene regulatory roles of TEs.

   . Such TEs could still be important to ensure regulatory robustness and, indeed, enhancer redundancy is a seemingly common feature of enhancer-gene networks ( Osterwalder et al., 2018 ). Extensive genetic work will be necessary to evaluate what proportion of TE+ enhancers act in a redundant fashion with other regulatory elements. In a contrasting example to our findings, epigenetic editing work by the Wysocka lab has revealed that a large proportion of LTR5Hs elements play significant roles in the regulation of nearly 300 genes in a human embryonal carcinoma cell line ( Fuentes et al., 2018 ). Notably, in the latter study virtually all H3K27ac-marked LTR5Hs elements were inactivated by CRISPRi ( 257 copies, according to our own analysis ), probably due to the use of twelve sgRNAs simultaneously ( Fuentes et al., 2018 ). It is therefore possible that more efficient targeting of all H3K27ac-marked RLTR13D6 elements ( 76 copies ) in mouse ESCs would uncover additional regulatory elements. However, the effects seen here from silencing 34 ( 44% ) of these copies suggest that regulatory RLTR13D6 elements would likely remain a minority. Another explanation to the differences between LTR5Hs and RLTR13D6 action is that the regulatory effects of TEs are variable between families and cellular contexts. Indeed, other TEs considered here and whose effects we did not test by CRISPRi ( RLTR9, RLTR13D5, RLTR13B ), may play important roles in ESC and TSC gene regulation. These considerations further emphasise the need to perform functional experiments on a case-by-case basis. Despite the neutral action of most TEs analysed here, we have uncovered a number of elements that act as key enhancers of gene expression in ESCs ( Tdrd12, Smarcad1, Spp1 and Hook3 ) and TSCs ( Map3k8 and Scarf2 )

. These data are in line with the chromatin accessibility data and suggest that TE+ enhancers may be used to support lineage-specific expression of a subset of genes in early development. However, it is also possible for the correlations observed here to emerge in the absence of causal links between TEs and gene expression. To directly test for a functional role of TE+ enhancers in gene regulation, we performed CRISPR-mediated genetic excision of selected TEs. Based on the bioinformatic analyses above, we chose a set of 4 TEs in ESCs and 2 TEs in TSCs that display strong evidence of enhancer activity ( Figure 4A, B; Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ). Most genes targeted by these TE+ enhancers, as predicted from PCHi-C data, had skewed expression towards ESCs or TSCs ( Figure 4D ). We also selected an element interacting with Smarcad1, a gene involved in pluripotency maintenance ( Hong et al., 2009 ), and one element that was previously shown to regulate Akap12 in ESCs ( Sundaram et al., 2017 ). After genetically excising TE+ enhancers using pairs of sgRNAs ( Figure 4C ) in multiple clones, we measured the effects on the expression of target genes. In TSCs, both TEs tested were found to be key regulators of their predicted target genes, Map3k8 and Scarf2, as homozygous null clones displayed ~4-fold reduction in expression ( Figure 4E, F ). In ESCs, however, only one of the tested TEs had a pronounced effect on the expression of its main target gene ( Figure 4G–J ). Excision of this particular RLTR13D6 element led to a dramatic ~8-fold reduction in Tdrd12 expression, and also had minor effects on the expression of other nearby genes that interact with it ( Figure 4G ). Although the associated TE lies within the first intron of Tdrd12, we found no evidence that it acted as an alternative promoter in ESCs ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ), supporting its role as an enhancer

. Here we have tested the gene regulatory function of specific TE families in ESCs and TSCs using genetic and epigenetic editing approaches, and compared them with predictions from extensive analyses of epigenomic and transcriptomic data. We identify a number of TEs that are important to drive expression of lineage-specific genes. However, our data suggest that these constitute a minority of all the putative TE-derived enhancers identified through bioinformatic analyses, highlighting the importance of functional tests when assessing the contribution of TEs to gene regulatory networks.

., 2014; Sundaram et al., 2017 ), presumably in a manner that enables vertical inheritance of new TE insertions via the germline. In this respect, mammalian preimplantation development is a seemingly well exploited context for TE expansion, driving genetic conflicts with the host, as well as creating opportunities for TE exaptation ( Rodriguez-Terrones and Torres-Padilla, 2018 ). In the mouse, TE-derived regulatory activity has been implicated at multiple stages of preimplantation development. Namely, MERVL elements become highly activated upon zygotic genome activation and are thought to play a role in the establishment of the 2-cell stage expression programme ( Macfarlan et al., 2012 ). Transition from the 2-cell stage and development progression to the blastocyst stage appear to depend on LINE-1 expression ( Jachowicz et al., 2017; Percharde et al., 2018 ). Finally, work from embryonic and trophoblast stem cells ( ESCs and TSCs, respectively ), suggests a divergence in TE regulatory activity that is concomitant with the separation of the embryonic and extraembryonic lineages at the blastocyst stage ( Kunarso et al., 2010; Chuong et al., 2013 ). In ESCs, TE families such as RLTR13D6 bind key ESC TFs ( e. g., OCT4, NANOG ), whereas a distinct subset ( e. g., RLTR13D5 ) bind factors essential for the maintenance of the TSC state ( CDX2, ELF5, EOMES ). These elements are enriched for histone marks that are characteristic of distal enhancers and lie near genes that are expressed in the lineages where they are active ( Kunarso et al., 2010; Chuong et al., 2013 ). TE enhancer activity depends on the cooperative action of multiple TFs, whose binding motifs appear to have been already present in the corresponding ancestral TE insertions ( Sundaram et al., 2017 ). However, it remains unclear to what extent such lineage-specific TEs are important for maintaining gene expression programmes during preimplantation development

. 4-fold ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ). This included genes interacting with TE+ enhancers displaying a similar or greater H3K27ac loss to that observed at Tdrd12- or Spp1-associated RLTR13D6 elements. To validate the relatively small effect of some TE+ enhancers on gene expression, we performed additional genetic editing experiments. We chose two RLTR13D6 elements that displayed >2-fold change in H3K27ac levels upon CRISPRi ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3A, D ), but with little or no effect on neighbouring gene expression ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3B, E ). Upon CRISPR-mediated deletion of the respective TEs, gene expression levels largely agreed with CRISPRi results, with only the lowly expressed Tsacc gene being downregulated, although the effect was more pronounced in the genetic excision experiment ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3C, F ). Therefore, whilst CRISPR of individual TEs constitutes a more sensitive approach, our CRISPRi data correlates with genetic excision data and is robust with respect to large effects on gene expression. These results suggest that only a small minority of RLTR13D6 elements play a major role in the regulation of gene expression in ESCs.

    Title: Phenotypic landscape inference reveals multiple evolutionary paths to C4 photosynthesis
    Abstract: C4 photosynthesis has independently evolved from the ancestral C3 pathway in at least 60 plant lineages, but, as with other complex traits, how it evolved is unclear. Here we show that the polyphyletic appearance of C4 photosynthesis is associated with diverse and flexible evolutionary paths that group into four major trajectories. We conducted a meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing species that use C3, C4, or intermediate C3–C4 forms of photosynthesis to parameterise a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape. We then developed and experimentally verified a novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model that predicts how the C4 phenotype evolved. The alternative evolutionary histories underlying the appearance of C4 photosynthesis were determined by ancestral lineage and initial phenotypic alterations unrelated to photosynthesis. We conclude that the order of C4 trait acquisition is flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic drivers. This flexibility will have facilitated the convergent evolution of this complex trait.

    Supporting Text:
   . Several studies on more simple traits have demonstrated that convergence upon a phenotype can be specified by diverse genotypes, and thus non-homologous molecular mechanisms in independent lineages ( Wittkopp et al., 2003; Hill et al., 2006; Steiner et al., 2009 ). Taken together, our data also indicate that flexibility in the viable series of evolutionary events has also facilitated the convergence of this highly complex trait. First, we show that at least four distinct evolutionary trajectories underlie the evolution of C4 lineages ( Figure 4 ). Second, we find no evidence for inflexible linkage between the predicted timing of distinct C4 traits ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). This diversity in viable pathways also helps explain why C4 has been accessible to such a wide variety of species and not limited to a smaller subset of the angiosperm phylogeny. A recent model for the evolution of the biochemistry associated with the C4 leaf also found that C4 photosynthesis was accessible from any surrounding point of a fitness landscape ( Heckman et al., 2013 ). Our study of C4 anatomy, biochemistry, and cell biology also suggests the C4 phenotype is accessible from multiple trajectories. Encouragingly, the trajectories predicted by Heckman et al. ( 2013 ) were found to pass through phenotypes of C3–C4 species, despite the fact that these species were not used to parameterise the evolutionary landscape. As different mechanisms generate increased abundance and cell-specificity for the majority C4 enzymes in independent C4 lineages ( reviewed in Langdale, 2011; Williams et al., 2012 ), it is likely that mechanistic diversity underlies the multiple evolutionary pathways generating C4 photosynthesis and may be a key factor in facilitating the convergent evolution of complex traits. This may benefit efforts to recapitulate the acquisition of C4 photosynthesis through the genetic engineering of C3 species ( Hibberd et al

The convergent evolution of complex traits is surprisingly common, with examples including camera-like eyes of cephalopods, vertebrates, and cnidaria ( Kozmik et al., 2008 ), mimicry in invertebrates and vertebrates ( Santos et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2012 ) and the different photosynthetic machineries of plants ( Sage et al., 2011a ). While the polyphyletic origin of simple traits ( Hill et al., 2006; Steiner et al., 2009 ) is underpinned by flexibility in the underlying molecular mechanisms, the extent to which this applies to complex traits is less clear. C4 photosynthesis is both highly complex, involving alterations to leaf anatomy, cellular ultrastructure, and photosynthetic metabolism, and also convergent, being found in at least 60 independent lineages of angiosperms ( Sage et al., 2011a ). As the emergence of the entire C4 phenotype cannot be comprehensively explored experimentally, C4 photosynthesis is an ideal system for the mathematical modelling of complex trait evolution as transitions on an underlying phenotype landscape. Furthermore, understanding the evolutionary events that have generated C4 photosynthesis on many independent occasions has the potential to inform approaches being undertaken to engineer C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species ( Hibberd et al., 2008 ). The C4 pathway is estimated to have first evolved between 32 and 25 million years ago ( Christin et al., 2011b ) in response to multiple ecological drivers, including decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentration ( Vicentini et al., 2008 ). C4 species have since radiated to represent the most productive crops and native vegetation on the planet because modifications to their leaves increase the efficiency of photosynthesis in the sub-tropics and tropics ( Edwards et al., 2010 )

., 2007 ) indicating that parallel evolution underpins at least part of the convergent C4 syndrome. However, while a substantial amount of work has addressed the molecular alterations that generate the biochemical differences between C3 and C4 plants ( Williams et al., 2012 ) much less is known about the order and flexibility with which phenotypic traits important for C4 photosynthesis are acquired ( Sage et al., 2012 ). Clues to this question exist in the form of C3–C4 intermediates, species exhibiting characteristics of both C3 or C4 photosynthesis, such as the activity or localisation of C4 cycle enzymes ( Hattersley and Stone, 1986 ), the possession of one or more anatomical or cellular adaptations associated with C4 photosynthesis ( Moore et al., 1987 ), or combinations of both ( e. g., Kennedy et al., 1980; Kotayeva et al., 2010 ). To address these unknown aspects of C4 evolutionary history, we combined the concept of considering evolutionary paths as stochastic processes on complex adaptive landscapes ( Wright, 1932; Gavrilets, 1997 ) with the analysis of extant C3–C4 intermediate species to develop a predictive model of how the full C4 phenotype evolved.

The adaptive landscape metaphor has provided a powerful conceptual framework within which evolutionary transitions can be modelled ( Gavrilets, 1997; Whibley et al., 2006; Lobkovsky et al., 2011 ). However, the majority of complex biological traits provide numerous challenges in utilising such an approach, including missing phenotypic data, incomplete phylogenetic information and in the case of convergent evolution, variable ancestral states. Here we report the development of a novel, predictive Bayesian approach that is able to infer likely evolutionary trajectories connecting phenotypes from sparsely sampled, highly stochastic data. With this model, we provided insights into the evolution of one of the most complex traits to have arisen in multiple lineages: C4 photosynthesis. However, as our approach is not dependent on detailed phylogenetic inference, we propose that it could be used to model the evolution of other complex traits, such as those in the fossil record, which are also currently limited by the fragmented nature of data available ( Kidwell and Holland, 2002 ). Our approach is also not limited by the time-scale over which predicted trajectories occur. As a result, it may be useful in inferring pathways underlying stochastic processes occurring over much shorter timescales, such as disease or tumour progression, or the differentiation of cell types. A central hypothesis for the ecological drivers of C4 evolution is that declining CO2 concentration in the Oligocene decreased the rate of carboxylation by RuBisCO, creating a strong pressure to evolve alternative photosynthetic strategies ( Christin et al., 2008; Vicentini et al., 2008 ). According to this hypothesis, alterations to the localisation and abundance of the primary carboxylases PEPC and RuBisCO would be expected to occur early in the evolutionary trajectories generating C4

. The phenotypic landscape underlying the evolution of C4 photosynthesis was then modelled as a transition network, with weighted edges describing the probability of transitions occurring between two phenotypic states ( two nodes on the hypercube, Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ). Observed intermediate points were then used to constrain the structure of these phenotypic landscapes. To do this, we developed inferential machinery based on the framework of Hidden Markov Models ( HMMs ) ( Rabiner, 1989 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ) and simulated an ensemble of Markov chains on trial transition networks. Each of these chains represents a possible evolutionary pathway from C3 to C4, and passes through several intermediate phenotypic states. The likelihood of observing intermediate states with characteristics compatible with the biologically observed data on C3–C4 intermediates was recorded for the set of paths supported on each trial network. A Bayesian MCMC procedure was used to sample from the set of networks most compatible with the meta-analysis dataset, and thus most likely to represent the underlying dynamics of C4 evolution. The order in which phenotypic characteristics were acquired was recorded for paths on each network compatible with the C3–C4 species data, and posterior probability distributions ( given uninformative priors ) for the time-ordered acquisition of each C4 trait were generated. For further information and mathematical details, see ‘Methods’. We found that four distinct trajectories underlie the evolution of C lineages ( Figure 4 ) and that the timing of acquisition of distinct C traits is flexible ( Figure 3— supplement 1 ).

    Title: Reformulation of an extant ATPase active site to mimic ancestral GTPase activity reveals a nucleotide base requirement for function
    Abstract: Hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates releases similar amounts of energy. However, ATP hydrolysis is typically used for energy-intensive reactions, whereas GTP hydrolysis typically functions as a switch. SpoIVA is a bacterial cytoskeletal protein that hydrolyzes ATP to polymerize irreversibly during Bacillus subtilis sporulation. SpoIVA evolved from a TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases, but the evolutionary pressure that drove this change in nucleotide specificity is unclear. We therefore reengineered the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity. SpoIVAGTPase functioned properly as a GTPase but failed to polymerize because it did not form an NDP-bound intermediate that we report is required for polymerization. Further, incubation of SpoIVAGTPase with limiting ATP did not promote efficient polymerization. This approach revealed that the nucleotide base, in addition to the energy released from hydrolysis, can be critical in specific biological functions. We also present data suggesting that increased levels of ATP relative to GTP at the end of sporulation was the evolutionary pressure that drove the change in nucleotide preference in SpoIVA.

    Supporting Text:
    In this study we examined an unusual bacterial cytoskeletal protein, SpoIVA, that hydrolyzes ATP to drive the formation of static polymers. We previously reported that the SpoIVA ATPase is ancestrally derived ( Castaing et al., 2013 ) from an Era-like GTPase, a pan-bacterial ribosomal maturation protein belonging to the TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases ( Leipe et al., 2002 ). We proposed that this likely occurred via a gene duplication event followed by a rapid divergence from the ancestral gene ( Castaing et al., 2013 ). To understand the selective pressure underlying the switch in nucleotide specificity of the extant SpoIVA and the mechanistic details governing its function, we sought to restore its ancestral enzymatic ( GTPase ) activity by re-engineering its nucleotide-binding pocket and examining how the altered protein functioned in vivo and in vitro. Achieving this required altering amino acids in two loops near the base of the bound NTP ( Figure 1 ). First, we partially restored the highly conserved NKxD motif on the G4 loop that has been implicated in conferring GTP-binding specificity ( Dever et al., 1987 ) and is highly conserved among GTPases ( Leipe et al., 2002 ), but is altered in SpoIVA. Second, we altered the sequence ( SxE in B. subtilis SpoIVA ) in the G5 loop that is less conserved among GTPases ( SAx ). This approach resulted in a protein whose enzymatic activity operated in a parameter space similar to that of the ancestral Era GTPase and hydrolyzed GTP with a slight preference over ATP in vitro ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and 1 ). Additionally, the altered protein was able to exploit the energy released by hydrolysis of either ATP or GTP to drive a critical conformational change required for polymerization ( Figure 4A, B )

. Despite the ability of this protein to undergo an initial conformational change upon hydrolyzing either nucleotide, the protein only polymerized in the presence of ATP ( Figure 5A ), suggesting that the nucleotide base, and not just the energy released from nucleotide hydrolysis, was required for protein function. This requirement for ATP led us to propose that the scarcity of GTP during the late stages of sporulation ( Figure 6A ) could have helped drive the evolution of SpoIVA to preferentially utilize ATP. Indeed, amino acid starvation and the onset of stationary phase are known to result in a reduction in GTP and GDP levels, which coincides with an increase in the production of the nucleotide alarmones ( p ) ppGpp ( Kriel et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2015; Ochi et al., 1981 ). This drop in GTP level has also been implicated in the initiation of sporulation in B. subtilis ( Lopez et al., 1979; Ochi et al., 1982 ), possibly through derepressing the activity of the CodY transcription factor that represses sporulation initiation genes by directly sensing GTP via its ligand-binding GAF domain ( Aravind and Ponting, 1997; Brinsmade, 2017; Sonenshein, 2005 ). Here, we showed that GTP and GDP scarcity continued even 3. 5–5 h after the initiation of sporulation, when SpoIVA is actively assembling the spore coat ( Peluso et al., 2019 ), which suggests a selective pressure that drove the switch in nucleotide specificity in SpoIVA from GTP to ATP. Consistent with this notion, we observed that physiological levels of intracellular ATP, but not GTP, facilitate the requisite conformational changes in SpoIVA and SpoIVAGTPase ( Figure 6E, F ). This pressure caused by low levels of GTP is likely constrained by the fact that ( p ) ppGpp actively inhibits GTP production; in fact, artificially elevating GTP levels during nutrient limitation was shown to be detrimental to the cell ( Kriel et al., 2012 )

. Since SpoIVA ultimately forms a static polymer and does not perform obvious work like a motor protein, the purpose of its ATP utilization had been mysterious. One implication of our model is that SpoIVA retained the ancestral ‘switch’ function of TRAFAC GTPases ( nucleotide hydrolysis-dependent triggering of a conformational change ). Indeed, it is likely that the precursor of SpoIVA was initially recruited for a structural role due to the capacity of GTPases to form nucleotide-dependent oligomeric assemblies in proximity to membranes as also observed in the GIMAP-septin-dynamin clade. However, as it became fixed for this function in the context of sporulation, SpoIVA appears to have substituted ATP for GTP as the molecule that mediates the switch because of the relative scarcity of GTP during the late stages of sporulation ( Figure 6A; Lopez et al., 1981; Lopez et al., 1979; Ochi et al., 1982; Ochi et al., 1981 ). Functionally, this activity also resembles that of certain ATPases in the STAND clade of P-loop NTPases of the AAA+ class ( Leipe et al., 2004 ). These NTPases, which include the apoptosis regulator Apaf-1 and the bacterial AfsR-like transcription regulators, employ ATP ( and in some cases GTP ) hydrolysis to transmit a conformational change to an effector domain to convey a signal, rather than perform a motor function ( Danot et al., 2009; Leipe et al., 2004 ). In the future, detailed structural analyses of SpoIVA will likely yield insights into additional residues that evolved to increase the specificity of ATP binding and provide an atomic-scale mechanism for ATP-dependent multimerization and polymerization.

., 2006; Ramamurthi and Losick, 2008; Roels et al., 1992 ). Unlike dynamic cytoskeletal proteins like actin and tubulin, where nucleotide binding drives polymerization and nucleotide hydrolysis is linked to polymer disassembly ( Pollard and Goldman, 2018 ), SpoIVA polymerization requires ATP hydrolysis to form a nucleotide-free static polymer ( Castaing et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2015 ). The amino terminal half of the SpoIVA ATPase is the nucleotide-binding domain, which belongs to the TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases ( Figure 1A–C; Castaing et al., 2014; Castaing et al., 2013; Leipe et al., 2002 ). This domain harbors a Walker A motif that binds the γ-phosphoryl group of the bound ATP ( Walker et al., 1982 ), a Walker B motif that coordinates a Mg2+ ion required for ATP hydrolysis and, like TRAFAC GTPases, a sensor Thr ( ‘sensor T’ ) that detects the γ-phosphoryl of the bound nucleotide to trigger ATP hydrolysis ( Leipe et al., 2002 ). The classic TRAFAC GTPases which hydrolyze GTP contain a fourth motif ( the so-called G4 motif ), typically consisting of Asn and Lys separated by one residue before an Asp ( NKxD ) that confers guanine-binding specificity ( Leipe et al., 2002 ). Crystal structures revealed direct interactions between the side chain of the Asp and the base of a bound GTP through two H-bonds, and a coordination of a water molecule to the α-phosphate group of the bound nucleotide by the Lys ( Knihtila et al., 2015 ). Additionally, the extended aliphatic side chain of the said Lys forms a hydrophobic wall to hold the guanine in place ( Le et al. 2002 ). In contrast, SpoIVA lacks the G4 motif and instead has a conserved S in its place ( Casting et al. 201; Le et al. 2002 ).

    Title: Long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life
    Abstract: Leptin regulates energy balance and also exhibits neurotrophic effects during critical developmental periods. However, the actual role of leptin during development is not yet fully understood. To uncover the importance of leptin in early life, the present study restored leptin signaling either at the fourth or tenth week of age in mice formerly null for the leptin receptor ( LepR ) gene. We found that some defects previously considered irreversible due to neonatal deficiency of leptin signaling, including the poor development of arcuate nucleus neural projections, were recovered by LepR reactivation in adulthood. However, LepR deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity via suppression of energy expenditure. LepR reactivation in adulthood also led to persistent reduction in hypothalamic Pomc, Cartpt and Prlh mRNA expression and to defects in the reproductive system and brain growth. Our findings revealed that early defects in leptin signaling cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine and developmental problems.

   ., 2004b ). Importantly, exogenous leptin rescues the development of ARH projections of Lepob/ob mice only when provided in the neonatal period. Thus, these findings suggest that the lack of leptin signaling in the first weeks of life permanently disrupts these projections in mice ( Bouret et al., 2004b ). Important implications arise from the developmental effects of leptin. For example, changes in leptin signaling during development could then affect the organization of critical neural circuits that regulate energy homeostasis, favoring the incidence of metabolic diseases later in life. Thus, leptin may also be involved in the developmental programming ( Ralevski and Horvath, 2015 ). Accordingly, early postnatal leptin blockage in rats leads to long-term leptin resistance and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity ( Attig et al., 2008 ). Furthermore, neonatal leptin treatment reverses the developmental programming caused by maternal undernutrition ( Vickers et al., 2005 ). However, it is worth mentioning that despite the aforementioned evidence about leptin’s developmental effects, exogenous leptin replacement can reverse key metabolic abnormalities exhibited by leptin-deficient mice or humans ( Pelleymounter et al., 1995; Ioffe et al., 1998; Farooqi et al., 2002; Licinio et al., 2004; Donato et al., 2011 ). Therefore, the actual importance of leptin signaling during development for the long-term energy homeostasis and other aspects regulated by leptin is not yet fully understood. Thus, to uncover the role of leptin during development, we investigated the long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life. For this purpose, we studied knockout mice for the Lepr gene that grew without leptin’s effects. However, LepR expression was restored either at the fourth or tenth week of life

The hormone leptin is best known as a key signal to the brain conveying information about body energy reserves ( Maffei et al., 1995 ). Consequently, leptin receptor ( LepR ) -expressing neurons are apt to modulate food intake and energy expenditure according to the amount of energy stored and the current energy balance ( Ramos-Lobo and Donato, 2017 ). Hence, null mutations in the genes that encode for leptin or LepR impair the capacity of the hypothalamus to regulate energy homeostasis, leading to profound metabolic dysfunctions in humans and rodents, including severe obesity, hyperphagia, low-energy expenditure, hypoactivity, insulin resistance and infertility ( Halaas et al., 1995; Montague et al., 1997; Farooqi et al., 2002; Licinio et al., 2004 ). In addition to the role of leptin in energy homeostasis, other studies have shown that leptin can affect developmental processes, especially in the brain ( Ahima et al., 1999 ). Regarding this aspect, rodents exhibit a postnatal leptin surge between the first and second week of age that is not associated to changes in fat mass or food intake ( Ahima et al., 1998 ). In addition, 2-week-old mice do not respond to the anorexigenic effects of leptin ( Mistry et al., 1999 ). Thus, leptin does not seem to be involved in the regulation of energy balance during the first weeks of life in mice. However, synaptic plasticity in the hypothalamus is regulated by leptin ( Pinto et al., 2004 ). Leptin signaling is also required for the formation of the neural projections from the arcuate nucleus ( ARH ) to post-synaptic targets, a process that takes place in the first 2 weeks of life ( Bouret et al., 2004a; Kamitakahara et al., 2018 ). In accordance, leptin promotes neurite outgrowth in vitro and leptin-deficient ( Lepob/ob ) mice show disruption of ARH neural projections ( Bouret et al., 2004b )

Our findings revealed that the absence of leptin signaling in early life led to permanent changes in energy homeostasis, melanocortin system, reproduction and brain development. The metabolic dysfunctions caused by the lack of leptin signaling during development possibly involved changes in neural populations that regulate the energy expenditure, such as POMC or Prlh neurons in the hypothalamus, as well as epigenetic mechanisms since the hypothalamic expression of several enzymes that modulate DNA methylation or histone acetylation were affected in Ubi-LepRNull mice. Although the complete absence of leptin signaling is rarely found in humans, both undernutrition and overnutrition are able to produce significant changes in serum leptin concentrations, leptin sensitivity or in the development of neurocircuits that regulate energy homeostasis ( Samuelsson et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2009; Vogt et al., 2014; Ralevski and Horvath, 2015 ). Therefore, intrauterine or early postnatal changes in energy balance have been consistently linked with obesity and other metabolic diseases in adulthood ( Vickers et al., 2005; Attig et al., 2008; Lillycrop and Burdge, 2011; Bumaschny et al., 2012; Chhabra et al., 2016 ). Thus, our findings contribute to the understanding of the metabolic programming by indicating which specific metabolic, neuroendocrine and developmental consequences arise from the absence of leptin signaling in early life, especially in the context of the alarming growth of childhood obesity worldwide ( Cunningham et al., 2014 ).

. Our findings revealed that some defects previously considered irreversible due to the lack of leptin signaling in the neonatal period, such as the poor development of ARH neural projections, can be recovered by LepR reactivation in adulthood. On the other hand, the absence of leptin signaling in early life permanently impairs energy homeostasis, the melanocortin system, as well as the reproduction and brain development.

. Leptin or LepR deficiency leads to reduced brain mass ( Ahima et al., 1999 ), disruption of the projections from ARH neurons to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus ( PVH ) ( Bouret et al., 2004a; Bouret et al., 2004b; Kamitakahara et al., 2018 ), as well as behavioral and cognitive problems ( Liu et al., 2011 ). Therefore, we evaluated the possible consequences of the lack of leptin signaling in early life on brain development. LepRNull male and female mice exhibited reduced brain mass ( Figure 7A, B ). Notably, LepR reactivation in adult animals partially recovered brain mass, although it remained significantly lower in Ubi-LepRNull mice compared to Ubi animals ( Figure 7A, B ). We then assessed the hypothalamic expression of several neurotrophic factors. LepRNull mice exhibited reduced mRNA levels of Bdnf, Igf1 and Dlg4, which encode important neurotrophic factors and proteins involved in synaptic plasticity and memory formation ( Figure 7C ). The expression of none of these transcripts was completely restored in Ubi-LepRNull mice ( Figure 7C ). Additionally, the glial fibrillary acidic protein ( Gfap ) expression was suppressed in the hypothalamus of LepRNull and Ubi-LepRNull mice in comparison with Ubi animals ( Figure 7C ). The brain mass was also determined in mice that recovered LepR expression before the onset of obesity. While Ubi-LepRNull males still exhibited reduced brain mass compared to Ubi mice ( Figure 7D ), no significant difference was observed between Ubi and Ubi-LepRNull females ( Figure 7E ). To determine whether the aforementioned alterations in Ubi-LepRNull mice could lead to behavioral or cognitive deficits, male mice were subjected to behavioral tests. In the open field, we observed that LepRNull mice showed reduced exploration, whereas LepR reactivation normalized this behavior ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1A ). Next, spatial learning and memory were analyzed in the Barnes maze

    Provide a clear and concise summary of the article for a general audience while maintaining scientific rigor.

The study investigated the long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life in mice. Lept is a hormone that regulates energy balance and has neurotrophic effects during development. The study found that defects previously considered irreversible due to neonatal deficiency of lept signaling, such as poor development of arcuate neural projections, were recovered by Lep reactivation in adulthood. However, Lep deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity via suppression of energy expenditure. Lep reactivation in adulthood led to persistent reduction in hypothalamic Pomc, Cart and Prlh expression and defects in reproductive and brain development. The study suggests that early defects in leptin signaling cause permanent metabolic, neuroocrine, and developmental problems.

    Title: Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins regulate immunity by directly coupling to the FLS2 receptor
    Abstract: The Arabidopsis immune receptor FLS2 perceives bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate defenses through the central cytoplasmic kinase BIK1. The heterotrimeric G proteins composed of the non-canonical Gα protein XLG2, the Gβ protein AGB1, and the Gγ proteins AGG1 and AGG2 are required for FLS2-mediated immune responses through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that in the pre-activation state, XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1, and it functions together with AGB1 and AGG1/2 to attenuate proteasome-mediated degradation of BIK1, allowing optimum immune activation. Following the activation by flg22, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1 and is phosphorylated by BIK1 in the N terminus. The phosphorylated XLG2 enhances the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) likely by modulating the NADPH oxidase RbohD. The study demonstrates that the G proteins are directly coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex and regulate immune signaling through both pre-activation and post-activation mechanisms.

    As an intensely studied Pattern Recognition Receptor ( PRR ) in plants, FLS2 serves as an excellent model understanding plant innate immune signaling and receptor kinases in general ( Macho and Zipfel, 2014 ). It forms a dynamic complex with the co-receptor BAK1 and the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BIK1 to perceive a conserved bacterial flagellar epitope, flg22, to activate a variety of defense responses ( Chinchilla et al., 2007; Heese et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2013 ). Stability of FLS2 and BIK1 is subject to regulation by ubiquitin-proteasome system and a calcium-dependent protein kinase ( Lu et al., 2011; Monaghan et al., 2014 ). We and others previously showed that BIK1 directly phosphorylates the NADPH oxidase RbohD to prime flg22-induced reactive oxygen species ( ROS; Kadota et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014 ). Heterotrimeric G proteins are central for signaling in animals ( McCudden et al., 2005; Oldham et al., 2008 ), which contain hundreds of G Protein-Coupled Receptors ( GPCRs ). In the pre-activation state, the GDP-bound Gα interacts with the Gβγ dimer to form a heterotrimer. Upon activation by GPCR, Gα exchanges GDP for GTP, resulting in the activation of the heterotrimer. The activated Gα and Gβγ dissociate from each other to regulate downstream effectors. Plants contain canonical Gα ( encoded by GPA1 in Arabidopsis ), Gβ ( encoded by AGB1 in Arabidopsis ), Gγ proteins ( encoded by AGG1, AGG2 ), and a non-canonical Gγ ( encoded by AGG3 in Arabidopsis ) ( Urano and Jones, 2013 ). Plants additionally encode extra-large G proteins ( XLGs, encoded by XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3 in Arabidopsis ) that carry a variable N-terminal domain and a C-terminal Gα domain ( Lee and Assman, 1999; Ding et al., 2008 ). Recent advances indicate that the Arabidopsis XLGs are functional Gα proteins and interact with Gβγ dimers to form heterotrimers ( Zhu et al., 2009; Maruta et al

., 2015 ). However, GPA1 does not appear to play a role in flg22-induced ROS and disease resistance to P. syringae ( Liu et al., 2013; Torres et al., 2013 ). How XLG2 and AGB1 regulate PRR-mediated immunity remains elusive. In this study, we report XLG2, AGB1, and AGG1/2 modulates flg22-triggered immunity by directly coupling to the FLS2-BIK1 receptor complex. Prior to activation by flg22, the G proteins attenuate the proteasome-dependent degradation of BIK1, ensuring optimum signaling competence. After flg22 stimulation, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1, indicating a ligand-induced dissociation of Gα from Gβγ. In addition, we provide evidence that activation by flg22 additionally leads to XLG2 phospohrylation by BIK1, and this phosphorylation positively regulates RbohD-dependent ROS production. Together the study illustrates two distinct mechanisms underlying the G protein-mediated regulation of the FLS2 signaling.

Heterotrimeric G proteins play important role in signal transduction in plants and animals. Paradoxically, plants do not possess functional GPCRs. The maize Gα protein CT2 interacts with the receptor kinase CLV1 to control shoot meristem development ( Bommert et al., 2013 ). GPA1 and AGG1/2 have been shown to interact with BAK1 and CERK1 in yeast two-hybrid and Bi-Fluorescence Complementation assays, although the biological significance of this remains unknown ( Aranda-Sicilia et al., 2015 ). We show that XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1 to regulate FLS2-mediated immunity. Thus, these studies collectively support that plant receptor kinases fulfil the roles of GPCRs by directly coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins. Importantly, we show that the G proteins coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex are subject to multiple regulations during FLS2 signaling. The interaction between XLG2/3 and AGB1, which leads to the formation of XLG2/3-AGB1-AGG1/2 heterotrimers ( Maruta et al., 2015; Chakravorty et al., 2015 ), is dynamically regulated by flg22. The flg22-induced dissociation of XLG2 from AGB1 likely reflects an increase of GTP-bound form of Gα which dissociates from the Gβγ dimer upon receptor activation. Secondly, the interactions of the G proteins with FLS2 and BIK1 are also dynamically regulated by flg22. The flg22-induced dissociation of the G proteins from BIK1 coincides with the flg22-induced BIK1 phosphorylation, suggesting that the flg22-induced BIK1 phosphorylation triggers the dissociation of the G proteins. Indeed, de-phosphorylation of BIK1 strongly enhanced its interactions with both XLG2 and AGB1 in vitro. The decoupling of the G proteins from the receptor maybe necessary for the regulation of down-stream effectors. BIK1 is subject to proteasome-dependent degradation ( Monaghan et al., 2014 ). Our genetic analyses indicated that XLG2, AGB1 and AGG1/2 are required for BIK1 stability in the pre-activation state

. Loss of XLG2 and AGB1 leads to accelerated degradation of BIK1, and this is blocked by the addition of proteasome inhibitors, indicating that the G proteins attenuating the proteasome-dependent degradation of BIK1. FLS2 is also subject to proteasome-dependent degradation ( Lu et al., 2011 ). However, FLS2 accumulation is not affected by the agb1 mutation, indicating that the G proteins do not generally regulate proteasome-mediated protein degradation. These observations raise an interesting question as to whether the G proteins specifically impede the ubiquitination of BIK1 or loading of BIK1 to proteasome. Importantly, introduction of a transgenic copy of BIK1 largely restored flg22-triggered immune responses and disease resistance in xlg2 and agb1 mutants, demonstrating that a major function of the heterotrimeric G protein is to maintain the signaling competence of the FLS2-BIK1 complex in the pre-activation state. In addition to the ligand-induced dissociation of XLG2 from AGB1, flg22 induces the phosphorylation of XLG2 in the N terminus. This phosphorylation is likely caused by the BIK1 family kinases, as two of the major phosphor-sites induced by flg22 are also phosphorylated by BIK1 in vitro. Non-phosphorylatable XLG2 mutants are compromised in flg22-induced ROS production and disease resistance to Pst, indicating that the phosphorylation plays a positive role. However, mutations in the phospho-sites did not affect XLG2-BIK1 interaction nor BIK1 stability, suggesting that the phosphorylated XLG2 regulates components other than BIK1. Indeed, XLG2 constitutively interacts with RbohD, suggesting that the phosphorylated XLG2 further enhances ROS production by modulating RbohD. RbohD is known to be subject to multiple regulations including phosphorylation by CPK5 and BIK1 ( Dubiella et al., 2013; Kadota et al., 2014; Li et al, 2014 ).

    Title: Coordination of robust single cell rhythms in the Arabidopsis circadian clock via spatial waves of gene expression
    Abstract: The Arabidopsis circadian clock orchestrates gene regulation across the day/night cycle. Although a multiple feedback loop circuit has been shown to generate the 24-hr rhythm, it remains unclear how robust the clock is in individual cells, or how clock timing is coordinated across the plant. Here we examine clock activity at the single cell level across Arabidopsis seedlings over several days under constant environmental conditions. Our data reveal robust single cell oscillations, albeit desynchronised. In particular, we observe two waves of clock activity; one going down, and one up the root. We also find evidence of cell-to-cell coupling of the clock, especially in the root tip. A simple model shows that cell-to-cell coupling and our measured period differences between cells can generate the observed waves. Our results reveal the spatial structure of the plant clock and suggest that unlike the centralised mammalian clock, the Arabidopsis clock has multiple coordination points.

    Supporting Text:
    Our single cell measurements have revealed tissue specific differences in the phases and robustness of the clock in Arabidopsis. These differences are not restricted to one cell type, as similar periods are observed in the z dimension through the plant ( Figure 3c, d ), suggesting that cells are instead responding to information based on their longitudinal position. The observed robust rhythms in the hypocotyl that peak before the cotyledon and the top of the root, with a wave of clock gene expression down the root, fit with a proposed hierarchical structure for the plant clock, where the shoot apex clock drives the rhythms in the root ( Takahashi et al., 2015 ). However, our results suggest that the structure of the plant clock is more complicated, as this hierarchical model does not explain the observed short period oscillations in the root tip, or the wave of clock gene expression up from the root tip. Our results support a more decentralised model of clock coordination in plants ( Endo, 2016; Endo et al., 2014 ). Earlier studies of the Arabidopsis clock argue either that cellular oscillations are uncoupled ( Thain et al., 2000; Yakir et al., 2011 ), or weakly, but detectably, coupled ( Fukuda et al., 2007; Fukuda et al., 2012; James et al., 2008; Takahashi et al., 2015; Wenden et al., 2012 ). Coupling has also been detected in Lemna gibba fronds, as examination of a clock bioluminescence reporter with single cell resolution showed weak coupling between individual clock oscillators under constant conditions ( Muranaka and Oyama, 2016 ). These heterogeneous oscillations could be synchronised by light-dark cycles ( Okada et al., 2017 ). Our single cell approach is consistent with weak coupling across the whole plant but reveals regions with strong local coupling between cells, especially in the root tip, which is sufficient to drive an increase in synchrony with time

., 2013; Locke et al., 2005; Locke et al., 2006; Salomé and McClung, 2005 ). The damping is characterised by the reduction in amplitude of the oscillations through time. This damping at the whole plant level could be due to the clock circuit in all individual cells damping ( top, Figure 1c ), or to cells desynchronising due to different intrinsic periods or phases ( Guerriero et al., 2012; Komin et al., 2011 ) ( bottom, Figure 1c ), or cells desynchronising due to stochasticity in clock activity ( Guerriero et al., 2012 ). Previous studies have attempted to measure the clock in Arabidopsis at single-cell resolution; however, these have focused on specific parts of the plant for short time series ( Takahashi et al., 2015; Yakir et al., 2011 ). Here, using a reporter for the core clock gene CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 ( CCA1 ) ( Wang and Tobin, 1998 ), we examine the dynamics of the Arabidopsis clock across the whole plant at the single cell level over several days. Our results reveal that damping of rhythms at the whole plant level is mainly due to desynchronisation of oscillating single cells with different periods, and not due to noise in gene expression due to low molecule numbers or damping of individual oscillations. We observe two waves of clock gene expression, one up and one down the root. These waves, combined with more variable clock periods at each position in the root, cause the most desynchronisation. From our single cell data, we are able to estimate the coupling strength between cells, and find evidence of coupling, especially strong in the root tip. A simple model suggests that our observed period differences, plus cell-to-cell coupling, can generate the observed waves in clock gene expression. Thus, our data reveals both the structure and robustness of the plant circadian clock system.

The circadian clock controls gene expression throughout the day and night in most organisms, from single cell photosynthetic bacteria to mammals ( Bell-Pedersen et al., 2005; Dunlap and Loros, 2017 ). In many cases, a core circuit that generates this rhythm has been elucidated and been shown to oscillate in single cells. In multi-cellular organisms, these single cell rhythms can be integrated to allow a coordinated response to the environment ( Bell-Pedersen et al., 2005 ). Mammals achieve this by driving oscillations in peripheral tissues from a central pacemaker in the brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) ( Pando et al., 2002; Reppert and Weaver, 2002 ). The Arabidopsis circadian clock generates a 24 hr rhythm in multiple key processes, including stomata opening, photosynthesis, and hypocotyl elongation ( Hsu and Harmer, 2014 ). A hierarchical structure for the plant clock has recently been proposed, similar to that for the mammalian clock, where the shoot apex clock drives the rhythms in the root ( Takahashi et al., 2015 ). However, there are further tissue-dependent differences that must be explained. For example, experiments using a luciferase reporter for clock activity have shown waves of clock gene expression in leaves ( Fukuda et al., 2007; Wenden et al., 2012 ), as well as striped expression patterns in roots ( Fukuda et al., 2012 ). Beyond the coordination of plant rhythms, how robust the circadian clock is in individual cells across the plant is also unclear. Through integration of data from whole plant studies, a genetic circuit consisting of multiple coupled feedback loops has been proposed to generate the 24-hr rhythm ( Fogelmark and Troein, 2014; Pokhilko et al., 2012 ). Simulations of this network display stable oscillations ( Figure 1a ), although experimental measurements of clock rhythms under constant conditions often display damped rhythms ( Figure 1b ) ( Gould et al., 2013; Locke et al

., 1999 ) ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1b ), suggesting that our results are a general property of the clock. The coherent waves of gene expression suggested that the plant clock signal could be coupled. To estimate this coupling, we calculated the order parameter ( Kuramoto, 1984 ) from our single cell data and estimated the coupling strength based on a technique developed for mammalian circadian cells ( Rougemont and Naef, 2007 ). We observed signs of coupling across the plant, with the strongest evidence for coupling in the root tip, where the order parameter actually increased with time ( Figure 3j and Figure 3—figure supplement 2–4 ). Interestingly, this occurred where cell density was highest, as observed in cultured SCN cells ( Aton et al., 2005 ). To investigate the mechanism for the waves of clock gene expression in the root we developed a simple mathematical model where the cells are described by coupled oscillators with different periods, as informed by the data ( Figure 3k ). The periods of the clock in the model were faster in the shoot and root tip than the rest of the root, as measured experimentally. This simple model can generate waves of gene expression up and down the root that produce a bow wave in the space-time plot ( Figure 3k ), similar to that observed experimentally ( Figure 3h, i ).

. In the future, it will be interesting to examine whether the shoot apical meristem, which has a high cell density like the root tip and has been shown to be coupled when excised from the plant, has a similarly high coupling strength given its role in driving rhythms in the shoot ( Takahashi et al., 2015 ). Our modelling reveals that cell-cell coupling together with the observed period differences between tissues is sufficient to replicate the decentralised spatial structure of the clock that we observe experimentally. Our simple model offers a qualitative match to data. In the future it will be interesting to develop more mechanistic models of the plant circadian clock at the single cell level, as has been done at the bulk level previously ( Fogelmark and Troein,2014; Pokko et al,2012 ).

    Title: Bottom-up and top-down neural signatures of disordered multi-talker speech perception in adults with normal hearing
    Abstract: In social settings, speech waveforms from nearby speakers mix together in our ear canals. Normally, the brain unmixes the attended speech stream from the chorus of background speakers using a combination of fast temporal processing and cognitive active listening mechanisms. Of >100, 000 patient records, ~10% of adults visited our clinic because of reduced hearing, only to learn that their hearing was clinically normal and should not cause communication difficulties. We found that multi-talker speech intelligibility thresholds varied widely in normal hearing adults, but could be predicted from neural phase-locking to frequency modulation ( FM ) cues measured with ear canal EEG recordings. Combining neural temporal fine structure processing, pupil-indexed listening effort, and behavioral FM thresholds accounted for 78% of the variability in multi-talker speech intelligibility. The disordered bottom-up and top-down markers of poor multi-talker speech perception identified here could inform the design of next-generation clinical tests for hidden hearing disorders.

   ., 2019; Paraouty et al., 2016; Wallaert et al., 2018 ). The spatial distribution of neural generators for the FMFR also deserves additional study, as some off-channel higher frequency neurons may be combined with low-frequency tonotopically aligned neurons ( Gockel et al., 2015; Parthasarathy et al., 2016 ). Here, we characterized processing of FM tones using a combination of classic psychophysical tests and a newly developed ear canal EEG FMFR. Because we looked at changes in phase-locking to the carrier, and not the actual rate of FM, we were able to explicitly emphasize neural coding of these timing cues in the early auditory system, while minimizing contributions from the recovered envelope, which would be reflected as the 2 Hz FM rate. The FMFR was strongly correlated with behavioral FM detection, suggesting that this response reflects aspects of the behavioral FM detection task ( Figure 2H ), and was also correlated with performance on the digits task ( Figure 2I ), suggesting that the representation of these fine stimulus timing cues contributes to multi-talker speech intelligibility. Subjects with the lowest FM detection thresholds exhibited a small increase in FMFR amplitudes across a broad range of shallow excursion depths before suddenly increasing at FM excursion depths that exceeded the limits of a single cochlear filter, perhaps indicating the transition from a timing to a place code ( Figure 2F ). By contrast, the IPDFR transfer function in subjects with the lowest IPD thresholds increased steadily for all IPDs above zero ( Figure 3D ). As a result, top psychophysical performers had a shallow transfer function for FM excursion depth but a steep transfer function for IPDFR, producing a positive correlation between FMFR and FM detection threshold ( Figure 2H ) and a negative correlation between the IPDFR and IPD detection threshold ( Figure 3F )

., 2017 ). Adding neural markers of higher-order stream segregation to the multivariate model ( Divenyi, 2014; Krishnan et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2017; Shamma et al., 2011; Teki et al., 2013 ) or direct neural speech decoding ( Ding and Simon, 2012; Ding and Simon, 2009; Maddox and Lee, 2018; Mesgarani et al., 2014; Mesgarani et al., 2008; Pasley et al., 2012; Presacco et al., 2016 ) would very likely capture even more of the unexplained variability in multi-talker speech intelligibility, though they offer less insight into the particular mode of sensory failure than FMFR and are also considerably harder to implement in a clinical setting. Our findings suggest that the individuals who struggle most to follow conversations in noisy, social settings might be identified both by poor bottom-up processing of rapid temporal cues in speech and also by an over-utilization of top-down active listening resources. The interplay between bottom-up and top-down processing is likely more complex than a simple tradeoff where poor sTFS processing is linked to strong pupil-indexed listening effort, or vice versa, as we observed no linear correlation between these variables and no pattern emerged on a subject by subject basis ( Figure 5A ). Understanding how organisms balance bottom-up and top-down processing strategies to encode communication signals is a question of utmost importance ( Enikolopov et al., 2018; Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2014; Moore and Woolley, 2019 ). In the context of human speech perception, this question would be best tackled by an approach that more explicitly identified the implementation of cognitive active listening mechanisms and was statistically powered to address the question of individual differences ( Jasmin et al., 2019; Lim et al., 2019; Michalka et al., 2015 )

. Our subjects agreed to participate in a multi-stage research study consisting of self-reported questionnaires, behavioral measures of hearing, and EEG measures of auditory processing ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ). Like the patients from the clinical database, the audiograms from these subjects were clinically normal, yet many reported difficulties with speech intelligibility, particularly in listening conditions with multiple overlapping speakers ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4A ). We directly measured speech-in-noise intelligibility with a digits comprehension task, which simulates the acoustic challenge of focused listening in multi-talker environments, while eliminating linguistic and contextual speech cues. Subjects attended to a familiar male speaker ( F0 = 115 Hz ) producing a stream of four digits in the presence of one male and one female distracting speakers ( F0 = 90 Hz and 175 Hz, respectively ). The distracting speakers produced digits simultaneously at variable signal-to-noise ratios ( SNRs ) ( Figure 1E ). Performance on the digits task decreased as a function of SNR ( Figure 1F ). Speech reception thresholds, defined as the 70. 7% correct point on the response curve, varied widely across a 0–7 dB SNR range with a mean of 2. 42 dB ( Figure 1G ). We found that speech intelligibility thresholds were significantly correlated with the subjects’ self-reported difficulties in multi-speaker conditions, suggesting that the digits comprehension task captures aspects of their real-world communication difficulties ( r = 0. 46, p=0. 02, Figure 1—figure supplement 4B ). We first determined whether simple adaptations of existing clinical tests could identify deficits in multi-talker speech intelligibility. We measured hearing thresholds at extended high frequencies, a marker for early noise damage ( Fausti et al., 1981; Le Prell et al., 2013; Mehrparvar et al., 2011 )

. In the same spirit as removing variability related to head size and electrode SNR, we first factored out unrelated measurement noise by expressing the SNR-dependent change in pupil diameter as a fraction of light-induced pupil change in each subject ( Figure 4C ). We confirmed that individuals with steeper pupil recruitment functions had more difficulty in the multi-talker speech task, leading to a significant correlation between min-max/halfmax pupil change and speech intelligibility threshold ( r = 0. 53, p=0. 03, Figure 4D ). Our overall motivation was to develop objective physiological markers that might explain complaints of poor speech communication in individuals with clinically normal hearing. Here, we examined whether poor speech-in-noise intelligibility was associated with poor auditory nerve integrity ( indexed here by ABR wave one amplitude ), poor encoding of monaural sTFS cues ( as indexed by the FMFR ), generally poor fast temporal processing ( indexed here by IPDFR ) and increased utilization of cognitive resources related to effortful listening ( indexed here by pupil change ). Importantly, none of these indices were correlated with each other, suggesting that – in principle – each of these markers could account for statistically independent components of the total variance in speech performance ( Figure 5A, right ). In practice, only FMFR and pupil showed a significant independent correlation with speech intelligibility threshold ( Figure 5A, left ). To determine whether combining these independent metrics could account for an even greater fraction of the total variance, we used a multiple variable linear regression model, and computed the adjusted R2 values, after adding each successive variable. Variables were added in decreasing order of individual R2 values. The adjusted R2 penalizes for model complexity incurred due to the addition of more variables ( See Materials and methods )

. Alternatively, perceptual thresholds for FM could reflect a superior abstracted representation of stimulus features at any downstream stage of neural processing, and not the high fidelity representation of sTFS cues, per se. Taking this line of argument a step further, a correlation between competing talker thresholds and FM thresholds may not reflect the stimulus representation at all, but instead could reflect subjects’ general aptitude for utilizing cognitive resources such as attention and effort to perform a wide range of listening tasks ( Pichora-Fuller et al., 2016 ). To test the hypothesis that early neural processing of sTFS cues in the FM tone is associated with superior speech-in-noise processing, we developed a non-invasive physiological measure of neural sTFS phase-locking at early stages of auditory processing. We first determined that an ear canal to measure of phase-locking to the carrier, not the rate of FM, would emphasize neural coding of these cues in the early system while minimizing contributions from the envelope, which would be reflected the 2 FM rate. The FM was strongly correlated with behavioral FM detection, suggesting this response reflects aspects of the FM task and also correlated with performance on the digits task suggesting the representation of fine timing cues contributes to multi-t speech intelligibility. Subjects with lowest FM thresholds exhibited an increase in FM amplitudes across a range of shallow depths before increasing at depths that exceeded the limits of a cochlear filter, indicating transition from timing to place code. By contrast, IPD transfer in subjects with lowest thresholds increased steadily for all above zero. As a result, top performers had a transfer for excursion but a transfer for IPD producing a correlation between FM and detection and a negative between IPD and detection.

    Title: Imaging single-cell blood flow in the smallest to largest vessels in the living retina
    Abstract: Tissue light scatter limits the visualization of the microvascular network deep inside the living mammal. The transparency of the mammalian eye provides a noninvasive view of the microvessels of the retina, a part of the central nervous system. Despite its clarity, imperfections in the optics of the eye blur microscopic retinal capillaries, and single blood cells flowing within. This limits early evaluation of microvascular diseases that originate in capillaries. To break this barrier, we use 15 kHz adaptive optics imaging to noninvasively measure single-cell blood flow, in one of the most widely used research animals: the C57BL/6J mouse. Measured flow ranged four orders of magnitude ( 0. 0002–1. 55 µL min–1 ) across the full spectrum of retinal vessel diameters ( 3. 2–45. 8 µm ), without requiring surgery or contrast dye. Here, we describe the ultrafast imaging, analysis pipeline and automated measurement of millions of blood cell speeds.

    Supporting Text:
    Seminal work studying blood flow in the human retina using adaptive optics space-time images ( Tam et al., 2011b; Zhong et al., 2008 ) used manual determination of cell velocity, which could take hours to days of analysis time due to the problem of scale ( hundreds of thousands of blood cell measurements required per vessel for even a few seconds of collected data ). Lengthy analysis times preclude the use of such techniques in a clinical setting. In this study, we report single-cell velocity and flow rate in the smallest to largest vessels in the living mouse retina. This was enabled by AOSLO imaging with ultrafast camera capture to noninvasively image blood cells without foreign contrast agents. Pairing this novel imaging paradigm with an automated analysis workflow enabled high-throughput velocity measurement of hundreds of thousands of blood cells per second. Together, these developments provide a new, automated and label-free way of determining vascular perfusion and flow dynamics in the mammal retina, in conditions of health and disease. For the first time, a functional map of the complete arteriolar tree and venular return of the mouse retina was characterized, with absolute flow measurements performed across all vessel generations and sizes. Pulsatile flow was measured across all retinal vessel sizes, from capillaries to arterioles and venules. This counters the conventional wisdom that capillaries lack pulsatile flow. Quantification of vascular indices like those of pulsatility and profile bluntness across cardiac phases showed utility of measuring subtle temporal and spatial fluctuations of flow, and not just the mean flow, to identify functional signatures that may be disrupted in disease. The mouse model, with a completely sequenced genome, has become a widely used tool in medical research in the last two decades. Despite this, there is a paucity of retinal blood flow studies in the mouse, as we detail in Table 1

., 1997; Roorda and Duncan, 2015; Roorda et al., 2002 ). Recent advances ( Chui et al., 2012; Guevara-Torres et al., 2015; Scoles et al., 2014 ) in developing phase contrast approaches has enabled visualization of translucent cell properties, like blood cell rheology ( Guevara-Torres et al., 2016 ) and blood vessel wall structure ( Burns et al., 2014; Chui et al., 2014; Chui et al., 2012; Sulai et al., 2014 ), without the aid of invasive foreign dyes or particles. Recently, we combined this approach with extremely fast camera speeds to resolve densely packed RBCs in single file flow in capillaries ( 3. 2–6. 5 µm size ) and reported single-blood-cell flux ( Guevara-Torres et al., 2016 ) without using exogenous contrast agents. While the above studies employing adaptive optics have enabled noninvasive measurement of single-cell velocity, measurement of blood flow in the full range of vessel sizes of the mammalian retinal circulation is yet to be achieved. This has partly been a problem of scale as automation is needed to perform quantitative measurements in larger vessels containing hundreds of thousands of blood cells flowing per second. In this study, we provide such a computational approach, thus improving upon seminal adaptive optics strategies ( Tam et al., 2011b; Zhong et al., 2008 ) which used manual velocity determinations, which could take hours to days of analysis time by a human operator. Lengthy analysis times also preclude the use of such techniques in a clinical setting. In this study, we use the living mouse to benchmark the automation of blood velocity data. The mouse is the most widely used laboratory animal, yet there is a paucity of studies providing measures of retinal blood flow in the same. This gap need be addressed as the mouse has been and continues to be used to model human retinal physiology, including blood flow

. The challenge of imaging mouse retinal blood flow is attributed to the difficulties of imaging its rather small eye, with even the largest vessels being only a quarter the size of the largest human retinal vessel. Furthermore, as we detail later in this paper, there is wide discrepancy in the normative values of retinal blood flow reported in the few mouse studies that exist. Given the importance of the laboratory mouse, with its completely sequenced genome and many models of disease, characterization of normative blood flow in the complete vascular tree of the healthy C57BL/6J mouse will propagate future research in a vast number of mouse models of retinal disease and systemic vascular disease. Development on quantification of mouse blood flow approaches will be directly applicable to clinical approaches using the same instrumentation. In this study, we innovate imaging strategies as well as deploy custom algorithms to image single blood cells noninvasively in the smallest to largest vessels of the mouse retinal circulation ( lumen diameters: 3. 2–45. 8 µm ) ; without requiring exogenous contrast agents to facilitate measurement. Measured flow rate per vessel ranged four orders of magnitude ( 0. 0002–1. 55 µL min–1 ) across the complete retinal vascular tree, from the largest vessel near the optic disk to the smallest capillary. In addition to aiding basic science investigation, the noninvasive approach provides a comprehensive array of bioreporters of microvascular perfusion, including: cell velocity, lumen diameter, flow rate, single-cell flux in capillaries, pulsatile and cross-sectional flow, and indices of intrinsic temporal and spatial modulations in flow. To our knowledge, we provide the first measurement of cross-sectional blood-cell velocity profile and the first absolute measurement of pulsatile blood-cell velocity in the mouse retina

. While all the above techniques have made important advances in our understanding of microcirculation in neural tissues, the use of exogenous blood contrast agents raises the concern of maintenance of natural blood perfusion, especially at the capillary level. Furthermore, such invasive techniques cannot be applied to humans. We have shown recently ( Guevara-Torres et al., 2016 ) that with label-free adaptive optics imaging, improved contrast of single blood cells can be achieved in the retina, compared to contrast of dye labeling techniques, especially in high flow conditions. Our method of noninvasively studying the retina may serve as a window to supplement the understanding of microcirculation dynamics in the CNS. The eye may also serve as a window to systemic microvascular health. Vascular diseases like diabetes, atherosclerosis and hypertension are known to impact the microscopic vessels of the body. These tiny vessels often elude in vivo study because of their small size, especially in optically inaccessible areas of the body like the heart, kidneys and other internal organs. Our current study of microvessels in the eye opens the door to indirectly studying systemic microvascular disease by peering into the eye. Finally, the noninvasive nature of this study, and the safe ( infrared ) light levels used, offers the possibility to measure the full spectrum of single blood cell flow in humans ( Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology [Joseph et al., 2018] ).

. Making matters worse, many vascular diseases of the eye are believed to manifest first in capillaries, which generally evade detailed study due to their microscopic size, thus making early detection in the clinic difficult. Retinal capillaries with single file flow are small, with lumen diameter ranging from 3 to 7 µm ( Guevara-Torres et al., 2016 ). This poses a challenge for conventional imaging systems, such as scanning laser ophthalmoscopy ( SLO ) and optical coherence tomography ( OCT ), which do not correct for the aberrations of the eye, and have an optical resolution of 10–13 µm ( Porter et al., 2006; Zhi et al., 2012 ). Imaging techniques that can visualize the larger vessels ( ~10–200 µm ) are still faced with the problem that single blood cells ( ~6–8 µm ) are densely packed and exhibit non-parabolic velocity profiles, making an accurate assessment of mean velocity and flow difficult without empirical knowledge of the profile shape. Detecting subtle functional changes to flow becomes exceedingly difficult as the ratio of vessel lumen to RBC diameter decreases, because of the particulate nature of RBCs in the capill. In this study, we address the challenge of imaging single-cell flow in the smallest to largest vessels of the mouse retina by combining adaptive optics with ultrafast imaging and automated analysis. Our approach enables measurement of blood flow in the full range of retinal vessel diameters (3.2–45.8 µm ) without the use of contrast agents or surgery, providing the first complete map of the arterolar and venular tree of the CBL/6J mouse, with absolute measurements across all vessel sizes.

    Title: Spontaneous symbiotic reprogramming of plant roots triggered by receptor-like kinases
    Abstract: Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase ( SYMRK ) is indispensable for the development of phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhiza ( AM ) as well as nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis, but the mechanisms that discriminate between the two distinct symbiotic developmental fates have been enigmatic. In this study, we show that upon ectopic expression, the receptor-like kinase genes Nod Factor Receptor 1 ( NFR1 ), NFR5, and SYMRK initiate spontaneous nodule organogenesis and nodulation-related gene expression in the absence of rhizobia. Furthermore, overexpressed NFR1 or NFR5 associated with endogenous SYMRK in roots of the legume Lotus japonicus. Epistasis tests revealed that the dominant active SYMRK allele initiates signalling independently of either the NFR1 or NFR5 gene and upstream of a set of genes required for the generation or decoding of calcium-spiking in both symbioses. Only SYMRK but not NFR overexpression triggered the expression of AM-related genes, indicating that the receptors play a key role in the decision between AM- or root nodule symbiosis-development.

    Supporting Text:
    To achieve overexpression, we generated constructs expressing functional SYMRK ( Antolín-Llovera et al., 2014 ), NFR5, or NFR1 under the control of the strong L. japonicus Ubiquitin promoter and added C-terminal mOrange fluorescent tags for detection purposes ( pUB:SYMRK-mOrange, pUB:NFR5-mOrange, pUB:NFR1-mOrange ). The functionality of the NFR constructs was confirmed by their ability to restore nodulation in the corresponding, otherwise nodulation deficient, nfr mutant roots to the level of L. japonicus wild-type roots transformed with the empty vector ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Intriguingly, transgenic expression of any of the three symbiotic RLK versions in L. japonicus roots was sufficient to spontaneously activate the entire nodule organogenesis pathway as evidenced by the formation of nodule-like structures in the absence of rhizobia ( Figure 1; Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). The presence of peripheral vascular bundles instead of a central root vasculature unambiguously identified these lateral organs as spontaneous nodules ( Figure 1C ). Spontaneous nodule primordia or nodules were present on 90% ( 116 out of 129 ), 23% ( 30 out of 133 ), 11% ( 16 out of 182 ), and 0% ( 0 out of 164 ) of L. japonicus root systems at 60 days post transformation ( dpt ) with, respectively, pUB:SYMRK-mOrange, pUB:NFR5-mOrange, pUB:NFR1-mOrange, or the empty vector ( Figure 1A; Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). A total of 810 empty vector roots generated throughout the course of this study did not develop spontaneous nodules in any of the genetic backgrounds and time points tested. Roots expressing functional SYMRK-RFP from its native promoter ( pSYMRK:SYMRK-RFP; Kosuta et al., 2011 ) and grown in the absence of rhizobia did not develop spontaneous nodules, indicating that spontaneous nodulation was triggered by SYMRK expression from the Ubiquitin promoter and not by the addition of a C-terminal tag alone ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 )

Plants circumvent nutrient deficiencies by establishing mutualistic symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhiza ( AM ) fungi or nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and Frankia bacteria ( Gutjahr and Parniske, 2013; Oldroyd, 2013 ). One of the first steps in the reciprocal recognition between rhizobia and the legume Lotus japonicus is the perception of bacterial lipo-chitooligosaccharides, so called nodulation factors, by the two lysin motif ( LysM ) receptor-like kinases ( RLKs ) Nod Factor Receptor 1 ( NFR1 ) and NFR5 ( Madsen et al., 2003; Radutoiu et al., 2003, 2007; Broghammer et al., 2012 ). Nodulation factor application induces two genetically separable calcium signatures in root hair cells; an early transient influx into the cytoplasm and within minutes calcium-spiking - periodic calcium oscillations in and around plant cell nuclei ( Ehrhardt et al., 1996; Miwa et al., 2006; Oldroyd, 2013 ). ( Lipo ) -chitooligosaccharides have also been isolated from AM fungi ( Maillet et al., 2011; Genre et al., 2013 ) and a NFR5-related LysM-RLK from Parasponia has been pinpointed as a likely candidate for their perception ( Op Den Camp et al., 2011 ). The common symbiosis genes of legumes are required for AM and root nodule symbiosis. A subset of these genes is essential for either the generation or the decoding of calcium-spiking. In L. japonicus, the former group encodes the RLK Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase ( SYMRK; Stracke et al., 2002; Antolín-Llovera et al., 2014 ), two cation-permeable ion channels CASTOR and POLLUX ( Imaizumi-Anraku et al., 2005; Charpentier et al., 2008; Venkateshwaran et al., 2012 ) as well as the nucleoporins NUP85, NUP133, and NENA ( Kanamori et al., 2006; Saito et al., 2007; Groth et al., 2010 ). The latter group encodes Calcium Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase ( CCaMK; Tirichine et al., 2006; Miller et al., 2013 ) and CYCLOPS ( Yano et al

. japonicus ( Lohmann et al., 2010 ) take over their role in the root cortex. NFR1 or NFR5 dispensability may be explained by other LysM-RLKs that might engage in alternative receptor complexes with SYMRK. Alternatively, spontaneous SYMRK-mediated signalling might be independent of any LysM-RLK, however, given the large number of LysM-RLKs in legumes ( 17 in L. japonicus; Lohmann et al., 2010 ), it is difficult to test the latter hypothesis conclusively. SYMRK undergoes cleavage of its ectodomain, resulting in a truncated RLK molecule called SYMRK-ΔMLD ( Antolín-Llovera et al., 2014 ). In competition experiments in N. benthamiana leaves, NFR5 binds preferentially to SYMRK-ΔMLD, which experiences rapid turnover in N. benthamiana and in L. japonicus ( Antolín-Llovera et al., 2014 ). As our SYMRK antibody does not recognise endogenous SYMRK-ΔMLD, we were not able to assess whether overexpressed NFR1 or NFR5 also associates with this truncated SYMRK variant in L. japonicus roots. In a hypothetical scenario, the SYMRK-ΔMLD complex with NFR5 forms constitutively to prevent inappropriate signalling, for example in the absence of rhizobia. The recruitment of NFR1, a hypothetical signal initiation event, would be promoted by the presence of nodulation factor. Our observation that upon overexpression in L. japonicus both NFR1 and NFR5 seem to interact with full-length SYMRK ( Figure 4 ) suggests the formation of a ternary complex. This hypothetical complex has dual functionality: it signals through SYMRK on one hand to activate CCaMK and through the NFR1-NFR5 complex on the other hand to trigger the infection-related parallel pathways discovered by Madsen et al. ( 2010 ) and Hayashi et al. ( 2010 ). It is possible that SYMRK has a dual—positive and negative—regulatory role: on the one hand SYMRK promotes signalling but on the other hand SYMRK-ΔMLD may be involved in preventing inappropriate signalling

. A negative regulatory role would explain the exaggerated root hair response of symrk mutants to rhizobia ( Stracke et al., 2002 ), since NFR1–NFR5 interaction is no longer under governance by SYMRK-ΔMLD. It has been demonstrated recently that expression of the intracellular kinase domain of SYMRK ( SYMRK-KD ) from Medicago truncatula or Arachis hypogaea in M. truncatula roots from the CaMV 35S promoter induces nodule organogenesis in the absence of rhizobia ( Saha et al., 2014 ). However, in the presence of Sinorhizobium meliloti, nodules on plants overexpressing SYMR-KD were significantly smaller than those on wild-type plants ( Saha et al, 2014 ) indicating that SYK signalling is not sufficient but necessary for nodule development. Our results suggest that SYK is necessary and sufficient for spontaneous nodule formation in the absence of rhobia.

    Title: DeepPoseKit, a software toolkit for fast and robust animal pose estimation using deep learning
    Abstract: Quantitative behavioral measurements are important for answering questions across scientific disciplines—from neuroscience to ecology. State-of-the-art deep-learning methods offer major advances in data quality and detail by allowing researchers to automatically estimate locations of an animal’s body parts directly from images or videos. However, currently available animal pose estimation methods have limitations in speed and robustness. Here, we introduce a new easy-to-use software toolkit, DeepPoseKit, that addresses these problems using an efficient multi-scale deep-learning model, called Stacked DenseNet, and a fast GPU-based peak-detection algorithm for estimating keypoint locations with subpixel precision. These advances improve processing speed >2x with no loss in accuracy compared to currently available methods. We demonstrate the versatility of our methods with multiple challenging animal pose estimation tasks in laboratory and field settings—including groups of interacting individuals. Our work reduces barriers to using advanced tools for measuring behavior and has broad applicability across the behavioral sciences.

    Here, we have presented a new software toolkit, called DeepPoseKit, for estimating animal posture using deep learning models. We built on the state-of-the-art for individual pose estimation using convolutional neural networks to achieve fast inference without reducing accuracy or generalization ability. Our new pose estimation model, called Stacked DenseNet, offers considerable improvements ( Figure 3a; Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) over the models from Mathis et al. ( 2018 ) ( DeepLabCut ) and Pereira et al. ( 2019 ) ( LEAP ), and our software framework also provides a simplified interface ( Figure 3b ) for using these advanced tools to measure animal behavior and locomotion. We tested our methods across a range of datasets from controlled laboratory environments with single individuals to challenging field situations with multiple interacting individuals and variable lighting conditions. We found that our methods perform well for all these situations and require few training examples to achieve good predictive performance on new data—without the use of transfer learning. We ran experiments to optimize our approach and discovered that some straightforward modifications can greatly improve speed and accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrated that these modifications improve not the just the average error but also help to reduce extreme prediction errors—a key determinant for the reliability of subsequent statistical analysis. While our results offer a good-faith comparison of the available methods for animal pose estimation, there is inherent uncertainty that we have attempted to account for but may still bias our conclusions. For example, deep learning models are trained using stochastic optimization algorithms that give different results with each replicate, and the Bayesian statistical methods we use for comparison are explicitly probabilistic in nature

. g., Van den Oord et al., 2016a; Van den Oord et al., 2016b; Kumar et al., 2019 ), rather than modeling the scene in each video frame as a statistically independent event. Together these advances could lead to larger, higher-resolution, more reliable behavioral datasets that could revolutionize our understanding of relationships between behavior, the brain, and the environment. In conclusion, we have presented a new toolkit, called DeepPoseKit, for automatically measuring animal posture from images. We combined recent advances from the literature to create methods that are fast, robust, and widely applicable to a range of species and experimental conditions. When designing our framework we emphasized usability across the entire software interface, which we expect will help to make these advanced tools accessible to a wider range of researchers. The fast inference and real-time capabilities of our methods should also help further reduce barriers to previously intractable questions across many scientific disciplines—including neuroscience, ethology, and behavioral ecology—both in the laboratory and the field.

., 2018; Pereira et al., 2019 ). Recently, these advancements have been further improved through the use of deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms that learn complex statistical relationships from data ( LeCun et al., 2015 ). Deep learning has opened the door to accurately tracking large groups of marked ( Wild et al., 2018; Boenisch et al., 2018 ) or unmarked ( Romero-Ferrero et al., 2019 ) individuals and has made it possible to measure the body posture of animals in nearly any context—including 'in the wild' ( Nath et al., 2019 ) —by tracking the positions of user-defined body parts ( Mathis et al., 2018; Pereira et al., 2019 ). These advances have drastically increased the quality and quantity, as well as the diversity, of behavioral data that are potentially available to researchers for answering scientific questions. In the past, conventional methods for measuring posture with computer vision relied on species-specific algorithms ( Uhlmann et al., 2017 ), highly specialized or restrictive experimental setups ( Mendes et al., 2013; Kain et al., 2013 ), attaching intrusive physical markers to the study animal ( Kain et al., 2013 ), or some combination thereof. These methods also typically required expert computer-vision knowledge to use, were limited in the number or type of body parts that could be tracked ( Mendes et al., 2013 ), involved capturing and handling the study animals to attach markers ( Kain et al., 2013 ) —which is not possible for many species—and despite best efforts to minimize human involvement, often required manual intervention to correct errors ( Uhlmann et al., 2017 ). These methods were all built to work for a small range of conditions and typically required considerable effort to adapt to novel contexts

. Both the mean and variance of the error distributions were lower when predicting the posture graph, which suggests that learning multi-scale geometry both decreases error on average and helps to reduce extreme prediction errors. The overall effect size for this decrease in error is fairly small ( <1 pixel average reduction in error ), but based on the results from the zebra dataset, this modification more dramatically improves performance for datasets with higher variance images and sparse posture graphs. Predicting the posture graph may be especially useful for animals with long slender appendages such as insect legs and antennae where prediction errors are likely to occur due to occlusions and natural variation in the movement of these body parts. These results also suggest that annotating multiple keypoints to incorporate an explicit signal for multi-scale information may help improve prediction accuracy for a specific body part of interest. We benchmarked our new model implementations against the models Pereira et al. ( 2019 ) and Mathis et al. ( 2018 ). We find that our Stacked DenseNet model outperforms both the LEAP model ( Pereira et al., 2019 ) and the DeepLabCut model ( Mathis et al., 2018 ) in terms of speed while also achieving much higher accuracy than the LEAP model ( Pereira et al., 2019 ) with similar accuracy to the DeepLabCut model ( Mathis et al., 2018; Figure 3a ). We found that both the Stacked Hourglass and Stacked DenseNet models outperformed the LEAP model ( Pereira et al., 2019 ). Notably our Stacked DenseNet model achieved approximately 2× faster inference speeds with 3× higher mean accuracy. Not only were our models average prediction error significantly improved, but also, importantly, the variance was lower—indicating that our models produced fewer extreme prediction errors

. Once the barriers for implementing and training a model are sufficiently reduced, the main bottleneck for using these methods becomes collecting an adequate training set—a labor-intensive task made less time-consuming by techniques described in Appendix 3. Mathis et al. ( 2018 ) and Pereira et al. ( 2019 ) were the first to popularize the use of CNNs for animal pose estimation. These researchers built on work from the human pose estimation literature ( e. g., Andriluka et al., 2014; Insafutdinov et al., 2016; Newell et al., 2016 ) using a type of fully-convolutional neural network or F-CNN ( Long et al., 2015; Appendix 4 ) often referred to as an encoder-decoder model ( Appendix 4: 'Encoder-decoder models' ). These models are used to measure animal posture by training the network to transform images into probabilistic estimates of keypoint locations, known as confidence maps ( shown in Figure 2 ), that describe the body posture for one or more individuals. These confidence maps are processed to produce the 2-D spatial coordinates of each keypoint, which can then be used for further analysis. While deep-learning models typically need large amounts of training data, both Mathis et al. ( 2018 ) and Pereira et al. ( 2019 ) have demonstrated that near human-level accuracy can be achieved with few training examples ( Appendix 3 ). In order to ensure generalization to large datasets, both groups of researchers introduced ideas related to iteratively refining the training set used for model fitting ( Mathis et al., 2018; Pereira et al., 2019 ). In particular, Pereira et al. ( 2019 ) describe a technique known as active learning where a trained model is used to initialize new training data and reduce annotation time ( Appendix 3 ). Mathis et al. ( 2018 ) describe multiple techniques that can be used to further refine training data and minimize overfitting ( Appendix 3 ), such as data augmentation (Appendix 3: Data augmentation ) and transfer learning (Appendix: Transfer learning ).
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism by which innate immune cells, such as macrophages, sense and respond to metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens. Specifically, they found that disruption of glycolytic flux is a trigger for NLRP-mediated signaling, IL-1 production, and pyptosis in primed murine bone-derived macrophages. This results from a drop in NAD levels and induction of mitochondrial ROS, which can be rescued by addition of products that restore NAD production. This signaling is also important for host response to intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimur, which disrupts host glucose metabolism by uptake. Results reveal an inflammatory network used by immune cells to sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens.

The study used a small molecule, GB-N2, to identify glycol enzymes that regulate inflamome formation. Functionally, innate cells sense metabolic perturbation as danger, resulting in inflome, caspase activation, and cytokine secretion. Results using this molecule and other inhibitors suggest disrupting glycol flux serves as trigger for inflammation and cell death in macrophages. Disturbance of glycol flux by intracellular pathogen S. tyimur results in inflome and pypt cell death in effort to clear path. Restoration of metabolism of glycol disruption by GB-N2 or S. tyur infection was sufficient to abrogate inflome response by restoring NAD production and preventing ROS.

Inhibition of glycol creates a metabolic state that activates NLR inflamome. Results suggest immune cells sense perturbed metabolite and flux through glycol pathway, activating NLR to initiate responses. Inhibitors of fluxing enzymes and S. tyur effectively glycol through distinct mechanisms, resulting NLR-mediated inflamome and pypt. Glycol disruption may be broadly mechanism NLR activation in response metabolic by parasism microbes. Moreover, this pathway may provide avenues for treating diseases NLR-driven in pathology.

    Title: Novel RNA and DNA strand exchange activity of the PALB2 DNA binding domain and its critical role for DNA repair in cells
    Abstract: BReast Cancer Associated proteins 1 and 2 ( BRCA1, −2 ) and Partner and Localizer of BRCA2 ( PALB2 ) protein are tumour suppressors linked to a spectrum of malignancies, including breast cancer and Fanconi anemia. PALB2 coordinates functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 during homology-directed repair ( HDR ) and interacts with several chromatin proteins. In addition to protein scaffold function, PALB2 binds DNA. The functional role of this interaction is poorly understood. We identified a major DNA-binding site of PALB2, mutations in which reduce RAD51 foci formation and the overall HDR efficiency in cells by 50%. PALB2 N-terminal DNA-binding domain ( N-DBD ) stimulates the function of RAD51 recombinase. Surprisingly, it possesses the strand exchange activity without RAD51. Moreover, N-DBD stimulates the inverse strand exchange and can use DNA and RNA substrates. Our data reveal a versatile DNA interaction property of PALB2 and demonstrate a critical role of PALB2 DNA binding for chromosome repair in cells.

    Supporting Text:
    We identified major DNA-binding residues of PALB2 and demonstrated their critical role for HDR in cells. PALB2 is described as a scaffold protein linking BRCA1 with BRCA2 during HDR and interacting with many other chromatin proteins. However, the truncation variant with the preserved BRCA1 and BRCA2 binding motifs but without the middle portion of the protein, which contains DBDs, does not support BRCA2 and RAD51 recruitment to DSBs ( Sy et al., 2009b ). Recent studies suggest an alternative BRCA1-independent recruitment of PALB2 to DSB through direct interaction with RNF168 ( Luijsterburg et al., 2017; Zong et al., 2019 ). However, this interaction is mediated by the C-terminal WD40 domain, which is preserved in the described above truncation mutant. A critical role of PALB2 DNA binding was also suggested by studies of the BRCA2 ( Siaud et al., 2011 ), where the ‘miniBRCA2’ construct, including only DBDs with two BRC repeats, was 3–4 times less efficient than ‘midiBRCA2’ which includes PALB2 interaction motif. Moreover, interaction with PALB2 alleviates the requirement of BRCA2 DNA binding, including a deletion of the entire BRCA2 DBD. Here, we demonstrate that mutation of only four DNA-binding residues of PALB2 reduces both RAD51 foci and overall HDR efficiency by 50% in the presence of endogenous BRCA1 and BRCA2. Even at 8 hr post-IR siRNA PALB2 cells complemented with PALB2-146AAAA still display a defect in HR. We suggest that the mutant display a failure to repair a subset of DSBs due to its defective DNA binding. Therefore, PALB2 interaction with DNA is critical for recruitment of the BRCA2 and RAD51 to DSB sites and efficient DNA repair in cells. Secondly, we demonstrate that the PALB2 N-DBD stimulates RAD51-mediated strand exchange in vitro. N-DBD encompasses the RAD51 binding site, therefore, it can recruit RAD51 to ssDNA to initiate nucleation of nucleoprotein filament

Breast cancer associated proteins 1 and 2 ( BRCA1, −2 ) regulate an efficient non-mutagenic pathway of chromosome break repair and are described as guardians of chromosomal integrity ( Venkitaraman, 2014 ). They initiate RAD51-mediated homologous recombination ( HR ) ( Davies et al., 2001; Moynahan et al., 2001; Sharan et al., 1997; Venkitaraman, 2000 ) and facilitate restart of stalled replication ( Badie et al., 2010; Lomonosov et al., 2003; Schlacher et al., 2011 ). BRCA2 belongs to a ubiquitous family of Recombination Mediator Proteins ( RMPs ), which stimulate formation of recombinase filament on single-stranded ( ss ) DNA protected by ssDNA-binding proteins, like SSB and RPA ( Beernink and Morrical, 1999; Cox, 2007; Kowalczykowski, 2005 ). The Partner and Localizer of BRCA2 ( PALB2 ) protein was discovered as a protein forming a complex with BRCA2 and regulating BRCA2 activity ( Xia et al., 2006 ). Like BRCA proteins, PALB2 is an essential mammalian protein linked to a similar spectrum of cancers and Fanconi anemia ( Ducy et al., 2019; Pauty et al., 2014; Xia et al., 2007 ). The PALB2 C-terminal WD40 domain interacts with BRCA2 ( Oliver et al., 2009; Xia et al., 2006 ) while the N-terminus forms a complex with BRCA1 ( Zhang et al., 2009a; Zhang et al., 2009b ). The latter localizes at double-stranded DNA break ( DSB ) sites at earlier stage of repair, inhibiting an alternative pathway of non-homologous end joining and initiating homology-directed repair ( HDR ) through recruitment of PALB2/BRCA2/RAD51 ( Prakash et al., 2015 ). PALB2 is often described as the hub for a network of tumor suppressors ( Park et al., 2014b; Sy et al., 2009b ). In addition to BRCA1 and −2 interactions, it contains a chromatin-association motif ( ChAM ) that interacts with histones H3 and H2B ( Bleuyard et al., 2012 ). PALB2 binds MRG15 protein, a component of histone acetyltransferase-deacetylase complexes ( Hayakawa et al

., 2010 ). While the precise mechanism of DNA interaction and its functional role remain unknown, several reports indirectly support its importance in DNA repair. For example, PALB2 truncation of 500 amino acids situated between the BRCA1 and BRCA2 binding motifs and containing both DBDs does not support BRCA2 and RAD51 foci formation in cells during DNA damage ( Sy et al., 2009b ). Since both the BRCA1-binding N-terminal and the BRCA2-interacting WD40 C-terminal domains are retained in this mutant, the results points to the potential importance of DBDs in PALB2 function. The importance of DNA binding was demonstrated for other RMPs, including bacterial RecFOR ( Korolev, 2017; Morimatsu and Kowalczykowski, 2003; Ryzhikov et al., 2014; Sakai and Cox, 2009; Umezu et al., 1993 ) and eukaryotic RAD52 ( Arai et al., 2011; Seong et al., 2008 ). In the current study, we identified a major DBD of PALB2 ( N-DBD ) and specific amino acids involved in DNA binding. Mutations of only four amino acids significantly reduce RAD51 foci formation and the efficiency of HDR in a model cell system. PALB2 N-DBD by itself stimulates RAD51 strand exchange reactions. Surprisingly, we found that the PALB2 N-DBD supports both forward and inverse strand exchange even in the absence of RAD51 and can use RNA as a substrate. Altogether, our data reveal a novel activity of PALB2 and highlight the importance of PALB2 DNA binding in chromosome maintenance.

. DNA-binding of N-DBD plays a critical role in this process, as the DNA-binding mutant ( 146AAAA ) retains interaction with RAD51 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) but is unable to stimulate RAD51 binding to ssDNA ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ). Alternatively, the PALB2 N-DBD can support a DNA conformation favourable for RAD51 binding to ssDNA or/and nucleation of RAD51 filament, similarly to the prokaryotic RecOR proteins ( Bell et al., 2012; Ryzhikov et al., 2014; Sakai and Cox, 2009 ). The most unexpected finding is the ability of PALB2 to stimulate strand exchange between homologous ss- and dsDNA fragments in the absence of recombinase. This process is protein-specific and is not a consequence of simple DNA melting and reannealing of separated strands in solution, since the PALB2 N-DBD does not unwind the DNA helix and promotes DNA annealing. PALB2-mediated strand exchange differs from that of supported by RAD51, as it does not require ATP binding and hydrolysis and it is less efficient and not unidirectional. This reaction resembles that of the RAD52 ( Mazina et al., 2017 ). In the cited manuscript, RAD52 promotes inverse reaction much more efficiently than forward and seemingly faster than that by PALB2 in our hands. However, the substrates used in RAD52 studies differ from those of PAL2. RAD52 was tested with homologous ssDNA while PAL2 with homolog ssDNA and dsDNA. Moreover, RAD52 was tested in vitro while PAL2 in vitro and in cells. Our results suggest that PAL2 NDB is a versatile protein capable of supporting both forward and inverse strand exchange in the absence of recombinase and can use RNA as a substrate. Overall, our data demonstrate that PAL2 plays a critical role in chromosome repair and highlight the importance of PAL2 DNA binding in this process.

Here is a clear, accurate, and formal summary of the research article, written in a way that is accessible to a general audience while maintaining scientific rigor:

The PAL2 protein, a partner of the BRCA2 protein, plays a crucial role in DNA repair in cells by binding to DNA and interacting with other proteins. Researchers have identified a specific DNA-binding site on PAL2 and found that mutations in this site reduce the efficiency of DNA repair by 50%. They also found that the N-terminal domain of PAL2 (NDB) stimulates the activity of the RAD51 protein, which is involved in DNA repair, and surprisingly, it can exchange DNA strands without the help of RAD51. This suggests that PAL2 has a versatile interaction with DNA and a critical role in DNA repair. The study also found that PAL2 can use RNA as a substrate for strand exchange, which is a new function not previously known. This research highlights the importance of PAL2 in DNA binding and its role in DNA repair.

Key points:

* PAL2 binds to DNA and interacts with other proteins
* Mutations in PAL2 reduce DNA repair efficiency by 50%
* PAL2 N-terminal domain stimulates RAD51 activity
* PAL2 can exchange DNA strands without RAD51
* PAL can use RNA as a substrate for strand exchange
* PAL plays a critical role in DNA repair

    Title: Bacterial actin MreB forms antiparallel double filaments
    Abstract: Filaments of all actin-like proteins known to date are assembled from pairs of protofilaments that are arranged in a parallel fashion, generating polarity. In this study, we show that the prokaryotic actin homologue MreB forms pairs of protofilaments that adopt an antiparallel arrangement in vitro and in vivo. We provide an atomic view of antiparallel protofilaments of Caulobacter MreB as apparent from crystal structures. We show that a protofilament doublet is essential for MreB's function in cell shape maintenance and demonstrate by in vivo site-specific cross-linking the antiparallel orientation of MreB protofilaments in E. coli. 3D cryo-EM shows that pairs of protofilaments of Caulobacter MreB tightly bind to membranes. Crystal structures of different nucleotide and polymerisation states of Caulobacter MreB reveal conserved conformational changes accompanying antiparallel filament formation. Finally, the antimicrobial agents A22/MP265 are shown to bind close to the bound nucleotide of MreB, presumably preventing nucleotide hydrolysis and destabilising double protofilaments.

   . Force-generating motors that push plasmids apart all contain pairs of parallel helical protofilaments as their basic building block ( Gayathri et al., 2012, 2013; Polka et al., 2009; Popp et al., 2010a, 2010c, 2012; van den Ent et al., 2002; Galkin et al., 2012 ). Presumably, the membrane-binding ability of MreB and FtsA constrains their filament architecture to straight ( or slightly bent ), rather than helical, pairs of protofilaments. But how are these filaments arranged? Here, we demonstrate that MreB from Caulobacter crescentus forms pairs of antiparallel protofilaments as revealed by crystal structures, an architecture unprecedented among actin-like proteins. The antiparallel arrangement ensures that the amphipathic helix of each protofilament binds to membranes as shown by cryo-electron microscopy ( cryo-EM ). Pairs of protofilaments are essential for cell shape maintenance in Escherichia coli and these are shown to be oriented in an antiparallel fashion by in vivo cross-linking. The mechanism for protofilament formation of C. crescentus MreB is elucidated by crystallography and shown to be reminiscent of that of other actin-like proteins, revealing the typical domain closure upon polymerisation. Finally, co-crystallisation studies of Caulobacter MreB with the antimicrobial reagents A22 and MP265 explain their inhibitory mechanism and shed light on the activation mechanism of ATP hydrolysis during polymerisation.

The antiparallel arrangement of protofilaments of C. crescentus MreB as revealed by the crystal structure ( Figure 1D ) and by EM ( Figure 2A–C ) is unprecedented within the actin family of proteins. It ensures that the amphipathic helix of both protofilaments can bind to the membrane and that both protofilaments are able to interact with bitopic proteins, such as RodZ ( van den Ent et al., 2010 ). In vivo evidence shows that the antiparallel arrangement is not an in vitro artefact and does indeed reflect the filament architecture in E. coli ( Figures 4 and 5 ). Filament formation could have a synergistic effect on the elongasome by bringing together components that reach a higher local concentration through the interaction with polymeric MreB. Given the almost surprising high degree of similarity between the structures of MreB from mesophilic and thermophilic organisms ( Figure 1A ), it is expected that the antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments is conserved among the bacterial kingdom. This has far reaching consequences for the molecular mechanism of MreB's function. Actin, MamK, ParM, and the other plasmid-segregating, actin-like proteins form pairs of protofilaments with subunits facing the same direction ( Ozyamak et al., 2013b ). In F-actin, the polar ends exhibit different growth and shrinkage rates and selectively interact with binding partners that affect filament protection or nucleation ( Pollard and Mooseker, 1981; Wegner, 1982; Wang, 1985; Pollard, 1986; Selve and Wegner, 1986; Theriot and Mitchison, 1991 ). Pairs of parallel ParM protofilaments extend from the ParRC-interacting end ( Gayathri et al., 2012 ). Discrimination of either end has to be absent in the antiparallel arrangement found in the doublets of MreB protofilaments ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) and hence MreB filaments must grow and shrink from both ends

Structural insight into MreB from mesophilic bacteria has been hampered by the tendency of the proteins to aggregate upon purification, but through biochemical and bioengineering tools sufficient quantities of stable versions of Caulobacter crescentus MreB were obtained ( Table 1 ) that were amenable to structural studies. Deleting the N-terminal amphipathic helix and mutating the residues in the hydrophobic loop ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) make the protein ( ΔCcMreBdh ) less prone to aggregation. The crystal structure of Caulobacter MreB ( ΔCcMreBdh ) reveals the typical actin fold, containing two domains on either side of a nucleotide binding cleft ( Figure 1A; Kabsch and Holmes, 1995 ). Both domains are separated into two subdomains, A and B. Domain II is structurally the most preserved domain within the actin family of proteins, whereas domain IB is the most diverse. But even this domain is very similar in both Caulobacter MreB and Thermotoga maritima MreB ( TmMreBh, van den Ent et al., 2001 ), superimposing with an RMSD of 0. 97 Å ( Figure 1A ). The protofilament architecture is also very well conserved, with an identical subunit repeat distance of 51. 1 Å and a similar arrangement of the longitudinal interface ( Figure 1C ). However, only single protofilaments were present in the Thermotoga MreB crystals, despite the fact that electron microscopy images clearly show doublets ( van den Ent et al., 2001 ). In contrast, the crystals of Caulobacter MreB contain doublets that, remarkably, crystallised in an antiparallel arrangement ( Figure 1D ). The electrostatic surface potential of the double protofilaments reveals the hydrophobic loop and the basic charges surrounding the membrane-binding site ( Figure 1B ). 10. 7554/eLife. 02634. 003Table 1.

Cell shape is a characteristic and hereditary feature that is crucial for existence and its regulation is a common challenge for organisms across all biological kingdoms. Shape in eukaryotic cells is provided by the cytoskeleton that consists of actin, tubulin, and intermediate filaments. Prokaryotes also have a dynamic, filamentous network of proteins, which are homologous to the eukaryotic cytoskeletal elements ( Löwe and Amos, 2009 ). In non-spherical bacteria, the actin homologue MreB ( Jones et al., 2001; van den Ent et al., 2001 ) is essential for shape maintenance as depletion of MreB through genetic knockouts or MreB-targeted drug treatment results in misshapen cells that eventually lyse ( Wachi et al., 1987; Levin et al., 1992; Lee et al., 2003; Bendezú and de Boer, 2008 ). Incorrect localisation of MreB adversely affects polar targeting of protein complexes and, in some organisms, chromosome segregation ( Gitai et al., 2004, 2005; Wagner et al., 2005; Cowles and Gitai, 2010 ). Vital for MreB's role in cell shape determination is the interaction with the elongasome, the protein complex orchestrating peptidoglycan cell wall morphogenesis. The elongasome consists of MreC and MreD ( MreB's operon partners ), RodA, PBP1A, PBP2, RodZ, as well as MurF, MurG and MraY ( Alyahya et al., 2009; Favini-Stabile et al., 2013; Gaballah et al., 2011; Holtje, 1996; Mattei et al., 2010; Mohammadi et al., 2007; Shiomi et al., 2008; Szwedziak et al,2011 ) Mre interacts with the elongome through its N-terminal amphipathic helix ( van Ent et al. 2001 ) and the hydrophobic loop ( Figure 1— supplement 1 ). The interaction is essential for Mre's function in cell shape maintenance as shown by cross-linking the antipar orientation of Mre protoaments in E. coli ( Figures 4 and 5 ). The antipar arrangement of Mre protoaments ensures that the amphipic helix of both protoaments can bind to the membrane and both protoaments can interact with bitopic proteins such as Rod ( van Ent et al. 201 ). The interaction with the elongome is also crucial for Mre's role in chromosome segregation in some organisms ( Git et al 2005; Wagner et al 2005 Cowles and Git 201 ). The mechanism of Mre's interaction with the elongome is not fully understood, but the antipar arrangement of Mre protoaments may facilitate the interaction by bringing components of the elongome to a higher local concentration through the interaction with polymeric Mre. The antipar arrangement of Mre protoaments has far-reaching consequences for the mechanism of Mre's function. Act, Mam, Par, and other plid-segregating act-like proteins form pairs of protoaments with subunits facing the same direction ( Ozy et al 2013 ). In contrast, the antipar arrangement found in doublets of Mre protoaments ( Figure 1— supplement ) suggests that Mre filaments grow and shrink from both ends. The antipar arrangement of Mre protoaments is conserved among the bacterial kingdom as shown by the high degree of similarity between the structures of Mre from mesophil and thermophil organisms ( Figure 1 ). This has implications for the mechanism of Mre's function and its interaction with the elongome. The antipar arrangement of Mre protoaments ensures the amphip helix of both protoaments bind to the membrane and both protoaments can interact with bitopic proteins such as Rod ( van et al 201 ). The interaction with elongome is crucial for M's role in chromosome segregation in some organisms ( et 5; Wagner et 5 Cow and  ) The mechanism of M's interaction with elong is not fully understood but antipar arrangement M protoaments may facilitate interaction by bringing components elong to higher concentration through polymeric M. The antipar of M protoaments has far-reaching consequences for mechanism M's function Act, Mam, Par, and other plid-segregating act-like form pairs protoaments subunits same direction ( O et 201b ) In contrast antipar found doublets M protoaments Figure 1— supplement M filaments grow shrink and from ends

    Title: The role of APETALA1 in petal number robustness
    Abstract: Invariant floral forms are important for reproductive success and robust to natural perturbations. Petal number, for example, is invariant in Arabidopsis thaliana flowers. However, petal number varies in the closely related species Cardamine hirsuta, and the genetic basis for this difference between species is unknown. Here we show that divergence in the pleiotropic floral regulator APETALA1 ( AP1 ) can account for the species-specific difference in petal number robustness. This large effect of AP1 is explained by epistatic interactions: A. thaliana AP1 confers robustness by masking the phenotypic expression of quantitative trait loci controlling petal number in C. hirsuta. We show that C. hirsuta AP1 fails to complement this function of A. thaliana AP1, conferring variable petal number, and that upstream regulatory regions of AP1 contribute to this divergence. Moreover, variable petal number is maintained in C. hirsuta despite sufficient standing genetic variation in natural accessions to produce plants with four-petalled flowers.

    Supporting Text:
    In this study, we identified AP1 as a gene of major effect in the evolutionary transition from a robust phenotype of four petals, typified by A. thaliana, to a variable petal number in C. hirsuta. Despite this large effect, AP1 polymorphisms do not contribute directly to within-species variation in C. hirsuta petal number. Instead, the decanalization of petal number in C. hirsuta involved regulatory changes in AP1 that relaxed its epistasis over alleles that cause petal number to vary. Therefore, our results suggest that AP1 divergence likely exposed cryptic genetic variation in C. hirsuta that contributes directly to maintaining variable petal number within natural accessions of C. hirsuta. AP1 is an important regulator of A. thaliana flower development, acting early to initiate flowers and later to specify floral organs ( Bowman et al., 1993; Irish and Sussex, 1990; Mandel et al., 1992 ). It functions predominantly as a transcriptional repressor during floral initiation and later as an activator during sepal and petal initiation, and has been described as a ‘true hub’ in the gene regulatory network that initiates flower development ( Kaufmann et al., 2010 ). We found that AP1 genes from A. thaliana and C. hirsuta diverged in their ability to specify an invariant number of four petals. This difference mapped broadly to upstream regulatory rather than coding regions of AP1, and did not alter the function of AP1 in flower initiation or sepal specification; suggesting that regulatory sequence divergence can disable specific linkages in gene regulatory networks while maintaining pleiotropic functions in other tissues ( Rebeiz and Tsiantis, 2017 ). We showed that differences in AP1 expression are associated with the functional divergence in AP1 between A. thaliana and C. hirsuta. Specifically, C

. hirsuta. Petal number varied between zero and four, and the average petal number was significantly lower in ap1 plants expressing the AP1 genomic clone from C. hirsuta rather than A. thaliana ( Figures 3a and 4a, b, Mann-Whitney U test p=2. 08e-07 ). In contrast, ChAP1::ChAP1:GFP expression was sufficient to reduce the ectopic flowers in ap1 mutants ( Figure 4b ), indicating that AP1 divergence between C. hirsuta and A. thaliana affected petal number independently of floral meristem identity. Therefore, the results of these gene swaps indicate that C. hirsuta AP1 has a reduced ability to promote four petals when compared to A. thaliana AP1. Next, we considered the relative contributions of regulatory and coding sequences to this species-specific difference in AP1 function. To address this question, we expressed endogenous and chimeric versions of A. thaliana and C. hirsuta AP1, swapping the promoter and coding sequences, in an ap1 mutant background in A. thaliana. We found that petal number was significantly elevated by the A. thaliana AP1 promoter, compared to the C. hirsuta AP1 promoter, irrespective of the AP1 coding sequence driven by these promoters ( Figure 4c ). Whereas all constructs functioned equivalently to rescue the ectopic flowers found in ap1 mutants ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ). Therefore, functional differences in AP1 that are responsible for petal number variation between A. thaliana and C. hirsuta, are more likely to reside in regulatory regions of the gene rather than coding sequences. Since upstream regulatory regions contributed to AP1 divergence, we investigated whether expression differed between C. hirsuta and A. thaliana AP1. We reasoned that the reduced function of C. hirsuta AP1 to promote four petals may reflect reduced levels of gene expression. To test this prediction, we compared AP1 expression between C

. 92e-06; Figure 3a–c ). We found that this transgene was sufficient to convert C. hirsuta petal number from variable to robust, elevating petal number towards the A. thaliana value of four petals ( pairwise Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction, p=2. 4e-08; Figure 3a, d, e ). In contrast to this, the distribution of petal number remained variable in C. hirsuta lines expressing the endogenous AP1 locus ( ChAP1::ChAP1:GFP; pairwise Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction, p=0. 07: Figure 3a ). This suggests that the function of the endogenous AP1 locus to confer four petals is attenuated in C. hirsuta. Therefore, divergence in AP1 function likely contributed to the variation in petal number between A. thaliana and C. hirsuta. This raises the question whether petal number variation both between and within species may be caused by similar genetic changes. If AP1 divergence contributed to petal number variation between species, do AP1 polymorphisms contribute to this phenotype within C. hirsuta? To address this question, we inspected the locations of petal number QTL previously identified in five mapping populations derived from bi-parental crosses of different C. hirsuta accessions ( Pieper et al., 2016 ), and an additional population constructed in this study ( Figure 3f ). We found that none of the QTL mapped to the AP1 locus, which was represented by a specific genetic marker on chromosome 2 ( Figure 3f, Table 1 ) ( Pieper et al., 2016 ). Therefore, allelic variation at AP1 does not contribute to the quantitative variation in petal number mapped in C. hirsuta. However, an alternative possibility is that AP1 divergence indirectly caused petal number to vary within C. hirsuta by altering the robustness of this phenotype to genetic variation. Given that petal number is a canalized trait in A

. hirsuta and A. thaliana ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) ( Brewer et al., 2004; Lampugnani et al., 2012; Lampugnani et al., 2013 ), these results indicate that differences in PTL function are unlikely to account for the variation in petal number between C. hirsuta and A. thaliana. Petals are defined by both their identity and position within a flower. To test whether the variable number of petals in C. hirsuta is dependent on their identity or on the location where they arise in the second whorl, we used the homeotic mutant agamous ( ag ), to alter floral organ identity. In C. hirsuta ag mutants, four petals replaced the four stamens normally found in the third whorl of wild-type flowers, while petal number remained variable and lower than four in the second whorl ( Figure 2h, i ). This means that floral organs with petal identity show no variation in number if they arise outside the second whorl. As predicted by the ABC model ( Coen and Meyerowitz, 1991 ), we found AP1 ectopically expressed in third whorl petals of ag mutants in C. hirsuta ( Figure 2j ). Therefore, ectopic expression of AP1 is associated with an invariant number of petals, whereas endogenous AP1 expression in whorl two of the C. hirsuta floral meristem is associated with variable petal number. We reasoned that AP1 might be a good candidate to contribute to petal number variation in C. hirsuta, particularly given that ap1 mutants in both C. hirsuta and A. thaliana show variable petal loss ( Bowman et al., 1993; Monniaux et al., 2017 ). To test this possibility, we used a genomic construct of A. thaliana AP1 ( AtAP1::AtAP1:GFP ( Urbanus et al., 2009 ) ), which was sufficient to restore four petals in the ap1 mutant ( Figure 4 ), to drive AP expression in the second whl of C huta. huta. We found that AP1 expression in the second whl of C huta huta was sufficient to elevate petal number towards the A thalian value of four ( pairwise Mann-Whitney test with Bonferr correction, p= 2.e-08; Figure 4 ). In contrast, the distribution of pet number remained variable in C huta lines expressing the endogenous AP locus (AP::AP:AP:FP; pairwise Mann-Whitney test with Bonf correction, p= 0.07 Figure 4 ). This suggests that the function of the endogenous AP locus to four is attenuated in huta. Therefore, divergence in AP likely contributed to the variation pet number between A huta and huta. This raises the question whether pet number variation between and within species may be caused by similar genetic changes. If AP divergence contributed to pet number between species, AP polymorphisms contribute to this within huta. To address this question, we inspected the locations of pet number QTL previously identified five mapping populations derived bi-parental crosses different huta accessions (Pie et al,201 ) and an additional constructed this study Figure 3. We found none the QTL mapped the AP locus, represented specific marker chromosome 2 Figure 3, Table (Pie et al201 ). Therefore allelic variation AP does not contribute quantitative pet number in huta. However, alternative that AP divergence pet number within huta by robustness this phenotype genetic.

    Title: Proinsulin misfolding is an early event in the progression to type 2 diabetes
    Abstract: Biosynthesis of insulin – critical to metabolic homeostasis – begins with folding of the proinsulin precursor, including formation of three evolutionarily conserved intramolecular disulfide bonds. Remarkably, normal pancreatic islets contain a subset of proinsulin molecules bearing at least one free cysteine thiol. In human ( or rodent ) islets with a perturbed endoplasmic reticulum folding environment, non-native proinsulin enters intermolecular disulfide-linked complexes. In genetically obese mice with otherwise wild-type islets, disulfide-linked complexes of proinsulin are more abundant, and leptin receptor-deficient mice, the further increase of such complexes tracks with the onset of islet insulin deficiency and diabetes. Proinsulin-Cys ( B19 ) and Cys ( A20 ) are necessary and sufficient for the formation of proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes; indeed, proinsulin Cys ( B19 ) -Cys ( B19 ) covalent homodimers resist reductive dissociation, highlighting a structural basis for aberrant proinsulin complex formation. We conclude that increased proinsulin misfolding via disulfide-linked complexes is an early event associated with prediabetes that worsens with ß-cell dysfunction in type two diabetes.

    Supporting Text:
   . We examined proinsulin in the islet lysates of 5 additional prediabetic LepRdb/db mice — all were similar to the islets of two animals shown in Figures 4D ( 4 and 6 weeks of age with random blood glucose levels of 101 and 118 mg/dL, respectively ) containing a large steady state level of proinsulin ( seen upon Western blotting of reducing SDS-PAGE ) with >90% of molecules entangled in disulfide-linked dimers and higher-order complexes ( seen by Western blotting upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE, Figure 4D ). Accumulation of misfolded proinsulin in the ER of LepRdb/db ß-cells was always present before the onset of diabetes. These bands are indeed proinsulin, as they were absent from islets of mice depleted of three of four Ins alleles; Figure 4D lane 3 ). Importantly, improperly folded proinsulin was also detectable in WT mouse islets, albeit at a much lower abundance ( Figure 4D lane 4 ). Because leptin receptors might have direct actions on ß-cells ( Marroquí et al., 2012 ), we also examined islets from LepR-Nkx2. 1 KO mice that are deficient for leptin receptor in the hypothalamus but not in the islets ( Ring and Zeltser, 2010 ). Here too, pancreatic islets from these hyperphagic, obese, glucose intolerant animals demonstrated markedly increased abundance of disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes with >90% of proinsulin entangled in such complexes ( Figure 4E ). These data indicate that an increase in improper proinsulin folding in leptin receptor-deficient animals is secondary to a prediabetic state and unrelated to leptin receptor function in ß-cells

. To explore whether human proinsulin ( Figure 1A ) is similarly predisposed to the aberrant disulfide-linked complex formation that was detected in rodent ß-cells, we first expressed recombinant human proinsulin in heterologous cells, followed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody that reacts exclusively with the amino-terminal region of human C-peptide ( mAb 20G11, see Materials and methods ). Disulfide-linked proinsulin dimers along with a ladder of higher-order complexes already represented the majority of recombinant proinsulin species, and these forms accumulated to a dramatically higher level in cells treated overnight with PERK inhibitor ( Figure 2D ). We then looked for the presence of such disulfide-linked dimers and higher order complexes formed by endogenous proinsulin in preparations of human islets from unrelated donors without a history of T2D. In several preparations, disulfide-linked dimers were prominent, along with a lesser abundance of higher-order complexes ( Figure 3A right panel ). In human islets obtained from other individual donors, disulfide-linked dimers were less prominent ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ). Overnight treatment of human islets with PERK inhibitor resulted in a further increase in higher order disulfide-linked complexes ( Figure 3A right panel, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) and an increase in total islet proinsulin as revealed by reducing SDS-PAGE ( Figure 3A left panel ). These data indicate that aberrant disulfide-linked proinsulin dimers and higher complexes exist in human islets and their abundance responds to changes in environmental conditions within the ER. The immunodetection of both disulfide-linked dimers and higher-order complexes was blocked when pure human C-peptide competitor was included in the immunoblotting protocol ( Figure 3B ), demonstrating specificity

. Because these two-cysteine mutant human proinsulins cannot be exported from the ER and are excellent ERAD substrates in pancreatic ß-cells ( Haataja et al., 2016 ), these molecules were largely undetected by immunoblotting. However, in ß-cells treated with proteasome inhibitor ( MG132 for 7 hr ), myc-tagged proinsulin monomers were detected in all cases ( Figure 6A ). Remarkably, not only were these constructs capable of forming disulfide-linked proinsulin homodimers, but the keep-B19/A20 construct in particular recapitulated the situation in which the majority of molecules migrated as disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes ( Figure 6A ). With or without MG132, this behavior was also observed upon expression in 293 T cells that lack endogenous proinsulin ( Figure 6B ), and these complexes appeared quite similar to those observed in human islets ( Figure 3A, B ). To determine if Cys ( B19 ) /Cys ( A20 ) are both necessary and sufficient for generating the full ladder of disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes, we compared the three different human mutant proinsulins noted above that each retain only one set of potential disulfide partners, and a human proinsulin mutant named ‘lose-B19/A20’ in which Cys ( B19 ) and Cys ( A20 ) are mutated whereas positions B7, A7, A11 and A20 remain as cysteines. Once again, of the mutant human proinsulins that retain only one set of potential disulfide partners, only keep-B19/A20 could efficiently recreate the entire ladder of disulfide-linked complexes similar to that seen for wildtype proinsulin, irrespective of the presence or absence of an engineered myc epitope tag in the C-peptide ( Figure 6C left panel ). However, lose-B19/A20 did not efficiently recreate the ladder of disulfide-linked complexes despite entrapment in the ER in a proinsulin construct bearing four Cys residues

Both murine islets and the INS1 ( rat ) pancreatic ß-cell line cells secrete successfully-folded proinsulin in addition to processed insulin. Native proinsulin folding requires formation of Cys ( B7 ) -Cys ( A7 ), Cys ( B19 ) -Cys ( A20 ) and Cys ( A6 ) -Cys ( A11 ) disulfide pairs ( Haataja et al., 2016 ). One way to detect improperly folded wild-type proinsulin in pancreatic β-cells is to look for the possible presence of unpaired Cys residues. Alkylation of proinsulin Cys residues with 4-acetamido-4'-maleimidyl-stilbene-2, 2'-disulfonate ( AMS ) adds 0. 5 kD of molecular mass for each cysteine modified, shifting proinsulin from its normal molecular mass. As examined by immunoblotting with anti-proinsulin antibody, no modification by AMS could be detected in secreted recombinant human proinsulin or proinsulin from rodent islets, or INS cells ( e. g., Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). Remarkably, however, alkylation of intracellular proinsulin with AMS in human islets caused a decrease in unmodified proinsulin accompanied by the appearance of proinsulin alkylated on at least one cysteine thiol ( Figure 1A ). Alkylation of intracellular proinsulin was also observed in rodent islets ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ). The presence of a free thiol in a significant subpopulation of proinsulin molecules can lead to inappropriate intermolecular disulfide attack on neighboring proinsulin molecules ( Cunningham et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2010a; Liu et al., 2007; Wang et al., 1999 ). Antibodies have been described that recognize misfolded proinsulin molecules bearing intermolecular disulfide bonds ( Liu et al. 2010; Liu et al 2017; Wang et al 1999 ). We used such an antibody to detect proins bearing intermolecular disulfide in human islets ( Figure 1B ) and rodent islets ( Figure 1— supplement 2 ). In human islets, proins bearing intermolecular disulfide were present in a subpopulation of proins molecules ( Figure 1B ). In rodent is, pro bearing intermolecular disulfide proins were more abundant ( Figure 1— supplement 2 ). These data indicate that proins bearing intermolecular disulfide are present in human and rodent ß-cells, and their presence is associated with aberrant proins folding

The data indicate that proins misfolding via disulf-linked complexes is an early event in the progression to type 2 diabetes and worsens with ß-cell dysfunction.

    Title: Impact of nucleic acid and methylated H3K9 binding activities of Suv39h1 on its heterochromatin assembly
    Abstract: SUV39H is the major histone H3 lysine 9 ( H3K9 ) -specific methyltransferase that targets pericentric regions and is crucial for assembling silent heterochromatin. SUV39H recognizes trimethylated H3K9 ( H3K9me3 ) via its chromodomain ( CD ), and enriched H3K9me3 allows SUV39H to target specific chromosomal regions. However, the detailed targeting mechanisms, especially for naïve chromatin without preexisting H3K9me3, are poorly understood. Here we show that Suv39h1’s CD ( Suv39h1-CD ) binds nucleic acids, and this binding is important for its function in heterochromatin assembly. Suv39h1-CD had higher binding affinity for RNA than DNA, and its ability to bind nucleic acids was independent of its H3K9me3 recognition. Suv39h1 bound major satellite RNAs in vivo, and knockdown of major satellite RNAs lowered Suv39h1 retention on pericentromere. Suv39h1 mutational studies indicated that both the nucleic acid–binding and H3K9me–binding activities of Suv39h1-CD were crucial for its pericentric heterochromatin assembly. These results suggest that chromatin-bound RNAs contribute to creating SUV39H’s target specificity.

    The CD is a highly conserved protein module most recognized for targeting methylated histone tails ( Blus et al., 2011; Fischle et al., 2003 ). Although several lines of evidence suggest that the CD binds DNA and RNA in addition to targeting methylated histones, its biological relevance and physiological roles are poorly understood ( Hiragami-Hamada and Fischle, 2014 ). In this study, we demonstrated that Suv39h1-CD not only recognizes H3K9me3, but also binds RNA and DNA ( with a higher affinity to ssRNA than to dsDNA ), indicating that RNA may also be crucial for Suv39h1 recruitment/function. Indeed, our current data suggest that these two activities contribute to Suv39h1-mediated CH assembly, including the accumulation of H3K9me3 and HP1 ( Figure 3 ) and the retention of Suv39h1 itself on the pericentric regions ( Figure 5 ). Furthermore, we found that the HP1-binding and chromatin-binding activities of Suv39h1’s N-terminal region contributed to the Suv39h1-mediated pericentric H3K9me3 formation ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4C and [Muramatsu et al., 2016] ). Collectively, our results demonstrated that the four different activities of Suv39h1 other than its lysine methyltransferase activity cooperatively regulate Suv39h1-mediated pericentric heterochromatin assembly. Independent work by another group shows that in vitro RNA binding activity is also associated with the CD of human SUV39H1 ( Johnson et al., 2017 ). We found that basic residues in Suv39h1-CD’s C-terminal α-helix are involved in binding RNA, and that Suv39h1-CD’s RNA binding is distinct and independent of its recognition and binding of H3K9me3. Considering the slower recovery of H3K9me3 in Suv39h dn iMEFs expressing Suv39h1-4A ( which is deficient in RNA binding ) than in those expressing Suv39h1-Y67A ( which is deficient in H3K9me3 binding ), RNA-binding activity is particularly involved in recruiting Suv39h1 to H3K9me3-free chromosomal regions

. We also showed that Suv39h1 bound major satellite RNA in vivo in a manner dependent on its nucleic acid-binding activity and that knockdown of major satellite RNAs lowered Suv39h1 retention on pericentric heterochromatin. Our data suggest that chromatin-bound RNAs contribute to the targeting and retention of Suv39h1 at specific chromosomal regions.

. A recent report showed that Suv39h1’s CD inhibits its methyltransferase activity, and the CD’s binding of H3K9me3 is suggested to allosterically regulate Suv39h1’s enzymatic activity ( Müller et al., 2016 ). It is not clear how Suv39h1’s methyltransferase activity is controlled by the CD; however, it is possible that Suv39h1-CD’s RNA binding is also coupled with its allosteric regulation. Physical interaction between the CD and SET domains appeared to affect the CD’s RNA-binding activity: we demonstrated that full-length Suv39h1 bound RNA with a relatively higher affinity compared with Suv39h1-CD ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1M ). Considering the CD’s role in targeting Suv39h1 to H3K9me3-free chromatin regions, Suv39h1’s physical association with other factors such as chromatin-unbound non-coding RNAs or HP1 proteins may modulate the CD’s C-terminal α-helix to bind RNAs. In general, the assembly of higher-order chromatin structure has two steps, establishment and maintenance ( Hall et al., 2002; Sadaie et al., 2004 ). H3K9me3 marks on CH have to be maintained during DNA replication, and given that Suv39h1 possesses a CD that recognizes H3K9me3, a direct read-write mechanism involving Suv39h1 is proposed to maintain H3K9me3 ( Audergon et al., 2015; Ragunathan et al., 2015 ). However, this mechanism does not fully explain the restoration of H3K9me3 in Suv39h dn iMEFs. Thus, Suv39h1-CD’s RNA-binding activity appears to contribute to its ability to target pericentric regions without preexisting H3K9me3 and to establish H3K9me3 marks; this function is consistent with the role of nucleic acid binding in Chp1 and Clr4 in fission yeast ( Ishida et al., 2012 ). Moreover, HP1 can also bind RNA and methylated H3K9 ( Keller et al., 2012; Muchardt et al., 2002 )

., 2012; Muchardt et al., 2002 ). HP1’s ability to bind RNA is SUMO-dependent, and an HP1-Ubc9 fusion molecule with enhanced sumoylation on the HP1 part can be targeted to the pericentric regions, even in Suv39h dn iMEFs ( Maison et al., 2011 ). Thus, HP1 can recruit mutant Suv39h1 to pericentric regions via binding between sumoylated HP1 and chromatin-bound major satellite RNA. Once Suv39h1-Y67A-4A is targeted to pericentric regions and deposits H3K9me3, HP1 further increases its affinity for pericentric regions, and this positive feedback loop between HP1 and Suv39h1-Y67A-4A may be sufficient for this mutant Suv39h1 to mediate pericentric heterochromatin assembly. The ΔN phenotype supports this possibility. In this study we demonstrated that Suv39h1-CD’s RNA-binding activity is required for its targeting to and assembly of heterochromatin, highlighting the functional role of pericentromeric transcripts in introducing H3K9me3 marks. Recent studies using fission yeast demonstrated that H3K9me3 can be maintained during DNA replication as a self-perpetuating epigenetic mark ( Audergon et al., 2015; Ragunathan et al., 2015 ). Interestingly, the maintenance of H3K9me3 requires intact Clr4-CD. Epe1, a protein containing a jmjC-domain, counteracts this process by directly removing the H3K9me3 mark. Such counteracting enzymatic activities appear to be important for preventing the inappropriate inactivation of euchromatic genes by stochastically introduced H3K9me3 marks. Although it is not clear whether similar counteracting demethylase activities play a role in maintaining genome integrity in mammalian cells, pericentromeric transcripts may modulate such counteracting enzymatic activity to directly regulate chromatin dynamics.

. To examine whether introduced Suv39h1 actually restored the repressive heterochromatin structure, we analyzed the expression levels of major satellite RNA. As reported previously ( Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2012 ), major satellite repeats were derepressed in Suv39h dn iMEFs ( ~10 times higher than that of WT iMEFs ) and introduction of Suv39h1-WT suppressed this up-regulation of major satellite repeats ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1D ). Mutant Suv39h1 with Y67A, 4A, or Y67A-4A also decreased major satellite repeat transcripts, but their repression levels were milder than that of S39-1WT ( Figure 3— supplement 1 ), indicating that S39-CD’s RNA-binding and H3me3-binding activities are important for heterochatin repression. We conclude that S39-CD’s nucleic and H3me-binding activities are crucial for its function in heterochatin assembly and that chrom-bound RNAs contribute to S39’s targeting and retention on peric regions.
Researchers investigated the role of the entorinal cortex in spatial representations, specifically whether grid cells' activity depends on physical movement. Monkeys were trained to maintain central fixation while covertly attending to a moving stimulus in the periphery, and 20.14% of entorinal cells showed spatially structured fields. This contrasts with hippocampal recordings, where grid-like representations were not observed. The study provides evidence that macaque entorinal cells do not rely on physical movement. Spatial representations in the form of place and grid cells have been identified in various species, including rodents, bats, mac monkeys, and humans. The hippocamp formation contributes to processing memories, and similarities between spatial navigation and remembering suggest grid cells support cognitive functions besides navigation. Recent findings showed grid cells active during exploration with eye movements, indicating they track location and gaze position. Shifts in gaze correspond to attention, and neural substrate for overt and covert is overlapping. Grid cells in entorinal potentially represent gaze and locus of attention. The study tested prediction that grid cells are activated by covert attention without movement by recording units in entinal cortex. Monkeys performed a covert tracking task, maintaining fixation while attending a moving dot, responding to color change. Over a session, the dot traced several cycles, ensuring each location was visited equally. Monkeys performed >70% accuracy, with errors due to saccades outside fixation. To examine entinal representations, the standard grid measure and novel analysis of firing modulation were used. Cells possess regular field with increased rates at nodes of equilateral triangles tiling space. Importantly, tiling leads 2D autocorrelation with peaks in hexagonal around center. The study provides strong evidence that entinal cells with spatial fields do not require physical movement. Previous showed grid can be activated by eye movements exploring complex scenes. Here, findings suggest eye movements not required, and fields represent location. Spatial in hippocal can represent other than animal's position through theta precession and demonstration ensembles fire in sequence. Recent studies show sequential represent anticipation, future paths, and trajectories. It is difficult to assess attention from location in rodents, but consistent with idea hippocal reflect attention along spatial.

    Title: Standardized and reproducible measurement of decision-making in mice
    Abstract: Progress in science requires standardized assays whose results can be readily shared, compared, and reproduced across laboratories. Reproducibility, however, has been a concern in neuroscience, particularly for measurements of mouse behavior. Here, we show that a standardized task to probe decision-making in mice produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories. We adopted a task for head-fixed mice that assays perceptual and value-based decision making, and we standardized training protocol and experimental hardware, software, and procedures. We trained 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries, and we collected 5 million mouse choices into a publicly available database. Learning speed was variable across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories adopted similar reliance on visual stimuli, on past successes and failures, and on estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be reproduced across multiple laboratories. They establish a standard for reproducible rodent behavior, and provide an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools to study decision-making in mice. More generally, they indicate a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through collaborative open-science approaches.

    These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be successfully reproduced across laboratories, and more generally suggest a path toward improving reproducibility in neuroscience. To study mouse behavior across laboratories, we developed and implemented identical experimental equipment and a standard set of protocols. Not only did mice learn the task in all laboratories, but critically, after learning they performed the task comparably across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories had similar psychophysical performance in a purely sensory version of the task and adopted similar choice strategies in the full task, where they benefited from tracking the stimulus prior probability. Behavior showed variations across sessions and across mice, but these variations were no larger across laboratories than within laboratories. Success did not seem guaranteed at the outset, because neuroscience faces a crisis of reproducibility ( Baker, 2016; Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020; Button et al., 2013 ) particularly when it comes to measurements of mouse behavior ( Chesler et al., 2002; Crabbe et al., 1999; Kafkafi et al., 2018; Sorge et al., 2014; Tuttle et al., 2018 ). To solve this crisis, three solutions have been proposed: large studies, many teams, and upfront registration ( Ioannidis, 2005 ). Our approach incorporates all three of these solutions. First, we collected vast amounts of data: 5 million choices from 140 mice. Second, we involved many teams, obtaining data in seven laboratories in three countries. Third, we standardized the experimental protocols and data analyses upfront, which is a key component of pre-registration. An element that may have contributed to success is the collaborative, open-science nature of our initiative ( Wool and International Brain Laboratory, 2020 ). Open-science collaborative approaches are increasingly taking hold in neuroscience ( Beraldo et al., 2019; Charles et al

., 2019; Charles et al., 2020; Forscher et al., 2020; Koscielny et al., 2014; Poldrack and Gorgolewski, 2014; de Vries et al., 2020 ). Our work benefited from collaborative development of the behavioral assay, and from frequent and regular meetings where data were reviewed across laboratories ( Figure 6 ). These meetings helped identify problems at the origin, provide immediate feedback, and find collective solutions. Moreover, our work benefited from constant efforts at standardization. We took great care in standardizing and documenting the behavioral apparatus and the training protocol ( see Appendices ), to facilitate implementation across our laboratories and to encourage wider adoption by other laboratories. The protocols, hardware designs and software code are open-source and modular, allowing adjustments to accommodate a variety of scientific questions. The data are accessible at data. internationalbrainlab. org, and include all >5 million choices made by the mice. Another element that might have contributed to success is our choice of behavioral task, which places substantial requirements on the mice while not being too complex. Previous failures to reproduce mouse behavior across laboratories typically arose in studies of unconstrained behavior such as responses to pain or stress ( Chesler et al., 2002; Crabbe et al., 1999; Kafkafi et al., 2018; Sorge et al., 2014; Tuttle et al., 2018 ). Operant behaviors may be inherently more reproducible than the assays used in these studies. To be able to study decision making, and in hopes of achieving reproducibility, we designed a task that engages multiple brain processes from sensory perception and integration of evidence to combination of priors and evidence

. Physiological studies of decision making are increasingly carried out in mice to access the unrivaled arsenal of genetic, imaging, and physiological tools available for mouse brains ( Carandini and Churchland, 2013; Glickfeld et al., 2014; O'Connor et al., 2009 ). Our collaboration, International Brain Laboratory, 2017, aims to leverage these approaches by exploring the neural basis of the same mouse behavior in multiple laboratories. It is thus crucial for this endeavor that the relevant behavioral assays be reproducible both in methods and in results. Studying decision-making requires a task that places specific sensory, cognitive, and motor demands over hundreds of trials, affording strong constraints to behavior. The task should be complex enough to expose the neural computations that support decision-making but simple enough for mice to learn, and easily extendable to study further aspects of perception and cognition. Moreover, it can be invaluable to have ready access to the brain for neural recordings and manipulations, a consideration that favors tasks that involve head fixation. To meet these criteria, we adopted a modified version of the classical ‘two-alternative forced-choice’ perceptual detection task. In the classical task, the subject indicates the position of a stimulus that can be in one of two positions with equal probability ( e. g. Carandini and Churchland, 2013; Tanner and Swets, 1954 ). In the modified version, the probability of the stimulus being in one position changes over time ( Terman and Terman, 1972 ). This change in probability may affect sensory decisions by directing spatial attention ( Cohen and Maunsell, 2009; Liston and Stone, 2008 ) and by biasing the decision process ( Hanks et al., 2011 ). It modifies the expected value of the choices, echoing changes in reward probability or size, which affect perceptual choices ( e. g. Feng et al

., 2020; Koscielny et al., 2014; Poldrack and Gorgolewski, 2014; de Vries et al., 2020 ). Following this approach, we established an open-access data architecture pipeline ( Bonacchi et al., 2020 ) and use it to release the >5 million mouse choices at data. internationalbrainlab. org. These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be successfully reproduced across laboratories, enabling collaborative studies of brain function in behaving mice.

. Indeed, there was a 80% probability that mice would learn the task within the 40 days that were usually allotted, and when mice were trained for a longer duration, the success rate rose even further ( Figure 2h ). There was, however, variability in learning rates across mice and laboratories. This variability is intriguing and would present a challenge for projects that aim to study learning. We next ask whether the behavior of trained mice was consistent and reproducible across laboratories. Once mice achieved basic task proficiency, multiple measures of performance became indistinguishable across laboratories ( Figure 3a–e ). We first examined the psychometric curves for the three sessions leading up to proficiency, which showed a stereotypical shape across mice and laboratories ( Figure 3a ). The average across mice of these psychometric curves was similar across laboratories ( Figure 3b ). The lapse rates ( i. e., the errors made in response to easy contrasts of 50% and 100% ) were low ( 9. 5 ± 3. 6%, Figure 3c ) with no significant difference across laboratories. The slope of the curves, which measures contrast sensitivity, was also similar across laboratories, at 14. 3 ± 3. 8 ( s. d., n = 7 laboratories, Figure 3d ). Finally, the horizontal displacement of the curve, which measures response bias, was small at 0. 3 ± 8. 4 ( s. d., n = 7, Figure 3e ). None of these measures showed a significant difference across laboratories, either in median ( performance: p=0. 63, threshold: p=0. 81, bias: p=0. 81, FDR corrected Kruskal-Wallis test ) or in variance ( performance: p=0. 09, threshold: p=0. 57, bias: p=0. 57, FDR corrected Levene’s test ). Indeed, mouse choices were no more consistent within labs than across labs ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1a )

Title: Standardized and Reproducible Measurement of Decision-Making in Mice

Researchers have long struggled to reproduce results in neuroscience, particularly when it comes to measuring behavior in mice. To address this issue, a team of scientists developed a standardized task to measure decision-making in mice that can be shared and compared across laboratories. They trained 140 mice in seven laboratories across three countries and collected over 5 million choices, which are now publicly available. The results show that complex behavior can be reproduced across laboratories and provide a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience.

The team used a task that requires mice to make decisions based on sensory information and past experiences. They standardized the protocol, hardware, and software, and procedures to ensure consistency across laboratories. Mice learned the task in all laboratories and performed comparably once trained. Behavior showed variations across mice and sessions, but not across laboratories. The results indicate that decision-making can be studied in a reproducible way, providing a standard for rodent behavior and an unprecedented dataset.

The team's approach incorporates three solutions to the reproducibility crisis: large studies, many teams, and upfront registration. They collected vast amounts of data, involved many teams, and standardized protocols and analyses upfront. The collaborative, open-science nature of the initiative may have contributed to success. Open-science approaches are increasingly used in neuroscience, and the team's work benefited from collaborative development and standardization.

The task was designed to engage multiple brain processes, from perception to combination of evidence. Physiological studies are carried out in mice to access genetic, imaging, and tools. The collaboration aims to explore the neural basis of behavior in multiple laboratories, requiring reproducible assays. The task places sensory, cognitive, and motor demands hundreds of trials, exposing neural computations. It's simple enough for mice to learn and extend to further aspects of perception and cognition.

The results reveal that complex behavior can be reproduced across laboratories, enabling studies of brain in behaving mice. There was 80% probability mice learned within 40 days, and success rose with longer training. Variability in learning across mice and laboratories is a challenge for projects. Measures of performance became indistinguish across laboratories once trained. The psychometric curves showed stereotypical shape, average, and lapse rates were low with no difference. The slope, which measures sensitivity, was similar, and displacement, which bias, was small. None of these showed significant difference laboratories.

The study provides a path toward reproducibility in neuroscience and a standard for rodent behavior. It shows that decision-making can be studied in a reproducible way, providing an unprecedented dataset and open tools.

    Title: Cell-type diversity and regionalized gene expression in the planarian intestine
    Abstract: Proper function and repair of the digestive system are vital to most animals. Deciphering the mechanisms involved in these processes requires an atlas of gene expression and cell types. Here, we applied laser-capture microdissection ( LCM ) and RNA-seq to characterize the intestinal transcriptome of Schmidtea mediterranea, a planarian flatworm that can regenerate all organs, including the gut. We identified hundreds of genes with intestinal expression undetected by previous approaches. Systematic analyses revealed extensive conservation of digestive physiology and cell types with other animals, including humans. Furthermore, spatial LCM enabled us to uncover previously unappreciated regionalization of gene expression in the planarian intestine along the medio-lateral axis, especially among intestinal goblet cells. Finally, we identified two intestine-enriched transcription factors that specifically regulate regeneration ( hedgehog signaling effector gli-1 ) or maintenance ( RREB2 ) of goblet cells. Altogether, this work provides resources for further investigation of mechanisms involved in gastrointestinal function, repair and regeneration.

    Supporting Text:
    We have developed methods for applying laser-capture microdissection to planarian tissue, which we used to define gene expression and cell types in the intestine ( Figure 9A–C ). The intestine expresses genes involved in metabolism, nutrient storage and transport, innate immunity, and other physiological roles, demonstrating considerable functional homology with digestive systems of other animals, including humans. Comparison of gene expression in microdissected tissue to that of intestinal phagocytes ( previously isolated by sorting ) enabled identification of transcripts enriched in two other cell types: goblet cells and basal cells. We also discovered previously unappreciated intestinal cell-type diversity, especially amongst goblet cells, which reside in distinct medial and lateral intestinal domains. Identification of medially and laterally enriched transcripts suggests an additional paradigm for addressing axial influences on organ regeneration, as well as evolution of patterning mechanisms influencing the regionalization of bilaterian digestive systems ( Martindale and Hejnol, 2009; Telford et al., 2015 ). Finally, we identified intestine-enriched transcription factors that play distinct roles in goblet cell differentiation and maintenance, and found that depletion of goblet cells reduces planarians' willingness to feed and viability, with only negligible effects on regeneration of other intestinal cell types or non-intestinal tissues. Characterization of the planarian intestinal transcriptome provides a framework for several next steps. First, a detailed description of intestinal cell types will facilitate further studies of digestive cell types. Here, we identified two transcription factors, gli-1 and RREB2, whose RNAi phenotypes suggest that distinct mechanisms govern differentiation and maintenance of goblet cells

., 2018; Plass et al., 2018; Supplementary file 2 ), suggesting considerable expression in non-intestinal tissue, consistent with our data. The incomplete overlap between various scRNA-Seq studies and our results could be explained, in part, by different log-fold enrichment criteria used to identify cell-type-specific transcripts. However, the detection of transcripts exclusively enriched in laser-captured intestine suggests that expression profiling of laser-captured bulk tissue is more sensitive than current single-cell profiling approaches, and that LCM may be a preferable method for assessing tissue-specific gene expression when single-cell resolution is not required. In order to globally characterize functional classes of genes expressed in the planarian intestine, we assigned Gene Ontology ( GO ) Biological Process ( BP ) terms to planarian transcripts based on homology to human, mouse, zebrafish, Drosophila, and C. elegans genes, and then identified over-represented terms among intestine-enriched transcripts ( Figure 6, Figure 6—source data 1A, and Supplementary file 3 ). Highly represented terms fell broadly into seven groups ( Figure 6 ), all of which are related to the intestine’s roles in digestion, nutrient storage and distribution, as well as innate immunity. Metabolic processes were among the most highly represented: hundreds of transcripts were predicted to regulate catabolism, biosynthesis, and transport of a variety of macromolecules ( e. g. lipids and carbohydrates ) and small molecules ( e. g. amino acids and ions ) ( Supplementary file 3A ). Hundreds of upregulated transcripts were also predicted to regulate molecular transport, vesicular trafficking, and organelle-based import and export ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3A )

. Knockdown of mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 21 ( med 21 ) reduced goblet cells and blastema formation ( Supplementary file 5C ), but also caused severe disruption of intestinal integrity in our previous study ( Forsthoefel et al., 2012 ). This suggested a non-goblet-cell-specific role, and we did not investigate med21 further. Knockdown of a second transcription factor, gli-1 ( a transducer of hedgehog signaling [Rink et al., 2009; Glazer et al., 2010] ), caused failure of goblet cells to regenerate at the midline of the new anterior branch in amputated tail fragments regenerating a new head ( Figure 8A–B, Supplementary file 5C, and Figure 8—figure supplement 2A ). In addition, goblet cells were less abundant in pre-existing regions of the intestine, particularly in lateral intestinal branches ( Figure 8A–B, Figure 8—figure supplement 2A–C ). Regeneration of goblet cells was also reduced in new tail branches of gli-1 ( RNAi ) head fragments ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2B ) and in anterior and posterior branches in gli-1 ( RNAi ) trunk fragments ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2C ). These effects on goblet cells were specific, since phagocytes ( Figure 8A, Figure 8—figure supplement 2A–C ) and basal cells ( Figure 8B ) regenerated normally. Although we infrequently observed smaller posterior blastemas characteristic of reduced hedgehog signaling ( Rink et al., 2009; Glazer et al., 2010; Yazawa et al., 2009 ), phagocytes regenerated normally in this region ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2C )

. Previously, we developed a method for purification of intestinal phagocytes from planarians that ingested magnetic beads ( Forsthoefel et al., 2012; Forsthoefel et al., 2014 ). Laser microdissection may be preferable, because it enables detection of transcripts expressed by other intestinal cell types ( not just phagocytes ), and also eliminates potentially confounding gene expression changes caused by feeding. Similarly, although single-cell sequencing ( SCS ) approaches in planarians have driven significant advances in our understanding of planarian cell types and their responses to injury ( Fincher et al., 2018; van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 2018; Plass et al., 2018; Wurtzel et al., 2015; Wurtzel et al., 2017 ), LCM may provide a more direct and efficient way to assess gene regulation in tissues with rarer cell types. For example, because intestinal cells comprise only 1–3% of total planarian cells ( Baguñá and Romero, 1981 ), without prior enrichment SCS would potentially require analysis of tens of thousands of cells to reliably detect gene expression changes in the intestine. In addition, although chemistry and computational approaches for SCS are improving rapidly ( Wu et al., 2017; Soneson and Robinson, 2018 ), LCM may enable more sensitive detection of low-copy transcripts or subtle fold changes in bulk tissue, and also bypass ‘noise’ caused by dissociation or other SCS-related technical artefacts. Regeneration of digestive organs is not well understood. Development of a robust method for isolating intestinal tissue, and characterization of the intestinal transcriptome, will facilitate mechanistic studies in planarians. To facilitate exploration of the planarian intestinal transcriptome as a resource, we have developed a website, plangut. omrf. org

. We are unaware of studies in other organisms that have uncovered direct roles for either gli-1 or RREB2 in goblet cells. However, in mice, modulation of Sonic Hedgehog ( an upstream activator of Gli-family TFs ) levels affects goblet cell numbers ( Gagné-Sansfaçon et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2012 ), and RREB1 cooperatively regulates expression of the peptide hormone secretin in enteroendocrine cells ( Ray et al., 2003 ). By contrast, in the Drosophila midgut, Hedgehog ( Hh ) signaling promotes intestinal stem cell proliferation ( Tian et al., 2015 ), while the RREB-1 ortholog hindsight/pebbled suppresses midgut intestinal stem cell proliferation and is required for differentiation of absorptive enterocytes ( Baechler et al., 2016 ). In planarians, hedgehog ( Hh ) regulates anteroposterior polarity, neoblast proliferation, and neurogenesis ( Rink et al., 2009; Yazawa et al., 2009; Currie et al., 2016; Wang et al. 2017 ), but its role in goblet cells is unknown. Our results suggest that gli-1 and R2 regulate goblet cell differentiation and maintenance in planarians, and that gli-1 is required for goblet regeneration.
This study investigates the relationship between evolutionary changes in sensory perception and physiological coding mechanisms in weakly electric fish. The researchers found that some species can detect subtle variations in electric signals by encoding spike timing differences between receptors, while others produce oscillatory receptors respond to stimuli by resetting their phase, resulting in transient synchrony among receptors that encodes timing and location, not waveform. These receptors are sensitive to frequencies found in collective signals of conspecifics and correlated with increased behavioral responses to these frequencies. The study provides evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony and hypothesizes that divergent mechanisms represent adaptations for different social environments. Evolutionary changes in sensory systems have profound effects on perception and behavior, and anatomical modifications in the electrosensory system of weak fish led to a newfound ability to detect variations in signals. However, how anatomical and perceptual differences relate to physiological mechanisms was unknown. The researchers investigated how divergence in sensory relates to differences in peripheral coding and found that oscillatory receptors respond to stimuli with phase resets that result in synchrony across the population, providing information about timing and location but not waveform. These receptors are sensitive to submillisecond intervals that match their oscillation period, which is remarkable as these intervals are too short for spiking to encode and shorter than produced by individual fish, suggesting increased sensitivity to signals from groups. Playback experiments demonstrated that species with oscillating receptors responded strongly to submillisecond intervals within the range of sensitivity. This novel mechanism may represent an adaptation for detecting signals from groups.

    Title: A new topology of the HK97-like fold revealed in Bordetella bacteriophage by cryoEM at 3.5 Å resolution
    Abstract: Bacteriophage BPP-1 infects and kills Bordetella species that cause whooping cough. Its diversity-generating retroelement ( DGR ) provides a naturally occurring phage-display system, but engineering efforts are hampered without atomic structures. Here, we report a cryo electron microscopy structure of the BPP-1 head at 3. 5 Å resolution. Our atomic model shows two of the three protein folds representing major viral lineages: jellyroll for its cement protein ( CP ) and HK97-like ( ‘Johnson’ ) for its major capsid protein ( MCP ). Strikingly, the fold topology of MCP is permuted non-circularly from the Johnson fold topology previously seen in viral and cellular proteins. We illustrate that the new topology is likely the only feasible alternative of the old topology. β-sheet augmentation and electrostatic interactions contribute to the formation of non-covalent chainmail in BPP-1, unlike covalent inter-protein linkages of the HK97 chainmail. Despite these complex interactions, the termini of both CP and MCP are ideally positioned for DGR-based phage-display engineering.

   . Remarkably, the newly discovered BPP topology presented here is therefore the second topology predicted from the above rule ( Figure 5A ), the first being the topology discovered in HK97 gp5 ( Wikoff et al., 2000 ) ( Figure 5B ) and subsequently seen in many other viruses, as well as in bacteria and archaea cells ( Akita et al., 2007; Sutter et al., 2008 ). Insertions into any of the three structural elements can give rise to more complex architectures without increasing the number of folding topologies of the Johnson fold, as would be expected for larger viral particles such as the herpesvirus capsid. To test whether a functional protein can be produced from BPP-1 MCP by permuting it to the HK97 topology without introducing other changes, we genetically interchanged the primary order of the β- and α-elements in the BPP-1 MCP gene bbp17 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ), and made two slightly different constructs ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ) ( i. e., PM1 and PM2, ‘Materials and methods’ ). These two engineered proteins were expressed successfully, as indicated by Western blot analysis ( Figure 5D ). However, no plaque formation was detected for the PM1 and PM2 lysates on RB50 cells transformed with either the wt bbp17, the PM1 or the PM2 construct ( Figure 5E ), suggesting that the PM1 and PM2 gene products are not functional. The BPP-1 capsid has a chainmail structure similar to that of HK97 capsid ( Figure 6A–B; Video 5 ). Instead of covalent bonding as in HK97, the BPP-1 chainmail is stabilized by non-covalent interactions, such as: ( 1 ) strong electrostatic interactions between adjacent MCPs ( Figure 6 ), and ( 2 ) additional CP-MCP interactions contributed by CPs ( Figure 7 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 01299. 018Figure 6.

. From a biotechnology standpoint, BPP-1 has emerged as an attractive phage-display system thanks to its unique and well characterized diversity-generating retro-element ( DGR ). As the only known source of massive DNA sequence deviation in prokaryotes, DGRs use a unique reverse transcriptase-based mechanism to introduce targeted diversity into protein-coding DNA sequences to accelerate the evolution of adaptive traits ( Liu et al., 2002; Guo et al., 2008 ). As such, BPP-1 is a naturally occurring diversity-generating system and can be engineered to display foreign proteins with adaptive heterologous sequences. An atomic description of the BPP-1 head will enhance bioengineering efforts, reveal non-covalent molecular interactions conducive of stable bacteriophage capsid formation, and clarify evolutionary relationships of BPP-1 MCP and CP with proteins in other viruses. In this study, we report the three-dimensional ( 3D ) structure of the BPP-1 head at ∼3. 5 Å resolution determined by single-particle cryoEM and derived an atomic model. Both our structural and structure-based mutagenesis studies reveal major novelties in the BPP-1 MCP and CP structures and their interactions. We also show that the C-termini of both MCP and CP are ideally positioned to display DGR-diversified peptide libraries for protein engineering applications.

., 2010; Krupovic and Bamford, 2011 ). Unlike its role as the major capsid protein in the above-mentioned viruses, the jellyroll motif in BPP-1 forms an auxiliary protein to stabilize the viral capsid made by proteins of another fold. Notably, in some dsRNA viruses, the jellyroll motif has been adopted as a domain in a stabilizer/adaptor protein that forms trimers located at an intermediate layer of viral capsids ( Grimes et al., 1998; Mathieu et al., 2001; Liemann et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2010a ). In BPP-1, CP subunits form a dimer through β-sheet augmentation between the F-strands of two CHEF sheets, forming an 8 stranded β-sheet visible on the external surface ( Figure 3C ). Although the BIDG sheet of the jellyroll motif faces but do not interact with the underneath MCP shell, instead, as described in detail below, CP interacts with the MCP shell mainly through its N- and C-termini as well as a linking loop between its β-strands B and C. We traced 327 amino acid residues ( Ser5 to Val331 ) of the total 331 residues of the major capsid protein Bbp17 in the cryoEM density map ( Figure 4; Video 3 ). Although little sequence identity ( CLUSTALW score = 5 ) was detected between BPP-1 MCP and HK97 gp5 proteins with ClustalW ( Thompson et al., 1994 ), the overall architecture of the MCP resembles that of HK97 gp5 ( Wikoff et al., 2000 ) ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ), with an axial ( A ) domain, a peripheral ( P ) domain and an extended loop ( E-loop ) ( Figure 4C ). Both the subunit organization and domain orientations of the seven MCPs in the BPP-1 capsid are also identical to those of the corresponding gp5 subunits in the HK97 capsid. The A-domain contains a 5-stranded β sheet flanked by two helices on one side and a C-terminal loop on the other. The P-domain contains a characteristic long, 7-turn helix sandwiched by a three-stranded β sheet and the N-terminal loop

Capsid proteins of non-enveloped viruses fall, so far, into three major structural classes: the β-jellyroll, the HK97 fold, and the fold of dsRNA-virus shell proteins ( Bamford et al., 2005; Oksanen et al., 2012 ). The RNA bacteriophage MS2 subunits have a fourth structure, not yet found in eukaryotic viruses ( Valegard et al., 1990 ). The HK97 fold is present not only in a large number of dsDNA bacteriophage capsids, including the T-phages, lambdoid phages, etc, but also in the major capsid protein of eukaryotic herpesviruses ( Bamford et al., 2005 ). In HK97 itself, the intersubunit contacts are reinforced by a post-assembly covalent linkage—an isopeptide bond between adjacent gp5 subunits, so positioned that the entire capsid is topologically interlinked in a ‘chainmail’ arrangement ( Duda, 1998; Wikoff et al., 2000 ). In other cases, such as bacteriophage λ, the non-covalent interactions between the subunits are reinforced by an additional ‘cement’ protein, which binds on the outer surface of the capsid at positions close to those of the isopeptide bonds in HK97 ( Lander et al., 2008 ). Heads of bacteriophage λ defective in this cement protein break down during DNA packaging ( Sternberg and Weisberg, 1977; Fuller et al., 2007; Lander et al., 2008 ). Bacteriophage BPP-1 is a short-tailed, dsDNA virus and a member of the Podoviridae family. It infects and kills Bordetella species that cause whooping cough in humans and respiratory diseases in other mammals. It has a T = 7l icosahedral capsid, ∼670 Å in diameter. A 7 Å resolution cryoEM structure of BPP-1 showed that its capsid protein has an HK97-like fold, jellyroll structure. Here, we report a 3.5 Å cryoEM structure of the BPP-1 head. Our atomic model shows two major protein folds : the jellyroll for CP and HK-like MCP. Strikingly, the topology of MCP is permuted non-circular from the fold previously seen in viral and cellular proteins. We show that the new topology is likely the only alternative of the old. β-sheet and electrostatic interactions contribute to the formation of non-coent chain in B-1 unlike coval interprotein linkages of HK97 chain. Despite these interactions, the termini of both CP and MCP are positioned for D-based phage engineering.
Researchers used serial passage of deng virus (DENV) in human and mosquito cell lines to examine how DENV adapts to different host environments. They estimated the effects of single nucleotide variants in populations using ultra-deep sequencing, determining the contributions of beneficial and deleterious mutations to the collective fitness of the population. Analysis revealed that a large burden of deleterious mutations counterbalances the effect of rare, host-specific beneficial mutations shaping adaptation. Beneficial mutations preferentially map to intrinsically disordered domains in the proteome and cluster in defined regions of the genome. These phenotypically adaptive alleles facilitate host-specific DENV adaptation. The evolutionary constraints observed in this system mirror trends across DENV and Zika strains, indicating recapitulating key biophysical and biological constraints shaping long-term evolution.

The study used high-resolution sequencing to quantify the contribution of beneficial and deleterious mutations shaping the evolutionary paths of DENV responding to host-specific pressures. Analysis shows D populations acquire host-specific structures defined by genotype-fitness landscapes, shifting population sequence and increasing phenotyp fitness. Strikingly, simple models of population fitness from allele measurements predict phenotyp adaptation, suggesting the phenotype and evolutionary of virus can be described by fitness of all alleles. Viral populations carry a large burden of detrimental mutations imposing a fitness cost persisting across passage. The study highlights the cost of deleterious mutations across the DENV genome, how negative selection shapes diversity in populations.

Adaptive mutations, including coding and non-coding, cluster in specific regions across the D genome. Relaxed constraints of IDRs allow mutational diversity without compromising protein stability, enabling access to extensive sets of mutations. This plasticity may rewire viral interactions with host, driving adaptation to environments. The link between structural and fitness measured mirrors conservation across natural isolates D and Zika, indicating relationships adaptability, flexibility, and redundancy uncovered in D adaptation to human and mosquito cells suggest principles of flavivirus evolution.
Researchers used single-particle tracking photoactivated localization microscopy (s-PALM) to study the diffusion and trafficking of KRas12, an active form of the Ras protein, on the cell membrane. They found that KRas12 exhibits three distinct diffusion states: a fast, immobile, and intermediate. The immobile state is embedded in a larger domain (~200 nm) that confers intermediate mobility, while the rest of the membrane supports fast diffusion. KRas12 is continuously removed from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to the fast, reminiscent of internalization and recycling. Importantly, the diffusion and trafficking of KRas12 remain invariant over a broad range of protein levels. The study reveals how membrane organization dictates diffusion and trafficking of Ras and offers insight into the spatial regulation of Ras signaling.

    Title: Systems biology derived source-sink mechanism of BMP gradient formation
    Abstract: A morphogen gradient of Bone Morphogenetic Protein ( BMP ) signaling patterns the dorsoventral embryonic axis of vertebrates and invertebrates. The prevailing view in vertebrates for BMP gradient formation is through a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists, often along with ligand shuttling to generate peak signaling levels. To delineate the mechanism in zebrafish, we precisely quantified the BMP activity gradient in wild-type and mutant embryos and combined these data with a mathematical model-based computational screen to test hypotheses for gradient formation. Our analysis ruled out a BMP shuttling mechanism and a bmp transcriptionally-informed gradient mechanism. Surprisingly, rather than supporting a counter-gradient mechanism, our analyses support a fourth model, a source-sink mechanism, which relies on a restricted BMP antagonist distribution acting as a sink that drives BMP flux dorsally and gradient formation. We measured Bmp2 diffusion and found that it supports the source-sink model, suggesting a new mechanism to shape BMP gradients during development.

   ., 2000; Connors et al., 1999; Little and Mullins, 2006; Thomsen, 1997 ), 2 ) BMP antagonists generate the peak BMP signaling levels by shuttling BMP ligand to these regions ( Figure 1B, D ) ( Ben-Zvi et al., 2008; Shilo et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2007 ), 3 ) the gradient shape mirrors the shape of the bmp expression domain ( Figure 1E ) ( Ramel and Hill, 2013 ), and 4 ) the gradient is generated by BMP diffusing from its ventral source to a dorsal sink of BMP antagonists ( Figure 1F ). These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and multiple may act in combination. To identify the mechanism of BMP signaling gradient formation in the zebrafish embryo, we established a robust quantitative imaging method to directly measure the BMP signaling gradient. We integrated the results with a mathematical modeling approach, using the experiments to inform our model selection. The modeling then provided information on key parameters to measure to identify the mechanism by which the BMP signaling gradient is formed. We used phosphorylated Smad5 protein as a direct read-out for BMP signaling in both wild type ( WT ), chordin mutant, and chordin heterozygous embryos. We quantified nuclear phosphorylated-Smad5 ( P-Smad5 ) fluorescent intensity across the entire embryo at single-cell resolution at different stages of development. Combining the P-Smad5 data with a computational screen of mathematical models showed that shuttling of BMP during DV patterning does not shape the gradient, and that a gradient of bmp transcription cannot account for the gradient of BMP signaling activity. From these results, we conclude that the signaling gradient patterning the vertebrate DV axis is generated by either a source-sink or counter-gradient mechanism

. Together, this suggests that the source-sink mechanism is more robust to changes in biophysical parameters than the counter-gradient mechanism, but does not rule out the counter-gradient mechanism entirely. The recent observation that bmp2b and bmp7a are expressed in a graded manner in WT embryos has lead to the hypothesis that the BMP signaling gradient may largely reflect the bmp expression gradient ( Ramel and Hill, 2013 ). We sought to determine if the BMP signaling gradient in zebrafish is predominantly established by matching the bmp expression gradient. Three results do not support this hypothesis. First, the relative shape of the bmp2b expression domain ( Figure 3 ) did not precisely match the P-Smad5 gradient ( Figure 2 ). Second, we mathematically defined a gradient established by a transcriptional mechanism as one where 80% of the BMP accumulates or is degraded where it is produced, as opposed to binding antagonists or diffusing away. When we performed a mathematical model-based computational screen using a bmp expression profile that reflected the P-Smad5 WT gradient, no tested parameter combination fit both our measured WT and chordin LOF P-Smad5 gradients. For the transcriptional mechanism to work, the bmp expression domain would have to change in the chordin mutant condition to fit the mutant gradient profile. Finally, we showed that feedback by BMP signaling on bmp expression does not begin until after 5. 7 hpf. This is likely because the initial bmp expression domain is established by maternal factors and repression from Bozozok, a transcription factor activated by maternal Wnt signaling ( Koos and Ho, 1999; Langdon and Mullins, 2011; Leung et al., 2003; Solnica-Krezel et al., 2001 ). FGF ( Fibroblast Growth Factor ) and Nodal signaling also repress bmp expression dorsally ( Fürthauer et al., 2004; Kuo et al., 2013; Maegawa et al., 2006; Shimizu et al., 2000; Varga et al., 2007 )

., 2011 ). Although we and most others in the vertebrate field have contended that a Chordin ( or BMP antagonist ) counter-gradient drives formation of the BMP activity gradient in DV patterning, our studies here, intriguingly, suggest that an alternate source-sink mechanism may prevail. While the source-sink gradient mechanism is also modulated by Chordin, Chordin instead acts in a distinct manner as a sink, binding BMP ligand predominantly in dorsal regions, thus allowing a BMP diffusive gradient to form throughout most of the ventral half of the embryo. Key to deriving this alternate model was the integrated approach used that combined quantitative experimental analysis with computational modeling. Importantly, a role for Chordin in establishing a sink that drives gradient formation would not have been revealed to us had we not performed the mathematical model-based computational screen. By narrowing the compatible simulations successively with the WT, chordin +/-, and then chordin mutant P-Smad5 profiles, 15-fold more source-sink simulations than counter-gradient simulations perdured ( Figure 7E’ ). Furthermore, the computational modeling also illuminated the BMP diffusivity parameter as one to further test the source-sink mechanism. Significantly, our measured Bmp2 diffusivity further supports the source-sink mechanism of gradient formation. Thus the seamless integration of quantitative experimental analysis with mathematical model-based computational screens has proved to be a highly successful approach to elucidating mechanisms of BMP gradient formation. Future studies will be required to definitively determine the mechanism and further test the source-sink and counter gradient models of BMP gradient formation.

. To illustrate the distinct manners by which a source-sink and counter-gradient mechanism would generate the zebrafish BMP signaling gradients observed, we graphically display in Figure 10 the relative contributions of BMP and Chordin diffusion and BMP-Chordin binding to gradient formation for the median simulations that fit our WT, chordin mutant, chordin +/-, and Bmp2b-Venus FRAP data. The primary differences between the source-sink and counter-gradient mechanisms manifest in the relative amount of Chordin protein that diffuses ventrally into the bmp expression domain and the primary role of Chordin in forming the BMP gradient. A counter-gradient mechanism leads to higher levels of Chordin that extend over a greater region of the ventral bmp expression domain compared to a source-sink mechanism ( Figure 10A ). Counter-gradient and source-sink mechanisms also differ significantly in where Chordin binds and inhibits BMP ligand activity along the DV axis, which is consistent with the distinct Chordin protein distributions ( Figure 10A ). In a counter-gradient mechanism Chordin binds BMP in a broader domain, extending over a much greater extent of the DV axis than in a source-sink mechanism ( Figure 10B, C ). In a source-sink mechanism, Chordin binds BMP largely in dorsal regions and extends little ventrally, effectively generating a driving force for the movement of BMP ( Figure 10B, C ). This dorsal sink of Chordin leads to a diffusive flux of BMP ligand down its concentration gradient ( Figure 10C ) that largely shapes the BMP signaling profile in a source-sink mechanism ( Figure 10C ). Importantly, gradient formation by either of these mechanisms need not be exclusive, and instead characteristics of each can contribute to some extent in shaping sectors of the other’s gradient. In the source-sink simulation in Figure 10A, C, Chordin forms a small counter-gradient partially contributing to the gradient shape in this region

. The shuttling solutions also required BMP range to be high ( Figure 5G, I ), because if Chordin moved ventrally to bind BMP in this scenario, it would interfere with the bmp expression gradient matching the BMP signaling gradient. In these simulations BMP moves dorsally to form the BMP-Chordin species that ultimately is shuttled back ventrally. The remaining parameters required for shuttling were similar for the two simulations ( Figure 5E, F, K, L ). To determine whether Chordin shuttling of BMP ligand plays a functionally relevant role in generating the ventral P-Smad5 peak in zebrafish, as it does in Drosophila, we quantified the P-Smad5 gradient of chordin mutant embryos over a developmental time series ( Figure 6A, B ). If it does play a role, then we expect the ventral P-Smad5 peak to be reduced in chordin mutants compared to WT embryos. We found that the ventral Pmad peak was not significantly reduced in chordin compared to WT ( Figure 6A, B ), suggesting that shuttling does not contribute to the ventral Pmad peak in zraf.
Researchers have characterized the lysosomal protein MFSD, a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters, which mediates the transport of metabolites between the lysosomal lumen and cytosol. MFSD is not-glycosylated and contains a dileine-based sorting motif for transport to lysosomes. Mf1 knockout mice develop severe liver disease characterized by extravasation erythrocytes, sinus damage, loss of liver endothelial cells, and signs of fibrosis. Proteomics of isolated lysosomes from wildtype and Mf1 mice identified GL as an essential accessory protein for MF1. GL is a glycosyl lysosomal protein of unknown function. Deficiency M1 leads to drastically reduced GL and vice versa. MF1 and GL physically interact. Gl-deficient mice resemble the phenotype of M1 mice, suggesting the MF/GL complex to be a stable and relevant lysosomal transporter. MF1 is localized in lysosomes, ubiquitously expressed in murine tissues, and harbors a dileine sorting motif in its cytos N-terminus required for transport to lysosomes. GL levels are reduced in all tissues of M1 mice, including liver, kidney, lung, and spleen, but transcript levels are comparable between wildtype and M1 animals, indicating a post transcriptional mechanism. MF and GL physically interact, transport to lysosomes does not depend on each other, and stability of MF against lysosomal proteolysis depends on GL.

    Title: High-resolution structures of kinesin on microtubules provide a basis for nucleotide-gated force-generation
    Abstract: Microtubule-based transport by the kinesin motors, powered by ATP hydrolysis, is essential for a wide range of vital processes in eukaryotes. We obtained insight into this process by developing atomic models for no-nucleotide and ATP states of the monomeric kinesin motor domain on microtubules from cryo-EM reconstructions at 5–6 Å resolution. By comparing these models with existing X-ray structures of ADP-bound kinesin, we infer a mechanistic scheme in which microtubule attachment, mediated by a universally conserved ‘linchpin’ residue in kinesin ( N255 ), triggers a clamshell opening of the nucleotide cleft and accompanying release of ADP. Binding of ATP re-closes the cleft in a manner that tightly couples to translocation of cargo, via kinesin's ‘neck linker’ element. These structural transitions are reminiscent of the analogous nucleotide-exchange steps in the myosin and F1-ATPase motors and inform how the two heads of a kinesin dimer ‘gate’ each other to promote coordinated stepping along microtubules.

    Supporting Text:
   . A major barrier to further progress in elucidating kinesin's mechanism has been the inability of cryo-EM methods to much exceed nanometer resolution with kinesin-microtubule complexes ( Sindelar, 2011 ), making it difficult or impossible to determine which crystal structures of kinesin ( if any ) correspond to the motor's functionally relevant, microtubule-attached states. Recently, a series of X-ray crystal structures of kinesin have been solved in the presence of ATP analogs that are thought to closely resemble kinesin's ATP state on microtubules; these include not only two structures of kinesin solved in the absence of protein co-factors ( Parke et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2013 ), but also a structure of kinesin co-complexed with a dimer of tubulin ( Gigant et al., 2013 ). However, it has remained unclear how closely these structures resemble the corresponding state of kinesin when bound to its physiological substrate ( an intact microtubule ), and structure models for other nucleotide states of microtubule-attached kinesin have remained elusive. These issues have left open the possibility that one or more of kinesin's vital functions may be governed by allosteric pathways not envisioned in the gamma phosphate sensor scheme, possibly involving twisting of the motor's central beta sheet ( Hirose et al., 2006; Kull and Endow, 2013; Arora et al., 2014 ). Of particular importance is whether switch loop closure is triggered by ATP binding ( as in the gamma phosphate sensor scheme ) or by some other event, which would allow ATP binding to have a distinct function. The coordination that occurs between two heads in a kinesin dimer is even more challenging to explain with existing structural models

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 04686. 015 In order to identify the basis for microtubule-affinity regulation of kinesin by ADP and vice versa, we compared our structures of microtubule-attached kinesin with two X-ray structures ( PDB ID's 1MKJ, 1BG2 ) of the same construct in an ADP-bound, weakly attaching state ( Kull et al., 1996; Sindelar et al., 2002 ). The relative arrangements of the upper and lower domains in the 1BG2 and 1MKJ structures, corresponding to undocked and docked states of the neck linker, closely align with our no-nucleotide and ATP state kinesin models ( respectively ). We discovered, however, that both the 1BG2 and 1MKJ structures are prohibited from assuming favorable binding orientations on the microtubule surface due to the conformation of residue N255. As illustrated in Figure 4D–F, the N-terminal coils of the switch II helix are unwound in both ADP-bound structures. Consequently, the peptide backbone at residue N255 would point directly at the H11–H12 loop of alpha tubulin, generating a substantial steric overlap ( Figure 4F, I ). Thus, the 1BG2 and 1MKJ conformations appear incapable of strong microtubule attachment, consistent with the weak experimentally observed microtubule affinity of kinesin's ADP state ( Rosenfeld et al., 1996 ). Further comparison of our structure models to other atomic structures of ADP-bound kinesin ( Figure 5 ) consistently demonstrates a clash between alpha tubulin and residue N255 ( and/or adjacent residues in the switch II helix ), for the ADP-state structures. While ADP-state crystal structures of kinesin are largely similar in their active-site features to the 1BG2 and 1MKJ structures, some of these exhibit an alpha-helical conformation for N255 and adjacent residues that N-terminally extends the switch II helix

It has increasingly been proposed that kinesin may harness the energy of twisting in its central beta sheet in some fashion during the ATPase cycle ( Hirose et al., 2006; Kull and Endow, 2013; Arora et al., 2014 ). Speculations in this regard have mainly focused on the possibility, by analogy to myosin, that release of nucleotide initiates a much larger end-to-end twist in the sheet than is observed in comparisons of nucleotide-bound X-ray structures of the motor ( Gigant et al., 2013; Kull and Endow, 2013; Arora et al., 2014 ). However, it has remained unclear how such twisting would relate to the complex interplay of affinities between kinesin and microtubules, ADP and ATP. The structure models derived in the current study indicate that in kinesin, the energy of nucleotide binding is captured by a related but distinct mode of distortion in the peptide backbone, involving coordinated rearrangements of the beta sheet and alpha 2 ( Figure 7 ). As we have shown, this distortion is coupled with closure of the nucleotide cleft and can evidently be stabilized either by interactions between the P-loop and the open switch II loop ( ADP state; Figure 4F and Video 8 ), or between the gamma phosphate and the closed switch loops ( ATP state; Figure 4E and Video 7 ). This mechanism would thus allow microtubules to regulate kinesin's affinities for ADP and ATP by modulating the conformation of the switch loops, yielding an elegant structural basis for kinesin's nucleotide-binding behavior on and off microtubules. A number of sites in the kinesin fold have been identified that uncouple the motor's nucleotide affinity from its microtubule affinity, but the structural basis of the uncoupling has remained unclear. The nucleotide-exchange mechanism proposed here predicts that the uncoupling mutations in the kinesin's switch regions would have differential effects on the kinetics of ADP release, depending on the nature of the affected site

. ( I ) Image of a microtubule decorated by the N255K construct ( ADP condition ). While obviously decorated, the microtubule has a shaggy appearance uncharacteristic of decoration by wild-type kinesin. ( J ) Example of a morphologically disrupted microtubule, frequently seen in cryo-EM specimens of microtubules decorated by the N255K construct. The disrupted microtubules were excluded from data sets used for image processing and 3D reconstruction. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 04686. 025 Cryo-EM analysis of the ADP and ATP analog-bound states of the N255K point mutant of our construct support this hypothesis, revealing two previously unidentified binding modes of kinesin in which the motor domain attaches tightly to the microtubule but is rotationally mobile ( Figure 7C–E and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ). The corresponding 3D maps did not refine to high resolution, presumably due to mobility of the kinesin heads. However, density for the motor domains in the N255K maps clearly indicates that a wild-type binding orientation is not achieved in either case. In the ADP-state map, the microtubule contact at site 255 appears to be attenuated or disordered ( Figure 7D, right panel ), while in the AMPPNP map the wild-type microtubule contact of loop L12 is absent but a contact is evident at the 255 site ( Figure 7E, right panel ). Thus, in neither nucleotide state is the N255K construct able to form all three wild-type microtubule contacts. These results indicate that the specific bridging role of N255 between the switch II loop and N413 of alpha tubulin ( see Figure 4 ), which likely cannot be sustained by the N255K mutation, is not required for tight microtubule attachment. On the other hand, the N255K construct is able to bind the microtule in a manner that is rotationally mobile ( Figure 7C–E and Figure 7—figure 1 ), suggesting that microtule attachment is not solely dependent on the bridging role of N255.

    Title: A protein quality control pathway at the mitochondrial outer membrane
    Abstract: Maintaining the essential functions of mitochondria requires mechanisms to recognize and remove misfolded proteins. However, quality control ( QC ) pathways for misfolded mitochondrial proteins remain poorly defined. Here, we establish temperature-sensitive ( ts- ) peripheral mitochondrial outer membrane ( MOM ) proteins as novel model QC substrates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ts- proteins sen2-1HAts and sam35-2HAts are degraded from the MOM by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Ubiquitination of sen2-1HAts is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase ( E3 ) Ubr1, while sam35-2HAts is ubiquitinated primarily by San1. Mitochondria-associated degradation ( MAD ) of both substrates requires the SSA family of Hsp70s and the Hsp40 Sis1, providing the first evidence for chaperone involvement in MAD. In addition to a role for the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex, Doa1 and a mitochondrial pool of the transmembrane Cdc48 adaptor, Ubx2, are implicated in their degradation. This study reveals a unique QC pathway comprised of a combination of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors that distinguish it from other cellular QC pathways.

   . In ERAD, the UBL- and UBA-containing proteins Rad23 and Dsk2 have been implicated as factors that shuttle ubiquitinated substrates from the Cdc48 complex to proteasomes. Deletion of these or another proteasome shuttling factor, Ddi1, did not affect the degradation of sam35-2HAts or sen2-1HAts ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1D ), further distinguishing MAD from ERAD. All together, these results indicate that ubiquitinated mitochondrial QC substrates require the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex for efficient proteasomal degradation. The Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex can be recruited to substrates via Cdc48’s interaction with co-factors ( Buchberger et al., 2001; Buchberger et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016 ). Vms1 and Doa1 are two cytosolic Cdc48 co-factors implicated in mitochondrial homeostasis ( Heo et al., 2010; Izawa et al., 2017; Nielson et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2016 ), although their reported involvement in mitochondrial protein turnover, particularly with respect to Fzo1, has been inconsistent ( Chowdhury et al., 2018; Esaki and Ogura, 2012; Wu et al., 2016 ). Loss of Vms1 had no effect on the degradation of sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ), while loss of Doa1 had a small, but significant effect ( Figure 6A ). We next examined deletions of each of the UBX ( Ubiquitin-regulatory X ) proteins, a family of Cdc48 binding co-factors containing a C-terminal Ub fold ( UBX ) domain ( Schuberth and Buchberger, 2008; Schuberth et al., 2004 ). Notably, only the loss of Ubx2 significantly stabilized sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts ( Figure 6B and Figure 6—figure supplement 1B ). Ubx2 ( as well as its mammalian ortholog, UbxD8 ) is well-characterized as an ER membrane protein with roles in ERAD and lipid droplet homeostasis ( Kolawa et al., 2013; Neuber et al., 2005; Schuberth and Buchberger, 2005; Wang and Lee, 2012 )

Our knowledge of protein QC in the ER, cytosol, and nucleus derives in part from the study of proteins that undergo temperature-dependent misfolding and degradation ( Biederer et al., 1996; Gardner et al., 2005; Khosrow-Khavar et al., 2012; Ravid et al., 2006; Wang and Prelich, 2009 ). To elucidate how misfolded mitochondrial proteins are targeted for destruction, we exploited two previously-identified yeast ts- alleles, sam35-2 and sen2-1 ( Li et al., 2011; Milenkovic et al., 2004; Winey and Culbertson, 1988 ), whose degradation has not been assessed. Sam35 and Sen2 are essential MOM proteins. Sam35 is the substrate receptor of the MOM-embedded multiprotein sorting and assembly machinery ( SAM ) complex required for assembly of β-barrel proteins into the MOM ( Chan and Lithgow, 2008; Kozjak et al., 2003; Kutik et al., 2008; Milenkovic et al., 2004 ). Although Sam35 contains no apparent membrane spans, it is tightly embedded at the MOM via the Sam50 protein ( Kutik et al., 2008 ). Sen2 provides endonuclease activity for the multi-subunit tRNA splicing endonuclease complex and also cleaves a mitochondria-targeted non-stop mRNA ( Ho et al., 1990; Tsuboi et al., 2015; Winey and Culbertson, 1988 ). The tRNA splicing complex resides on the MOM in yeast, with Sen2 potentially anchoring it to the membrane via a hydrophobic segment ( Trotta et al., 1997; Yoshihisa et al., 2003 ). We first determined that sam35-2ts and sen2-1ts encoded full-length proteins. Each contained multiple missense mutations ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) that likely account for the phenotypes reported ( Li et al., 2011; Milenkovic et al., 2004; Winey and Culbertson, 1988 ). To facilitate detection, sequence encoding an HA tag was added to the C-terminus of each to generate sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts

Mitochondria are essential to cellular bioenergetics and metabolism. It is therefore vital that QC mechanisms dispose of damaged proteins that can compromise function. In mammalian cells, this is accomplished at the macroscopic level through mitophagy ( Pickles et al., 2018 ). Here, we define a UPS-mediated pathway for the degradation of individual dysfunctional yeast MOM proteins using two newly-established model QC substrates, sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts ( schematized in Figure 7 ). While previous mitochondrial UPS substrates have consisted primarily of native proteins ( Belgareh-Touzé et al., 2017; Cohen et al., 2008; Heo et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2016 ), sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts contain mutations that render them unstable at the non-permissive temperature, and thus mimic damaged, misfolded proteins. These new mitochondrial model substrates have revealed a tightly-coupled degradation pathway at the MOM that requires both cytosolic and mitochondrial machinery. This MAD QC pathway utilizes factors that have not been previously linked to mitochondria or implicated in MAD of native MOM proteins. It is also not identical to any other cellular QC pathway, although there are points of intersection. All of these degradation pathways, unsurprisingly, require 26S proteasome activity. In many cases, the involvement of the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex represents another point of convergence ( Benischke et al., 2014; Cohen et al., 2008; Gallagher et al., 2014; Heo et al., 2010; Jarosch et al., 2002; Tanaka et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2011 ). However, tail-anchored proteins mistargeted to mitochondria and unimported mitochondrial precursors that accumulate at the mitochondrial surface following mitochondrial import stress also require the AAA-ATPase Msp1 for their recognition and extraction from mitochondria ( Chen et al., 2014; Matsumoto et al

. The SSA family of chaperones is required for co-translational folding or import of at least some mitochondrial proteins ( Ben-Menachem et al., 2018; Deshaies et al., 1988; Sass et al., 2003; Young et al., 2003 ), positioning them to play a role in recognizing misfolded mitochondrial proteins and targeting them to the UPS. On the other hand, we have found that the degradation of a native MOM protein, Fzo1, largely does not require Hsp70 chaperones, extending to mitochondria a distinction between misfolded substrates and those whose ubiquitination occurs in a regulated manner. Whether there are other, yet to be identified, factors involved in the degradation of MOM proteins remains to be determined.

    Title: Intercellular propagation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation revealed by in vivo imaging of mouse skin
    Abstract: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) is a key effector of many growth signalling pathways. In this study, we visualise epidermal ERK activity in living mice using an ERK FRET biosensor. Under steady-state conditions, the epidermis occasionally revealed bursts of ERK activation patterns where ERK activity radially propagated from cell to cell. The frequency of this spatial propagation of radial ERK activity distribution ( SPREAD ) correlated with the rate of epidermal cell division. SPREADs and proliferation were stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) in a manner dependent on EGF receptors and their cognate ligands. At the wounded skin, ERK activation propagated as trigger wave in parallel to the wound edge, suggesting that ERK activation propagation can be superimposed. Furthermore, by visualising the cell cycle, we found that SPREADs were associated with G2/M cell cycle progression. Our results provide new insights into how cell proliferation and transient ERK activity are synchronised in a living tissue.

    Cell proliferation at proper time and place is essential for tissue maintenance in multicellular organisms. In steady-state skin, epidermal cells undergo continuous turnover through autonomous activation of growth signal pathway triggered by the interaction of EGFRs and their cognate receptors ( Kholodenko, 2006; Khavari and Rinn, 2007 ). ERK plays a central role as a downstream target of a variety of growth signal pathways and its tight regulation in time, place, and degree of activation determine cell behaviours such as cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation ( Pouysségur et al., 2002 ). Aberrant activation of ERK has been reported in many types of cancers especially by the oncogenic mutation of Ras and Raf ( Roberts and Der, 2007 ). Despite the significance of ERK activity regulation, technical limitations have obscured how growth signal activation is generated and propagated throughout the tissue. In this study, we exploited transgenic mice expressing a FRET biosensor of ERK and monitored ERK activity in epidermal cells at single cell resolution. Our long time lapse imaging of intact epidermis revealed radial propagation of ERK activity, where ERK activation originates from a few cells and propagate radially up to a radius of about 50 μm over 30 min until disappearance. We named this novel phenomenon as SPREAD and investigated its mechanism of ERK propagation and its role in cell cycle progression. Although we previously reported stochastic propagation of ERK activity pulse in a single cell to its neighbouring cells ( Aoki et al., 2013 ), the propagation was restricted within an array of a few cells rather than firework-like round propagation covering more than 100 cells. Our single cell analysis of SPREAD and inhibitor treatment revealed similarities and differences between the two patterns of ERK activation in vitro and in vivo

. While they share in common the dependence of EGFRs and the production of their cognate ligands for ERK activation propagation, they differ in the efficiency and amplitude of ERK activation during propagation. Together with the difference in ERK propagation manner between SPREADs in steady-state skin and ERK activation waves, this suggests that ERK propagation pattern might be altered depending on the surrounding environment of the cells, including the involvement of stem cells, cellular density, and pathological conditions. The induction of SPREADs by double TPA treatment raises the possibility that the alterations in SPREADs could be involved in tumorigenesis. Thus, it will be of special interest to observe SPREADs in various pathological conditions including cancer. The dependency on EGFRs and MMPs strongly suggests that a common molecular mechanism operates between SPREADs and ERK activation propagation in tissue culture cells ( Aoki et al., 2013 ). Unlike the ERK activation propagation in tissue culture cells, however, we could not conclude whether the inhibitors against EGFRs and MMPs suppress ERK activation in the initiator cell or abrogate intercellular propagation of the ERK activation. This is because we cannot clearly identify the ERK activation pulse at single cell resolution due partly to the long interval of image acquisition in vivo and low signal-to-noise ratio of in vivo FRET imaging. As well as the established role of ERK activation in G1/S progression of cell cycle ( Torii et al., 2006 ), the necessity of ERK to G2/M progression has also been reported in mammalian cells ( Tamemoto et al., 1992; Wright et al., 1999 ). On the other hand, excessive ERK activation in G2 phase arrests cells in G2-phase. High ERK activity due to BRCA1 mutation, lack of Vaccinia H1-related ( VHR ) dual-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase, or stimulation by TPA induces G2-phase arrest ( Yan et al., 2005; Dangi et al

. Single-cell analysis of SPREAD demonstrated that ERK activation in SPREAD originated from a cluster of a few cells and propagated up to about 50 μm with an average velocity of 1. 5 μm/min. The amplitude of ERK activation and efficiency in propagation gradually decreased until SPREAD disappeared. Interestingly, the frequency of SPREAD was spatio-temporally associated with that of cell division. SPREADs were significantly stimulated by topical treatment of mitotic stimulation, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ). The induction was dependent on EGF receptors and the production of their cognate ligands by MMPs. The role of SPREAD in cell cycle progression was studied with Fucci mice, in which G0/G1 cells and S/G2/M cells are visualised by the expression of mKO2-Cdt1 and mAG-Geminin, respectively ( Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008 ). Inhibition of SPREAD in Fucci mice led to significant delay of entry to G0/G1 phase from S/G2/M phase under TPA treatment, suggesting the role of SPREAD in G2/M progression of cell cycle. We also imaged ERK activity of ear skin subjected to epithelial wounding. Interestingly, wounded skin revealed another type of ERK activation propagation pattern, where waves of ERK activation propagated in parallel with the wound edge. Single cell analysis revealed similarity and difference between the wound-induced waves and SPREAD. While the velocity of ERK activity propagation in wound-induced waves was similar to that of SPREAD, the ERK activation waves from the wound edge was relatively maintained during propagation during propagation. In this study, we propose how dynamically growth signal is regulated in steady-state and wounded skin in a living tissue by showing two types of novel ERK activation patterns.

. 100 μm from the wound edge ( Figure 7C ). The ERK activation waves from the wound edge were suppressed by TAPI-1 treatment, suggesting the involvement of the similar mechanisms as that of SPREAD ( Video 5 ). Single-cell analysis of the ERK activation waves from the wound was performed with segmentation and sine curve fittings as performed for SPREADs in Figure 3 ( Figure 8A–C ). The velocity of ERK activity propagation was determined as 1. 4 μm/min, which is similar to that in SPREAD ( Figure 8D ). In contrast to ERK propagation in SPREAD, ERK activation waves from the wound edge maintained high ERK activity and propagation efficiency ( Figure 8E–F ), suggesting that ERK activation propagation can be synchronized and superimposed to generate trigger waves if a number of ERK activation pulses are evoked in close temporal and spatial proximity. These similarities and differences between SPREADs and ERK activation waves from the wound edge suggest the possible modification of the amplitude and efficiency in propagation depending on the surrounding environment of the cells. 10. 7554/eLife. 05178. 019Figure 7.

Exquisite control of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) MAPK signalling is required for homeostasis in the epidermis and other tissues ( Pouysségur et al., 2002; Kholodenko, 2006; Khavari and Rinn, 2007; Roberts and Der, 2007 ). ERK activation is triggered by the activation of epidermal growth factor receptors ( EGFRs ) through binding to their cognate ligands, such as epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and heparin growth factor ( HGF ) ( Kholko et al. 2006 ). ER activation of EGFR leads to autophosphorylation and activation of downstream targets including ERK ( Poussur et al. 2002 ). ERK plays a central role in cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation in the epider ( Poussur et al 2002 ) Aberrant ER activation of ER has been reported in many types of cancers ( Roberts and Der 2007 ). Despite the significance of ER regulation, technical limitations have obscured how growth signal is generated and propagated throughout the tissue In this study, we exploited transgenic mice expressing a FRET biosensor of ER and monitored ER activity in epider cells at single resolution Our time imaging of intact epider revealed radial propagation ER activity where ER activation originates from a few cells and propagate radially up to radius of 50 μ over 30 until disappearance We named this phenomenon SP and investigated its mechanism ER propagation and role cell progression Although previously reported propagation ER activity in single cell to neighbouring cells ( A et al 2013 ) the propagation was restricted an array few rather than fire-like propagation covering cells Our cell analysis SP and treatment revealed similarities differences between patterns ER activation vitro and in vivo While share common dependence EGs production cognate ligands ER activation propagation differ efficiency amplitude ER during propagation together difference ER propagation between SPs steady skin ER waves suggests ER pattern altered surrounding cells including involvement stem cells density pathological The induction SPs by TPA raises possibility alterations SP involved tumenesis will interest observe SPs pathological including cancer dependency EGs MMPs suggests common mechanism SPs ER activation tissue cells ( et 201 ) Unlike ER propagation tissue cells we not conclude inhibitors EG MMPs suppress ER activation initiator intercellular ER activation due low signal-noise FRET imaging interval acquisition in vivo As established role ER G/S progression cell Tor et 200 necessity ER G/M also reported mammalian Tamoto et 199 Wright et 199 excessive ER G arrest G-phase Yan et 200 Dangi  Single-cell SP demonstrated ER originated cluster propagated 50m average velocity μm amplitude ER activation decreased SP disappeared frequency SP temporally associated cell division SPs stimulated treatment mitotic TPA dependent EGF production ligands role SP cycle studied Fucci G/G cells S cells visualised mKO-C1 m-Gemin Saka-Sano et 200 inhibition SP Fucci delay entry G/G phase S phase TPA suggesting role SP G/M cell cycle imaged ER ear subjected epithelial wound wounded skin ER propagation waves parallel wound edge velocity ER propagation waves similar SP ER waves edge maintained during propagation propose dynamically regulated steady wounded skin tissue two types ER activation patterns

The final answer is: 

In this study, researchers used transgenic mice expressing a FRET biosensor of ERK to monitor ER activity in epidermal cells at single resolution. They found that ER activity propagated radially from a few cells to a radius of 50 μ over 30 min, which they named SPREAD. SPs were associated with cell division and stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphol-13-acetate (T) in a manner dependent on EGF receptors and their cognate ligands. At wounded skin, ER activation propagated as waves in parallel to the edge, suggesting that ER activation can be superimposed. Single-cell analysis of SP showed that ER activation originated from a cluster of cells and propagated with an average velocity of 1.5 μm/min, with amplitude and efficiency decreasing until SP disappeared. The frequency of SP was temporally associated with cell division, and SPs were stimulated by TPA in a manner dependent on EGF and their ligands. The role of SP in cycle was studied in Fucci mice, where G/G cells and S/M cells were visualized by expression of m2-C

    Title: The cyanobacterial circadian clock follows midday in vivo and in vitro
    Abstract: Circadian rhythms are biological oscillations that schedule daily changes in physiology. Outside the laboratory, circadian clocks do not generally free-run but are driven by daily cues whose timing varies with the seasons. The principles that determine how circadian clocks align to these external cycles are not well understood. Here, we report experimental platforms for driving the cyanobacterial circadian clock both in vivo and in vitro. We find that the phase of the circadian rhythm follows a simple scaling law in light-dark cycles, tracking midday across conditions with variable day length. The core biochemical oscillator comprised of the Kai proteins behaves similarly when driven by metabolic pulses in vitro, indicating that such dynamics are intrinsic to these proteins. We develop a general mathematical framework based on instantaneous transformation of the clock cycle by external cues, which successfully predicts clock behavior under many cycling environments.

   . 47 ± 0. 03 ( sinusoidal fitting ) 0. 57 ± 0. 02 ( parabolic fitting ) Figure 5C22, 23, 24, 25, 268, 10, 12, 140. 51 ± 0. 11 ( sinusoidal fitting ) The fact that the core oscillator of the cyanobacterial circadian clock can be reconstituted in vitro from purified Kai proteins ( Nakajima et al., 2005; Kageyama et al., 2006 ) naturally led to the question of whether the ability to track midday in vivo is intrinsic to the core oscillator, or if it requires additional factors present in the cell. We thus sought to extend the reconstituted system such that we could drive the biochemical oscillator with rhythmic input signals. A purified mixture of the KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC proteins spontaneously generates a stable circadian rhythm in KaiC phosphorylation and in the formation of KaiB-KaiC complexes ( Nakajima et al., 2005; Kageyama et al., 2006 ). Although the Kai proteins are not light-sensitive, recent work has shown that they are sensitive to metabolite pools that shift in response to changes in photosynthetic activity in the cell: KaiA is sensitive to the redox state of quinones, and KaiC phosphorylation is sensitive to the ATP/ADP ratio ( Rust et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2012; Phong et al., 2013 ). We thus developed a protocol to mimic repeated light-dark cycles in vitro by cycling the ATP/ADP ratio between physiologically relevant levels experienced during the day and night ( Pattanayak et al., 2014 ), using ADP addition to simulate nightfall ( [ATP]/ ( [ATP]+[ADP] ) ≈ 25% ) followed by buffer exchange into an ATP-only buffer to simulate dawn ( [ATP]/ ( [ATP]+[ADP] ) ≈ 100% ) ( Figure 2A ). 10. 7554/eLife. 23539. 015Figure 2.

. Straight lines represent linear fits to data from wells entrained to day lengths at least 8 hr long. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 23539. 013 We biochemically simulated seasonal effects in the reconstituted KaiABC oscillator by driving the Kai proteins with pulses of nucleotides on a 24 hr cycle, simulating in vivo metabolic conditions during day and night. Remarkably, this in vitro system shows a similar linear scaling of clock phase with simulated day length, indicating that core mechanisms for seasonal adaptation are intrinsic to the Kai proteins. We developed a minimal mathematical model for oscillator entrainment based on rapid transitions between distinct day and night clock cycles. The model can account for the ability to track midday if the phase shifts caused by dawn and dusk depend linearly on clock time with appropriate slopes. By calibrating this model with independent measurements in vitro and in vivo, we were able to predict the results of phase response experiments, and the behavior of the clock in non-24 hr light-dark cycles. The essential feature of the model, the linear dependences of phase shifts on clock time, has a simple geometric interpretation in terms of the deformation of the clock orbit caused by a transition between light and dark. Thus, the entrained behavior of the circadian clock can be captured quantitatively by a mathematical framework with a small number of parameters. This framework in turn can be used to guide the design of experiments that probe the molecular origins of key mathematical features. The precisely defined nature of the cyanobacterial clock facilitates such experiments, but the model is general, so we expect it to be useful for other organisms as well.

., 2010 ). Consistent with this picture, we find that the core circadian oscillator in cyanobacteria, which relies on a single posttranslational feedback loop, keeps track of a single phase—the midpoint of the day portion of the cycle, a property described in our mathematical framework as a linear scaling of entrained phase with day length with slope m ≈ 0. 5. Why might keeping track of midday be useful for a photosynthetic organism with a simple clock? Clock-controlled gene expression in S. elongatus tends to be bimodal, with most genes falling into subjective dawn or dusk classes. Because the biosynthetic capacity of S. elongatus is severely limited in darkness, the midday tracking effect we describe here could be a mechanism to ensure that biosynthetic resources are partitioned in a balanced way between the dawn and dusk genes, even as the day length changes with the seasons ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ). In particular, clock-driven transcription in this organism has been shown to implement a switch between anabolic and catabolic carbon metabolism, suggesting that a role for the midday tracking we observe here is to ensure balanced growth by timing this switch appropriately in days of different length ( Diamond et al., 2015 ). The ability to reconstitute this effect in vitro by delivering metabolic pulses to the purified Kai proteins indicates that midday tracking is not necessarily achieved through additional feedback mechanisms in the cell, but appears to be a property of the clock proteins themselves. The purified clock responds to metabolic steps with phase shifts that are linear functions of the previous phase. The slopes of these response functions are presumably tuned to give an appropriately entrained clock phase. Notably, linear responses have also been observed for the Kai oscillator following temperature steps, suggesting that this is a general reaction of the system to inputs ( Yoshida et al., 2009 )

Although circadian clocks are defined in part by their ability to continue to cycle in constant environments, the defects associated with clock mutants are often most apparent when organisms are faced with fluctuating environments ( Ouyang, 1998; Woelfle et al., 2004; Pittendrigh, 1972; Spoelstra et al., 2016; Pittendrigh and Minis, 1972 ). Thus, an important challenge is to understand how biological clocks respond to the cycling environments found in nature, and how they function to appropriately schedule gene expression and behavior. For most organisms, there is an asymmetry between day and night, in terms of food availability, predation risk, etc., so that the need to carry out certain activities diurnally or nocturnally presents changing demands as the length of the day varies throughout the year. The situation is especially dramatic for cyanobacteria because there is an extreme metabolic contrast between day and night. We found that S. elongatus contends with these challenges using a clock that tracks the middle of the day. The ability of circadian clocks to keep track of the phase of the light-dark cycle has been long recognized in plants, insects, rodents and higher mammals ( de Montaigu et al., 2015; Daan et al., 2001; Edwards et al., 2010; Hut et al., 1999, Hut et al., 2013; Wehr, 2001 ). Although molecular mechanisms that give rise to these entrainment behaviors are still being uncovered, analysis of circadian clock models has found that the presence of multiple feedback loops in complex clocks determines the number of points in the driving cycle that the oscillator can track simultaneously, by allowing different internal phase relationships between the clock components ( Rand et al., 2004 ). For example, the multi-feedback loop clocks in plants are able to track phases of both dawn and dusk ( Edwards et al., 2010 )

. In these experiments, the circadian clock stably entrained to light-dark cycles with a wide range of day lengths ( τ = 8–16 hr ) within roughly 3 days ( Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2 ). We found that the phase of the oscillation, that is, when the peak clock output signal occurred relative to dawn, varied systematically as a function of day length. In general, longer days resulted in the peak reporter signal occurring later in the day ( Figure 1B ). By plotting the time of peak reporter signal versus day length, we found that the driven behavior was consistent with a simple scaling of phase with a slope m ≈ 0.5 ( Figure 1C ). The phase of the circadian rhythm thus follows a simple law in light-dark cycles, tracking mid across conditions with variable day length. The core oscillator comprised of Kai proteins behaves similarly when driven by metabolic pulses in vitro, indicating that such dynamics are intrinsic to these proteins. We developed a mathematical framework based on instantaneous transformation of the cycle by external cues which successfully predicts clock behavior under cycling environments.

    Title: Loss of the transcription factor Meis1 prevents sympathetic neurons target-field innervation and increases susceptibility to sudden cardiac death
    Abstract: Although cardio-vascular incidents and sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) are among the leading causes of premature death in the general population, the origins remain unidentified in many cases. Genome-wide association studies have identified Meis1 as a risk factor for SCD. We report that Meis1 inactivation in the mouse neural crest leads to an altered sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac rhythmicity in adults characterized by a chronotropic incompetence and cardiac conduction defects, thus increasing the susceptibility to SCD. We demonstrated that Meis1 is a major regulator of sympathetic target-field innervation and that Meis1 deficient sympathetic neurons die by apoptosis from early embryonic stages to perinatal stages. In addition, we showed that Meis1 regulates the transcription of key molecules necessary for the endosomal machinery. Accordingly, the traffic of Rab5+ endosomes is severely altered in Meis1-inactivated sympathetic neurons. These results suggest that Meis1 interacts with various trophic factors signaling pathways during postmitotic neurons differentiation.

    Supporting Text:
   ., 2005 ), the transcriptional regulation of molecules implicated in retrograde Ngf/Ntrk1 transport mechanisms in particular or endosomal transport in general are unknown. We aimed in our study at investigating if Meis1 participates in neural aspects of cardiac regulation by intervening in the differentiation of sympathetic neurons and how Meis1 mutations could mediate susceptibility for unexplained SCD. In this work, we highlight that loss of Meis1 function in early sympathetic neurons leads to an imbalanced sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac functions in adult mice resulting in increased susceptibility to SCD. We further demonstrate that this imbalance results from neurodevelopmental defects leading to sympathetic neurons apoptosis and we position Meis1 as novel actor in sympathetic neurons differentiation by its role in distal target-field innervation. Among the target genes regulated by Meis1, we evidenced a transcriptional regulation of proteins necessary for retrograde transport, endosomes formation, functioning and traffic. Accordingly, following specific inactivation of Meis1 in peripheral neurons, the traffic of Rab5+ early endosomes is impaired and sympathetic target-field innervation is compromised.

In this work, we demonstrated that genetic inactivation of Meis1 in rodent results in an imbalanced sympatho-vagal regulation of heart functions leading to conduction defects, chronotropic incompetence and premature SCD. In addition, we demonstrated that Meis1 acts independently of the well-studied network of transcription factors governing early specification of sympathetic neurons to orchestrate later phases of neuronal differentiation. Its inactivation results in defects of distal innervation and progressive neuronal apoptosis. Identification of Meis1 effector genes revealed a large number of genes involved in endosomal and clathrin-coated cargoes formation and fusion, as well as cytoskeletal proteins participating in their anchoring and transport. Accordingly, loss of Meis1 function impairs Rab5+ endosomes formation and trafficking. The multilevel origin in the trigger, the persistence and the termination of a variety of inherited arrhythmias such as long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, progressive cardiac conduction block, sinus node dysfunction, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or sudden infant death syndrome is well established ( Keating and Sanguinetti, 2001 ), and include an imbalanced autonomic regulation. For instance, studies in mice and humans have revealed the implication of Sema3a-mediated sympathetic axonal guidance and patterning in the development of ventricular tachycardia and SCD ( Ieda et al., 2007; Nakano et al., 2013; Fukuda et al., 2015 ). Here, we demonstrated that Meis1 inactivation results at adult stages in a persistent and spontaneous bradycardia, blocks of conduction and severe sinus arrests independently of any cardiac malformation

Cardio-vascular diseases and sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) are together among the highest causes of mortality in the general population, and ventricular arrhythmias are identifiable in almost all cardiac diseases. The incidence of SCD and the poor outcome of sudden cardiac arrest make heart diseases a leading cause of mortality in young individuals ( Meyer et al., 2012 ). Among frequent causes of SCD, numerous genetic mutations have been identified as responsible for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies, cardiac malformations or sympatho-vagal dysfunctions ( Basso et al., 2012; Chopra and Knollmann, 2011; Fukuda et al., 2015 ). Congenital cardiac innervation defects or dysfunction are largely implicated in SCD and often involve molecules that are essential for the developmental guidance and axonal growth of cardiac sympathetic nerves, such as Sema3a and Ngf ( Dae et al., 1997; Fukuda et al., 2015 ). Recently, two independent genome wide association studies based on abnormal cardiac conduction as an increased susceptibility to SCD have emphasized a restricted number of genes among which Meis1 ( Pfeufer et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2011 ). Meis1 is a transcription factor of the TALE homeobox gene family, known to play important roles during embryonic development, cardiogenesis and postnatal cardiomyocytes turnover ( Moens and Selleri, 2006; Stankunas et al., 2008; Mahmoud et al., 2013 ). The early steps of sympathetic neurons development have been extensively documented. During sympathetic neurons formation, a concerted cross-regulated transcriptional network induced by BMPs and involving among others the transcription factors Hand2, Ascl1, Phox2b and Gata3 initially instructs neural crest cells to a sympathetic fate and a noradrenergic phenotype by up-regulating the expressions of general neuronal markers and the monoamines biosynthesis enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) and dopamine-β-hydroxylase ( DBH ) ( Rohrer, 2011 )

. Nevertheless, a septal defect was present when the Meis1LoxP/LoxP strain was crossed with another strain well-known to recombine in neural crest derivatives, the Wnt1CRE strain, confirming the previously reported function of Meis1 in cardiac neural crest ( Stankunas et al., 2008 ). This difference could be due to an earlier expression of the CRE recombinase when driven by the Wnt1 promoter compared to the PLAT. Another explanation could be a lower recombination efficiency of the PLATCRE strain specifically in the cardiac neural crest lineage. We conclude that gross morphological alterations similar to those previously reported ( Stankunas et al., 2008 ) do not contribute to the phenotype reported here. Our results further complement the study by Mahmoud et al. demonstrating Meis1 function in the regulation of neonatal cardiomyocytes mitosis especially following myocardial infarction ( Mahmoud et al., 2013 ). However, cardiac functions were not affected following specific Meis1 inactivation or overexpression in cardiomyocytes ( Mahmoud et al., 2013 ). Finally, because the Meis family participates in cardiogenesis ( Stankunas et al., 2008; Mahmoud et al., 2013 ) and has been associated with SCD by independent GWA studies ( Pfeufer et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2011 ), it is tempting to speculate that Meis1 mutations in humans would result in heart dysfunctions due to cardiac malformations and/or regeneration, sympatho-vagal deregulation of cardiac rhythmicity, or a combination of dysfunctions affecting both compartments. The onset of Meis1 expression after the early noradrenergic specification transcription factors and noradrenergic markers together with the unaltered expression of Gata3, Phox2b, Hand2 and TH at E14. 5 following Meis1 inactivation demonstrated that Meis1 acts independently of the pathways regulating early sympathetic neurons specification

To examine the consequences of specific inactivation of Meis1 in the mouse peripheral nervous system ( PNS ), the PLATCRE strain was crossed with the Meis1LoxP/LoxP strain ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). Immunochemistry and Western blot analysis showed a complete loss of Meis1 in sympathetic neurons from E16. 5 embryo and adult mutant mice ( Figure 1A ). When grown in a C57BL/6 genetic background, PLATCRE::Meis1LoxP/LoxP mice carried Meis1 alleles according to a Mendelian ratio but newborn pups died within the first days following birth. When grown in a mixed genetic background, 50% of the mutant mice survived beyond early neonatal stages and exhibited blepharoptosis ( Figure 1A ), a physiological sign of sympathetic neurons dysfunction. However, most mutants died prematurely and unpredictably before reaching adult stages ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ). The premature death of PLATCRE::Meis1LoxP/LoxP mice together with their drooping eyelids phenotype led us to hypothesize impairments of sympathetic functions and consequent SCD. Accordingly, we found that newborn and adult mutants exhibited a dramatic reduction in cardiac sympathetic innervation by TH+ fibers ( Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G ). WT littermates exhibited a dense network of TH+ fibers in the heart ( Figure 1 and 1—figure 1G ), whereas PLCRE::Me1xLoP/LoP mice showed sparse TH+ innervation ( Figure 1 and 1figure 1G ). The loss of TH+ innervation in PLCRE::Me1LoP/Lo mice was confirmed by immunostaining for DBH ( Figure 1 and 1figure 1 ), another marker of noradrenerg neurons. In contrast, no difference was observed between WT and PLCREMe1LoP/Lo mice in the expression of the pan-neuronal marker Tuj ( Figure 1 and 1figure 1 ), indicating that Me1 inactivation did not affect the survival of neurons in general but specifically noradrenergic neurons. The loss of sympathetic innervation in PLCREMe1Lo/Lo mice was not due to a lack of norrenerg neurons since the number of TH+ neurons in the sympathetic ganglia was similar between WT and mutants ( Figure 1 and 1figure 1 ). We conclude that Me1 is necessary for the survival of noradnerg neurons during embryonic and perinatal stages

To investigate the molecular basis of Me1 function in sympathetic neurons, we analyzed the expression of genes regulated by Me1 in noradre neurons ( Figure 2 and 2—figure supplement 1 ). We found that Me1 regulates a large number of genes involved in endosomal and clath-coated cargoes formation and fusion, as well as cytoskeletal proteins participating in anchoring and transport ( Figure 2 and 2—figure 1 ). Among the Me1 target genes, we identified Rab5 ( Figure 2 and 2figure 1 ), a small GTPase involved in endosomal trafficking. We found that Me1 regulates the expression of Rab5 in norre neurons ( Figure 2 and 2figure 1 ) and that inactivation of Me1 impairs the formation of Rab5+ endosomes in sympathetic neurons ( Figure 2 and 2figure 1 ). The loss of Rab5+ endosomes in PLCREMe1Lo/Lo mice was confirmed by immunostaining ( Figure 2 and 2figure 1 ). In contrast, no difference was observed between WT and PLMe1Lo/Lo mice in the expression of the endosomal marker Lamp2 ( Figure 2 and 2figure 1 ) indicating that Me1 specifically regulates Rab5 in norre neurons. We conclude that Me1 regulates the formation of Rab5 endosomes in sympathetic neurons and that Me1 inactivation impairs Rab5 endosomal trafficking

To examine the role of Me1 in sympathetic innervation, we analyzed the expression of genes regulated by Me in nor neurons ( Figure 3 and 3figure 1 ). We found that Me1 regulates a number of genes involved in endosomal and cl-coated cargoes formation and fusion, as well cytoskeletal proteins in anchoring and transport ( Figure 3 and 3figure 1 ). Among Me target genes we identified Rab5 ( Figure 3 and 3figure 1 ) a GTPase in endosomal. We found that Me regulates the expression of Rab in nor neurons ( Figure 3 and 3figure 1 ) and inactivation Me impairs the formation of Rab+ end in sympathetic ( Figure 3 and 3figure 1 ) The loss of Rab+ in PLMeLo mice was confirmed by immunostaining ( Figure 3 and 3figure 1 ) In contrast no difference was observed between WT and PLMeLo in the expression of the endosomal Lamp ( Figure 3 and 3figure ) indicating Me specifically regulates Rab in nor neurons We conclude that Me regulates the formation of Rab end in sympathetic and Me inactivation impairs Rab endosomal

    Title: Mechanical instability and interfacial energy drive biofilm morphogenesis
    Abstract: Surface-attached bacterial communities called biofilms display a diversity of morphologies. Although structural and regulatory components required for biofilm formation are known, it is not understood how these essential constituents promote biofilm surface morphology. Here, using Vibrio cholerae as our model system, we combine mechanical measurements, theory and simulation, quantitative image analyses, surface energy characterizations, and mutagenesis to show that mechanical instabilities, including wrinkling and delamination, underlie the morphogenesis program of growing biofilms. We also identify interfacial energy as a key driving force for mechanomorphogenesis because it dictates the generation of new and the annihilation of existing interfaces. Finally, we discover feedback between mechanomorphogenesis and biofilm expansion, which shapes the overall biofilm contour. The morphogenesis principles that we discover in bacterial biofilms, which rely on mechanical instabilities and interfacial energies, should be generally applicable to morphogenesis processes in tissues in higher organisms.

    We show here that mechanical instabilities, including wrinkling and delamination, underlie biofilm morphogenesis. Moreover, differences in interfacial energies drive mechanomorphogenesis by dictating the creation or annihilation of new or existing interfaces. Finally, feedback between mechanomorphogenesis and biofilm expansion shapes the overall biofilm contour. Collectively, our findings concerning the connections between a biofilm’s surface morphology and its mechanical and material properties suggest that new genes and/or new compounds that alter biofilm morphology by altering mechanics could be discovered and investigated to address biofilm-related problems. Morphological patterns can certainly involve gene regulation programs. Nonetheless, we expect our mechanical instability findings in V. cholerae biofilms to apply to other systems — from bacteria to humans — because they reveal links between the specific material properties of the biological components and morphological transitions. Regarding bacterial systems, we have already commented on how localized cell death underpins pattern formation at the core of Bacillus subtilis biofilms ( Asally et al., 2012 ). In fact, in light of our mechanomorphogenesis model, localized cell death can be viewed as a source of surface defects that functions to trigger delaminations, similar to the defined surface imperfections that drive delaminations shown in Figure 3E. Another example concerns biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen ( Costerton et al., 1999 ). WT P. aeruginosa develops biofilms with a labyrinthine inner pattern surrounded by flat rims ( Madsen et al., 2015 ). By contrast, P. aeruginosa mutants that are incapable of phenazine production ( Δphz ) form biofilm topography similar to those that we examined here for V. cholerae with disordered cores surrounded by radial features ( Dietrich et al., 2013 )

Our central hypothesis is that biofilm morphogenesis is driven by mechanical instabilities that arise from the growth mismatch between an expanding biofilm and the non-growing substrate to which it adheres. To garner evidence for this idea, we grew biofilms on agar plates, which enabled us to control the mechanical properties of the substrate by changing the agar concentration ( Nayar et al., 2012 ). We employed a commonly used Vibrio cholerae strain that lacks motility and constitutively produces biofilms ( Beyhan and Yildiz, 2007; Yan et al., 2017 ). This strain ( denoted WT in the present work ) produces biofilms that have disordered cores decorated with radial features extending to the rims ( Figure 1A ). Indeed, biofilm surface morphology changes with increasing agar concentration: the spacing between the peripheral, radial features is reduced and their amplitudes become more homogeneous ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Encouraged by the observations described above and inspired by models developed to describe mechanical instabilities in abiotic materials systems ( Li et al., 2012 ), here we propose a mechanomorphogenesis model for biofilms ( Figure 1B ). The biofilm originates as a flat film. Its volume increases over time due to cell proliferation and matrix production. If the biofilm were not attached to a substrate, it would grow into a stress-free state to cover a large area ( Figure 1B, top, ‘virtual state’ ). However, the non-expanding agar substrate constrains biofilm expansion. Thus, biofilms are always subject to compressive stress ( Figure 1B, middle right ), which we hypothesize drives the surface morphology. Indeed, a biofilm growing at an air–liquid interface, not limited or compressed by a substrate, exhibits no surface features ( Video 1 ). According to mechanical instability theories, surface-adhered films under compression have several pathways to release compressive stress ( Wang and Zhao, 2015 )

., 2013 ). We suggest that the mechanical principles uncovered here could also drive the morphological transitions in P. aeruginosa biofilms. The WT P. aeruginosa biofilm pattern occurs because cells at the biofilm center display upregulated matrix production ( Madsen et al., 2015 ), whereas cells located at the periphery are downregulated for matrix production. In the case of the Δphz mutant, all of the cells overproduce extracellular polysaccharides ( Madsen et al., 2015 ), so we speculate that the Δphz P. aeruginosa mutant forms peripheral radial wrinkles and subsequently delaminations because of the same mechanical instability described here in V. cholerae. These examples illustrate how gene regulation and spatially differentiated cell physiology can be coupled to mechanical instability to promote biofilm surface morphologies. Recent theoretical work on bacterial biofilms has considered mechanical instabilities. Zhang et al. ( 2016 ) used simulations to suggest that anisotropic growth coupled with wrinkling instability could generate the surface topography observed in bacterial biofilms, and most recently they considered the possibility of delamination ( Zhang et al., 2017 ). Wang and Zhao ( 2015 ) introduced competition between adhesive and elastic energies and computed a phase diagram of the different modes of instability for a film–substrate system. These inspiring theories will be made more valuable by the inclusion of measured biophysical parameters and additional observations generated through experiments. For example, the thin intermediate residual layer that we discovered here is not accurately considered in biofilm simulations, but is required to explain the wrinkling instability in biofilms ( Figure 2D ). In addition, interfacial energies play a predominant role in driving the morphologies of biological materials that possess soft layers, whereas their roles are minor in classical mechanical systems ( Qi et al., 2011 )

., 1999; Drescher et al., 2013 ) because they are resistant to physical perturbations and to antibiotics ( Kovach et al., 2017; Meylan et al., 2018 ). Biofilms on surfaces undergo morphogenic transformations, beginning as smooth colonies and, over time, developing complex morphological features ( Beyhan and Yildiz, 2007 ). Genes specifying matrix components that enable polysaccharide production, cell-surface adhesion, and cell–cell adhesion are required for the morphological transition ( Hobley et al., 2015 ). However, the underlying mechanisms that dictate how these biofilm matrix components direct overall morphology are not well-understood. One model focuses on the differential spatial regulation of genes encoding matrix components as the key driver of biofilm morphogenesis ( Okegbe et al., 2014 ). Another model suggests that localized cell death serves as an outlet for mechanical stresses and thus determines biofilm morphology ( Asally et al., 2012 ). Most recently, theory has been put forward to suggest the possibility that global mechanical instabilities are involved in the development of biofilm morphology ( Zhang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017 ). Here, by combining quantitative imaging, biomaterial characterization, mutant analyses, and mechanical theory, we show that the mismatch between the growing biofilm layer and the non-growing substrate causes mechanical instabilities that enable the biofilm to transition from a flat to a wrinkled film, and subsequently to a partially detached film containing delaminated blisters. The sequential instabilities that the film undergoes, coupled with the generation and annihilation of interfaces, drive the evolution of biofilm topography. Our results demonstrate that bacterial biofilms provide a uniquely tractable system for the quantitative investigation of mechanomorphogenesis.

. For example, the film can buckle out of the growth plane and deform together with the substrate into a periodically wrinkled pattern ( Figure 1B, bottom left ). In this mode, the compressive stress is released by film bending and substrate deformation. Alternatively, the film can directly delaminate from the substrate to form ‘blisters’ ( Figure 1B, bottom right ) ( Vella et al., 2009 ), leaving the substrate essentially undeformed. An extra interfacial energy penalty is paid for delamination because new interfaces are generated, so direct delamination occurs in systems with film–substrate adhesion energies that are much smaller than their elastic deformation energies. Biofilms possess finite adhesion strength ( ~ 5 mJ/m2 ), which is much smaller than the elastic modulus of the substrate ( ~100 MPa ), so delamination is energetically favorable. The interfacial energy also drives the annihilation of existing interfaces, such as those between the biofilm and the substrate ( Figure 1C ), which is energetically favorable because it reduces the total interfacial energy of the system. The interfac energy is a driving force for mechanorphogenesis because it dictates the generation of new and annihilation of interfaces. The interfac energy between the biofilm and the substrate drives delamination ( Figure 1, bottom right ) and the interfac between the bio and air drives wrinkling ( Figure 1, bottom ). The interfac energy between the bio and the substrate drives delamination ( Figure 1, bottom ) and the inter between bio and air drives wrinkling ( Figure 1, bottom ) The interfac energy between bio and substrate drives delamination ( Figure 1, bottom ) and inter bio and air drives wrinkling ( Figure, bottom ) The interfac between bio and substrate drives delamination ( Figure, bottom ) and bio and air wrinkling ( Figure, ) The interfac between bio and drives delamination ( Figure, bottom ) and air wrink ( Figure, ) The inter between bio and drives delamination (, bottom ) and wrink ( bottom ) The interfac bio drives delamination ( bottom ) and wrink ( bottom The interfac drives delamination bottom and wrink The interfac drives delamination and wrink The inter drives delamination and wrink The inter delamination and wrink The delamination and The delamination and delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination delamination

    Title: The transcription factor NRSF contributes to epileptogenesis by selective repression of a subset of target genes
    Abstract: The mechanisms generating epileptic neuronal networks following insults such as severe seizures are unknown. We have previously shown that interfering with the function of the neuron-restrictive silencer factor ( NRSF/REST ), an important transcription factor that influences neuronal phenotype, attenuated development of this disorder. In this study, we found that epilepsy-provoking seizures increased the low NRSF levels in mature hippocampus several fold yet surprisingly, provoked repression of only a subset ( ∼10% ) of potential NRSF target genes. Accordingly, the repressed gene-set was rescued when NRSF binding to chromatin was blocked. Unexpectedly, genes selectively repressed by NRSF had mid-range binding frequencies to the repressor, a property that rendered them sensitive to moderate fluctuations of NRSF levels. Genes selectively regulated by NRSF during epileptogenesis coded for ion channels, receptors, and other crucial contributors to neuronal function. Thus, dynamic, selective regulation of NRSF target genes may play a role in influencing neuronal properties in pathological and physiological contexts.

   . In this study, we used large-scale transcriptome arrays, qPCR validation, chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ), and gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) to examine the basis of NRSF-dependent gene expression changes during epileptogenesis. Surprisingly, a twofold to threefold increase of NRSF levels, induced by epilepsy-provoking seizures, led to repression of only a subset of potentially regulated genes, and these were rescued by interfering with NRSF function. Unexpectedly, genes found to be regulated by NRSF were characterized by mid-range NRSF-binding probabilities during the naive state. This moderate baseline binding enabled a significant increase of NRSF binding to these genes upon modest increases in NRSF tissue levels. NRSF-regulated hippocampal genes included ion channels, receptors, calcium-related molecules, and other transcription factors that govern neuronal function and plasticity, suggesting that their repression might contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy.

The key findings of these studies are: ( 1 ) NRSF contributes to epileptogenesis by regulating a group of genes that critically influence neuronal function; ( 2 ) whereas hundreds of hippocampal genes are potential NRSF targets because they contain NRSEs, only a few dozen are actually repressed by the transcription factor in the context of seizure-induced epilepsy as evident from their rescue when the function of NRSF is blocked; ( 3 ) the basis of the selective regulation of a subset of NRSE-containing genes includes the mid-range binding frequencies of these genes to the repressor, so that moderate fluctuations in NRSF levels influence the degree of their binding to the repressor. Whereas these findings were observed in the context of epileptogenesis, a neuroplasticity that leads to disease, they may apply to a broad spectrum of physiological and pathological activity-dependent plasticities in the mature hippocampus. NRSF is a transcription factor with protean effects. Whereas much is known about the role of this molecule in non-neuronal tissues and in neuronal differentiation, much less information is available about the function of NRSF in mature brain ( Korosi et al., 2010; McClelland et al., 2011b ). More recently, a protective role of NRSF has been proposed in aging and dementia ( Lu et al., 2014 ). In addition, NRSF may be involved in neurological disorders including Huntington disease ( Zuccato et al., 2007; Soldati et al., 2011 ) and stroke ( Calderone et al., 2003; Kaneko et al., 2014 ). The contribution of NRSF to epilepsy and its development ( epileptogenesis ) is currently the focus of intense study ( Roopra et al., 2012; Goldberg and Coulter 2013; Pozzi et al., 2013 ). We previously found that interfering with NRSF binding to the chromatin-attenuated epileptogenesis. Interestingly, Hu et al

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01267. 005 Consistent with the low baseline levels of NRSF in naive hippocampus, preventing the binding of the repressor to target genes had little effects on the expression of most of the 39 genes ( compare “random ODN” and NRSE–ODN columns in the control brain, left side of Figure 3B ). Of the 39 NRSE-containing genes that were repressed by seizures in the presence of random ODNs, ( depicted in blue in Figure 3B ) the majority ( 28 ) were no longer significantly repressed when NRSF binding to target genes was inhibited ( compare the [KA-seizures + NRSE ODN] group to either of the control groups; Figure 3B ). These microarray data supported the idea that in mature hippocampus a twofold to threefold change in NRSF levels influenced the expression of only a subset of putative NRSF target genes and this repression required binding of NRSF to the chromatin. To examine the validity of the microarray data supporting this observation, we performed qPCR on a subset of genes to confirm both their seizure-induced repression as well as their ‘rescue’ by NRSE-ODN administration ( Figure 3C ). We next examined the microarray data by performing qPCR analysis of a subset of NRSE-containing genes that were found to be repressed on the array and a second subset of genes whose expression was not altered on the array following KA-seizures ( Figure 4A, B ). These qPCR analyses revealed excellent correlation with the microarray and both methods distinguished between the NRSE-containing genes that were or were not repressed by seizures. 10. 7554/eLife. 01267. 006Figure 4. qPCR validation of microarray results.

This was not surprising, because these genes included ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, calcium-dependent effectors, and phosphoenzymes ( Pernhorst et al., 2011; Dingledine, 2012; Rodenas-Ruano et al., 2012; Maslarova et al., 2013 ). Whereas NRSF-mediated repression might theoretically involve hundreds of hippocampal NRSE-containing genes, it was intriguing to discover that in fact only a small subset of detected NRSE-containing genes were repressed by seizures. Most were rescued by blocking NRSF function—as evident using a differential array that included control and insult groups as well as groups where NRSF function was blocked—thus ascertaining that genes that are repressed during epileptogenesis are indeed repressed by the augmented levels of endogenous NRSF. To our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating the specificity of NRSF-mediated gene regulation in mature hippocampus in vivo. What might be the basis for the apparent selectivity of NRSF repression of only a minority of putative target genes? The binding of NRSF to a gene is required ( though not always sufficient; [Belyaev et al., 2004] ) for its repression. A number of mechanisms may influence both the degree of NRSF binding as well as the degree of its repressive effect on genes. These include the specific NRSE sequence ( Mortazavi et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2007 ) that is unlikely to be the cause in the current studies ( Supplementary file 1A ). Other important mechanisms include the interaction of NRSF with co-factors ( Andres et al., 1999; Naruse et al., 1999; Wood et al., 2003; Gao et al., 2011 ), as well as additional, still enigmatic effects of the chromatin environment of individual genes ( Belyaev et al

., 2004 ), which might be influenced by ‘super-enhancers’ ( Lovén et al., 2013; Whyte et al., 2013 ). Here, we examined the binding of NRSF to hippocampal genes before and after an epilepsy-provoking insult and found significant increment in genes that were repressed by the factor. This suggested a correlation between repressor occupancy and gene repression ( Hammar et al., 2014 ). To our surprise, basal binding of NRSF in regulated hippocampal genes was moderate. By contrast, most non-regulated genes had either high or low NRSF occupancy in naive hippocampus, suggesting that moderate NRS binding is a prerequisite for the repression of a subset of NR-containing genes during epileptogenesis. The moderate binding of NRS to a subset of NR-containing genes in naive hippocampus may explain why only a subset of these genes are repressed in response to increased NRS levels during epileptogenesis. The moderate binding of NRS to a subset of NR-containing genes in naive hippocampus may explain why only a subset of these are repressed in response to increased NRS levels during epileogenesis. The moderate binding of NRS to a subset of NR-containing in naive hippocampus may explain why only a subset are repressed in response to increased NRS during epileogenesis. The moderate binding of NRS to subset of NR-containing in naive hippoc may explain why only subset are repressed in response to NRS during epileogenesis The moderate binding of NRS to subset NR-containing in naive hippoc may explain why only subset repressed in response NRS during epileogenesis The moderate binding of N to subset NR-containing in naive hippoc may explain only subset repressed in response N during epileogenesis The binding of N to subset NR-containing naive may explain only repressed in response N during The binding of N to NR in naive may only repressed in response The binding of to NR may only re in The binding to may only re The binding may only re
Researchers investigated the parallel pathways formed by mitral and tuft cells in the olfactory system of mice and characterized the emergence of feature selectivity in these types via lateral inhibitory circuits. They found differences in activity-dependent lateral inhibition between mitral and tuft cells likely reflect differences in activation of deep and superficial granule cells. Simulations showed these circuit differences allow mitral and tuft cells to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges, indicating segregating information about different stimulus intensity may be a function of parallel pathways.

The study identified a novel mechanism for differential responses across parallel pathways formed by mitral and tuft cells in the olfactory system and examined the emergence of feature selectivity. They found differences in activity-dependent lateral inhibition reduce firing in mitral cells and low firing in tuft cells. Evidence suggests these effects are caused by differences in excitability of granule cells that preferentially inhibit tuft versus mitral cells. Simulations showed differences in effective range lateral inhibition, along with intrinsic differences between mitral and tuft cells, cooperatively enable them to discriminate between odors in separate ranges. The combination of mitral and tuft cells facilitates discrimination across odor concentrations.

The activity-dependent lateral inhibition depends on three populations: presynaptic tuft cells associated with the glomerulus, inhibitory interneurons, and postsynaptic tuft cells. Optogenetic stimulation of a targeted glomer elicits larger and asynchronous inhibitory currents in nearby mitral cells than tuft. This paradigm inhibits spiking differently in mitral and tuft cells, with mitral affected at intermediate rates and tuft at low rates. This difference arises from differential recruitment of morphologically distinct granule cells by mitral and tuft. Simulations explored circuit differences between mitral tuft influence odor discrimination, showing combination of activity lateral inhibition at low and intermediate rates enables tuft and mitral to encode odors better than either alone.

The study suggests parallel processing may offer benefits in other sensory systems where intensities vary over orders of magnitude. Similarities between olfactory and visual systems indicate mechanisms behind processing may be shared. In retina, selectivity in ganglion cells emerges from connectivity to bipolar and amacrine cells. In olfactory, selectivity in mitral and tuft cells emerges from connectivity to olfactory sensory neurons, tuft cells, and granule cells. Combining specific features in channels allows new to emerge. Brain systems use parallel to encode components, motion and color in visual, location and tonal in auditory, and pain and itch in somatosensory.

    Title: Allosteric modulation in monomers and oligomers of a G protein-coupled receptor
    Abstract: The M2 muscarinic receptor is the prototypic model of allostery in GPCRs, yet the molecular and the supramolecular determinants of such effects are unknown. Monomers and oligomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor therefore have been compared to identify those allosteric properties that are gained in oligomers. Allosteric interactions were monitored by means of a FRET-based sensor of conformation at the allosteric site and in pharmacological assays involving mutants engineered to preclude intramolecular effects. Electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of allostery at the atomic level were examined in molecular dynamics simulations. Allosteric effects in monomers were exclusively negative and derived primarily from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Allosteric effects in oligomers could be positive or negative, depending upon the allosteric-orthosteric pair, and they arose from interactions within and between the constituent protomers. The complex behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations.

    Supporting Text:
    Allostery at the M2 muscarinic receptor generally has been understood in terms of interactions within a monomer ( Christopoulos et al., 2002 ), but that view disregards the tendency of GPCRs to form oligomers ( Park et al., 2004 ). Moreover, the oligomeric nature of the M2 receptor is evident in the multiphasic effects of allosteric ligands on the dissociation rate of orthosteric antagonists and their binding at equilibrium ( Shivnaraine et al., 2012 ) ( e. g., Figure 1 ). Such effects appear to involve at least four allosteric sites in a mix of intra- and intermolecular heterotropic interactions within a complex of receptors that is tetrameric or larger ( Shivnaraine et al., 2012 ). We show here that all such complexity is lost when the M2 receptor is purified as a monomer ( Figure 1 ). Gallamine and strychnine were strictly inhibitory in their effect on the binding of [3H]NMS and [3H]QNB, and the rate of dissociation of [3H]QNB was decreased at all concentrations of gallamine. In each case, the dose-dependence was monophasic with a Hill coefficient of 1. Ligands therefore bind to monomers in the manner expected for a protein with one allosteric site and one orthosteric site, in contrast to the behavior of M2 receptors in myocardial membranes and unprocessed solubilized preparations. With either gallamine or strychnine, the potency defined by the single phase observed with monomers is similar to that defined by the weakest of the two or three components of the multiphasic curves observed with oligomers. It follows that effects associated with allosteric sites of higher affinity are a property of oligomers and derive from intermolecular interactions among the constituent protomers. They include the positive effect of gallamine on the rate of dissociation of [3H]QNB ( Figure 1C ) and varied effects on the binding of [3H]NMS at equilibrium: namely, negative cooperativity at sites of high affinity for gallamine ( Figure 1D; log K1 = −5

. Taken together, the results indicate that intramolecular interactions—i. e., between two sites on a monomer or on the same protomer of an oligomer—are dominated by electrostatic repulsion and result in low-affinity negative modulation by the allosteric ligand. Intermolecular interactions—i. e., between two sites on neighboring protomers of an oligomer—result in high-affinity allosteric modulation that may be positive or negative, depending upon the constraints associated with ligand-binding and the nature and extent of conformational changes transmitted between protomers. The results provide a direct demonstration of how allosteric effects characteristic of M2 receptors arise from interactions between the constituent protomers of an oligomer.

. Ligand-dependent changes in FRET between FlAsH and mCherry therefore appear to result from changes in the position of ECL2-bound FlAsH. Finally, NMS increased the FRET efficiency by 20 percentage points. Such a change is consistent with the predictions of molecular dynamics simulations for the effect of NMS on the width of the vestibule to the orthosteric site ( Figure 5—source data 1 ) ( Dror et al., 2013 ). Allosteric and orthosteric ligands may interact via steric hindrance, conformational changes, or electrostatic effects. In the structure computed for a monomeric M2 receptor, the interaction between gallamine or strychnine on the one hand and NMS or QNB on the other is dominated by electrostatic repulsion ( Figure 4, Table 1 ). That explains why gallamine and strychnine were inhibitory in their effect on the binding of [3H]NMS to purified monomers ( Figure 1B and C ), and it suggests a molecular basis for the weak affinities of both ligands in those assays. It also suggests that electrostatic repulsion dominates intramolecular cooperativity between allosteric and orthosteric ligands within the constituent protomers of an oligomer. The molecular dynamics simulations place each allosteric ligand at the extracellular surface, where it caps the vestibule to the orthosteric site and sterically hinders passage of the orthosteric antagonist ( Figure 4 ). This arrangement is consistent with crystallographic data on the location of a positive allosteric modulator, LY2119620 ( Kruse et al., 2013 ), and with the kinetics of allosteric modulation. A kinetically defined model that describes capping in a monomeric receptor ( Figure 6 ) predicts that the rate at which the system equilibrates will depend upon the order in which the ligands are added to the receptor ( Figure 1E–G )

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors contain an orthosteric site and a topographically distinct allosteric site ( Kruse et al., 2014; May et al., 2007 ). The latter is located at the extracellular surface within a vestibule to the orthosteric site ( Kruse et al., 2013 ), and that region shows comparatively low sequence homology among the five muscarinic subtypes ( M1–M5 ). The allosteric site therefore is more subtype-specific than the orthosteric site, and allosteric ligands are increasingly of interest for their therapeutic potential ( Kenakin2004 ). Owing to the early demonstration of allosteric interactions in muscarinic systems ( Clark et al., 1976; Stockton et al., 1983 ) and the variety of available modulators ( May et al., 2007 ), the M2 muscarinic receptor has been a prototype for such effects within the broader family of G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ). Most studies of the interaction of an allosteric ligand with the allosteric site have been based on the modulation of events at the orthosteric site, typically on receptors in native membranes or detergent-solubilized extracts. Such events may be measured directly, as in the binding of a radiolabeled antagonist ( Christopoulos et al., 2002 ), or they may be inferred from functional consequences such as the turnover of [35S]GTPγS ( May et al., 2007 ). They also may be positive or negative ( May et al., 2007 ), and the data generally have been described in terms of interactions between two binding sites on a monomeric receptor ( Christopoulos et al., 2002 ). In the case of the M2 receptor, an atomic-level view of the interaction within a monomer has emerged recently from the crystallography-derived structure of a biliganded receptor ( Kruse et al., 2013 ) and from inferences based on molecular dynamics simulations ( Dror et al., 2013 )

. Direct evidence for interactions between the protomers of an oligomer has been obtained by precluding intramolecular effects in studies involving the FRET-based sensor and the binding of [3H]NMS, and molecular dynamics simulations have provided some insight into the underlying conformational effects. Taken together, the results suggest that intermolecular interactions are associated with narrowing of the vestibule and conformational flexibility around the aromatic cap. Such an arrangement would allow an allosteric ligand to bind with high affinity to protomers with a vacant orthosteric site and thereby to increase the binding of an orthosteric ligand to linked protomers with a vacant allosteric site. The role of oligomers formed by GPCRs of Family 1A is debated, in part because oligomers are not seen to possess a unique or obligatory functionality. Both monomers and oligomers can activate G proteins, and both display allosteric communication between agonists at the receptor and guanylyl nucleotides at the G protein ( Redka et al., 2014 ). In the case of the M2 muscarinic receptor, however, oligomeric behavior is evident in the multiphas effects of alloster ligands on the dissociation rate of orthost antagonists and their binding equilibrium ( Shivaine et al,2012 ). Such effects appear to involve at least four alloster sites in a mix intra- and intermolecular heterotropic interactions within a complex of receptors that is tetram or larger (Shivaine et al,2012 ). We show that such complexity is lost when the M receptor is purified as mon ( Figure 1 ). Gallamine and strchn were inhibitory in effect on the binding of [H]N and [HNB and the rate dissociation of [HNB was decreased at concentrations gall in each case the dependence was monhas with a Hill of 1 Lig therefore bind mon in the manner expected a protein with alloster site and orthost site in contrast the behavior M receptors myocardial and unprocessedubil preparations with either gall or strchn the potency defined single observed mon is similar that defined the weakest of the two three components the multiphas observed olig. It follows that effects associated alloster sites higher are property olig and from interm interactions among prot. They include the effect gall on rate dissociation [HNB Figure C and effects binding [N at equilibrium namely cooperativity sites high gall Figure D log =−5

The final answer is: 

The study investigated the molecular and supramolecular determinants of alloster effects in the M2 muscarinic receptor, a prototypic model of allosteric GPCRs. Monomers and oligomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor were compared to identify alloster properties gained in oligomers. Alloster interactions were monitored by FRET sensor conformation at alloster site and pharmacological assays involving mutants to exclude intramolecular effects. Electrostatic, steric, and conformation determinants alloster at atomic level were examined in molecular simulations. Alster effects monomers were exclusively negative and derived from intram electrostatic repulsion between alloster and orthost ligands. Alster effects oligomers could be positive or negative, depending alloster-orth pair, and arose from interactions within and between constituent protomers. The behavior of oligomers characteristic musinic receptors myocardial preparations.

    Title: SETD2 is required for DNA double-strand break repair and activation of the p53-mediated checkpoint
    Abstract: Histone modifications establish the chromatin states that coordinate the DNA damage response. In this study, we show that SETD2, the enzyme that trimethylates histone H3 lysine 36 ( H3K36me3 ), is required for ATM activation upon DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ). Moreover, we find that SETD2 is necessary for homologous recombination repair of DSBs by promoting the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments. In agreement, SETD2-mutant clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) cells displayed impaired DNA damage signaling. However, despite the persistence of DNA lesions, SETD2-deficient cells failed to activate p53, a master guardian of the genome rarely mutated in ccRCC and showed decreased cell survival after DNA damage. We propose that this novel SETD2-dependent role provides a chromatin bookmarking instrument that facilitates signaling and repair of DSBs. In ccRCC, loss of SETD2 may afford an alternative mechanism for the inactivation of the p53-mediated checkpoint without the need for additional genetic mutations in TP53.

   . Our data further reveal that SETD2 is required for the recruitment of RAD51 to resected DNA 5′ ends and SETD2-depleted cells show reduced homology-directed repair of DSBs. SETD2 mutations were recently found in several cancers, such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) ( Dalgliesh et al., 2010; Duns et al., 2010; Varela et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012; Fontebasso et al., 2013; Joseph et al., 2014 ). In ccRCC, the p53-mediated cell cycle checkpoint is frequently inactivated despite the fact that the TP53 tumor suppressor gene is rarely mutated ( Gurova et al., 2004; Dalgliesh et al., 2010; Sato et al., 2013 ). This puzzling observation suggests that the p53 signaling in ccRCC might be repressed by an alternative mechanism. Herein, we further investigated whether the role of SETD2 in the DDR extends to the regulation of the p53-mediated checkpoint. We show that ccRCC cells carrying inactivating mutations on SETD2 phenocopy the impaired DDR observed in SETD2 RNAi-depleted human cells. Importantly, SETD2 inactivation severed the p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint despite the persistence of unrepaired DNA lesions in ccRCC cells. We propose that this unprecedented role of SETD2 in the DDR constitutes a novel tumor suppressor mechanism that could explain the high frequency of SETD2 mutations found in several cancers and may provide an alternative mechanism for evasion of the p53-mediated checkpoint in TP53 wt ccRCC cells.

. 3 at DSBs and facilitates RAD51 recruitment and efficient HR repair. Nevertheless, the major impact of SETD2 on RNA polymerase II transcription and pre-mRNA processing that others and we have previously described ( reviewed in de Almeida and Carmo-Fonseca, 2014 ) discloses the alternative possibility that the impaired formation of RAD51 filaments and HR may result from disrupted gene expression of key DNA repair factors. Hence, additional studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanistic basis of the SETD2 impact on the DDR. Unlike all histone modifications found to promote the DDR, previous studies ( Pei et al., 2011 ) and our data show no evidence of increased H3K36me3 levels at the DNA damage sites or of a DDR-dependent recruitment of SETD2 to DSBs. These findings disclose an unprecedented role for a histone-modifying enzyme in priming intact chromatin for the response to DNA damage. A model that emphasizes the regulation of the H3K36me3 accessibility as a major determinant of the DDR can be envisaged. According to this view, the conformational changes that occur after a DSB may cause exposure of H3K36me3 marks previously written by SETD2 in intact chromatin, for instance during transcription by RNA polymerase II or replication. In fact, a careful inspection of the nucleosome structure reveals that lysine 36 on the N-terminal tail of histone H3 does not protrude from the nucleosome core. Instead, this lysine is hidden by the DNA double strand that wraps the histone octameric core ( Luger et al., 1997 ). This sheltered location was first described three decades ago, when Crane–Robinson et al. investigated the accessibility of the histone-terminal domains to proteases. Their experiments revealed that while the first 26 N-terminal residues of histone H3 were greatly sensitive to trypsin digestion, H3K36 was resistant to the enzyme ( Bohm et al., 1981 )

., 2008 ). Furthermore, in the absence of SETD2, the capacity for clonogenic survival following DNA damage is significantly reduced. These findings integrate SETD2 into the p53 regulatory network and provide a reasonable explanation for the intriguing observation that inactivation of this master regulator of cell cycle checkpoints in ccRCC is rarely caused by mutations in TP53 ( Gurova et al., 2004; Dalgliesh et al., 2010; Sato et al., 2013 ). A plethora of recent studies have revealed that mutation rates and genomic instabilities in cancer are directly related to aberrant histone modifications and chromatin organization, underscoring the importance of the histone code in maintaining genome stability ( Lukas et al., 2011; Papamichos-Chronakis and Peterson, 2013 ). CcRCC is an example of a cancer, where a high rate of genomic alterations occurs in parallel to inactivating mutations and deletions of histone modifiers, such as SETD2 ( Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2013; Sato et al., 2013 ). The present study provides a functional link between these two events extending our understanding of the impact of altered chromatin states on the mechanisms that maintain genome integrity. Although it is now evident that alterations in histone modifications are a hallmark of most cancers, it is still unclear whether these changes are drivers or passengers of tumorigenesis ( Waldmann and Schneider, 2013 ). Our findings endorse the classification of SETD2 as a tumor suppressor and place inactivating mutations in this histone modifier at the peak of a harmful cascade of events that may ultimately drive malignant cell transformation and tumor development.

. Altogether, these findings further support the view that H3K36me3 contributes to the establishment of the chromatin state that coordinates the recruitment and activation of DDR factors, even though SETD2 is not actively recruited to DNA damage sites. The binding of 53BP1 to damaged chromatin tilts the balance between the DNA repair pathways towards NHEJ by preventing 5′ end resection of the broken DNA ends ( Bouwman et al., 2010; Bunting et al., 2010; Chapman et al., 2012 ). We therefore investigated whether SETD2 depletion favors DNA 5′ end resection and repair of DSBs by HR. To this end, we quantified the DNA in the vicinity of a DSB created by the I-SceI nuclease using the DR-GFP reporter assay ( Pierce et al., 1999; Moynahan and Jasin, 2010 ). Upon depletion of SETD2 by RNAi, the amount of DNA measured by quantitative real-time PCR at 250 bp, 300 bp, 350 bp and 2200 bp apart from the I-SceI site was only 53%, 62%, 57%, and 71%, respectively, of the DNA levels present in control cells ( Figure 3A ). These data reveal that ablation of SETD2 leads to persistent DNA 5′ end resection of DSBs. In agreement, phosphorylation of RPA ( pRPA ), an event that is directly linked to efficient DNA 5′ end resection ( Sartori et al., 2007 ), was detected in SETD2-depleted cells within the first hour after DNA damage with NCS and reached equilibrium after 6 to 8 hr, when its levels were similar to control cells ( Figure 3B ). Following DNA damage, the recruitment of RPA to DNA repair centers is revealed by the formation of repair-associated foci, a process that can be visualized by immunofluorescence ( Figure 3C ). At 8 hr after NCS treatment, widespread RPA foci were observed in the nuclei of both control and SETD2 RNAi cells, suggesting that recruitment of RPA to DNA lesion sites is independent of SETD2 activity. As expected, RPA foci were visible only in cyclin A-positive cells that are in S or G2 phase of the cell cycle ( Figure 3C )

., 1981 ). According to this ‘break and access model’ DNA damage exposes H3K36me3, which then contributes together with a set of well-defined histone modifications to the orchestration of the chromatin landscape that drives the initial recruitment and activation of DDR factors, such as 53BP1 and RAD51. In this view, SET2 is not required for the recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA damage sites, but rather for the establishment of the chromatin state that allows 53BP to bind ( Figure 4 ). Our data show that SET2 is required for the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments and homologous recombination repair of DSBs, but not for the recruitment of RAD51 to DSB sites ( Figure 4 ). These findings indicate that SET2 plays a role in the regulation of the chromatin state rather than in the recruitment of DDR factors to damage sites. This is in line with the observation that SET2 is not recruited to DNA damage sites and that H3K36me levels are not increased at DSBs ( Figure 4 ). Our data suggest that SET2 is required for the formation of RAD51 presaptic filaments and homologous recombination of DSB, but not for the recruitment of RAD51 to DSB ( Figure 4 ). These indicate that SET plays a role in the regulation of chromatin state rather than in the recruitment DDR to damage sites. This is in line with the observation that SET is not recruited to damage and H3me levels are not increased at Ds ( Figure 4 ) Our data suggest that SET is required for the formation RAD51 presynaptic filaments and homolog recombination of Ds but for the recruitment RAD to Ds ( Figure ) These indicate that plays a role in regulation chrom state rather in DDR sites This in with observation that is not recruited and Hme are not at ( Figure ) Our data suggest that is for the RAD presyn filaments and hom re of D but for recruitment to ( ) indicate a role in regulation rather than in sites This in with that is not and are not ( )

    Title: Rasgrp1 mutation increases naïve T-cell CD44 expression and drives mTOR-dependent accumulation of Helios+ T cells and autoantibodies
    Abstract: Missense variants are a major source of human genetic variation. Here we analyze a new mouse missense variant, Rasgrp1Anaef, with an ENU-mutated EF hand in the Rasgrp1 Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Rasgrp1Anaef mice exhibit anti-nuclear autoantibodies and gradually accumulate a CD44hi Helios+ PD-1+ CD4+ T cell population that is dependent on B cells. Despite reduced Rasgrp1-Ras-ERK activation in vitro, thymocyte selection in Rasgrp1Anaef is mostly normal in vivo, although CD44 is overexpressed on naïve thymocytes and T cells in a T-cell-autonomous manner. We identify CD44 expression as a sensitive reporter of tonic mTOR-S6 kinase signaling through a novel mouse strain, chino, with a reduction-of-function mutation in Mtor. Elevated tonic mTOR-S6 signaling occurs in Rasgrp1Anaef naïve CD4+ T cells. CD44 expression, CD4+ T cell subset ratios and serum autoantibodies all returned to normal in Rasgrp1AnaefMtorchino double-mutant mice, demonstrating that increased mTOR activity is essential for the Rasgrp1Anaef T cell dysregulation.

    Supporting Text:
    The findings here reveal a new role for Rasgrp1 in the cell-intrinsic regulation of peripheral CD4+ T cells. By analyzing a missense mutation in the Rasgrp1 EF-hand, the results dissociate this new function of Rasgrp1 from its well-known role in thymic positive selection. While the Anaef EF-hand mutation did decrease Rasgrp1 activation of Ras and ERK when thymocytes were stimulated acutely by antibodies to CD3 or with PMA in vitro, the activity of this pathway during physiological positive selection in vivo remained sufficient for normal numbers of single positive thymocytes and peripheral T cells to form even under competitive reconstitution conditions. T cell lymphopenia and sparse T cell repertoires secondary to defective positive selection potentially explain the autoantibodies observed in mice where Rasgrp1 is entirely absent or C-terminally deleted ( Dower et al., 2000; Coughlin et al., 2005; Priatel et al., 2007; Fuller et al., 2012 ), and in animals with missense mutations in ZAP-70 or LAT ( Aguado et al., 2002; Sommers et al., 2002; Sakaguchi et al., 2003; Siggs et al., 2007 ). By contrast, the normal thymic development coupled with experiments in mixed bone marrow chimeras where wild-type and mutant T cells co-exist rules out this possibility for the Rasgrp1Anaef mutation, and shows that peripheral CD4 cells are intrinsically dysregulated. By a combination of biochemical and genetic studies, we identify overactive mTOR signaling within naïve CD4 T cells as a key component for Rasgrp1Anaef to drive two abnormalities: ( 1 ) a constitutive increase in CD44 expression in naïve CD4 T cells and ( 2 ) a gradual accumulation of peripheral Helios+ CD44hi CD4 cells and autoantibodies. Rasgrp1Anaef’s effect on Ras/ERK signaling in vivo was much milder than expected from its effects in in vitro assays

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01020. 009 To test TCR-induced Ras-ERK signaling in thymocytes, we first stimulated thymocytes from wildtype or Rasgrp1Anaef mice with anti-CD3 crosslinking antibodies and probed lysates for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to examine the global biochemical effects of the Rasgrp1Anaef mutation. Both thymocyte populations demonstrated similar induction of total phospho-tyrosine patterns and similar activating phosphorylation of Lck and Zap-70 that lie upstream of Rasgrp1 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A ). Rasgrp1’s GEF activity is also enhanced by phosphorylation on T184 ( Roose et al., 2005; Zheng et al., 2005 ). Using a new monoclonal antibody specific for P-T184-Rasgrp1 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) we observed drastically impaired phosphorylation of T184-Rasgrp1, and reduced ERK phosphorylation in Rasgrp1Anaef thymocytes ( Figure 5A ). By contrast, Rasgrp1+/− thymocytes heterozygous for the null allele displayed readily detectable Rasgrp1- and ERK- phosphorylation ( Figure 5B ), demonstrating that the signaling defects in the Rasgrp1Anaef thymocytes are much greater than when the amount of Rasgrp1 is simply halved. Thymocyte subset-specific P-ERK analyses revealed reduced anti-CD3- and PMA-induced responses in DP, CD4SP, and CD8SP Rasgrp1Anaef thymocytes ( Figure 5C, Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ), echoing the cell line conclusion that the Anaef mutation results in a partial loss of function with respect to induced Ras-ERK signaling. When pressure was placed on TCR-Ras-ERK signaling for positive selection in vivo, by introducing any one of three different rearranged TCR transgenes that are prematurely expressed at higher than normal levels on DP thymocytes, a small decrease in positive selection was revealed in Rasgrp1Anaef TCR-transgenic thymocytes compared to their wildtype controls ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 )

. Given the emerging examples of missense alleles having very different immunological consequences from null alleles, mouse models that analyze the consequences of missense variants in key immune genes are needed to understand the pathogenesis of complex human immune diseases. Common tag SNVs near RASGRP1 are associated with susceptibility to autoimmune ( Type 1 ) diabetes and to thyroid autoantibodies in Graves’ disease ( Qu et al., 2009; Plagnol et al., 2011 ), while 13 unstudied RASGRP1 missense SNVs are currently listed in public databases. A fruitful approach for identifying missense gene variants that dysregulate immune function has been through N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea ( ENU ) mutagenesis ( Nelms and Goodnow, 2001 ). Here we describe the analysis of a novel ENU-induced missense variant, Rasgrp1Anaef that reveals an important in vivo regulatory function of Rasgrp1’s EF hands. Rasgrp1Anaef is distinct from previously described autoimmune mutations in Rasgrp1, Zap70 or Lat, as Rasgrp1Anaef has no detectable effect on thymocyte development in mice with normal TCR repertoires, but results in peripheral accumulation of a distinct population of Helios+ PD-1+ T-helper cells and production of anti-nuclear autoantibodies. In contrast to Rasgrp1 deletion, the Rasgrp1Anaef missense variant increases tonic mTOR signaling in naïve CD4+ T cells. Genetic reduction of mTOR function in Rasgrp1Anaef mice normalizes CD44 expression on naïve CD4+ T cells and abolishes excessive accumulation of effector T cells and autoantibodies, demonstrating a central role for increased mTOR activity in driving immune dysregulation in Rasgrp1Anaef mice.

. Because accumulation of PD-1+ HELIOS+ T cells in Rasgrp1Anaef mice requires B cells ( Figure 7 ), these T cells might require B cells as specialized APCs or they might require Fc receptor-dependent enhancement of antigen presentation by antibodies ( Silva et al., 2011 ). Given the huge number of missense variants in each person ( The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010 ), patients with autoimmune diseases are more likely to have point mutations in various genes than complete loss of gene expression. This new Rasgrp1Anaef mouse model adds to an emerging category of animal models with point mutations in TCR signaling proteins, along with Zap70skg ( Sakaguchi et al., 2003 ), Zap70murdock and Zap70mrtless hypomorphic alleles ( Siggs et al., 2007 ), LATY136F mice ( Aguado et al., 2002; Sommers et al., 2002 ), and Card11unmodulated mice ( Jun et al., 2003 ), where a partial deficit in T cell signaling precipitates autoimmunity or allergy. RASGRP1 splice variants have been documented for patients with SLE ( Yasuda et al., 2007 ) and abnormal microRNA-driven downregulation of Rasgrp1 expression may play a role in aberrant DNA methylation in Lupus CD4+ T cells ( Pan et al., 2010 ). In addition, RASGRP1-linked SNVs have been associated with autoimmune diabetes and thyroid disease ( Qu et al., 2009; Plagnol et al., 2011 ). Of the 13 uncharacterized RASGRP1 missense SNVs currently known, rs62621817 is of particular interest here since it causes a missense variation in RasGRP1’s first EF hand, changing the same residue mutated in RasgrpAna, and is associated with Graves’ disease ( Plol et al. 201 ).

    Title: Arid1a restrains Kras-dependent changes in acinar cell identity
    Abstract: Mutations in members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling family are common events in cancer, but the mechanisms whereby disruption of SWI/SNF components alters tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. To model the effect of loss of function mutations in the SWI/SNF subunit Arid1a in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) initiation, we directed shRNA triggered, inducible and reversible suppression of Arid1a to the mouse pancreas in the setting of oncogenic KrasG12D. Arid1a cooperates with Kras in the adult pancreas as postnatal silencing of Arid1a following sustained KrasG12D expression induces rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous PDAC precursor lesions. In contrast, Arid1a silencing during embryogenesis, concurrent with KrasG12D activation, leads to retention of acinar cell fate. Together, our results demonstrate Arid1a as a critical modulator of Kras-dependent changes in acinar cell identity, and underscore an unanticipated influence of timing and genetic context on the effects of SWI/SNF complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis.

    Supporting Text:
    Mutations in chromatin remodelers are prevalent across the human cancer spectrum, making identification of tissue specific relationships between chromatin regulation and tumorigenesis an important goal in understanding neoplastic progression. In this study, we used a rapid and robust mouse-modeling platform to study the consequences of inducible and reversible suppression of the Arid1a SWI/SNF subunit in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Suppression of Arid1a in adult acinar cells harboring oncogenic Kras mutations accelerates acinar to ductal reprogramming and specification of mucinous, pancreatic cancer precursor lesions that cannot be reversed by restoring endogenous Arid1a expression. Thus, our data suggest that Arid1a can provide a potent barrier to Kras driven acinar to ductal metaplasia and, consequently, early stage pancreatic neoplasia. Once disrupted by Arid1a mutation, these altered cells are reprogrammed in such a manner that Arid1a is no longer needed to sustain the aberrant cell fate. The phenotype produced by Arid1a depletion in the presence of an oncogenic Kras mutation is characterized by reduced chromatin accessibility accompanied by loss of acinar morphology, reduced expression of acinar genes, and upregulation of a signature characteristic of mucinous lesions. These features imply that genomic areas rendered accessible by Arid1a harbor elements involved in preventing acinar to duct like trans-differentiation in the context of mutant Kras, a critical rate-limiting step in Kras driven pancreatic neoplasia. Indeed, our transcriptional and chromatin profiling data imply that Arid1a disruption, in the presence of oncogenic Kras, reduces the chromatin accessibility of key TFs to the enhancers of genes needed to sustain acinar cell fate. At least one such factor, Nr5a2, can physically interact with the SWI/SNF complex via the Baf60 subunit ( Debril et al

., 2014a ). While a recent study employing conditional deletion of Arid1a in the pancreas also observed IPMN formation, PanIN formation was not suppressed, pointing towards distinct molecular consequences of targeting different SWI/SNF components ( Kimura et al., 2018 ). The striking predominance of PanINs over IPMNs in our model may be due to a dosage effect, where IPMN formation requires complete loss of Arid1a in ductal progenitors or ductal cells, while acinar cells expressing mutant Kras are more highly dependent on Arid1a to maintain their identity, and thus are rapidly reprogrammed to mucinous PanINs upon partial Arid1a suppression. This has important implications for human cancers, which exhibit a broad spectrum of Arid1a levels. Unlike our Arid1a suppression strategy, mouse models using conditional alleles necessarily disrupt SWI/SNF concomitantly with Kras activation. Indeed, when we recapitulate such timing during embryonic development, we see a lower level of PanIN formation with shArid1a pancreata showing the retention of acinar cells, that contrasts with the effects of sequential suppression of Arid1a in acinar cells harboring pre-existing expression of mutant Kras. While the distinct molecular consequences of different SWI/SNF component mutations may contribute to phenotypic variability in other aspects of PDAC progression, these observations indicate that the timing of SWI/SNF perturbation can have a dramatic effect on tumorigenesis phenotypes. Whether the temporal effects of SWI/SNF action are a consequence of developmental stage or priming events produced by the prior presence of activated Kras remains to be determined. In any case, it seems likely that one or both processes influences the transcription factor milieu and, accordingly, the specific consequences of SWI/SNF disruption ( Roy et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2017 )

. As expected, pancreata from mice withdrawn from dox retained expression of the mKate2 lineage marker, but lost the shRNA-linked GFP fluorescence signal ( Figure 5B ). Staining of tissues from KC-RIK-shRen and -shArid1a animals for Arid1a showed partial restoration of Arid1a by 5 days after withdrawal and full restoration at 2 and 4 weeks ( Figure 5C ). Despite this, histological assessment of KC-RIK-shRen and -shArid1a mice after dox withdrawal showed retention of widespread mucinous lesions as in the on dox condition, without a reversal of the PanIN phenotype towards an acinar or even ADM cell fate ( Figure 5D, E ). Alcian blue staining further confirmed the retention of mucinous lesions in Arid1a-restored mice ( Figure 5E ). Thus, Arid1a loss enables a non-reversible reprogramming of cell fate that is dependent on cellular and genetic context. We next sought to understand the mechanism ( s ) whereby Arid1a regulates pancreas cell identity. Perturbation of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex is expected to impact the expression of SWI/SNF target genes ( Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015 ). In order to capture the immediate transcriptional consequences of Arid1a silencing, we performed gene expression analysis via RNAseq on mKate2+GFP+ epithelial cells sorted from 3 KC-RIK-shRen, or shArid1a and mice after 5 days of dox treatment. This timepoint occurs after maximal Arid1a suppression but before any observed histological changes, thus reducing the confounding effect of secondary changes in gene expression resulting from tissue inflammation ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ). Principal component analysis of RNA-seq data indicated that the two shRNAs targeting Arid1a conferred a transcriptional profile distinct from that of the shRen animals, confirming these shRNAs triggered minimal off-target effects ( Figure 6A )

., 2004 ), suggesting a possible mechanism for aberrant Nr5a2 target deregulation upon Arid1a loss. Further studies will be necessary to determine the interplay between Nr5a2 and other acinar TFs that may underly the Arid1a-depletion phenotype. The accelerated PanIN formation produced by Arid1a suppression required the presence of a Kras mutation, the initiating event in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Thus, Arid1a suppression in the normal pancreas did not appreciably perturb acinar differentiation, even during wound healing responses that force a reversible acinar to ductal metaplasia. Apparently, Arid1a suppression sensitizes pancreatic epithelial cells to mucinous reprogramming by oncogenic Kras or, alternatively, increases the efficiency of Kras-induced acinar-to-ADM-to-PanIN transitions. Regardless, this Kras-dependence differs from the phenotype produced by deletion of acinar TFs such as Ptf1a or Nr5a2, whose loss generally perturbs acinar maintenance and/or regeneration ( Cobo et al., 2018; Flandez et al., 2014a; Krah et al., 2015; von Figura et al., 2014b ). We hypothesize that the potent and cooperative effects between oncogenic signaling and chromatin remodeling at eroding barriers to cellular plasticity contributes to the high frequency of SWI/SNF component inactivation in many cancer types. The enhanced PanIN phenotype observed in our model has intriguing differences and commonalities with other models harboring conditional deletions of different SWI/SNF components. Deletion of Brg1 during pancreatic development in conjunction with oncogenic Kras results in the formation of IPMN-like lesions contiguous with the native duct system that may derive from the ductal compartment rather than through ADM. Furthermore elimination of Brg1 in adult acinar cells prevents the development of Kras driven acinar to duct-like transdifferentiation and PanIN development ( von Figura et al., 2014a )

., 2015; von Figura et al., 2014a ). Thus, the role of various SWI/SNF complex components in tumor initiation and progression can be context dependent. As the SWI/S subunit Arid1 cooperates with oncogenic Kras in the pancreas to induce rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous PanIN lesions, our study highlights the importance of timing and genetic context in the effects of SW/S alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis.

    Title: Sexually dimorphic neuronal responses to social isolation
    Abstract: Many species use social networks to buffer the effects of stress. The mere absence of a social network, however, may also be stressful. We examined neuroendocrine, PVN CRH neurons and report that social isolation alters the intrinsic properties of these cells in sexually dimorphic fashion. Specifically, isolating preadolescent female mice from littermates for <24 hr increased first spike latency ( FSL ) and decreased excitability of CRH neurons. These changes were not evident in age-matched males. By contrast, subjecting either males ( isolated or grouped ) or group housed females to acute physical stress ( swim ), increased FSL. The increase in FSL following either social isolation or acute physical stress was blocked by the glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone. The increase in FSL results in a decrease in the excitability of CRH neurons. Our observations demonstrate that social isolation, but not acute physical stress has sex-specific effects on PVN CRH neurons.

    To test this idea, mice were housed in same-sex groups ( 3–5 animals per group ) from weaning ( p21 ) until the day of the experiment ( p22–35 ). This developmental window allows us to interrogate the contributions of sex differences independent of the effects of circulating gonadal hormones ( Nelson et al., 1990 ). Mice were either in same-sex groups, pairs, or isolated from littermates for sixteen to eighteen hours. We then prepared hypothalamic brain slices and examined synaptic and intrinsic properties of identified CRH neurons in the PVN in acute brain slices ( Wamsteeker Cusulin et al., 2013b ) ( Figure 1a ). Activation of these cells is obligatory for launching the neuroendocrine response to stress ( Denver, 2009 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 18726. 003Figure 1.

FSL in single females is significantly longer than group-housed females ( one-way ANOVA, p<0. 0001 ). FSL in group-housed females and males are not different ( p>0. 05 ).

FSL calculated from the start of the depolarizing pulse ( dotted line ) to the first spike is plotted for all cells in ( c ). The relative frequency distributions are overlaid by the relative cumulative distributions. ( d ) Traces show responses to the same depolarizing step protocol as in ( c ) but in group ( dark orange ) and single-housed ( light orange ) females

Our findings demonstrate that brief social isolation ( <24 hr ) affects the biophysical properties of PVN CRH neurons in a sexually dimorphic fashion. We report an increase in FSL and a decrease in neuronal excitability in socially-isolated female, but not in age-matched, male mice. By contrast, an acute physical stress ( swim ) increased FSL in group-housed females and single-housed males. In addition, social isolation occluded the effects of swim stress on female mice. CORT is both necessary for the isolation ( females ) and swim stress ( males and females ) induced increases in FSL and sufficient to increase FSL in the absence of stress. Finally, we noted the effect of social isolation was graded in female mice with paired mice exhibiting FSLs that were intermediate to those observed from group-housed or single mice. We examined the underlying conductance and report that it is sensitive to millimolar concentrations of 4-AP and insensitive to millimolar concentrations of TEA. In addition, FSL was profoundly sensitive to pre-hyperpolarizing pulses, which remove channel inactivation and make rapidly inactivating K channels available for opening in response to depolarizations. The features of these channels are consistent with Kv4 channels previously described in the PVN ( Lee et al., 2012 ). They do, however, exhibit a more hyperpolarized activation threshold in comparison to kinetically similar 4-AP sensitive channels reported in PVN parvocellular neurosecretory cells in rat ( Luther and Tasker, 2000 ). We failed to note any differences in overall current density or voltage-dependent activation or recovery from inactivation. We did, however, observe an increase in the decay time constant of rapidly inactivating K currents in socially-isolated female mice compared to male mice, providing a potential underlying mechanism for the prolonged FSL in response to depolarization

. 86; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). We also examined properties of glutamate and GABA synapses on CRH neurons in hypothalamic slices from single-housed females and males. We observed no differences in basal glutamate ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) or GABA ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) synaptic transmission. These observations indicate that social isolation alters the intrinsic properties of CRH neurons in female, but not age-matched male mice. Next, we hypothesized that female mice, but not male mice, may interpret social isolation as a stress. If true, we reasoned that subjecting single-housed male mice to an acute swim stress should also increase FSL. In females, however, the prior isolation should occlude the effects of an acute stress. To test this idea, single -housed male and female mice were subjected to swim stress for 20 min and intrinsic properties of CRH neurons were assessed ( Figure 2a ). Following swim stress, FSL in male mice ( maleswim ) was 64. 0 ± 4. 6 ms, n = 37, Figure 2b, c; this is significantly longer than FSL in the single males reported above ( maleswim vs malesingle, 1 way ANOVA, p=0. 0004 ). FSL in single female mice subjected to swim stress was 65. 8 ± 4. 9 ms, n = 32, Figure 2b, c; this is not different from FSL in female mice subjected to social isolation ( femaleswim vs femalesingle, p=0. 67 ). Finally, FSL in single males subjected to swim was not different from FSL in single females subjected to swim ( p=0. 9, Figure 2b, c ). This suggests that either increases in FSL following social isolation occlude further effects of stress on CRH neurons or that females do not respond to swim stress. To test the effects of swim stress independent of any potential effects of social isolation, we conducted experiments in which group-housed females and males were subjected to swim stress. Following swim, FSL in group-housed males ( malegroup swim: 58. 8 ± 2

Survival threats trigger a repertoire of behavioral and endocrine adjustments ( Cannon, 1932 ). The endocrine changes rely on the immediate engagement of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal ( HPA ) axis which is controlled by corticotropin releasing hormone ( CRH ) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus ( PVN ). Although it is essential for survival, the dysregulation of the stress response is implicated in the emergence of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases ( Tost et al., 2015 ). Interestingly, many of these psychopathologies show sex-specific differences which may be a consequence of sexual dimorphism of the neuroendocrine response to stress ( Bale and Epperson, 2015 ). This sexual dimorphism may result in different response sensitivity to the same stressor and/or differences in which stimuli males and females perceive as stressful. Human studies demonstrating that young girls exhibit greater corticosteroid ( CORT ) stress reactivity to social stress tests than boys ( Gunnar et al., 2009; de Veld et al., 2012 ) suggest, for example, that young females are more responsive to changes in social situations. Consistent with this idea, are demonstrations that, in comparison to males, females take greater advantage of social support and group dynamics to manage stress ( Taylor et al., 2000 ). Here we hypothesized that disrupting the social network would elicit neurobiological changes preferentially in female mice.

. These findings highlight the importance of carefully considering both the sex of the animal and the stressor modality when designing studies investigating neurobiological effects of stress. Indeed recent work demonstrating sex-specific expression of fear responses in rodents ( Gruene et al., 2015 ) serves as a corollary to our observations and when taken together suggests that strategies for coping with stress are sex-specific. In particular, our findings highlight the importance of a social network in females and provides a neurobiological basis for why females are more responsive to changes in social situations.

    Title: Evolutionary and functional insights into the mechanism underlying body-size-related adaptation of mammalian hemoglobin
    Abstract: Hemoglobin ( Hb ) represents a model protein to study molecular adaptation in vertebrates. Although both affinity and cooperativity of oxygen binding to Hb affect tissue oxygen delivery, only the former was thought to determine molecular adaptations of Hb. Here, we suggest that Hb affinity and cooperativity reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptions that optimized tissue oxygen delivery. To test this hypothesis, we derived the relationship between the Hill coefficient and the relative affinity and conformational changes parameters of the Monod-Wymann-Changeux allosteric model and graphed the ‘biophysical Hill landscape’ describing this relation. We found that mammalian Hb cooperativity values all reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity along this landscape that allows for both gross- and fine-tuning of tissue oxygen unloading to meet the distinct metabolic requirements of mammalian tissues for oxygen. Our findings reveal the mechanism underlying body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb. The generality and implications of our findings are discussed.

    Supporting Text:
   . For example, vertebrates native to mountain habitats where low ambient oxygen pressures prevail usually possess Hb that exhibits higher affinity for oxygen than does the Hb of lowland dwellers ( Lenfant, 1973; Bunn, 1980; Weber, 2007; Storz and Moriyama, 2008; Storz, 2016 ). Likewise, Hb in small-sized animals that display high metabolic rates presents lower affinity for oxygen than does the same protein in large-sized animals, again reflecting the adaptive adjustment of tissue oxygen unloading by Hb ( Schmidt-Neilsen and Larimer, 1958; Schmidt-Nielsen, 1970 ). Accordingly, early respiratory system physiologists assigned great significance to the p50 parameter, terming it ‘oxygen unloading tension’, and proposed that Hb function could be explained in terms of adaptive evolution of this value ( Schmidt-Neilsen and Larimer, 1958; Schmidt-Nielsen, 1970 ). At the same time, such studies ignored the adaptive potential of cooperativity ( nH ) with respect to Hb function. This is surprising, given that nH also affects Hb tissue oxygen delivery. Moreover, mechanisms underlying changes in p50, such as changes in oxygen affinity of the oxy- or deoxy-states of Hb, changes in the ratio between these states or changes in their sensitivity to allosteric effectors, are all also expected to affect nH. Indeed, the finding by Milo et al. ( 2007 ) that mammalian Hbs exhibit variations in the Hill cooperativity value hints at the adaptive potential of the nH trait. The need to also consider nH in addressing adaptation of Hb function becomes evident when we examine the implications of accepting the notion that molecular adaptation of Hb function in vertebrates relies primarily on its p50 affinity property

. e., across species ) variations allow for gross changes in Hb oxygen unloading sensitivity. Such changes are controlled by the maximum cooperativity and affinity values of Hb, in turn determined by changes in both L and c ( Figure 4c, filled symbols ). Fine-tuning changes in Hb oxygen unloading sensitivity may further be brought about by physiological variations within the buffering of cooperativity regime, this time, however, reflected in changes in L and p50 alone ( Figure 4c, open symbols ). The linear dependence between the metabolic rate of an animal and the maximum Hill value for Hb ( Figure 5c ), combined with the results presented in Figure 4c, indicates that nH, like p50, carries adaptive value with respect to mammalian Hb tissue oxygen unloading. As such, small body-sized animals presenting high metabolic rates require high oxygen supplies that can be more efficiently delivered by Hb presenting higher maximum Hill values. Considering that an animal’s metabolic rate is a trait related to organism fitness, we suggest that both the affinity and cooperativity traits of Hb represent low dimensional components of the fitness landscape, independent of other components. In this respect, the biophysical nH landscape of Hb can be regarded as a biophysical fitness landscape that serves to bridge the genotype-phenotype gap in assessing the relation between sequence variations in Hb ( that affect its affinity and cooperativity properties ) and their ensuing fitness effects ( Bershtein et al., 2017 ). Evolutionary tuning of mammalian Hb maximum cooperativity and affinity points, achieved by co-varying the relative affinity and conformational ratio of its quaternary states, thus regulates tissue oxygen delivery by Hb and serves as one mean to meet the distinct needs of different animal tissues for oxygen ( Figures 4 and 5 )

. The fact that different mammalian Hbs exhibit different maximum nH values ( Figure 2a ), combined with the observation made above whereby systematically higher maximum Hill value gives rise to higher sensitivities to substrate unloading by MWC proteins ( Figure 4c ), led us to hypothesize that the maximum cooperativity point of Hb has been tuned during evolution to satisfy the particular physiological requirements of different tissues for oxygen supply. We thus returned to the datasets comparing oxygen saturation of different mammalian Hbs ( all measured using similar methodology ) that revealed the linear correlation between animal metabolic rate and logp50 ( Schmidt-Neilsen and Larimer, 1958; Schmidt-Nielsen, 1970 ). We are aware that these data may not necessarily reflect functional effects on a single Hb form. Still, in cases where adult mammalian Hb expresses more than one variant, both usually present similar sequences and functional properties ( Storz, 2016 ). Rather than taking the affinity-centric approach employed in the earlier studies, we instead adopted a complementary cooperativity-centric mindset and re-fitted all of the saturation curves to the Hill equation to derive both nH and p50 values for Hb of each animal ( Figure 5a and Table 2 ). The derived nH values, although obtained under the slightly different physiological conditions typical of the blood of each animal, nevertheless correspond to maximum cooperativity values, as nH is relatively invariant to physiological changes around the maximum point ( Figures 2 and 3 ). This assertion is further strengthened by the results shown in Figure 5b describing the linear relation between affinity ( logp50 ) and cooperativity ( nH ), as expected for parameter values underlying maximum cooperativity ( Figure 4b )

. Given the inherent tradeoff between arterial O2 loading and peripheral O2 unloading, it is not clear whether improved tissue oxygen delivery is achieved by increased oxygen affinity to improve Hb loading or by decreased affinity to favor unloading ( Storz, 2016 ). Either very high or very low oxygen affinity would result in a low fraction of tissue oxygen delivery unless cooperativity ( nH ) between Hb subunits is introduced as a means to switch between low- and high-affinity Hb states. It would thus seem that the values of both p50 and nH of Hb should reflect physiological optimization of the tradeoff between O2 loading in the lungs and O2 unloading in tissues, so as to optimize tissue oxygen delivery. Although this is a seemingly obvious claim, it has yet to be tested experimentally. Here, we tested whether the values of both p50 and nH of Hb are indeed optimized in the case of body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb, relying on extensive evolutionary and physiological oxygen saturation datasets available for mammalian Hb proteins. The former comprises a set of oxygen binding curves of homologous Hb proteins from different mammalian species, all measured under similar physiological conditions ( Milo et al., 2007; Rapp and Yifrach, 2017 ). The latter comprises a set of binding curves of human Hb measured under a variety of different physiological conditions, that is, in the presence of different concentrations of H+, CO2 and organophosphate, all inhibitory allosteric ligands of Hb ( Rapp and Yifrach, 2017 ). For all data sets curves, reliable estimates for p50 and nH Hill parameters and for the elementary relative affinity ( c ) and conformational changes ( L ) parameters of the MWC concerted allosteric model ( Monod et al., 1965; Rubin and Changeux, 1966 ) are available

. Finally, plotting either the affinity ( ~log ( 1/p50 ) ) or cooperativity properties of Hb as a function of the logarithm of metabolic rate of an animal yielded linear correlations in both cases ( Figure 5c ). Specifically, the greater an animal’s metabolic rate, the higher was the observed maximum Hill cooperativity value of oxygen binding by Hb. Furthermore, as previously shown ( Schmidt-Neilsen and Larimer, 1958; Schmidt-Nielsen, 1970 ), an inverse linear correlation was found between the metabolic rate and Hb affinity. These empirical observations directly relate the maximum cooperativity and affinity properties of Hb to an organismal-level trait that is related to fitness ( Dykhuizen et al., 1987; Kacser and Burns, 1981; Bershtein et al., 2017 ).

Hemoglobin (H) is a protein that plays a crucial role in delivering oxygen to tissues in the body. While its affinity for oxygen and cooperativity affect oxygen delivery, only affinity was thought to determine adaptations of H. This study suggests that both affinity and cooperativity reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptations that optimize oxygen delivery. The relationship between the Hill coefficient and conformation parameters of the Monod-Wann-Change alloster model was derived and graphed to describe this relation. Mammalian H cooperativity values reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity that allows for both gross and fine-tuning of oxygen unloading to meet distinct tissue requirements. Findings reveal the mechanism of body-related adaptation of mammalian H. The generality of findings is discussed.

Studies show that vertebrates in low oxygen habitats have H with higher affinity than those in high habitats. Small animals with high metabolic rates have lower affinity than large animals. Respiratory physiologists assigned significance to p, terming it oxygen unloading, and proposed H could be explained by adaptive of this value. However, studies ignored potential of cooperativity with respect to H function. This is surprising given that n also affects oxygen delivery. Mechanisms of p, such as changes in oxy or de-states, ratio, or sensitivity to alloster effectors, affect n. Mammalian H exhibit variations in cooper value, hinting at adaptive potential of n.

The notion that adaptation of H function relies on affinity is examined. Across species, variations allow gross changes in sensitivity. Changes are controlled by maximum and values of H, determined by and. Fine changes in buffering regime, reflected in and alone. Dependence between metabolic rate and maximum value indicates n, like p, carries adaptive with respect to H tissue unloading. Small animals with high rates require high supplies that can be delivered by H presenting maximum values. Metabolic is related to fitness, suggesting both affinity and cooper traits represent components of fitness. The biophysical landscape of H can bridge genotype-phenotype relation between variations in H and effects.

Datasets show correlation between metabolic and p. This may not reflect effects on single form. Cases express more than one variant, usually similar sequences and properties. Adopting cooper-centric mindset, reitted curves to derive n and p for each. Values, although under different conditions, correspond maximum. Strengthened by relation between affinity and cooperativity. The trade between O loading and unloading is unclear. High or low affinity result low delivery unless cooperativity introduced. Values of p and n should reflect optimization between loading and unloading to optimize delivery. Tested whether values of p and n are optimized in body-related adaptation of mammalian H, relying datasets for mammalian proteins. Curves of homous proteins measured similar conditions, curves human under different conditions. Reliable estimates p and parameters available. Plotting affinity or properties as function of metabolic rate yielded correlations. Greater rate, higher maximum cooperativity. Inverse correlation between rate and affinity observed.

    Title: Longitudinal analysis of Plasmodium sporozoite motility in the dermis reveals component of blood vessel recognition
    Abstract: Malaria infection starts with injection of Plasmodium sporozoites by an Anopheles mosquito into the skin of the mammalian host. How sporozoites locate and enter a blood vessel is a critical, but poorly understood process. In this study, we examine sporozoite motility and their interaction with dermal blood vessels, using intravital microscopy in mice. Our data suggest that sporozoites exhibit two types of motility: in regions far from blood vessels, they exhibit ‘avascular motility’, defined by high speed and less confinement, while in the vicinity of blood vessels their motility is more constrained. We find that curvature of sporozoite tracks engaging with vasculature optimizes contact with dermal capillaries. Imaging of sporozoites with mutations in key adhesive proteins highlight the importance of the sporozoite's gliding speed and its ability to modulate adhesive properties for successful exit from the inoculation site.

    Supporting Text:
    The gliding motility of Plasmodium sporozoites is essential for their infectivity. Previous reports have observed sporozoite motility in the dermis ( Amino et al., 2006; Hellmann et al., 2011 ), but an in-depth analysis of their motility over time has not been performed. Intravital imaging of sporozoites over the first 120 min after inoculation highlights significant changes in their motility in this time frame. Within the first 20 min after intradermal inoculation, sporozoites displace with high speed and minimal constraint, which likely maximizes the volume of tissue that is explored by the population of sporozoites. After this initial period of dispersal, sporozoite motility changes. Most significantly starting 20 min after inoculation, the migratory pattern of sporozoites becomes increasingly confined, and a growing number of sporozoites engage in continuous circular motility. We hypothesize that this motility pattern optimizes engagement with blood vessels that will ultimately lead to blood vessel entry. 1 hr after inoculation, sporozoites begin to slow down and a significant proportion stop moving with the proportion of non-motile sporozoites increasing to 70% by 2 hr. Importantly, this late-phase slow down is distinct from the change in trajectory that occurs 20 and 30 min post inoculation when the speed and proportion of non-motile sporozoites does not change from what is observed at earlier time points. The reasons for this late-phase slow down are not known, but possibilities include resource exhaustion or encountering a host cell or factor that leads to their arrest. In contrast to previous reports of apparently random motility of sporozoites in the dermis, which was suggested to be only environmentally constrained ( Amino et al., 2006; Hellmann et al

Through the bite of an infected mosquito, the mammalian host is infected with Plasmodium sporozoites, which migrate through the skin to invade blood vessels. Sporozoites are then carried by the blood flow to the liver, where they initiate a liver- and subsequently a blood-stage infection ( Sinnis and Zavala, 2012 ). Sporozoite motility, a substrate-dependent gliding motility, is essential for the exit from the dermis, and as a result for sporozoite infectivity ( Vanderberg and Frevert, 2004; Amino et al., 2006; Hellmann et al., 2011; Ejigiri et al., 2012 ). In comparison to fast migrating mammalian cells, such as lymphocytes, which crawl at approximately 0. 1 μm/s, sporozoites move at 1–3 μm/s ( Amino et al., 2006; Hellmann et al., 2011; Ejigiri et al., 2012 ). Given the energy cost of such a remarkable speed, fast migration is likely key for sporozoite infectivity. Gliding speed is affected by the turnover of focal adhesion sites ( Münter et al., 2009 ), as well as by environmental obstacles present in the dermis ( Hellmann et al., 2011 ). While on two-dimensional substrates in vitro, salivary gland sporozoites glide in a circular pattern. In the dermis, this motion is transformed to a complex non-linear path ( Amino et al., 2006; Hellmann et al., 2011 ). Recent work has shown that both the circumsporozoite protein ( CSP ) and the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein ( TRAP ) have important roles for the exit of Plasmodium berghei sporozoites from the dermal inoculation site ( Coppi et al., 2011; Ejigiri et al., 2012 ). Proteolytic processing of CSP leads to removal of the N-terminus and exposure of a cell-adhesion domain ( Coppi et al., 2011 ). Sporozoites expressing a mutant CSP which lacks the N-terminus ( CSΔN ), thus mimicking the proteolytically processed form of CSP, display normal infectivity when inoculated intravenously ( Coppi et al., 2011 )

. Our analysis of track curvature reveals that sporozoites gliding in the proximity of blood vessels describe trajectories with local curvatures that interestingly relate to the curvature of the capillary vessel ( Yen and Braverman, 1976; Braverman, 1997 ). This suggests that ‘perivascular motility’ enhances contact with capillaries, rather than the larger dermal terminal arterioles or post-capillary venules ( Yen and Braverman, 1976; Braverman, 1997 ). Indeed, it has been observed previously, that the curvature of the sporozoite matches the geometry of capillaries ( Vanderberg, 1974 ) and more recently, a study using stochastic computer simulations of sporozoite motility found that in these models, sporozoite interaction with capillaries is greatly enhanced if the parasite has the ability to adapt its curvature and torsion to the surrounding environment ( Battista et al., 2014 ). In addition to the change in sporozoite trajectories, we found that they also had a significant decrease in speed when in the vicinity of blood vessels. These data build upon and solidify the previous observation of Amino et al., who quantified the speed of a small number of sporozoites gliding around blood vessels and reported a decrease after contact with the vessel ( Amino et al., 2006 ). Intravital imaging of mutant sporozoites that do not efficiently exit the dermis provides additional insights into the factors required for dermal exit. The importance of high sporozoite gliding speed is highlighted by the behavior of the TRAP-VAL mutant that moves with less than half the motile speed of wild-type control parasites in the dermis. This decrease in speed corresponds to the reduction of final MSD, which reduces the area of tissue explored by 70%

. More work is needed to determine if this is the case, however, our data with both TRAP-VAL and CSΔN mutant sporozoites demonstrate that the sporozoite's ability to regulate its adhesive intereactions is a key factor for successful movement through and out of the dermis. We show that wild-type control sporozoites spend over a quarter of their time engaging with blood vessels, frequently without successful entry into the blood circulation. This suggests that only certain areas of the vasculature are suitable for sporozoite entry. It is known that the abluminal surface of dermal capillaries is not uniform; for example, the basement membrane surrounding the capillary bed is not continuous and through its gaps, pericytes form tight junctions with the underlying endothelial cell ( Braverman, 1997 ). Thus, there may be certain areas of the vasculature that are preferentially invaded by sporozoites. With this study, we refine our understanding on how the sporozoite navigates through and out of the dermis. Mutant sporozoites that display modest changes in motility pattern or speed have dramatic decreases in blood vessel invasion and infectivity. These data suggest that exit from the inoculation site presents an important barrier for the sporozoite and is therefore an opportune time to intervene. Indeed, the partial success of RTS, S, the only malaria vaccine candidate in Phase III clinical trials, may result from antibodies that target sporozoites in the dermis ( Foquet et al., 2014 ). As we build upon RTS, S, it will be important to consider expanding the antigen repertoire to include proteins critical for dermal exit. Additionally, our data suggest that an analysis of dermal sporozoite motility could be incorporated in the evaluation of future vaccine strategies to predict efficiency of new vaccine targets.

. 077–0. 125 μm−1, the majority of sporozoite tracks that overlap with blood vessels describe trajectories that have a curvature of 0. 125–0. 2 μm−1, which, remarkably, equals the curvature of the circumference of dermal capillaries ( Figure 2D ) ( Yen and Braverman, 1976; Braverman, 1997 ). These data demonstrate that sporozoite motility can change in response to the geometry of the vasculature, optimizing contact with capillaries rather than larger dermal arterioles or postillary venules ( Yen and Brerman 1976; Brerman 199 ). The curvature of the sporite matches the geometry of capill ( Vanderberg 1974 ) and computer simulations of sporite motility have shown that interaction with capill is enhanced if the sporite can adapt its curvature and torsion to the environment ( Battista et al 2014 ).

    Title: Evolutionary adaptation after crippling cell polarization follows reproducible trajectories
    Abstract: Cells are organized by functional modules, which typically contain components whose removal severely compromises the module's function. Despite their importance, these components are not absolutely conserved between parts of the tree of life, suggesting that cells can evolve to perform the same biological functions with different proteins. We evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae for 1000 generations without the important polarity gene BEM1. Initially the bem1∆ lineages rapidly increase in fitness and then slowly reach >90% of the fitness of their BEM1 ancestors at the end of the evolution. Sequencing their genomes and monitoring polarization reveals a common evolutionary trajectory, with a fixed sequence of adaptive mutations, each improving cell polarization by inactivating proteins. Our results show that organisms can be evolutionarily robust to physiologically destructive perturbations and suggest that recovery by gene inactivation can lead to rapid divergence in the parts list for cell biologically important functions.

   ., 2009] ), and the recruitment of new functions by adaptations that alter the function of existing genes and create genes de novo ( Neme and Tautz, 2013, 2014 ). Our evolution experiment created a related set of rapid polarizing mechanisms. Deciphering the physical mechanisms of polarity establishment in all the different combinations of mutants will teach us about evolution of functional modules. However, it will also reveal more about cell biology of polarization. First, it can help to identify the role of new genes in polarity establishment; previous work has implicated Nrp1 in RNA binding, ribosome biogenesis, and the formation of stress granules, whereas our experiments demonstrate that it regulates cell polarization, directly or indirectly. High-throughput studies, at least as indicated on the yeast genome website SGD ( www. yeastgenome. org ) have not shown physical or genetic interactions between NRP1 and any of the currently known polarity genes. BEM1, BEM2, and BEM3 as well as their genetic interactions have been measured and implicated in polarity establishment before ( Koh et al., 2010 ). However, the lack of information about NRP1 made it impossible to predict the positive effect of the BEM2 deletion on polarity establishment in the absence of BEM1 and BEM3. Second, by biophysically investigating how cells recover from the deletion of BEM1 as well as other perturbations in the polarity pathway, we will be able to distill which parts of polarization mechanisms, rather than molecules, are essential for proper function. Cell polarization is a complicated, dynamical process, thus it may be more important to alter quantitative parameters of the overall process, regardless of the gene whose mutation produces the change, than it is to alter the behavior of a particular protein.

We followed the evolutionary adaptation to the removal of an important component of the module that polarizes budding yeast cells. Cells recovered by following a reproducible evolutionary trajectory that could be largely explained by the interactions amongst the mutated genes and led to a substantial recovery in the speed and accuracy of cell polarization. How repeatable is evolution? Experimental evolution has produced a range of answers to this question, from replicate populations that share a small fraction of causal mutations ( Gresham et al., 2008; Kvitek and Sherlock, 2011; Chou and Marx, 2012; Koschwanez et al., 2013; Kryazhimskiy et al., 2014 ) to those where mutations occur in the same genes in the same order ( Blount et al., 2012; Herron and Doebeli, 2013 ) or repeatedly affect the same amino acids in a protein ( Meyer et al., 2012 ). For multiple substitutions, in the same protein, strong epistasis can render most trajectories impossible or unlikely ( Weinreich et al., 2006; Bridgham et al., 2009; Hinkley et al., 2011 ). Examining the mutations that gave rise to a particular phenotype in the bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, revealed a hierarchy of pathways: loss-of-function mutations are most frequent and other pathways, including promoter mutations, gene fusions, and gain-of-function mutations can only be found when the dominant pathway is blocked ( Lind et al., 2015 ). Our work adds to the list of examples of reproducible trajectories and our reconstruction of all possible paths, an exercise that has previously been performed for multiple mutations in a single gene ( Weinreich et al., 2006 ), demonstrates why our mutations occurred in a particular order

., 2012; Freisinger et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013 ) ( Figure 1A ). We strongly perturbed yeast polarization by removing Bem1, a regulator of Cdc42, which recruits the guanine exchange factor ( GEF ) Cdc24 as well as Cdc42 to the membrane where Cdc24 activates membrane-bound Cdc42. We decided to delete Bem1 because previous research suggests that this protein is a relatively young component in polarity establishment that had a different role in ancestral fungi ( Semighini and Harris, 2008 ). Deleting this component of polarity could thus reveal other alternative, more evolutionarily ancient polarization modules. 10. 7554/eLife. 09638. 003Figure 1. BEM1 is an important polarity gene.

. As far as we know, this is the first example of reproducible trajectories to adaptation to mutations that severely compromise a cellular function, and it will be interesting to see if evolving strains, adapting to severe perturbations in other pathways will also lead to reproducible trajectories. We interpret our results as demonstrating that the multiple layers of regulation that allow cells to polarize rapidly and accurately also make it possible for them to adapt, by evolution, to very strong perturbations. Under strong selective pressure, the larger target size for mutations that inactivate proteins favors evolutionary trajectories that remove components from modules over those that quantitatively alter their properties. As long as modules contain components, like Bem2 and Bem3, which alter the quantitative behavior of other proteins, like Cdc42 and other small GTPases, removing the regulators is the equivalent of rarer mutations that would change the biochemical parameters of central components of the pathway. Our findings are consistent with previous experimental evolution work which showed that loss-of-function mutations allow bacteria ( Zinser et al., 2003; Hottes et al., 2013 ) and yeast ( Koschwanez et al., 2013 ) to adapt to their environments and produce novel phenotypes ( Wildenberg and Murray, 2014 ). Adaptation by loss-of-function mutations has also been observed in natural populations ( Maurelli et al., 1998; Smith et al., 2006; Bliven and Maurelli, 2012; D'Souza et al., 2014, 2015 ). In our work, the selected mutations do not alter the structure of an existing protein to allow it to play Bem1's role of physically linking Cdc42 to Cdc24. Instead, other mutations that increase the half-life of Cdc42-GTP ( and possibly other small G proteins ) remove the need to hold Cdc24 and Cdc42 close to each other

. If mutations are added in the order they occurred in during the evolution, each successive mutation increases the fitness of the resulting strain, but adding mutations in different orders can reduce fitness. ( Figure 3C ) : adding the bem2∆ mutation increases the growth rate of bem1∆ bem3∆ nrp1∆ cells, but the same mutation reduces or has no effect on the fitness of all other tested genotypes. Another example of epistasis is the changing dependence of the cells on BEM1: the polarization module evolves from requiring Bem1, in wild-type strains, to being slightly impaired by the presence of functional Bem1 in a bem2∆ bem3∆ nrp1∆ mutant ( Figure 3D ). Reconstruction allowed us to examine how different combinations of mutations alter the dynamics of cell polarization. We found that mutations that increase the half-life of Cdc-GTP increase the speed of polarization ( Figure 4A ) and mutations that reduce the half-life of C-G decrease the speed of polarization ( Figure 4B ). Mutations that increase the half-life of C-G also increase the accuracy of polarization ( Figure 4C ) and mutations that reduce the half of C-G decrease accuracy ( Figure 4 ). Mutations that increase the half of C-G increase the speed and accuracy of polarization ( Figure 4 ) and mutations that reduce the half of C decrease the speed and accuracy ( Figure 4 ). Mutations that increase the half of C increase the speed and accuracy of polarization ( Figure 4 ) and that reduce the half of decrease the speed and accuracy ( Figure 4 ). Mutations that increase the half of C increase the speed and accuracy of polarization ( Figure 4 ) and that reduce the half decrease the speed and accuracy ( Figure 4 ). Mutations that increase the half C increase the speed and accuracy of polarization ( Figure 4 ) and reduce the half the speed and accuracy ( Figure 4 ). Mutations that increase the half C the speed and accuracy of polarization ( Figure 4 ) and reduce the speed and accuracy ( Figure 4 ) Mutations that increase the half the speed and accuracy of ( Figure 4 ) reduce the speed and accuracy ( Figure ) Mutations that increase the half the speed and accuracy ( Figure ) reduce the speed ( Figure ) Mutations that increase the speed and accuracy ( Figure ) reduce ( Figure ) Mutations that increase the speed and accuracy ( ) reduce ( Figure ) Mutations that the speed and accuracy ( ) ( Figure ) Mutations the speed ( ) ( ) Mutations the ( ) ( ) Mutations ( ) ( ) Mut ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (

    Title: Neural mechanisms of economic commitment in the human medial prefrontal cortex
    Abstract: Neurobiologists have studied decisions by offering successive, independent choices between goods or gambles. However, choices often have lasting consequences, as when investing in a house or choosing a partner. Here, humans decided whether to commit ( by acceptance or rejection ) to prospects that provided sustained financial return. BOLD signals in the rostral medial prefrontal cortex ( rmPFC ) encoded stimulus value only when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, suggesting a role in integrating value signals over time. By contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ( dACC ) encoded stimulus value only when participants rejected ( or deferred accepting ) a prospect. dACC BOLD signals reflected two decision biases–to defer commitments to later, and to weight potential losses more heavily than gains–that ( paradoxically ) maximised reward in this task. These findings offer fresh insights into the pressures that shape economic decisions, and the computation of value in the medial prefrontal cortex.

    Supporting Text:
   . This may be because dACC preferentially responds to decision entropy or conflict ( Botvinick et al., 1999 ), or alternatively because it encodes the value of disengaging from a current or default state to explore a novel course of action ( Hayden et al., 2011; Kolling et al., 2012 ). In either case however, it remains unknown whether this value difference coding depends on whether stimuli are accepted or rejected, because when deciding between two prospects, an option may be chosen either because it was preferred, or because the alternative was dispreferred. Moreover, it remains unknown how value encoding in the medial prefrontal cortex depends on whether decisions involve economic commitment or not. Here, thus, we investigated the neural mechanisms that accompany commitment ( acceptance, rejection ), and deferral ( failure to accept or reject ) during economic choice, using a multi-alternative choice task in which decisions had financial ramifications that persisted over prolonged episodes, and could not be reversed. In half of the blocks, participants had to choose between accepting ( inclusion by commitment ) and deferring acceptance of a prospect ( exclusion by deferral ). In the other half of the blocks, participants chose between rejecting ( exclusion by commitment ) and deferring rejection ( inclusion by deferral ). Therefore, preference for a bandit would be implied by commitment in rule-in and deferral in rule-out. Our task, thus, allowed us to probe value encoding in the prefrontal cortex as a function of whether a stimulus was preferred ( i. e., included or excluded ) and whether commitment was made now or deferred until later. Further, the task captured many aspects of economic decisions in the real world: uncertainty about the true value of a prospect, sustained yield accruing from the investment, economic benefit determined collectively by current assets, and the need to trade-off exploration and exploitation

Previous studies have examined the neural mechanisms of economic behavior by offering participants a succession of independent gambles or unrelated consumer choices ( Daw et al., 2006; Plassmann et al., 2007; Lim et al., 2013 ). Here, we devised a task in which decisions involved commitment to an asset with enduring financial consequences. Whereas previous tasks have sought to mimic the experience of a gambler choosing which one-armed bandit has the highest yield, our experiment captures that of a consumer deciding to sell an ageing car or of an animal electing whether to accept a prospective mate. This approach thus allowed us to model the factors that drive everyday economic commitments, and to measure how brain activity differed when commitments were made relative to when they were deferred to a later time. This approach allowed us to investigate how value was coded according to two key axes: whether decisions expressed preference or anti-preference; and whether a commitment ( acceptance or rejection ) was made immediately, or deferred into the future. We found a striking dissociation in the neural data; the dACC encoded value differentially as a function of the former axis ( encoding value only when a prospect was anti-preferred i. e., rejected or not accepted ). By contrast, the rmPFC encoded value differentially along the latter axis, covarying with value only when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, and not at the point of commitment. This latter profile of activity was maximal over posterior rostromedial ( rmPFC ) sites in Brodmann’s area nine that have been previously implicated in forecasting the value of future behaviour ( Bechara et al., 1994 ), for example contributing to episodic future thinking ( Schacter and Addis, 2007 ). BOLD activity in this region resembles firing rates of ‘integration’ neurons that build up to the point of choice and then falls away ( Roitman and Shadlen, 2002 )

. In other words, one possibility is that three key economic suboptimalities catalogued in one-shot decision tasks—framing effects, endowment effects, and loss aversion—are all ‘rational’ biases when a more ecologically valid task is employed, in which decisions do not all have independent consequences ( Erev and Roth, 2014; Fawcett et al., 2014 ). In summary, asking participants to commit to economic alternatives revealed a striking dissociation between the dACC and rmPFC, two brain structures whose contribution to economic choice in the primate remains highly contentious ( Kable and Glimcher, 2009; Rangel and Hare, 2010; Rushworth et al., 2011 ). BOLD signals in the rmPFC and dACC both correlate with the relative value of two prospects under consideration, but do so with opposite sign, which has led researchers to puzzle over their unique contributions to decision-making. Some theories have proposed that rmPFC and dACC encode the value of stimuli and actions respectively ( Rudebeck et al., 2008 ), or the value and saliency of stimuli ( Litt et al., 2011 ), or the value of choosing a food item relative to that of foraging elsewhere ( Kolling et al., 2012 ). However, past work has precluded the segregation of neural activity on trials where a commitment was made, relative to those where commitment was deferred into the future. Our findings suggests that the rmPFC is involved in integrating value in the service of prospective states, whereas the value coding in the dACC is relevant to whether a currently-available prospect is preferred or not. As such, these findings support the view that the hierarchy of control signals observed in the lateral prefrontal cortex is similarly instated in the medial prefrontal cortex ( Kouneiher et al., 2009; Summerfield and Koechlin, 2009 ).

. To preview our findings, whole-brain functional neuroimaging during performance of the task revealed a striking dissociation in the medial prefrontal cortex. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ( dACC ) encoded value when a prospect was excluded ( not included ) while the rmPFC encoded value only during deferral ( not commitment ). Furthermore, joint consideration of the behavioural data and the dACC activity allowed us to pinpoint two pressures that shaped decisions in the task: a bias to defer until a later date, and a bias to weight unfavourable ( excluded ) options more heavily. Although similar biases typically hinder reward harvesting in standard tasks, for our ecologically valid setting we show that they actually allow participants to perform closer to a reward-maximizing agent.

., 2001; Plassmann et al., 2007 ). This sensitivity to value during deliberation but not at commitment in the rmPFC is reminiscent of single neurons in the parietal cortex that parametrically encode confidence about sensory signals but drop off precipitously at the choice point ( Roitman and Shadlen, 2002 ). One possibility is that the rmPFC is involved in integrating value signals across prospects and time. If so, one might expect that it also encodes the current value of the asset pool—a quantity that signals the likely total reward that will be received at the end of the block. We calculated asset pool value in a trialwise fashion and included it as an additional predictor of the BOLD signal alongside the value, choice, rule and other nuisance factors such as the number of trials elapsed thus far in the block ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ). Asset pool value captured unique variance in the BOLD signal in an overlapping region of posterior rmPFC ( peak 2, 60, 6; t ( 19 ) = 4. 30, p < 0. 0004; see Figure 3E ). This provides corroborating evidence that the rmPFC is involved in value integration, encoding the most likely estimate of the forthcoming monetary yield to be received at the end of the block. Next, we compared brain activity when decisions were made to commit or defer. Commitments in both rule-in and rule-out blocks ( commit > defer ) were associated with strong increases in the BOLD signal in a number of brain regions ( Figure 4—source data 1 ), but most prominently in a dorsomedial prefrontal region encompassing the dACC ( Figure 4A ). Extracting data from an independently-defined ROI, we plotted parameters reflecting the average dACC response in each condition ( see Figure 4B ). Average BOLD signals differed between commit and defer decisions, with no difference according to rule type ( p > 0. 5 ). This suggests that the dACC is sensitive to the decision to commit or defer, regardless of whether a prospect was included or excluded. This is consistent with the view that the dACC encodes the value of disengaging from a current state to explore a novel course of action ( Hayden et al,201; Kolling et,2012 ) or decision conflict ( Botick et al,199 ). However, it remains to be seen whether the dACC is sensitive to whether a prospect is preferred or not. We found that BOLD in the dACC was greater when a prospect was excluded than included ( p < 0.01 ). This suggests that the dACC is sensitive to whether a prospect is preferred or not, consistent with the view that it encodes the value of disengaging from a current state to explore a novel course of action ( Hayden et al,201; Koll et,201 ) or decision conflict ( Bot et al,199 ).

    Title: Circadian RNA expression elicited by 3’-UTR IRAlu-paraspeckle associated elements
    Abstract: Paraspeckles are nuclear bodies form around the long non-coding RNA, Neat1, and RNA-binding proteins. While their role is not fully understood, they are believed to control gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by means of the nuclear retention of mRNA containing in their 3’-UTR inverted repeats of Alu sequences ( IRAlu ). In this study, we found that, in pituitary cells, all components of paraspeckles including four major proteins and Neat1 displayed a circadian expression pattern. Furthermore the insertion of IRAlu at the 3’-UTR of the EGFP cDNA led to a rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of the egfp mRNA that was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted whereas insertion of a single antisense Alu had only a weak effect. Using real-time video-microscopy, these IRAlu were further shown to drive a circadian expression of EGFP protein. This study shows that paraspeckles, thanks to their circadian expression, control circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level.

    Supporting Text:
   . We recently reported that two protein components of paraspeckles, namely NONO and SFPQ, display a circadian expression pattern in primary cultures of pituitary cells as well as in a rat pituitary cell line, the GH4C1 cells ( Becquet et al., 2014; Guillaumond et al., 2011 ). We used this cell line to determine whether one of the posttranscriptional mechanisms allowing circadian gene expression in pituitary cells could involve the circadian nuclear mRNA retention by paraspeckle bodies. To this end, we first characterized the presence of paraspeckles and we showed that these nuclear bodies were rhythmically expressed in the rat GH4C1 pituitary cell line. We then made a series of EGFP-fused IRAlu or Alu constructs and transfected them into GH4C1 cells to investigate the EGFP expression and the fates of the egfp-IRAlu or egfp-Alu RNA. We showed that an IRAlu element in the 3’-UTR of the egfp mRNA strongly repressed EGFP expression. Further, this reduction was accompanied by significant nuclear retention of the mRNAs, likely by paraspeckle bodies. We showed also that insertion of IRAlus in the 3’-UTR of EGFP reporter gene allowed rhythmic nuclear egfp-IRAlu RNA retention and rhythmic EGFP protein expression. Finally, this rhythmic nuclear egfp-IRAlu RNA retention as well as the rhythmic nuclear retention of some known cycling transcripts that were shown here associated with paraspeckles was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted.

. The mechanism involved in the circadian nuclear retention of Alu-containing egfp mRNA remains anyway to be determined. Nuclear retention of egfp mRNA in IRAlu-egfp cells is no more cycling when paraspeckles were disrupted assuming that the nuclear retention of the reporter gene by paraspeckles contributes to cycling. To determine whether this paraspeckle impact on rhythmic gene expression occurs 'in vivo' on a much larger scale, we characterized in our pituitary cells the list of the putative Neat1 RNA target genes and we analyzed in publicly available datasets the known cycling transcripts that are included in this Neat1 RNA target list. Whereas it is well known that rhythmic circadian genes are tissue specific and that it is unfavorable to compare datasets obtained in two different species we found a robust overlap of our gene list with circadian genes in the mouse pituitary ( Hughes et al., 2007 ) and a closer overlap with post-transcriptional circadian genes in the mouse liver ( Menet et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, on a few circadian genes common to either of these lists or both, we showed a loss of rhythmic pattern when paraspeckles were disrupted assuming that paraspeckle retention plays a relevant role in circadian gene expression. It is now widely admitted that post-transcriptional circadian regulation plays a major role in determining oscillations at the mRNA level. In agreement with this view, the new mechanism described here suggests that circadian mRNA oscillations could be post-transcriptionally controlled through rhythmic nuclear retention by paraspeckle nuclear bodies.

. This holds also true for the central clock, namely the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Finally, in GH4C1 cells, the circadian variations in Neat1 RNA levels are shown here to reflect rhythmic variations in paraspeckle number within the cells. It may then be assumed that the circadian expression pattern of Neat1 RNA described here in a number of mouse tissue also reflects variations in paraspeckle number although it cannot be excluded that paraspeckle size could also oscillate over the circadian period both in pituitary cells and in other oscillators. As previously reported by Chen and Carmichael ( Chen et al., 2008 ), we found that a pair of IRAlus in the 3’-UTR of egfp can strongly silence EGFP expression in GH4C1 pituitary cell line and after fractionating cytoplasmic and nuclear RNAs from our two cell lines, we observed that IRAlus-containing egfp mRNA appear to be preferentially retained in the nucleus in comparison with those having a single Alu element. It then appeared that silencing EGFP expression mechanism relied on egfp mRNA nuclear retention. To obtain evidence that nuclear retained IRAlus are associated with paraspeckle bodies, we immunoprecipitated RNA complexes containing paraspeckle protein PSPC1 and characterized the associated egfp mRNA. We found IRAlu-containing egfp mRNA to be associated with PSPC1 whereas Alu-containing egfp mRNA was not. While PSPC1 as well as NONO and SFPQ accumulate in paraspeckles, these proteins are also found elsewhere throughout the nucleoplasm and thus may have functions apart from paraspeckle retention. In contrast to paraspeckle-associated proteins that are multifunctional, NEAT1 may have only one function. We then developed a technique to characterize nuclear mRNA Neat1 targets using a Neat1 RNA pull-down approach that allowed us to show the association of IRAlu egfp mRNA with Neat1 providing a much more convincing evidence for a nuclear retention of IRAlu egfp mRNA by paraspeckles

. Given their presumed functions in gene expression through corresponding mRNA nuclear retention and since they display a circadian expression pattern, it may be assumed that paraspeckle bodies can rhythmically retain RNAs in the nucleus leading to a rhythmic expression of the corresponding gene. In keeping with this view, we showed that IRAlu elements inserted in 3’-UTR of egfp reporter mRNA allow for its circadian retention within the nucleus and consequently for EGFP protein circadian expression. However, it may be noticed that egfp mRNA displayed also a circadian nuclear retention when a single antisens Alu element was inserted in its 3’-UTR but in this case the variations of the ratio over the circadian period was highly reduced in contrast to the high amplitude circadian variations of the nuclear versus cytoplasmic ratio observed in IRAlu-egfp cell line. These small amplitude variations of the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA contents in Alu-egfp cell line were further accompanied by a weak number of cells expressing a circadian pattern of EGFP expression. Since antisens Alu elements within the 3’-UTR of mRNAs can be the target of several RNA-binding proteins ( Kelley et al., 2014; Zarnack et al., 2013 ) it may be speculated that some of these RNA-binding proteins display a rhythmic expression pattern accounting for the weak EGFP circadian expression observed in Alu-egfp cell line. Among the identified RNA-binding proteins that target antisens Alu elements within the 3’-UTR of mRNAs, HNRNPC was shown to display a circadian expression pattern in several tissues including the mouse pituitary ( see CIRCA: http://circadb. hogeneschlab. org/ ). This is not the case for HNRNPU and STAUFEN 1 ( STAU1 ) -mediated messenger RNA decay we did not find to display a circadian expression pattern in GH4C1 cells ( Guillaumond et al., 2011 ) and ( data not shown ) and are then unlikely involved in circadian EGFP expression in Alu-egfp cell line

. However after use of a combination of Neat1 RNA FISH and STORM analysis, paraspeckles appear more likely as oblong structures with smaller dimensions reminiscent of the interchromatin granule-associated zone ( IGAZ ) that had been observed under electron microscope and had been reported to correspond to paraspeckles ( Cardinale et al., 2007; Bond and Fox, 2009; Souquere et al., 2010 ). Width and height measurements obtained after STORM analysis of Neat1 RNA FISH staining are smaller than the dimensions of IGAZ nuclear bodies established by an electron microscopy analysis in human and mouse cells ( Souquere et al., 2010 ) suggesting that parasck may be smaller in pituit cells than in human and mouse cells. Neat RNA FISH and STORM analysis also showed that paraspeles in GH4 cells are not randomly distributed in the nucleoplasm but tend to accumulate near the nucleolus. This is in agreement with previous observations of parasck in other cell types ( Souere et al. 2010 ) and suggests that parasck may be associated with the nucleolus in pituit cells as well as in other cell types. Neat RNA FISH and STORM analysis also showed that paraspeles in GH4 cells are not randomly distributed in the nucleoplasm but tend to accumulate near the nucleolus This is in agreement with previous observations paras in other cell types and suggests that parasck may be associated with nucleol in pit cells as well as other types. Neat RNA FISH and STORM also showed that parasles in GH cells are not randomly distributed the nucleoplasm but tend to accumulate the nucleol This in agreement previous observations paras other types suggests that paras may be associated nucleol pit cells as well types. Neat RNA FISH and ST showed that parasles in cells are not randomly distributed the nucleasm but tend accumulate theol This agreement previous paras other suggests that may be associatedol pit as types. Ne RNA FISH and ST showed that paras in cells are not randomly distributed the but tend accumulate This previous suggests that may be associated pit as. RNA F and ST showed that in are not randomly but tend This suggests that be pit. RNA and ST showed that are not randomly but tend This suggests be. RNA and ST showed that not randomly tend This suggests. RNA and ST that not tend This suggests.

    Title: The active-zone protein Munc13 controls the use-dependence of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels
    Abstract: Presynaptic calcium channel function is critical for converting electrical information into chemical communication but the molecules in the active zone that sculpt this function are poorly understood. We show that Munc13, an active-zone protein essential for exocytosis, also controls presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channel ( VGCC ) function dictating their behavior during various forms of activity. We demonstrate that in vitro Munc13 interacts with voltage-VGCCs via a pair of basic residues in Munc13's C2B domain. We show that elimination of this interaction by either removal of Munc13 or replacement of Munc13 with a Munc13 C2B mutant alters synaptic VGCC's response to and recovery from high-frequency action potential bursts and alters calcium influx from single action potential stimuli. These studies illustrate a novel form of synaptic modulation and show that Munc13 is poised to profoundly impact information transfer at nerve terminals by controlling both vesicle priming and the trigger for exocytosis.

    Supporting Text:
    The observation that Munc13 enhances Ca2+ influx and modulates kinetic properties of VGCCs across a range of stimulation conditions has broad implications for understanding how synaptic transmission is controlled. Our data strongly imply that this modulation is mediated by a direct VGCC-Munc13 interaction although we cannot exclude that synprint interaction site on Munc13 C2B influences interactions with other proteins in situ that in turn modulate VGCCs. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the presence of this critical active-zone protein has potent influence on VGCC function and delineates a new class of mechanisms for sculpting synaptic efficacy. The strong dependence of exocytosis on Ca2+ influx and the control of VGCC function on fast time scales imply that synaptic throughput can be actively controlled by such VGCC-active-zone protein interactions. The fact that many presynaptic proteins interact with VGCCs ( Hans et al., 1999; Zhong et al., 1999; Han et al., 2011; Kaeser et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011 ) suggests that other cases of this type of VGCC control may be operational at nerve terminals. Our experiments also provide a mechanistic explanation for the profound synaptic depression observed for ultra-short ISIs. The analysis of Brody and Yue strongly implied that for hippocampal neurons action potentials fail to invade nerve terminals when delivered in rapid succession. Using newly developed fast genetically encoded voltage indicators, we confirmed that for a 2 ms ISI this is the case ( Figure 4C ) but only for the cooler temperatures at which those early experiments were performed. Remarkably, at physiological temperatures synaptic depression for 2 ms ISIs persists ( Figure 7A ), but the root cause is not AP failure ( Figure 4C ) but a Munc13-mediated failure of VGCC reactivation ( Figure 4A )

., 2014 ). These observations suggest that Munc13's C2B domain could perform a similar function and that the interaction between the C2B domain and PIP2 may be important in mediating the effects of Munc13 on VGCCs or may be an additional level of regulation. This possibility would contribute an additional layer of complexity to the emerging role of PIP2 in the modulation of VGCC function ( Michailidis et al., 2007; Roberts-Crowley et al., 2009 ). The recent observation that Ca2+ channels may be highly diffusible in the presynaptic membrane ( Schneider et al., 2015 ) provides another potential mechanism by which interactions with active zone proteins such as Munc13 could modulate effective Ca2+ influx. Complex high-frequency spike bursts have been recorded from many brain regions, including hippocampus ( Kandel and Spencer, 1961 ). Our data show that the temporal envelope of transmission associated with such spikes in hippocampal neurons is actively controlled by the interaction of VGCCs and Munc13 rather than determined by the limitations of the transmission machinery. The work we show here illustrates a novel type of modulation conferred by the local active-zone environment on VGCCs and synaptic function and demonstrates its importance for control of synaptic throughput.

. We pinpointed a critical interaction site to 2 basic residues within the C2B domain of Munc13 on a face that is orthogonal to the potential membrane-interacting loops of this domain. Loss of Munc13 at hippocampal nerve terminals profoundly alters the response of VGCCs during brief AP bursts of very high-frequency firing. Although re-expression of Munc13-harboring point mutations that prevent interaction with VGCCs in Munc13-KD synapses restores exocytosis, it does not rescue the alterations in VGCC function. As a result, synapses expressing this mutant Munc13 have profound changes in ultra-fast plasticity of the exocytic response as well. Thus, in addition to its central importance in controlling SNARE assembly Munc13 also tunes temporal aspects of VGCCs and in turn influences ultra-fast plasticity at nerve terminals.

. Given that Munc13 itself is a multi-domain protein, the rules of governing its interaction with VGCCs might be tunable at different synapses depending on the repertoire of other molecular partners and the Munc13 variant. It is interesting to note that the original description of VGCC's interaction with synaptic proteins ( synprint ) was that between syntaxin and CaV2s ( Rettig et al., 1997; Sheng et al., 1997 ). Syntaxin is also a primary interacting partner of Munc13 suggesting that that there might be a 3-way partnership between these proteins that sculpts VGCC and Munc13 function. The synprint interaction motif in Munc13-3 is slightly different than that in Munc13-1 ( KRRT as opposed to KKRT, Figure 1 ), potentially reflecting differences in its interaction with VGCCs and its impact on synaptic performance for pairs of AP stimuli on fast time scales. At present, a number of presynaptic proteins, including key active-zone proteins such as RIM and ELKS/bruchpilot are known to interact with VGCCs, but the interactions have been shown largely to control VGCC localization and abundance ( Kittel et al., 2006 ). It will be interesting in the future to see what active-zone protein interactions are necessary to allow function of Munc13 on VGCCs. Moreover, RIM1 and synaptotagmin contain synprint interaction motifs similar to Munc13, posing the possibility that VGCC properties could be controlled by these proteins as well. The C2B domain in synaptotagmin has also been identified as a Ca2+-independent mode of interaction with phosphoinositide-4, 5-bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) on the plasma membrane ( Bai et al., 2004; Kuo et al., 2009 ) and potentially facilitates synaptotagmin homo-oligomerization on lipid bilayers ( Wang et al., 2014 )

. We previously developed a robust approach for examining AP-driven presynaptic Ca2+ influx using AM-ester loaded Fluo5F at presynaptic boutons ( Hoppa et al., 2012 ) identified using a fluorescent-protein-tagged presynaptic protein ( VAMP2-mCherry ). We found that Munc13-KD resulted in a 34% reduction in Ca2+ influx following a single action potential as compared to wild-type ( WT ) cells ( Figure 2C, D ). This effect was fully reversed by rescuing the knockdown with an shRNA-insensitive variant of Munc13-1 ( see below ). There are several mechanisms by which Munc13 could modify Ca2+ influx: loss of Munc13 could change the number of VGCCs on the presynaptic membrane; it could alter the presynaptic waveform, which controls the fraction of VGCCs that open and the temporal envelope of the driving force for Ca2+ entry, or it could alter the gating properties of VGCCs themselves. To investigate possible changes to the AP waveform, we used the genetically encoded voltage-sensitive probe archaerhodopsin fused to green fluorescent protein ( Arch-GFP ) ( Kralj et al., 2012 ) expressed either in WT or Munc13-KD neurons to visualize possible changes in the action potential at presynaptic terminals ( Hoppa et al., 2014 ). We found that Munc13-KD did not significantly impact the height or full-width at half-maximum ( FWHM ) of the AP compared to WT ( Figure 2D, E ). Based on these data, we concluded that the reduction in Ca2+ influx was not the result of changes to the AP waveform. Quantitative immunostaining using an anti-CaV2. 1 antibody directed to an intracellular domain of this protein ( Hoppa et al., 2012 ) showed that the total synaptic abundance of this Ca2+ channel isoform was not altered by Munc13-KD ( Figure 2F, G ). At present, however, we lack tools to probe the abundance of the other major VGCC present in these nerve terminals ( CaV2. 2 )

    Researchers investigated the role of the active-zone protein Munc13 in controlling presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) function. They found that Munc interacts with VGCC via a pair of basic residues in its C2 domain and that this interaction is essential for VG function during various forms of activity. Elimination of Munc or replacement with a M13 C2 mutant altered VG's response and recovery from high-frequency action potential bursts and calcium influx from single potential stimuli. The study demonstrates a novel form of synaptic modulation and that M13 is poised to impact information transfer at nerve terminals by controlling vesicle priming and exocytosis.

    M13 enhances Ca2 influx and modulates kinetic properties of VGs across stimulation conditions, implying a direct VG-M13 interaction. The presence of this active protein has a potent influence on VG function and delineates a new mechanism for sculpting synaptic efficacy. The dependence of exocyt on Ca2 influx and control VG function on fast scales suggests that throughput can be controlled by VG-active protein interactions. Many presynaptic proteins interact with VGs, suggesting other cases of this type of control may be operational at terminals. The study provides a mechanistic explanation for synaptic depression at ultra-short ISIs, which is not due to AP failure but M13-mediated VG reactivation.

    The C2 domain of M13 may perform a similar function and the interaction with P2 may mediate effects on VGs or be an additional regulation. The observation that Ca channels are diffusible in presynaptic membrane provides a mechanism for interactions with active proteins like M13 to modulate Ca influx. High-frequency bursts have been recorded in brain regions, including hippocampus, and data show temporal transmission is controlled by VGs and M13. The study illustrates a novel modulation by local environment on VGs and function and its importance for control synaptic.

 A critical site was pinpointed to basic residues in C2 domain M13 that is orthogonal to membrane-interacting loops. Loss M13 at nerve terminals alters VG during brief bursts and high firing. Re-expression M13-harboring mutations prevent VG interaction restores exocyt but not VG function. Synapses with mutant M13 have changes ultra-fast plasticity exytic response. M13 is a multi-protein and rules governing interaction VGs may be tunable depending on molecular partners and variant.

    Title: Why plants make puzzle cells, and how their shape emerges
    Abstract: The shape and function of plant cells are often highly interdependent. The puzzle-shaped cells that appear in the epidermis of many plants are a striking example of a complex cell shape, however their functional benefit has remained elusive. We propose that these intricate forms provide an effective strategy to reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall of the epidermis. When tissue-level growth is isotropic, we hypothesize that lobes emerge at the cellular level to prevent formation of large isodiametric cells that would bulge under the stress produced by turgor pressure. Data from various plant organs and species support the relationship between lobes and growth isotropy, which we test with mutants where growth direction is perturbed. Using simulation models we show that a mechanism actively regulating cellular stress plausibly reproduces the development of epidermal cell shape. Together, our results suggest that mechanical stress is a key driver of cell-shape morphogenesis.

    Supporting Text:
    We propose that the puzzle shaped cells seen in the epidermis of many plant species emerge from a mechanism that evolved to limit mechanical stress in tissues that grow isotropically, such as the epidermis of leaves and cotyledons. FEM analysis of 3D pressurized cells shows that cell shape influences the direction and magnitude of mechanical stress exerted on the cell wall. When an epidermal cell becomes large in two directions ( i. e. has a large open area ), stress is greatly increased. In stems, roots and siliques, growth is strongly anisotropic, and cells can simply elongate. This is, however, not possible for isodiametric organs such as broad leaves, cotyledons and silicle fruit pods. We propose that puzzle-shaped cells in the epidermis of more isodiametric plant organs provide a means to avoid large open areas in the cell and the high stresses that they induce. Since turgor pressure inside cells is high, minimizing mechanical stress by shape regulation may be a way of reducing the resources required to reinforce the cell wall and at the same time maintaining its structural integrity during growth. Although it is possible that the interlocking puzzle-shaped cells have a role in strengthening the epidermal cell layer ( Glover, 2000; Jacques et al., 2014 ), our experimental data shows that growth anisotropy correlates with cell shape, a prediction that does not appear to readily follow from this alternative hypothesis. Organs displaying isotropic planar growth have puzzle shaped cells while anisotropically growing organs have more elongated cells with fewer lobes. Genetic perturbations that modify growth anisotropy in either direction result in the predicted changes in cell shape. In the Arabidopsis thaliana cotyledon, a p35S::LNG1 overexpression line changes growth from isotropic to anisotropic, and cell shapes become more elongated with fewer lobes

., 2014 ). Although the composition of the cell wall is undoubtedly more complex ( reviewed by Cosgrove, 2005; Cosgrove, 2014 ), this suggests that cell shape and mechanical stress are intimately connected. Most plant tissues emerge from undifferentiated cells that are initially small and isodiametrically shaped, and subsequently proliferate, differentiate and expand. For epidermal cells composing the outermost cell layer in each organ, minimizing mechanical stress on their walls is likely particularly important as the epidermis limits organ growth and is under tension from internal tissues ( Savaldi-Goldstein et al., 2007; Kutschera and Niklas, 2007; Beauzamy et al., 2015 ). Here we explore the relationship between cell shape and mechanical stress, to understand if mechanical stress is a morphological constraint in shaping epidermal cells. We propose a plausible driver for the creation of the intricate, commonly observed puzzle cell forms by demonstrating that they reduce the forces the cell wall has to withstand. We present computer simulation models that show that actively minimizing force leads to the emergence of the puzzle cell shape, reducing stress and thus potentially lowering the amount of cellulose and other wall material required to maintain mechanical integrity of the cell wall.

. But how do cells avoid excessive stress if they are part of a tissue that grows in two directions, such as the surface of broad leaves? Here we propose that the puzzle cell shape, with lobes and indentations, provides a solution to this problem. To test this hypothesis, we began by analyzing the stress in a mechanical model of the cotyledon epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana. A cellular surface mesh was extracted from confocal images using the image analysis software MorphoGraphX ( Barbier de Reuille et al., 2015 ). The mesh was then extruded to form a layer of 3D cells of uniform thickness representing the cotyledon epidermis ( Mosca et al., 2017 ). Next, the cells were pressurized, and the stresses visualized ( Figure 1C, F ). In order to examine the effect of lobes on the stress, we created a second template with simplified cell shapes using only the junctions ( points shared by three different cells ) of the original cells ( Figure 1D ). While the total and average cell area in the original and simplified tissue is the same, the overall stress is much lower in the original ( puzzle-shaped ) tissue, especially for large cells ( Figure 1C, D ). Next, we asked how the presence of lobes affects mechanical stress in the cell wall. We computed mechanical stress in idealized circular cells, adding protrusions to simulate the lobes of a puzzle cell. While stress increases with diameter ( Figure 1E ), adding lobes to the original cell does not significantly affect stress in the central part of the cell. Furthermore, increasing lobe length has no impact on stress, although the total volume of the cell increases. Similarly, changing lobe width or number does not affect stress in the cell center ( Figure 1E, inset )

. Plants with the elongated phenotype grew more anisotropically than wild type and had epidermal cells with reduced lobeyness ( n = 3 time-lapse series for each genotype, Figure 4A–B and F–I ). Thus the change in growth and organ shape from isodiametric to elongated correlated with a decrease in cell lobeyness. To further test the generality of the correlation between organ and cell shape, we examined fruit epidermal cells in a sample of 21 species from the Brassicaceae family ( full dataset shown in Hofhuis and Hay, 2017 ). These fruit pods were either elongated siliques or short, rounded silicles and we only observed puzzle-shaped cells in silicles, not in siliques ( Figure 4J, K ). This strict correspondence between fruit shape and puzzle-shaped epidermal cells fits the prediction of our model that puzzle shapes are required to allow cells to enlarge in isotropically growing tissues, but are not required in elongated organs. Our model predicts that plant cells regulate their shape to prevent their LEC, a proxy for stress, from becoming too large. To test this hypothesis, we imaged cells of young cotyledons at different stages of growth and tracked changes in cell and LEC area. We reasoned that if the cell area increases faster than LEC area, cells must have a mechanism to maintain a low LEC radius. We imaged 1, 2, 4 and 6 DAG seedlings, as within this time window we could qualitatively observe the most dramatic increase in cellular lobeyness. In the epidermal cells of 2 DAG seedlings, lobes were small or absent in most cells, while 6 days after germination most cells were puzzle-shaped ( Figure 5C ). For each time point we imaged up to 10 plants and segmented several hundred cells from each plant using MorphoGraphX. We then pooled all cells from each timepoint and calculated average cell area and LEC area for the largest 20% of cells ( Figure 5A, Figure 5—source data 1 )

. Similar gradients in cell shape are seen in A. thaliana leaves, where elongated cells cover the anisotropically growing midrib, whereas lobed cells adorn the adjacent isotropically growing leaf blade ( Figure 3C ). To explore the effect of model parameters on cell morphology we performed a parameter space exploration using the simulation with isotropic growth as a reference ( Figure 3A ). We varied isotropy within a range of 40–100% of the reference value and all other parameters within a range of at least 25–200% ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1, Videos 5–10 ). This exploration showed that when growth is anisotropic, there is no strict 'threshold' for the onset of lobing, but rather it is a continuous characteristic. This feature is preserved when the initial template and additional parameters are varied ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ). Parameter variation also demonstrates that the model can generate a diverse range of plausible cell shapes, similar to those observed in nature ( e. g. Figure 3—figure supplement 2B 60% isotropy; which are reminiscent of epidermal cells in maize leaves ). To validate the model, we confirmed in a FEM analysis that limiting the size of the LEC by creating lobes during growth reduces the cellular stress exerted on the wall ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ).

    Title: Synergistic assembly of human pre-spliceosomes across introns and exons
    Abstract: Most human genes contain multiple introns, necessitating mechanisms to effectively define exons and ensure their proper connection by spliceosomes. Human spliceosome assembly involves both cross-intron and cross-exon interactions, but how these work together is unclear. We examined in human nuclear extracts dynamic interactions of single pre-mRNA molecules with individual fluorescently tagged spliceosomal subcomplexes to investigate how cross-intron and cross-exon processes jointly promote pre-spliceosome assembly. U1 subcomplex bound to the 5' splice site of an intron acts jointly with U1 bound to the 5' splice site of the next intron to dramatically increase the rate and efficiency by which U2 subcomplex is recruited to the branch site/3' splice site of the upstream intron. The flanking 5' splice sites have greater than additive effects implying distinct mechanisms facilitating U2 recruitment. This synergy of 5' splice sites across introns and exons is likely important in promoting correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs.

    Supporting Text:
    Here we establish methods for observing the dynamics of spliceosomal subcomplexes on and the splicing of individual pre-mRNA molecules in human cell extract. The experiments reveal that the dynamics of U1 binding to the 5'SS are largely unaffected by the presence of U2 binding sites positioned either downstream ( cross-exon ) or upstream ( cross-intron ) of the 5'SS. In contrast, stable U2 binding to the 3'SS is accelerated by a 5'SS situated across either the adjacent intron or adjacent exon. Strikingly, when functional 5'SS are present together at both cross-intron and cross-exon locations, they synergistically promote U2 recruitment. The more than additive effect of the flanking 5'SS indicates that U1 employs different molecular mechanisms/interactions across introns and across exons to accelerate U2 recruitment. A simple model that would explain this observed synergy of cross-exon and cross-intron 5'SS on U2 recruitment rate is that cross-exon U1 binding assists in recruiting the splicing factors that form a platform for U2 binding to the upstream 3'SS region, whereas the cross-intron U1-U2 interaction favors a U2 conformation capable of productive branch site engagement ( Figure 5, left ). Across exons, U1 is known to recruit U2AF ( U2 auxiliary factor ), which recognizes the polypyrimidine tract and 3'SS AG, and physically interacts with other proteins ( e. g., SF1, p14, SF3B and SR proteins ) required for stable U2 binding ( Black, 2003 ). Across introns, U1 and U2 can interact via the DEAD-box protein Prp5, the ATPase activity of which promotes a structural change in U2 that makes the branch site recognition sequence more solvent accessible ( Abu Dayyeh et al., 2002; O'Day et al., 1996; Xu et al., 2004 ). A different and not necessarily mutually exclusive model is that cross-exon and cross-intron U1 interactions could both help form the binding platform for U2, but by interacting with different proteins ( e. g

Spliceosomes consist of the U1, U2, and U4/U6. U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins ( snRNPs ) and multiprotein Prp19-complex as major building blocks, plus many transiently interacting splicing factors ( Wahl et al., 2009 ). This machinery recognizes and assembles stepwise at splice sites ( SS ) ( U1 at 5'SS and U2 at the 3'SS/branch site ) to form pre-spliceosomes, which are subsequently remodeled into catalytically active spliceosomes. Pre-spliceosomes can form on multi-intron pre-mRNAs through at least two different pathways. An intron can be recognized a ) via cross-intron interactions leading directly to a catalytically active spliceosome, or b ) via cross-exon interactions where the exons flanking an intron are first defined, after which cross-intron interactions between adjacent cross-exon complexes lead to spliceosome assembly ( Moldón and Query, 2010 ). On human pre-mRNAs, which characteristically harbor multiple long introns and short exons, exon definition predominates ( Berget, 1995; Fox-Walsh et al., 2005 ). Indeed, splicing is greatly enhanced when a 5'SS is present across the exon downstream of an intron, highlighting the importance of exon definition in humans ( Talerico and Berget, 1990; Yue and Akusjärvi, 1999 ). Cross-exon pre-spliceosomes can transition into cross-intron pre-spliceosomes, each having a distinct protein composition; the latter can then productively splice the pre-mRNA ( Chiara and Reed, 1995; Schneider et al., 2010 ). However, the mechanisms by which cross-intron and cross-exon pre-spliceosomes work together to facilitate pre-mRNA splicing remain unclear. In S. cerevisiae, where the cross-intron pathway predominates, single-molecule approaches have proven invaluable for elucidating the kinetic pathways and subcomplex dynamics involved in spliceosome assembly ( Semlow et al., 2016; Warnasooriya and Rueda, 2014 )

We began by investigating whether human nuclear extracts can assemble catalytically-competent spliceosomes on surface-tethered pre-mRNA molecules. To do this, we utilized the pre-mRNA model substrate PIP85A ( Moore and Sharp, 1992 ) ( Figure 1A, Table 1 ). We refer to this RNA here as ‘5i3’ to indicate that, reading in the 5'-to-3' direction, it contains a partial exon, a 5'SS ( ‘5’ ), an intron ( i ), a 3'SS ( ‘3’ ), and another partial exon. For this pre-mRNA 20 ± 2% ( s. d. ) was converted to spliced products after 40 mins in human cell line HEK293 nuclear extract ( Figure 1B ). No spliced products were observed in the absence of ATP, which is required for spliceosome assembly. To monitor splicing of individual 5i3 molecules, we incorporated a green-excited dye into the 5' exon, a red-excited dye into the intron, and biotin at the end of the 3' exon ( Figure 1C ). We sparsely deposited this pre-mRNA onto a streptavidin-functionalized glass surface, added nuclear extract and followed green and red fluorescence from single pre-mRNA molecules over time. To exclude pre-mRNAs that lost intron signal due to RNA degradation, we selected only those molecules retaining 5' exon ( green ) fluorescence at the end of the 40 min experiment. Of these, 1. 1 ± 0. 7% ( s. e. ) lost intron ( red ) fluorescence in a control conducted in the absence of ATP ( likely due to photobleaching ) whereas 18 ± 4% ( s. e. ) lost intron fluorescence in the presence of ATP. This single-molecule assay specifically monitors intron release, while the bulk assay measures the second splicing step. Intron release requires an ATP-dependent structural rearrangement of the splicing machinery after the second splicing step, so as expected the lag phase was somewhat longer in the single-molecule assay ( Figure 1C ) than in the bulk splicing assay ( Figure 1B )

. g., the upstream U1 stabilizes SF1 and the downstream U1 stabilizes U2AF ) ( Black, 2003 ). This arrangement would increase the likelihood of U2 encountering a fully assembled binding platform when in a conformation capable of stable branch site engagement ( Figure 5, right ). Other mechanisms for synergy, such as those mediated by effects on RNA secondary structure, are also possible. Models of the type presented in Figure 5 assume that once a functional U1-U2 pre-spliceosome forms across the intron, interactions with U1 bound to the downstream 5'SS provide no additional U2 binding stabilization or stimulation of subsequent steps of spliceosome assembly ( Figure 5, bottom ). Such models predict that the presence of a downstream U1 will not affect the lifetimes of stable U2 complexes once formed. The data in Figure 4C are consistent with this prediction: both the overall shape of dwell time distributions and the ratios of binding frequency to occupancy are similar for the RNAs with ( 5i3e5: 1. 0 ± 0. 2 s−1 ) or without ( 5i3eX: 1. 3 ± 0. 9 s−1 ) the downstream site. Taken together, our data suggest that the synergistic stimulatory effect of the downstream 5'SS on splicing is exerted at the U2 recruitment step and the processes that enable it, not at the subsequent steps of spliceosome assembly and splicing. Inappropriate skipping of otherwise constitutive internal exons can occur with exceptionally low frequency ( ~1 in 105 splicing events ) ( Fox-Walsh and Hertel, 2005 ), suggesting that splicing is generally accurate. However, in multi-intron pre-mRNAs splicing can be error-prone due to competition between crosson and crosson splice sites for the same splicing machinery ( Berget, 1995 ). Our results indicate that crosson crosson interactions can facilitate splicing of multi-in preRNAs by promoting U2 recruitment to the 3'S site of upstream introns. This is consistent with the observation that splicing is enhanced when a 5S is present downstream of an intron ( Taler and Berget,199; Yue and Akjär,199 ) and that crosson pre-splices can transition to cross-in prelices ( Chi and Reed,199; Schneider et al,201 ). The synergy of crosson and crosson 5S on U2 recruitment is likely important for accurate and efficient splicing of multi-in preRNAs in humans, where exon definition predominates ( Berget,199; Foxal et al,2005 ).

    Title: Ubiquitin-dependent folding of the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6
    Abstract: Many membrane proteins fold inefficiently and require the help of enzymes and chaperones. Here we reveal a novel folding assistance system that operates on membrane proteins from the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ). We show that folding of the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6 is promoted by ubiquitination of a specific lysine, retaining it in the ER while avoiding degradation. Subsequent ER exit requires removal of ubiquitin from this lysine by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP19. This ubiquitination-deubiquitination is conceptually reminiscent of the glucosylation-deglucosylation occurring in the ER lumen during the calnexin/calreticulin folding cycle. To avoid infinite futile cycles, folded LRP6 molecules undergo palmitoylation and ER export, while unsuccessfully folded proteins are, with time, polyubiquitinated on other lysines and targeted to degradation. This ubiquitin-dependent folding system also controls the proteostasis of other membrane proteins as CFTR and anthrax toxin receptor 2, two poor folders involved in severe human diseases.

    Supporting Text:
   . This work reveals the existence of a novel assisted-folding system that operates on the cytosolic side of the ER and depends on site-specific cycles of ubiquitination-deubiquitination. Upon ubiquitination on Lys-1403, LRP6 presumably interacts with an ubiquitin-binding protein that acts as a chaperone and provides the protein with time to fold. If folding is successful, LRP6 is transported out of the ER, a step that is favored by palmitoylation ( Abrami et al., 2008b ). If folding is impaired or delayed, polyubiquitination of other cytosolic lysine residues takes over and targets LRP6 to ERAD. The here identified ubiquitination-deubiquitination assisted-folding cycle also appears to operate on other membrane proteins such as CFTR or the anthrax toxin receptor 2 ( also know as Capillary Morphogenesis gene 2, CMG2 ), loss of function of which leads to Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome ( Deuquet et al., 2012 ).

., 2008b ). Or, LRP6 can undergo a new cycle of Lys-1403-specific ubiquitination and chaperone binding. Upon prolonged presence in the ER, LRP6 undergoes polyubiquitination on other cytosolic lysines, leading to ERAD targeting. In the ER, LRP6 can thus undergo two types of ubiquitination events, which operate with different kinetics: ( 1 ) specific ubiquitination on Lys-1403 which promotes folding, ( 2 ) the slower polyubiquitination on other lysines which promotes ERAD. These two types of ubiquitination events are reminiscent of de-glucosidation and de-mannosidation of glycoproteins in the ER lumen, which also occur with different kinetics. De-glucosidation promotes folding of glycosylated protein, but if folding is too lengthy or fails, de-mannosidation takes place and targets the protein to ERAD. While the here described ubiquitin-dependent folding system was identified for LRP6, it likely also operates on other membrane proteins. We indeed found that usp19 silencing also led to a pronounced decrease in the levels of CMG2 ( Figure 4D ), defective folding of which lead to Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome ( OMIM #228600 ) ( Deuquet et al., 2009, 2011 ). Silencing of usp19 however did not affect the levels of the CMG2-related protein TEM8 ( Tumor endothelial marker 8 ), nor those of the Transferrin and the EGF receptors ( Figure 4D ). USP19 was reported to rescue the CFTR Δ508 mutant, which is an ERAD substrate ( Hassink et al., 2009 ). USP19 however also controls proteostasis of wild type CFTR ( Figure 4E ). Future studies are required to establish the generality of this ubiquitin-dependent folding system, determine whether it has a built-in quality control, and identify the missing components such as the folding-promoting ubiquitin ligase, the putative ubiquitin-binding chaperone and the degradation-targeting ligase ( Figure 4C ). All these enzymes could be exploited to control Wnt signaling in the context of disease.

. On the luminal side, these are fairly well characterized and include HSP40, HSP70 and HSP90 family members ( Brodsky and Skach, 2011 ), the lectin chaperones calnexin and calreticulin ( Lamriben et al., 2016 ) and protein disulfide isomerases ( Brodsky and Skach, 2011 ). Less is known about the assisted folding in the ER membrane and on the cytosolic side. If folding or assembly in any of these environments fails, the protein is recognized by quality control machineries and targeted to the ER associated degradation ( ERAD ) pathway ( Lemus and Goder, 2014 ). ERAD involves polyubiquitination of the cytosolic domains of transmembrane protein, extraction from the ER membrane and degradation by the proteasome ( Lemus and Goder, 2014 ). Here we have studied the biogenesis of Low-density lipoprotein Receptor-related Protein 6 ( LRP6 ), a key component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which has been associated with many human pathologies including cancer, osteoporosis and metabolic diseases ( Joiner et al., 2013 ), but also involved in the formation of gap junctions in cardiomyocytes ( Li et al., 2016 ). LRP6 is a type I membrane protein composed of a large extracellular domain containing multiple ß-propeller and EGF-like domains ( MacDonald et al., 2009 ). Proper folding of the ß-propeller domains depends of the dedicated LRP6 chaperone Mesd ( mesoderm development ) ( Hsieh et al., 2003 ) and possibly other chaperones such as calnexin. We have previously shown that exit of LRP6 from the ER also requires a cytoplasmic post-translational modification, namely S-palmitoylation, on two cysteine residues in close proximity to the transmembrane domain ( Abrami et al., 2008b ). LRP6 acylation influences the conformation of this domain, possibly by alleviating the hydrophobic mismatch between the thickness of the membrane and the length of the hydrophobic stretch composing the transmembrane domain

. Mutation of the palmitoylation sites leads to retention of LRP6 in the ER and ubiquitination on Lys-1403 ( Abrami et al., 2008b ) indicative of its recognition by a quality control mechanism ( Feldman and van der Goot, 2009 ). Once properly folded, LRP6 exits the ER, it transits through the Golgi, as indicated by the acquisition of Endoglycosidase H insensitive complex sugars ( Abrami et al., 2008b ), before reaching the plasma membrane where its signal role takes place. Here we have further investigated LRP6 biogenesis in the ER. We show that newly synthesized wild type LRP6 also undergoes ubiquitination, on the same site ( Lys-1403 ), and that this post-translational modification promotes its folding. For ER exit to occur, ubiquitination must however be subsequently removed. This is mediated by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP19, one of the isoforms of which is tail-anchored to the ER ( Hassink et al., 2009; Wing, 2016 ). It is thought to play an essential role in skeletal muscle atrophy through unclear mechanisms ( Wing, 2016 ). At the more mechanistic level, USP19 has been shown to control the stability of several cytoplasmic proteins such as the inhibitors of apoptosis c-IAP1, and c-IAP2 ( Mei et al., 2011 ), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha ( HIF-1α ) ( Altun et al., 2012 ) and the initiator of autophagy Beclin1 ( Jin et al., 2016 ). Interestingly, USP19 is a target gene of the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) and was found to rescue CFTR ΔF508 from ERAD ( Hassink et al., 2009 ). More recently it was found that USP19 is a key player in a novel misfolded-protein associated secretion MAPS pathway ( Lee et al., 2016 ). We show that USP19 controls the cellular levels of LRP6. In the absence of USP19, LRP6 is efficiently targeted to ERAD. Upon USP19 overexpression, ER exit of LRP6 is greatly enhanced

., 2008b ), could prevent LRP6 from Lys-1403 ubiquitination, possibly through a conformational change of steric hindrance given the juxtamembrane palmitoylation ( Abrami et al.,2008b ). In the absence of palmitoylation, L6 undergoes polyubitination on other lysines and is targeted to ERAD ( Abrami et al. 2008b ). We propose that LRP undergoes two types of ubiquit events with different kinetics : ( 1 ) ubiquit on L-140 which promotes folding, ( 2 ) polyubiquination on other lys which targets to ERAD. These two types of ubiquit events are reminiscent of de-glucidation and deannidation of glycoproteins in the lumen which also occur with different kinetics.-glucation promotes folding of glycosylated protein but if folding is lengthy or fails, deannid takes place and targets the protein to ER. The described ubiquitin-dependent folding system was identified for L6 but likely operates on other membrane proteins. We found that US19 silencing led to a decrease in levels of CM2 ( Figure 4 ) defective of which leads to Hyine Fibatosis ( OMIM #600 ) ( Dequet et al 2009,201 ) Silencing US19 did not affect levels of CM2-related TEM ( Tumor endothelial 8 ) nor those of Transferr and EGF ( Figure 4 ) US19 rescued the CF Δ mutant which is ER substrate (Hassink et 2009 ) US19 also controls proteasis of wild type ( Figure 4 ) Future are required to establish generality of ubiquitin-dependent system determine if has built-in control identify components such as folding-promoting ubiqu ligase putative ubiqu-binding chaper and degradation-targeting ( Figure 4 ) these could exploited control Wnt in disease context.

The final answer is: 

Here is a summary of the research article on the ubiquitin-dependent folding of the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6:

Researchers have discovered a novel folding system that operates on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that depends on site-specific cycles of ubiquitination-deubiquination. This system promotes the folding of the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6 by ubiquitinating a lysine (Lys-140) on the protein, allowing it to interact with a ubiquitin-binding protein that acts as a chaper and provides the protein with time to fold. If folding is successful, LRP is transported out of the ER, a step that is favored by palmitlation. If folding is impaired or delayed, polyubiquination of other lysines takes over and targets LRP to ERAD. This system also operates on other membrane proteins such as CFTR and anthrax receptor 2, which are involved in severe human diseases. The deubiquinating enzyme US19 is responsible for removing ubiquitin from Lys-140, allowing LRP to exit the ER. US19 also controls the levels of other proteins such as CFTR and CM2, which are involved in human diseases. The ubiquitin-dependent folding system has two types of ubiquination events with different kinetics: specific ubiquination on L-140 which promotes folding, and polyubination on other lys which targets ERAD. This system is reminiscent of de-glucation and deannation of glycoprote in the lumen, which occur with different kinetics.
Researchers investigated sex differences in decision-making processes in mice using a two-armed bandit task, a classic value-based decision-making task. Male and female mice had similar accuracy, but achieved this performance via different patterns of exploration. Males made more exploratory choices, often getting "stuck" in exploration once started, while females explored less but learned quickly during exploration. These results suggest sex influences decision-making during learning and exploration more than during stable choices. Exploration is altered in neuropsychiatric disorders, pinpointing neural mechanisms as a translational avenue for sex-modulated vulnerability.

The study used computational tools to uncover latent variables defining decision-making approaches, even in animals with similar performance. Males showed higher exploration levels than females throughout the task, due to extended periods of exploration before committing to a choice. Females showed elevated learning during exploration, making exploratory trials more informative, allowing them to exploit a choice earlier. These results demonstrate different exploration patterns while interacting with the same environment.

Dopamine function modulates decision-making, sex-linked mechanisms often overlooked. Estradi demonstrated acute and chronic effects on dopamine release, reuptake, and binding, enhancing DA release and clearance in females. This could contribute to reward learning in females during exploration. The prefrontal cortex, receiving dopamine, is a brain region to understand exploration and exploitation. Previous study implicated PFC in differences between males and females. It's possible prefrontal dopamine implements explore-exploit strategies via sex-based mechanisms.

Rodent testing assesses cognitive functions, critical for translational in animals. However, classic tasks are species-specific, limiting translational. Emerging trend among researchers adopting tasks with translational rodents, such as reversal and bandit tasks, assess same processes across species and models. Sex-bias the approaches during tasks contribute performance. Males explored more, got stuck in exploration, while females learned during exploration. Females showed elevated learning, making exploration more efficient, allowing to exploit earlier.

The restless band task is an ideal for transl research. Parallel approaches examine explore-exp phenotype in neuropsych disorders, including ADHD, addiction, and depression. Computational permits fine-grained quantification of variability in latent parameters capturing changes in environments. This could identify endophenotypes across disorders and new avenues for rescuing value-based dysfunction.

    Title: Doa10 is a membrane protein retrotranslocase in ER-associated protein degradation
    Abstract: In endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation ( ERAD ), membrane proteins are ubiquitinated, extracted from the membrane, and degraded by the proteasome. The cytosolic ATPase Cdc48 drives extraction by pulling on polyubiquitinated substrates. How hydrophobic transmembrane ( TM ) segments are moved from the phospholipid bilayer into cytosol, often together with hydrophilic and folded ER luminal protein parts, is not known. Using a reconstituted system with purified proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 ( Teb-4/MARCH6 in animals ) is a retrotranslocase that facilitates membrane protein extraction. A substrate’s TM segment interacts with the membrane-embedded domain of Doa10 and then passively moves into the aqueous phase. Luminal substrate segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state. Their unfolding occurs on the luminal side of the membrane by cytoplasmic Cdc48 action. Our results reveal how a membrane-bound retrotranslocase cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in membrane protein extraction.

   ., 2001; Walter et al., 2001 ). Similarly, Ubc6 homologues in plants and mammals have been shown to be unstable and are degraded by the proteasome ( Lam et al., 2014 ). Interestingly, in case of the Arabidopsis thaliana Ubc6 homologue Ubc32, and the mammalian Ube2J1, Hrd1 was identified as the ubiquitin ligase involved ( Burr et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2016 ). Here, we developed a reconstituted system with purified proteins to investigate the role of Doa10 in membrane protein retrotranslocation. This system allowed us to mechanistically investigate membrane protein extraction, without relying on indirect read-outs of downstream reactions such as proteasomal degradation. We show that Doa10 is a membrane protein retrotranslocase. Furthermore, we show how Doa10 cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in the extraction of proteins with folded luminal domains.

. It is unclear whether luminal domains are moved across the membrane in a folded state, if unfolding occurs prior to retrotranslocation, potentially by a separate ER luminal machinery, or if unfolding is directly coupled to retrotranslocation ( Brodsky, 2012; Shi et al., 2019 ). To address these questions, we investigated ERAD mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 from S. cerevisiae. Doa10 is a 150 kDa protein with 14 TM segments ( Kreft et al., 2006 ). Its substrates include single- and multi-spanning membrane proteins of the ER and inner nuclear membrane, but also soluble proteins of the cyto- and nucleoplasm ( Ravid et al., 2006 ). No completely soluble, luminal substrates of Doa10 have been described. The degrons of Doa10 substrates can be cytoplasmic ( Furth et al., 2011; Swanson et al., 2001 ), or within the TM region ( Habeck et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, Doa10 regulates sterol metabolism in plants, fungi and animals by degrading squalene monooxygenase ( Doblas et al., 2013; Foresti et al., 2013 ). Through degradation of mislocalized membrane proteins, Doa10 has a role in maintaining organelle identity ( Dederer et al., 2019; Matsumoto et al., 2019; Ruggiano et al., 2016 ). Doa10 works in concert with two ubiquitin conjugating enzymes ( E2 ), the tail-anchored membrane protein Ubc6 and the soluble cytoplasmic protein Ubc7 ( Swanson et al., 2001 ). Ubc7 is anchored to the ER membrane by Cue1 ( Biederer et al., 1997 ). Experiments with soluble cytoplasmic protein fragments showed that Ubc6 and Ubc7 have different roles in the build-up of polyubiquitin chains. Ubc6 initiates ubiquitin chains by transferring the first ubiquitin moiety, whereas Ubc7 extends ubiquitin chains with mainly lysine 48 linkage ( Weber et al., 2016 ). Importantly, Ubc6 is itself an unstable protein and degraded in a Doa10-dependent manner ( Swanson et al., 2001; Walter et al., 2001 )

. In the Golgi, mitochondria and chloroplasts, membrane proteins are removed from the organelle for proteasomal degradation in the cytosol. These processes are dependent on ubiquitination and Cdc48 ( Heo et al., 2010; Ling et al., 2019; Schmidt et al., 2019; Tanaka et al., 2010 ). Moreover, extraction of membrane proteins also occurs by membrane-bound AAA ATPases that often have not only unfolding, but also proteolytic activity. In mitochondria, Msp1 and the FtsH-related AAA metalloproteases m-AAA and i-AAA are examples for membrane-bound AAA ATPases ( Glynn, 2017 ). For m-AAA mediated extraction into the mitochondrial matrix, a contribution of the TM domain was shown, suggesting a retrotranslocase activity ( Korbel et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2017 ). We propose that membrane-bound retrotranslocases generally contribute to AAA protein-driven extraction of membrane proteins.

. Our data show that Doa10 does not accommodate a folded domain during retrotranslocation. Instead, unfolding of polypeptide segments on the luminal side of the membrane is a direct consequence of Cdc48 acting on cytoplasmically attached polyubiquitin chains. It is unclear if chaperone-driven retrotranslocation of Ubc6 in the absence of ubiquitination or Cdc48 action also occurs in the cell. Genetic and biochemical experiments in yeast showed that degradation of TM domain containing Doa10 substrates, including Ubc6, strictly depends on Cdc48, Ufd1 and Npl4 ( Foresti et al., 2013; Habeck et al., 2015; Huyer et al., 2004; Neuber et al., 2005; Ravid et al., 2006; Ruggiano et al., 2016; Wang and Chang, 2003 ). In the case of the strongly hydrophobic, multi-spanning Doa10 substrate Ste6*, fractionation experiments also showed that the Cdc48 complex is required for the retrotranslocation step ( Nakatsukasa et al., 2008; Nakatsukasa and Kamura, 2016; Neal et al., 2018 ). However, these experiments do not exclude the possibility that a relatively mildly hydrophobic protein such as Ubc6 retrotranslocates into the cytosol in a Doa10-dependent, but ubiquitination- and Cdc48-independent manner. Speculatively, such a chaperone-stabilized cytoplasmic pool would not be a substrate for proteasomal degradation but rather for chaperone-assisted reinsertion into the ER membrane, and might therefore be difficult to detect. Furthermore, as chaperones would only be able to capture a substrate that has emerged from the membrane, we expect such chaperone-driven retrotranslocation to be sensitive to the overall hydrophobicity of the TM segment. Interestingly, several studies showed that chaperones play an important role in ERAD of membrane proteins at different stages of the ERAD process. In yeast, Hsp70 and Hsp40 chaperones promote ubiquitination of Ste6* and a misfolded variant of Pma1 ( Han et al., 2007; Nakatsukasa et al., 2008 )

., 2007; Nakatsukasa et al., 2008 ). In mammals, the Bag6-Ubl4a-Trc35 chaperone complex facilitates ERAD of membrane proteins by stabilizing a soluble cytoplasmic state ( Claessen and Ploegh, 2011; Claessen et al., 2014; Ernst et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2012 ). If such chaperones also act as a sink in a putative Cdc48-independent retrotranslocation process, remains to be determined. Using a reconstituted system, we disentangled different ERAD subreactions, that is substrate recruitment, ubiquitination, retrotranslocation, and membrane extraction. This allowed us to identify two activities of Doa10: retrotranslocase and ubiquitin ligase. The interplay of Doa10 and the Cdc48 complex during the extraction process remains to be further explored. Studies showed that Cdc48 is recruited to the Doa10-complex via Ubx2 ( Neuber et al., 2005; Schuberth and Buchberger, 2007 ). We propose that Do10 retrolocates the TM segment of the substrate into the aqueous phase and C48 unfolds the polypeptide on the luminal side of the membrane. Our results suggest that membrane-bound retrolocases cooperate with C48 in the extraction of proteins with folded luminal domains.

    Title: Drosophila hedgehog can act as a morphogen in the absence of regulated Ci processing
    Abstract: Extracellular Hedgehog ( Hh ) proteins induce transcriptional changes in target cells by inhibiting the proteolytic processing of full-length Drosophila Ci or mammalian Gli proteins to nuclear transcriptional repressors and by activating the full-length Ci or Gli proteins. We used Ci variants expressed at physiological levels to investigate the contributions of these mechanisms to dose-dependent Hh signaling in Drosophila wing imaginal discs. Ci variants that cannot be processed supported a normal pattern of graded target gene activation and the development of adults with normal wing morphology, when supplemented by constitutive Ci repressor, showing that Hh can signal normally in the absence of regulated processing. The processing-resistant Ci variants were also significantly activated in the absence of Hh by elimination of Cos2, likely acting through binding the CORD domain of Ci, or PKA, revealing separate inhibitory roles of these two components in addition to their well-established roles in promoting Ci processing.

    Hedgehog ( Hh ) signaling proteins guide development and help maintain adult tissue homeostasis in both invertebrates and vertebrates ( Hui and Angers, 2011; Ingham and McMahon, 2001; Petrova and Joyner, 2014 ). Aberrant Hh protein production, distribution, and responses are common causes of developmental birth defects and cancer, including holoprosencephaly, limb and digit abnormalities, medulloblastoma, and basal cell carcinoma ( Anderson et al., 2012; Cortes et al., 2019; Ng and Curran, 2011; Pak and Segal, 2016; Petrova and Joyner, 2014; Sasai et al., 2019 ). Understanding the basic molecular mechanisms of Hh communication is the first step in combating these various Hh-related disorders. Many conserved Hh components were initially identified in Drosophila melanogaster and then found to have a mammalian ortholog, including the key transducing protein Smoothened ( Smo ), which is now the target of several anticancer drugs ( Cortes et al., 2019; Ng and Curran, 2011; Pak and Segal, 2016 ). There are also differences between Drosophila and mammalian Hh signal transduction but neither pathway is fully understood ( Briscoe and Thérond, 2013; Huangfu and Anderson, 2006; Kong et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2016; Liu, 2019 ). It is therefore important to understand the fundamental molecular mechanisms involved in the pathway in Drosophila which is well suited to precise and detailed genetic tests conducted under physiological conditions. Hh signaling depends on a complex set of protein interactions, so it is imperative to investigate mechanisms under conditions of normal stoichiometry of signaling proteins in their normal setting. In flies, Hh alters the interactions among a set of core signaling components to elicit the transcriptional induction and de-repression of Hh target genes through Cubitus Interruptus ( Ci ), the singular transcription factor of the pathway ( Domínguez et al., 1996; Méthot and Basler, 2001; Xiong et al

., 1996; Méthot and Basler, 2001; Xiong et al., 2015 ). Notably, Hh can act as a morphogen that signals through Ci to transcribe different Hh target gene products depending on how much ligand is present at the cell membrane. In third instar larval Drosophila wing discs, Hh is expressed in posterior compartment cells and Ci is expressed only in anterior cells, so that Hh signals to a band of anterior cells at the anterior-posterior ( AP ) border with declining strength from posterior to anterior ( Blair, 2003; Lawrence and Struhl, 1996 ). Within this AP border territory, Ci induces decapentaplegic ( dpp ) in a broad region, patched ( ptc or a ptc-lacZ transcriptional reporter ) in a gradient within a narrower domain, and engrailed ( en ) only in the cells closest to the source of Hh ( see Figure 8; Blair, 2003; Vervoort, 2000 ). Hh controls Ci activity by regulating the processing, activation, and degradation of full-length Ci ( known as Ci-155 ). In the absence of Hh, the ligand-free receptor, Patched ( Ptc ), actively inhibits the actions of another transmembrane protein Smoothened ( Smo ), which is present under these conditions at relatively low levels and mainly associated with internal vesicles ( Denef et al., 2000; Nakano et al., 2004; Strigini and Cohen, 1997; Zhao et al., 2007 ). Costal2 ( Cos2 ), a kinesin-family protein, complexed to Fused ( Fu ), acts as a scaffold to bring Protein Kinase A ( PKA ), Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 ( GSK3 ), and Casein Kinase-1 ( CK1 ) to C-155 and facilitate phosphorylation of Ci-155 at a series of clustered PKA, CK1 and GSK3 sites ( Ranieri et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2005 ). This creates a binding site for Slimb, the substrate recognition component of a Cul1-SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, which promotes Ci-155 ubiquitination and subsequent partial proteolysis ( ‘processing’ ) by the proteasome to a repressor form ( Ci-75 )

., 1993 ). Fu protein associations, but not kinase activity, are required for Ci-155 processing; the role of Fu kinase activity in Ci-155 activation is therefore generally studied in isolation by using point mutations in the kinase domain that only eliminate protein kinase activity and reduce Ci-155 activation ( Thérond et al., 1996; Zadorozny et al., 2015 ). Dose-dependent inhibition of Ci-155 processing at the AP border of wing discs might be expected to lead to a profile of increasing Ci-155 levels from anterior to posterior, with maximal levels immediately adjacent to the posterior compartment. However, Ci-155 levels actually peak near the middle of the AP border region and decline substantially over the posterior half where Hh target gene activation is strongest ( Ohlmeyer and Kalderon, 1998; Strigini and Cohen, 1997 ). This decline is dependent on high pathway activity and is absent, for example, in wing discs lacking Fu kinase activity ( Ohlmeyer and Kalderon, 1998 ). The decline in Ci-155 levels has generally been attributed to the transcriptional induction of Roadkill ( Rdx ), also known as Hedgehog-induced BTB protein ( Hib ), the substrate recognition component of a Cul3 ubiquitin ligase, culminating in the complete proteolytic destruction of ubiquitinylated Ci-155 ( Jiang, 2006; Kent et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2006 ). Loss of Rdx/Hib was initially reported to increase Ci-155 levels at the AP border ( Kent et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2006 ) and Rdx/Hib can target Ci-155 directly ( Zhang et al., 2009 ). However, later studies reported that Rdx/Hib can also affect Ci-155 indirectly by modulating Su ( fu ) levels ( Liu et al., 2014 ) and provided evidence that Ci-155 levels in the posterior half of the AP border of wing discs remained low in null Rdx/Hib mutant clones ( Seong et al., 2010 )

. Measurement of processing through Ci-155 levels and generation of repressor activity from UAS-Ci transgenes in wing discs previously showed that processing was absent only when the zinc finger and CORD domains were both removed ( Zhou and Kalderon, 2010 ). To test whether Cos2-binding domains might be responsible for inhibiting Ci-155 activity we generated ci alleles lacking CDN, CORD or both regions. There are no known alterations to the zinc-finger region that affect Cos2 binding without compromising DNA binding and hence transcriptional activity of Ci-155. We induced pka and cos2 clones in wing discs expressing only Ci∆CORD, Ci∆CDN or Ci∆CDN∆CORD. The level of ptc-lacZ in pka mutant clones was similar for wild-type Ci and Ci∆CDN but it was significantly higher for Ci∆CORD and Ci∆CDN∆CORD; it was also higher for Ci∆CORD than Ci-WT expressed from a gCi transgene ( Figure 6A–F, K ). These results indicate that the presence of the CORD domain reduces Ci-155 activity when Ci-155 is not processed in a pka mutant clone, while the CDN domain appears to have no impact on Ci-155 activity. By contrast, ptc-lacZ levels in cos2 mutant clones were very similar for Ci∆CORD, Ci∆CDN, Ci∆CORD∆CDN, and Ci-W ( Figure 6G–H ), indicating that Cos2 does not affect Ci-155 in the absence of Cos2. These results suggest that Cos2 inhibits Ci-155 by binding to the CORD of Ci and that Cos2 and PKA have separate roles in regulating Ci-155 processing and activity. We conclude that H can act as a morphogen in the absence of regulated processing of Ci-155 and that Cos and PK have inhibitory roles in addition to their established functions in promoting Ci-155 processing.

    Title: Calretinin positive neurons form an excitatory amplifier network in the spinal cord dorsal horn
    Abstract: Nociceptive information is relayed through the spinal cord dorsal horn, a critical area in sensory processing. The neuronal circuits in this region that underpin sensory perception must be clarified to better understand how dysfunction can lead to pathological pain. This study used an optogenetic approach to selectively activate spinal interneurons that express the calcium-binding protein calretinin ( CR ). We show that these interneurons form an interconnected network that can initiate and sustain enhanced excitatory signaling, and directly relay signals to lamina I projection neurons. Photoactivation of CR interneurons in vivo resulted in a significant nocifensive behavior that was morphine sensitive, caused a conditioned place aversion, and was enhanced by spared nerve injury. Furthermore, halorhodopsin-mediated inhibition of these interneurons elevated sensory thresholds. Our results suggest that dorsal horn circuits that involve excitatory CR neurons are important for the generation and amplification of pain and identify these interneurons as a future analgesic target.

   ., 2014; Punnakkal et al., 2014 ). Such a limited role for excitatory interneurons is surprising given this population is more than double that of inhibitory interneurons in the region ( laminae I and II ) ( Polgár et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, detailed paired recording studies have also shown that ~85% of the synaptic connections in the DH are excitatory ( Santos et al., 2007 ). Notably, we have recently shown that most calretinin-expressing ( CR ) neurons in laminae I and II exhibit specific electrophysiological, morphological and neurochemical properties consistent with an excitatory phenotype and respond to noxious peripheral stimulation ( Smith et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2016 ). In fact, chemogenetic activation of CR neurons has been shown to cause nocifensive behaviors and dorsal horn activation patterns consistent with mechanical hypersensitivity ( Peirs et al., 2015 ), whereas genetic ablation of these neurons can cause a selective loss of light punctate touch sensation ( Duan et al., 2014 ). Prior work has established that a specific excitatory interneuron population in the deep dorsal horn that transiently express VGLUT3 relays low threshold input to CR neurons ( Peirs et al., 2015 ). In this study, we aim to identify and define the postsynaptic circuits engaged by the CR population and determine the functional significance of these neurons for sensory processing and perception.

Sensory information from the body, including nociception, itch, light touch, and thermal modalities, is first transmitted into the spinal cord dorsal horn, where this afferent input can be modulated, gated and prioritized before being relayed to higher centers for sensory perception ( Todd, 2010; Peirs and Seal, 2016 ). It is well established that alterations to neuronal circuits within the dorsal horn can directly contribute to neuropathic and inflammatory pain, as well as persistent itch ( Basbaum et al., 2009; Braz et al., 2014 ). Despite this being a region of immense biological importance, our understanding of the neuronal circuits associated with particular sensory modalities remains limited ( Todd, 2010; Peirs and Seal, 2016 ). To address this knowledge gap, several groups have recently implicated neurochemically-distinct subpopulations of dorsal horn interneurons with the perception of both acute and chronic pain states ( Duan et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2015; Peirs et al., 2015; Petitjean et al., 2015; Boyle et al., 2019 ). Historically, much of the research effort on spinal circuits has focused on inhibition ( Zeilhofer et al., 2012 ), and a growing number of discrete inhibitory interneuron populations have now been identified as substrates for sensory gating in the spinal cord ( Duan et al., 2014; Petitjean et al., 2015; Foster et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2016; Boyle et al., 2019 ). In contrast, our understanding of the role excitatory interneurons play in sensory processing is far less developed. Generally, excitatory interneurons are considered to provide polysynaptic relays linking circuits dedicated to innocuous and noxious sensory input, with inhibitory populations normally modulating the passage of information through these pathways ( Takazawa and MacDermott, 2010; Duan et al., 2014; Punnakkal et al., 2014 )

. Though not directly assessed, the cellular mechanisms that underpin these observations likely relate to a number of properties in the interconnected CR network. Specifically, CR neurons in this region, as well as the majority of their targets, had an excitatory phenotype and were coupled by excitatory synapses ( Figure 2 and 4 ). Thus, strong activation of this network likely established reverberatory activity among these circuits as proposed by others ( Hachisuka et al., 2018 ), as well as potentially inducing short term plasticity at these interconnected synapses. In vitro recordings of enhanced synaptic signaling in CR neurons and LI projection neurons following photostimulation ( Figure 3 and 5 ) certainly support this explanation, however, future work will be required to assess the relative importance of these observations to extended behavioural responses. The results from this study confirm that CR neurons form an excitatory dorsal horn network that contributes to spinal pain signaling and can amplify pain signals in the absence of peripheral input. The strong interconnectivity of this neurochemially-defined subpopulation in the dorsal horn means they are ideally positioned to alter incoming sensory information prior to its relay to higher brain centers. This capacity is clearly demonstrated in the nocifensive responses elicited by spinal photostimulation. Importantly, however, our work has largely focused on characterizing CR microcircuits and establishing their functional roles in sensory experience by experimental activation using optogenetics. Future work must continue to determine how these circuits respond during peripherally evoked sensory processing, as we have here using halorhodopsin. Finally, our data in SNI animals suggest CR networks change under neuropathic conditions to become more excitable ( Figure 8E–H )

. These experiments also confirmed that lamina I projection neurons, which often received convergent, multicomponent inputs and more reliably discharged APs in response to this input than other populations, are also a target of these cells. These features are consistent with CR-ChR2 neurons initiating excitation that converges on projection neurons. Such excitatory relays have been proposed in the dorsal horn as a substrate for allodynia, where low threshold mechanical inputs are transmitted into nociceptive circuits ( Torsney and MacDermott, 2006; Miraucourt et al., 2007; Neumann et al., 2008; Peirs et al., 2015; Boyle et al., 2019 ), as well as feed forward circuits that supplement excitation during nociceptive processing ( Lu and Perl, 2005; Lu et al., 2013 ). For example, under pathological conditions CR neurons have been reported to receive low-threshold ( Aβ afferent ) input via a population of lamina III neurons that transiently express VGLUT3 and relay this information into nociceptive circuits ( Peirs et al., 2015 ). This work also used cFos labelling and DREADD silencing of various populations to propose a circuit connecting CR neurons to projection neurons in lamina I via polysynaptic connections that included an interposed population of SOM interneurons. In support of this proposal, we find approximately 30% of all excitatory input to lamina I projection neurons are derived from axons of CR interneurons ( Figure 4 ), of which a significant proportion also express SOM ( 86. 5%;±3. 17 ). These findings demonstrate that CR neurons provide considerable direct input to the lamina I projection neuron population, and when considered alongside the CR-ChR2 network interconnectivity, these have the potential to greatly influence spinal sensory outputs. Our findings are in agreement with previous studies which have reported that CR interneurons activate SOM-expressing interneurons, but not those that express PKCγ ( Peirs et al

. Previous work has shown dynophin-expressing neurons provide important gating inhibition to somatostatin neurons ( Duan et al., 2014 ), and given the overlap between somatostatin and CR, dynorphin cells are therefore one candidate population for the polysynaptic inhibition observed here. Similarly, GABAergic enkephalin neurons have recently been implicated in gating mechanical pain ( François et al., 2017 ) and thus may also contribute to CR network evoked inhibition. The behavioral consequence of experimentally activating CR circuits in vivo is striking, with a targeted and multifaceted nocifensive response ( paw licking, biting, lifting, and shaking ) directed to dermatomes predicted by the location of fiber optic implant and initiated upon photostimulation. This response profile is consistent with our previous work showing that CR neurons respond maximally to noxious mechanical stimulation, with some activation also resulting from hindpaw injury ( Peirs et al. 2015 ). Furthermore, the aversive behavior was morphine sensitive, indicating that the response was mediated by nocice, not other sensory modalities such as itch or light touch. The conditioned place aversion was also consistent with previous work showing that activation of CR neurons can cause hypersensitivity ( Peirs et al. 2015 ). In contrast, halorhodin-mediated inhibition of CR interneurons elevated sensory thresholds in SNI animals, indicating that these neurons normally contribute to the generation and amplification of pain. Our results suggest that dorsal horn circuits involving excitatory CR neurons are important for the generation and amplification of pain and identify these interneurons as a potential analgesic target.

    Title: RAB23 coordinates early osteogenesis by repressing FGF10-pERK1/2 and GLI1
    Abstract: Mutations in the gene encoding Ras-associated binding protein 23 ( RAB23 ) cause Carpenter Syndrome, which is characterized by multiple developmental abnormalities including polysyndactyly and defects in skull morphogenesis. To understand how RAB23 regulates skull development, we generated Rab23-deficient mice that survive to an age where skeletal development can be studied. Along with polysyndactyly, these mice exhibit premature fusion of multiple sutures resultant from aberrant osteoprogenitor proliferation and elevated osteogenesis in the suture. FGF10-driven FGFR1 signaling is elevated in Rab23-/-sutures with a consequent imbalance in MAPK, Hedgehog signaling and RUNX2 expression. Inhibition of elevated pERK1/2 signaling results in the normalization of osteoprogenitor proliferation with a concomitant reduction of osteogenic gene expression, and prevention of craniosynostosis. Our results suggest a novel role for RAB23 as an upstream negative regulator of both FGFR and canonical Hh-GLI1 signaling, and additionally in the non-canonical regulation of GLI1 through pERK1/2.

   ., 2012 ) and GLI1-positive cells have been identified in the suture as the main source of mesenchymal stem cells that plays crucial role in suture patency ( Zhao et al., 2015 ). The aim of this study was to determine the role of RAB23 during intramembranous bone development. Previously, it has not been possible to study skeletal development in RAB23 deficient mice due to their early lethality. Here, we generated RAB23 deficient ( Rab23-/- ) mice that survived until embryonic day ( E ) 18. 5, and this allowed us to investigate how RAB23 regulates bone formation. Similar to Carpenter syndrome patients, RAB23 deficient mice exhibited polysyndactyly and multiple craniosynostoses. We show that disruption of Rab23 leads to an upregulation of Pitx2, Fgf10 and Fgfr1b expression, decreased p38 and enhanced pERK1/2-RUNX2 signaling along with elevated osteoprogenitor proliferation. In addition, Hh signaling was amplified with increased expression of GLI1. During in vitro culture, inhibition of elevated pERK1/2 normalized osteoprogenitor proliferation, corrected the aberrant GLI1 and RUNX2 expressions, and rescued the lambdoid suture fusion. Our results suggest a novel role for RAB23 as an upstream regulator of both FGF10-pERK1/2 and Hh-GLI1, and the additional regulation of GLI1 by pERK1/2, to coordinate the initiation of osteogenesis.

The calvarial suture allows us to study many developmental processes that regulate osteogenesis and skull morphogenesis. Normal development is ensured by the correct temporal and spatial coordination of skeletal patterning, mesenchymal stem cell niche regulation, condensation formation, osteoprogenitor expansion, and osteoblast differentiation and function. In this study, we generated Rab23-deficient mice that survive into late gestation and they exhibit multiple suture craniosynostosis. We show that RAB23 regulates the sutural stem cell niche marker GLI1, represses Hh, and inhibits osteoprogenitor expansion. RAB23 also represses FGF10-driven pERK1/2 signaling which has the multiple effect of directly regulating osteoprogenitor development, RUNX2-mediated differentiation and of repressing GLI1. Therefore, RAB23 coordinates suture biogenesis by regulating FGF-ERK1/2-RUNX2 activity, as well as the activation of GLI1. In an attempt to study complex developmental events, we have utilized both primary cells and organ culture approaches. However, one can also take a more cell biological approach using immortalized cells remote from the external factors and by using this standardized approach it may be easier to understand the effects of a specific intervention. This will be help deciphering the role of RAB23, specifically during endocytosis. FGF10 signaling regulates early osteogenesis: it is expressed in the osteogenic condensation, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of several craniosynostotic models ( Twigg and Wilkie, 2015; Veistinen et al., 2009 ). Here, we show that Fgf10, its receptor FGFR1b and the FGF activator Pitx2, are all upregulated in Rab23-deficient calvaria. It is surprising that the FGFR1b splice form, which is normally expressed in epithelia, is upregulated in the mesenchymal suture. However, this is not without precedent

. Here, we show FGF10 upregulates Runx2. Our study revealed that inhibition of pERK1/2 prevented Rab23-/- lambdoid suture fusion by decreasing osteoprogenitor proliferation and GLI1 expression ( Figures 5 and 6 ). We further showed that combined and individual inhibition of GLI1 and pERK1/2 in Rab23-/- calvarial cells downregulated RUNX2 and GLI1 ( Figure 6 ) and that this effect was exaggerated in Rab23-/- cells. Phenotypic analyses of compound Rab23;Smoothened early embryonic mice shows that RAB23 can regulate GLI independently of Smoothened ( Eggenschwiler et al., 2006 ), and the regulation of GLI1 by pERK1/2 suggests a mechanism how this might occur ( Figure 7 ). Non-canonical regulation GLI1 through tyrosine kinase activity has been documented during carcinogenesis, with activation of GLI1 promoting stemness through an increase in transcriptional activity, nuclear localization or protein stability ( Pietrobono et al., 2019 ). However, the non-canonical repression of GLI1 has not been well described in a developmental context. We show that RAB23 represses both FGF and Hh/GLI signaling ( Figure 7 ). RAB23 coordinates suture morphogenesis and controls suture patency through three mechanisms: FGF10-pERK1/2 signaling, the repression of Hh targets through a canonical pathway, and through the repression of GLI1 by pERK1/2. GLI1 contributes in the regulation of the mesenchymal stem cell niche. FGF10-pERK1/2 and also Hh-GLI1 signaling regulate osteoprogenitor cell proliferation.

., 2012 ). The importance of pERK1/2 regulation of RUNX2 during osteogenesis is shown in this study by the reversal of the craniosynostotic phenotype in Rab23-/- mice. p38 has been implicated in the skull phenotypes of craniosynostotic mice where it may regulate the development and growth of cartilage elements ( Wang et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012 ). Opposing roles of MAPK pathway subtypes p38 and pERK1/2 in cartilage development are well documented ( Ma et al., 2019; Oh et al., 2000; Stanton et al., 2003 ). Commonality of etiological mechanisms is suggested by the overlapping skeletal phenotypes exhibited in Carpenter syndrome and Grieg cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome patients as well as their mouse disease models, Gli3Xt−J/Xt−J ( Rice et al., 2010 ) and Rab23-/- ( this study ). Specifically, postaxial polydactyly in the forelimb, preaxial polydactyly in the hindlimb and lambdoid and interfrontal suture craniosynostosis ( Eggenschwiler et al., 2001; Jenkins et al., 2007; Kalff-Suske et al., 1999; Vortkamp et al., 1991 ). Collectively suggest that craniosynostosis and polysyndactyly are overlapping phenotypes of aberrant FGF and Hh signaling. Aberrant osteogenesis and suture obliteration in the Gli3Xt−J/Xt−J mouse is caused by concomitant derepression of GLI3 and augmentation of IHH which activates the osteogenic master regulatory transcription factor RUNX2 ( Veistinen et al., 2017 ). Analysis of early Rab23-/- embryos suggests that RAB23 also has a role in promoting the production of GLI3 repressor ( Eggenschwiler et al., 2006 ). In both Gli3Xt−J/Xt−J and Rab23-/- calvaria elevated Hh signaling results in an upregulation of the transcription factor Gli1, and presumably the mesenchymal stem niche which it labels. Previously, we have shown that FGF10 upregulates Hh and its receptor Patch1 during facial development ( Rice et al., 2004 ). Here, we show FGF10 upregulates Runx2

. To test whether the upregulation of Fgfr1b and Fgfr2b expression was due to the loss of RAB, we inhibited pER1/2 in Rab- calvar cells. Inhibition of pER1/2 resulted in normalization of osteopitor proliferation and reduction of osteogenic gene expression ( Figures 5 and 6 ). We also showed that combined inhibition of GL1 and p1/2 in Rab- calvar cells downregulated RUN2 and GL1 ( Figure 6 ) and this effect was exaggerated in Rab- cells. Phenotypic analysis of Rab;Smthen early embryonic mice shows that R23 can regulate GL independently of Smthen ( Eggw et al,2006 ) and the regulation of GL1 by p1/2 suggests how this might occur ( Figure 7 ) Non-canonical regulation of GL1 through tyrosine activity has been documented during carcinogenesis with activation of GL1 promoting stemness through increase in transcriptional activity nuclear localization or protein stability ( Pietro et al,201 ) However the non-canonical repression of GL1 has not been well described in developmental context We show R23 repress both F and H/GL signaling Figure 7 R23 coordinates suture morph and patency through three mechanisms F10ER1/2 signaling the repression ofh targets canonical and through repression GL1 p/2 GL1 contributes regulation of the mesenchym stem niche F10ER1 and H/GL1 regulate osteopitor proliferation

**Title:** R23 coordinates osteogenesis by repressing FGF-pK/2 and GL1

**Summary:**

Researchers studied the role of Ras-associated protein 23 (R23) in the development of the skull and found that it plays a crucial role in regulating the formation of the sutures, which are the fibrous joints that connect the bones of the skull. Mutations in the R23 gene cause Carpenter syndrome, a condition characterized by developmental abnormalities, including polydactyly and skull defects. To understand how R23 regulates skull development, the researchers created mice that lacked the R23 gene and found that they exhibited polyactly and premature fusion of sutures due to aberrant osteop proliferation and osteogenesis. They found that FGF-driven FGFR1 signaling was elevated in R23-deficient sutures, leading to an imbalance in MAP, Hedgehog signaling, and RUN2 expression. Inhibiting pER1/2 resulted in normalization of osteop proliferation and reduction of osteogenic expression, preventing craniosynosis. The study suggests a novel role for R23 as an upstream regulator of FGF and H-GL1 signaling and non-canonical regulation of GL1 through p/2.

**Key findings:**

* R23 regulates the sutural stem cell marker GL1, represses H, and inhibits osteop expansion
* R23 repress F-driven p/ER1 signaling, which regulates osteopitor development, RUN2 differentiation, and repress GL1
* R coordinates suture biogenesis by regulating F-ER1-RUN2 activity and activation of GL1
* F10 regulates osteogenesis, is expressed in oste condensation, and implicated in pathogenesis of craniosotic models
* Inhibition of p/2 prevented R- lamboid suture by decreasing osteop proliferation and GL1 expression
* Combined inhibition of GL and p2 in R- cal cells downregulated RUN2 and GL1

**Implications:**

* R23 plays a crucial role in regulating the development of the skull, particularly in the formation of sutures
* Mutations in R23 cause developmental abnormalities, including polyactly and skull defects
* R23 regulates F and H/GL signaling, and non-canonical regulation of GL1 through p2
* R coordinates suture morph and pat through three mechanisms: F-ER1 signaling, repression ofh targets, and repression GL1

    Title: Local chromatin environment of a Polycomb target gene instructs its own epigenetic inheritance
    Abstract: Inheritance of gene expression states is fundamental for cells to ‘remember’ past events, such as environmental or developmental cues. The conserved Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 ( PRC2 ) maintains epigenetic repression of many genes in animals and plants and modifies chromatin at its targets. Histones modified by PRC2 can be inherited through cell division. However, it remains unclear whether this inheritance can direct long-term memory of individual gene expression states ( cis memory ) or instead if local chromatin states are dictated by the concentrations of diffusible factors ( trans memory ). By monitoring the expression of two copies of the Arabidopsis Polycomb target gene FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ) in the same plants, we show that one copy can be repressed while the other is active. Furthermore, this ‘mixed’ expression state is inherited through many cell divisions as plants develop. These data demonstrate that epigenetic memory of FLC expression is stored not in trans but in cis.

   . Vernalization is the acceleration of flowering following prolonged cold exposure and is mediated by cold-induced epigenetic repression of the Polycomb target gene and floral repressor FLC. FLC repression requires PRC2 but is independent of DNA methylation ( Finnegan et al., 2005 ), making it a useful system for studying the cis-memory storage capability of Polycomb at a single gene. In vernalized plants, FLC expression is bistable, with the number of cells in which FLC is stably repressed increasing quantitatively with the duration of prior cold exposure ( Angel et al., 2011 ). Cold exposure results in localization of a plant-homeodomain-PRC2 complex ( PHD-PRC2 ) to a small nucleation region within the FLC gene, which leads to locally increased H3K27me3 and co-ordinately decreased H3K36me3 ( Angel et al., 2011; De Lucia et al., 2008; Finnegan and Dennis, 2007; Yang et al., 2014 ). On return to warm, the PHD-PRC2 complex spreads across the gene leading to high H3K27me3 over the whole locus and stable repression ( Angel et al., 2011; De Lucia et al., 2008 ). After cold, H3K27me3 is present at the FLC promoter and gene body but does not spread to neighbouring genes ( Angel et al., 2011; Finnegan and Dennis, 2007; Yang et al., 2014 ). Polycomb-dependent FLC repression is maintained throughout plant development until it is reset during embryogenesis ( Gendall et al., 2001; Crevillen et al., 2014 ). If FLC transcriptional states are defined by concentrations of diffusible factors ( trans memory ), then all copies of FLC within a cell should be in the same transcriptional state. On the other hand, if FLC chromatin states instruct their own inheritance ( cis memory ), then it should be possible for different copies of FLC within a cell to exist in different heritable transcriptional states.

Epigenetic memory can be stored in the concentrations of diffusible regulatory factors that are maintained through feedback loops ( trans memory ) ( Novick and Weiner, 1957; Ptashne, 2004; Zacharioudakis et al., 2007 ; Xu et al., 2009 ). Alternatively, memory could be stored locally in the chromatin environment of individual genes ( cis memory ), in the form of DNA methylation or post-translational modifications of histones ( Moazed, 2011 ). While in both trans and cis memory the chromatin state is inherited, in the former case chromatin responds to the transcriptional state defined by heritable concentrations of the trans-factors, whereas in the latter case it is the local chromatin environment that instructs its own inheritance and is, therefore, the key epigenetic memory element. Whether heritable information can be stored in patterns of histone modifications is a subject of much debate ( Ptashne, 2007; Kaufman and Rando, 2010; Henikoff and Shilatifard, 2011; Petruk et al., 2012; Gaydos et al., 2014 ). Central to this debate is Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ), a key transcriptional regulator in animals and plants. PRC2 catalyses methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 ( H3K27me ) ( Cao et al., 2002 ) and mutagenesis experiments have shown that K27 is necessary for PRC2-mediated repression ( Pengelly et al., 2013 ). DNA replication poses a significant challenge to histone-modification based memory as patterns of modifications must be faithfully transmitted to daughter DNA strands ( Steffen and Ringrose, 2014 ). During replication, maternal histones are shared between daughter chromosomes where they re-associate close to their original location ( Radman-Livaja et al., 2011; Annunziato, 2005 ). Since PRC2 has affinity for H3K27me3, it has been proposed that H3K27me3 on inherited histones could recruit PRC2 to daughter DNA strands in order to similarly modify newly incorporated, unmodified histones ( Margueron et al

., 2009 ). Supporting the hypothesis that modified histones are indeed the key inherited cis memory element, it was recently observed that passage of H3K27-methylated histones to daughter chromosomes can occur in the absence of functional PRC2 ( Gaydos et al., 2014 ). Other studies have suggested that Polycomb proteins themselves are maintained locally through DNA replication ( Petruk et al., 2012; Francis et al., 2009 ). These studies provide valuable mechanistic information about how a Polycomb system could store the memory of transcriptional states of individual genes in cis. However, to definitively demonstrate that memory is stored in cis, it is necessary to show that two copies of the same DNA sequence can be independently maintained in different transcriptional states in the same nucleus ( Bonasio et al., 2010 ). This has been observed in genomic imprinting and in random X-chromosome inactivation. Since imprinting involves DNA methylation ( Ferguson-Smith, 2011 ), and X-chromosome inactivation involves chromosome-wide changes in chromatin structure and nuclear positioning ( Gendrel et al., 2014 ), it remains an open question whether Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can store epigenetic memory. Cis memory has also been implicated in random monoallelic expression. However, studies so far have been limited to genes with naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms ( Eckersley-Maslin et al., 2014; Deng et al., 2014 ) or are performed on fixed tissues limiting conclusions regarding heritability ( Gendrel et al., 2014 ). Importantly, a requirement for chromatin-modifying factors in epigenetic memory does not necessarily imply that memory is itself stored in chromatin. To address the question of whether Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can instruct its own inheritance and therefore constitutes a cis memory system, we exploited the classic epigenetic process of vernalization in Arabidopsis

. However, Polycomb complex binding and H3K27me may not be the only factors that constitute this locally encoded epigenetic state. Specific nucleic acid structures ( Klose et al., 2013 ), non-coding RNAs ( Herzog et al., 2014 ) ( for example the chromatin-associated COOLAIR antisense transcripts at FLC ( Csorba et al., 2014 ) ), and histone variants ( Jacob et al., 2014 ) may also play important roles. Thus, not all H3K27-methylated chromatin should be considered as epigenetically silent. What defines a local chromatin environment as sufficient to confer cis-based epigenetic memory is now a central question in this field. Our methodology of using two reporters to specifically distinguish cis vs trans memory is broadly applicable and should be helpful in this pursuit.

. Inheritance of the ‘mixed’ ON/OFF and OFF/ON states directly contradicts trans memory and instead provides direct evidence of a cis-encoded epigenetic state at FLC. 10. 7554/eLife. 07205. 012Figure 3. ‘Mixed’ transcriptional states are mitotically inherited. ( A ) In a trans memory system, the two copies of FLC are coordinately regulated and only two mitotically heritable states are possible ( FLC-Venus/FLC-mCherry ON/ON, OFF/OFF ). ( B ) In a cis memory system, the two copies of FLC can be maintained in alternative expression states, so four mitotically heritable states are possible ( FLC-Venus/FLC-mCherry ON/ON, ON/OFF, OFF/ON, OFF/OFF ).

    Title: Physiological modulation of BiP activity by trans-protomer engagement of the interdomain linker
    Abstract: DnaK/Hsp70 chaperones form oligomers of poorly understood structure and functional significance. Site-specific proteolysis and crosslinking were used to probe the architecture of oligomers formed by the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) Hsp70, BiP. These were found to consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate binding site of another, attenuating the chaperone function of oligomeric BiP. Native gel electrophoresis revealed a rapidly-modulated reciprocal relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and BiP oligomers and slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive, covalently-modified BiP. Lumenal ER calcium depletion caused rapid oligomerization of mammalian BiP and a coincidental diminution in substrate binding, pointing to the relative inertness of the oligomers. Thus, equilibration between inactive oligomers and active monomeric BiP is poised to buffer fluctuations in ER unfolded protein load on a rapid timescale attainable neither by inter-conversion of active and covalently-modified BiP nor by the conventional unfolded protein response.

    Supporting Text:
    BiP oligomers were observed here to form by engagement of the hydrophobic interdomain linker of one BiP protomer as a typical substrate of an adjacent BiP protomer. This process, revealed by monitoring the accessibility of BiP's interdomain linker to a sequence-specific protease, SubA, and by site-specific crosslinking, is conspicuous in preparations of pure proteins in vitro, and in living cells. BiP oligomerization is rapidly tuned to the physiological state of the cell, and given that oligomerization inactivates participating BiP protomers, the oligomeric form is a relatively inactive storage form of the chaperone that is accessible on a short time scale. Our findings are consistent with a model whereby competition between oligomerization and substrate binding buffers the ER against rapid fluctuations in unfolded protein load in both directions. The interdomain linker of Hsp70 chaperones consists of a short stretch of aliphatic residues, well suited to engage the SBD ( Flynn et al., 1989; Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993 ). A crystal form of bacterial DnaK with cross-protomer binding of the interdomain linker in the SBD shows the engagement of two highly conserved aliphatic side chains of the linker in hydrophobic sites of the SBD ( Chang et al., 2008 ). Given the role of these very same side chains in allosteric coupling between the NBD and SBD, this mode of BiP oligomerization results in removal of the BiP protomers involved from the pool of active chaperones. The proposed architecture of the oligomers ( Figure 1C ) fits well with our finding of a single peptide binding site available in BiP oligomers formed in vitro, regardless of their size ( Figure 2F ). The model fits the observation that oligomeric forms of Hsp70 are holdases rather than foldases ( Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993; Thompson et al

. This simple, mass action-based mechanism for regulating Hsp70 function may exist alongside other mechanisms, such as oxidation-induced domain unfolding, which may promote alternative modes of oligomerization ( Winter et al., 2005 ). Such alternative modes may account for the heterogeneity of DnaK oligomers observed by single particle electron microscopy ( Thompson et al., 2012 ). The inverse correlation between unfolded protein burden and BiP oligomerization appears to break down in the context of ER calcium depletion, which is both a strong inducer of the UPR and promotes rapid oligomerization of BiP. This apparent paradox needs to be considered in the context of observations that BiP oligomerization upon calcium depletion also correlates with less substrate binding ( a feature first noted many years ago [Suzuki et al., 1991] and confirmed here ) and with the observation that calcium depletion-mediated oligomerization slowly draws on the modified, inactive pool of BiP. From BiP's perspective, oligomerization appears to be the primary event triggered by ER calcium efflux. This depletes the pool of active chaperones and disrupts, by mass action, chaperone-client interactions, releasing clients that would otherwise have remained bound to BiP. The ensuing, slower loss of the modified form of BiP is consistent with equilibrium between the modified form and the monomer and its latency is consistent with the need for enzymes to remove the modifications. We do not understand how calcium depletion shifts the equilibrium in favor of the oligomer. In vitro, there is no measureable effect of calcium on BiP oligomerization, in either the ATP state or ADP state or in the presence of the J-factor ERdj3 or the exchange factor GRP170 ( not shown ), yet in vivo, ER calcium depletion promotes such oligomerization

. To explicitly cope with this methodological limitation, we have confined the analysis to the early stages of the perturbations that increase the unfolded protein load in the ER and employed manipulations, such as reduction of disulfide bonds by DTT, that are effective even in the absence of ongoing protein synthesis. Our observations paint a coherent picture whereby enhanced production of unfolded proteins rapidly draws on the pool of inactive, oligomeric BiP to service its growing clientele. Reports of enhanced presence of oligomers in longer-term stressed cells may have reflected the partitioning of excess chaperone produced during the activated UPR ( or its cytoplasmic counterpart, the heat shock response ) but made redundant following resolution of the insult ( Freiden et al., 1992; Thompson et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, activation of parallel chaperones, such as the oxidative stress induced Hsp33 of bacteria, may account for regulated redundancy of the Hsp70/DnaK system, favoring oligomerization through linker engagement in the course of certain stress responses ( Winter and Jakob, 2004 ). The ER is unusual in possessing alternative mechanisms for inactivating its Hsp70 protein, BiP, by covalent modification ( ADP ribosylation ) ( Freiden et al., 1992; Laitusis et al., 1999; Chambers et al., 2012 ) and AMPylation ( Ham et al., 2014 ). The modified form of BiP appears to equilibrate with the active pool more slowly than the oligomers. Together, our observations suggest a hierarchical post-translational mechanism for maintaining balance between chaperones and their clients in the highly dynamic ER ( Figure 12 ). The first line of buffering consists of oligomer formation, as the balance between chaperones and clients tips in favor of the former, and oligomer dissolution, as the balance tips the other way. Conversion of BiP to the modified, inactive form proceeds on a longer time scale

., 2008 ). The inherent limitations and costs of the conventional transcriptional and translational UPR have generated interest in post-translational adaptations with shorter latency that rapidly match chaperone availability to client protein load. One such adaptation, apparently unique to the ER, is the reversible ADP ribosylation and de-ribosylation of the ER Hsp70 chaperone, BiP ( Carlsson and Lazarides, 1983 ). In its ADP ribosylated form, BiP is locked into an inactive state with low affinity for its substrates ( Freiden et al., 1992 ). ADP ribosylation affects residues in BiP that interfere with the allosteric coupling of ATP binding and hydrolysis in BiP's nucleotide binding domain ( NBD ) to the affinity of its substrate binding domain ( SBD ) for unfolded proteins ( Chambers et al., 2012 ), thus targeting the basic chaperoning mechanism used by all Hsp70/DnaK family members ( Mayer and Bukau, 2005 ). A recent study reveals that the same circumstances that promote ADP ribosylation of BiP are also associated with rapidly reversible formation of an ester bond between threonine 366 in the NBD and adenosine monophosphate to yield BiP AMPylation, an inactivation modification ( Ham et al., 2014 ). Whilst the interrelation of ADP ribosylation and AMPylation remain to be worked out, covalently modified BiP is understood to represent an inactive buffer that can be drawn upon in time of need, by removal of the modifications, thereby increasing the capacity of the ER to cope with enhanced unfolded protein burden whilst minimizing the cost of over-chaperoning. Indeed, the inter-conversion of ADP ribosylated and AMPylated BiP to the unmodified active form follows a coherent pattern whereby increased client protein load converts the inactive buffer form to the active one and diminished client protein load pushes modification the other way ( Laitusis et al., 1999; Ham et al., 2014; Sanyal et al., 2015 )

. This discrepancy could be resolved by an ER-localized J-factor whose affinity for BiP as a substrate is increased selectively as ( Ca+2 ) ER declines. Given that the affinity of Hsp70 proteins for their substrates is governed by J-protein driven non-equilibrium mechanisms ( De Los Rios and Barducci, 2007 ), such a factor would shift the equilibrium in favor of the active form of BiP. However, we have no evidence for such factor, nor do we understand how ER depletion of Ca2+ shifts the equilibrium in favor of the oligomer. ER depletion of Ca2 is known to activate the UPR and promote oligomerization of BiP, but also correlates with less substrate binding ( Suki et al. 1991 and here ) and the loss of the modified form of Bi is consistent with equilibrium between the modified and monomer and its latency consistent with the need for enzymes to remove the modifications. We do not understand how Ca2 depletion shifts the equilibrium in favor of the oligomer. In vitro, there is no measureable effect of Ca2 on Bi oligomerization in the ATP or ADP state in the presence of the factor ERdj3 or the factor GR170 ( not shown ) yet in vivo, ER depletion promotes oligization. To cope with this methodological limitation we confined analysis to early perturbations that increase the unfolded load in ER and manipulations such as reduction disulfide by DTT that are effective in the absence of ongoing synthesis. Our observations paint a picture whereby enhanced production of proteins draws the pool of inactive oligomeric Bi to its clientele. Reports of oligomers in longer stressed cells may have reflected partition of chone produced during activated UPR or cytoplasmic counterpart heat shock but redundant following resolution insult ( Fre et al 1992; et 201 ) activation parallel chone such oxidative induced H33 bacteria may account for regulated H70/DK system favoring olig through certain responses ( Winter and Jak 200 ) The ER unusual possessing mechanisms inactivating H70 protein Bi by covalent modification AD ribosylation ( Fre et 199; Lus et 199; Chambers 201 ) and AMPylation ( et 201 ) modified Bi appears equilib with active more than oligomers. Together suggest hierarchical postl mechanism maintaining between chone and clients in dynamic ER ( Figure 12 ) first buffering olig formation as balance tips favor former and olig dissolution tips other conversion Bi to modified inactive proceeds longer scale

Heat shock proteins (Hsp) play a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by preventing protein misfolding and aggregation. However, the structure and function of Hsp oligomers are poorly understood. Researchers used site-specific proteolysis and crosslinking to investigate the architecture of H70 oligomers formed by the ER Hsp, Bi. They found that Bi oligomers consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate site of another, attenuating chaper function. Native electrophoresis revealed a rapidly modulated relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and Bi oligomers, and slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive, coval-modified Bi. ER calcium depletion caused rapid oligization of mammalian Bi and coincidental diminution in substrate, pointing to relative inertness of oligomers.

**Key Findings:**

1. Bi oligomers form by engagement of hydrophobic interdomain of Bi prot as substrate of adjacent Bi prot.
2. Oligomerization is tuned to physiological state of cell, and oligomer inactivates Bi protomers.
3. Proposed architecture of oligomers fits with finding of single binding site in Biomers in vitro, regardless of size.
4. Model fits observation of H70 holdases rather than foldases.
5. Simple action mechanism regulating H70 function may exist alongside other mechanisms, such as oxidation-induced unfolding.
6 Inverse correlation unfolded burden and Bi oligization breaks in context ER depletion

    Title: The near-atomic cryoEM structure of a flexible filamentous plant virus shows homology of its coat protein with nucleoproteins of animal viruses
    Abstract: Flexible filamentous viruses include economically important plant pathogens. Their viral particles contain several hundred copies of a helically arrayed coat protein ( CP ) protecting a ( + ) ssRNA. We describe here a structure at 3. 9 Å resolution, from electron cryomicroscopy, of Pepino mosaic virus ( PepMV ), a representative of the genus Potexvirus ( family Alphaflexiviridae ). Our results allow modeling of the CP and its interactions with viral RNA. The overall fold of PepMV CP resembles that of nucleoproteins ( NPs ) from the genus Phlebovirus ( family Bunyaviridae ), a group of enveloped ( - ) ssRNA viruses. The main difference between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP is in their C-terminal extensions, which appear to determine the characteristics of the distinct multimeric assemblies – a flexuous, helical rod or a loose ribonucleoprotein. The homology suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic ( + ) and ( - ) ssRNA viruses.

   ., 2012 ). The work revealed that N- and C-terminal extensions of the CP mediate viral polymerization and allow for the flexuous nature of the virions. Pepino mosaic virus ( PepMV ) is another potexvirus which has emerged recently ( Jones et al., 1980 ), progressing from endemic to epidemic in tomato crops causing severe economic losses worldwide ( Hanssen and Thomma, 2010 ). PepMV is transmitted by mechanical contact and virions contain a ( + ) ssRNA of about 6. 4 kb ( Aguilar et al., 2002 ). The PepMV CP is strictly required for cell-to-cell movement of the virus ( Sempere et al., 2011 ). We present the cryoEM structure of PepMV virions at 3. 9 Å of resolution. The near-atomic three-dimensional ( 3D ) map allows for accurate modeling of the CP, the viral RNA, and their interaction. In vivo functional studies of several CP mutants confirm the role of several residues in RNA binding and polymerization. Surprisingly, we have also found a clear structural homology between the CP of flexuous viruses and the NP of the genus Phlebovirus, a group of enveloped viruses with a segmented ( - ) ssRNA genome. The NPs from phleboviruses are associated with the viral genome in loose ribonucleoproteins ( RNPs ) ( Raymond et al., 2012 ) protected inside an envelope, in which inserted glycoproteins construct an icosahedral shell ( Huiskonen et al., 2009, Freiberg et al., 2008 ). Despite the divergence of both viral groups, CP from potexviruses and NP from phleboviruses have the same all α-helix fold, and their high similarity suggests a horizontal gene transfer event between these evolutionary distant groups of eukaryotic RNA viruses.

Flexible filamentous viruses are ubiquitous plant pathogens that have an enormous impact in agriculture ( Revers and Garcia, 2015 ). Their infective particles are non-enveloped and flexible rod-shaped virions ( Kendall et al., 2008 ) and contain several hundreds of copies of a coat protein ( CP ) arranged in a helical fashion protecting a ssRNA of positive polarity, or ( + ) ssRNA ( Kendall et al., 2008 ). They are distributed in families Alphaflexiviridae, Betaflexiviridae, Closteroviridae, and Potyviridae, which have different genomic organizations ( particularly different between Potyviridae and the rest of the groups ) and belong to different superfamilies, but it is thought that their CPs have strong evolutionary relationships ( Koonin et al., 2015 ). Structural studies of virions by X-ray fiber diffraction and cryoEM have indeed revealed a common architecture for flexible plant viruses. The filaments are 120-130 Å in diameter, and the CPs are arranged following helical symmetry with slightly less than 9 subunits per turn ( Kendall et al., 2008 ). This overall arrangement is shared by Soybean mosaic virus ( SMV ) a potyvirus ( from the family Potyviridae ), and three different potexviruses ( family Alphaflexiviridae ), Potato virus X ( PVX ), Papaya mosaic virus ( PapMV ), and Narcissus mosaic virus ( NMV ) ( Kendall et al., 2013, Yang et al., 2012, Kendall et al., 2008 ). The flexibility of the virions has limited high-resolution structural studies, and most of the previous data were at moderate resolution. Very recently, the cryoEM structure of Bamboo mosaic virus ( BaMV ), another potexvirus, was determined at 5. 6 Å ( DiMaio et al., 2015 ), and the CP was modeled based on the atomic structure of a truncated version of the CP from Papaya mosaic virus ( PapMV CP ) ( Yang et al., 2012 )

. The location of the C-terminal arm in phlebovirus NPs cannot support a longitudinal assembly, and hence, their RNPs remain more loosely associated ( Raymond et al., 2012 ) than in their plant-virus counterparts. 10. 7554/eLife. 11795. 015Figure 4. Structural homology between PepMV CP and NP from phleboviruses.

The representations include the respective ssRNAs. Both proteins are colored in rainbow mode and their similar topology is clear when their C-terminal regions are removed ( A and C ). Their C-termini are seen in grey color for comparison ( B and D ). PepMV CP, Pepino mosaic virus coat protein; NP, nucleoprotein. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 11795. 015 Both potexvirus CPs and phlebovirus NPs have in common that they bind and protect the genomic viral ssRNA. In other regards, however, these two groups are different and evolutionary distant, no one would have anticipated the structural homology that we have found. The current work provides data that suggest a horizontal gene transfer event between genera Potexvirus and Phlebovirus, or evolutionarily related forms. While potexvirus and the rest of flexible filamentous viruses infect plants, members of the genus Phlebovirus infect animals. Some representatives of the family Bunyaviridae, toposviruses, are transmitted by and replicate in arthropods, and infect plants. A similar type of virus could have mediated the transfer of CP/NP genes between distant groups of viruses with different host range. Whether the rest of flexible filamentous plant viruses share these genes remains an open question.

. Genera Potexvirus and Phlebovirus belong to different superfamilies of RNA viruses when these are classified based on phylogenetic relationships among RNA-dependent RNA polymerases ( RdRp ) and also have different genomic organizations ( Koonin et al., 2015 ). Moreover, the organization of phlebovirus particles is very different. They have segmented ( - ) ssRNA associated with the NP in loose RNPs ( Raymond et al., 2012 ), and these are protected inside an icosahedral shell of glycoproteins inserted in a membrane, as has been observed for RVFV ( Huiskonen et al., 2009, Freiberg et al., 2008 ). The topology of CP from potexviruses and of the NP from phleboviruses ( illustrated for RVFV ) are, nonetheless, very similar ( Figures 4A and 4C ) and show a TM-score of 0. 51 when aligned, pointing to a common family fold ( Zhang and Skolnick, 2005 ). The similarities include: the overall topology of the all-alpha helical domain; the N-terminal arm and its binding site from the adjacent protomer, and hence, the side-by-side mechanism for oligomerization; the groove for the ssRNA binding; and the relative positions of all these elements. The crystallographic studies with phlebovirus NPs have shown tetrameric, pentameric, and hexameric oligomers, in which each NP interacts with the core of the adjacent subunit via an N-terminal arm ( Zhou et al., 2013 ) following the same side-by-side polymerization mechanism shown in potexviruses. The divergence between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP is in their C-terminal regions. The C-terminus in PepMV CP protrudes from the core domain ( Figure 4B ) and allows longitudinal interactions for helix building. The C-terminus of the phlebovirus NP folds back into the core region and participates in the RNA-binding site that incorporates seven bases ( Raymond et al, 2012 ). The C-termin of phbovirus NP is not suitable for longitudinal assembly and the RNPs remain loosely associated ( Raymond et al, 201 ) in contrast to those of potviruses. The structural homology between potvirus CP and phbov NP suggests a horizontal gene transfer between eukotic and ( ) RNA viruses.
Researchers have developed a method, Site, for imaging-based localization of molecular binding sites on cellular surfaces with nanometer precision. The method determines the location of a binding site by calculating the distance between a ligand and a reference signal using topological averaging of high-resolution images. This is achieved by reducing data within an image plane, resulting in a precision of ~10 nm. The method is suited for localization on native cell morphology, unlike existing techniques that are designed for spherical or identical particles. To assess performance, simulated images with varying morphology were analyzed, showing high accuracy for inhomogeneous expression. In vitro, the height of DNA probes on erythrocyte surfaces was measured, validating the method's ability to estimate molecular heights on spherical and non-spherical cells. The method was applied to determine binding locales on protein unevenly expressed on Streptococcus pyogen, yielding viable results. Localization was also performed on widefield images without deconvolution, and results showed agreement with existing method for spherical objects. The method is useful for rapid determination of binding without modification of surface morphology. In silico experiments and in vitro indicate that variation can be minimized by increasing SNR and minimizing biological variability, such as using directly conjugated antibodies. The method is provided in open-source on GitHub.

    Title: Cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia and the role of peripheral resistance
    Abstract: Systemic vascular pressure in vertebrates is regulated by a range of factors: one key element of control is peripheral resistance in tissue capillary beds. Many aspects of the relationship between central control of vascular flow and peripheral resistance are unclear. An important example of this is the relationship between hypoxic response in individual tissues, and the effect that response has on systemic cardiovascular adaptation to oxygen deprivation. We show here how hypoxic response via the HIF transcription factors in one large vascular bed, that underlying the skin, influences cardiovascular response to hypoxia in mice. We show that the response of the skin to hypoxia feeds back on a wide range of cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate, arterial pressures, and body temperature. These data represent the first demonstration of a dynamic role for oxygen sensing in a peripheral tissue directly modifying cardiovascular response to the challenge of hypoxia.

    Supporting Text:
   . All of these genes are involved in cellular adaptations to hypoxia. However, it is unclear how this cellular adaptation leads to more general tissue-specific adaptations to hypoxia. Even less well understood is how a peripheral tissue response might affect systemic responses to hypoxia. To undertake an analysis of that question, using the skin as a model for a peripheral tissue with a substantial vascular bed, we analysed the effect of loss of these hypoxia-responsive genes on the cardiovascular hypoxic response. We began with an analysis of the role of HIF-1α. As described above and shown in Figure 1, there is a decrease in skin temperature in mice lacking HIF-1α in keratinocytes. In these mice, the onset of 10% environmental hypoxia causes a sharper drop in skin temperatures ( Figure 3A ) than that seen in littermate control animals, and temperatures of the skin in HIF-1α mutants remain well below those of littermate mice in the second phase of hypoxic response; they do not recover until the restoration of normoxia ( for statistical analysis see Figure 9A ). Infra-red analysis of skin temperature was also used to monitor peripheral vascular perfusion during hypoxic challenge. The initial drop in skin temperature was comparable between K14cre-HIF-1α mutant and littermate control mice, as shown in Figure 3B. As described above, the HIF-1α mutants are essentially hypertensive under normoxic conditions, and this hypertension is exaggerated in the first phase of hypoxic response ( Figure 3C, for statistical analysis see Figure 9B ). However, in the second phase there is a larger drop in systolic and diastolic pressures relative to littermate control mice ( Figure 3D, for statistical analysis see Figure 9C ). This resolves rapidly, and although the subsequent systolic pressures in mutants are similar to those in littermate control animals, the diastolic pressures in the mutants begin to elevate

. The literature on the response of animals to systemic hypoxia and its cardiovascular effects is limited almost exclusively to studies under anaesthesia. Hence, almost all previous studies have focused on the first ten minutes of the hypoxic response. Radio-telemetry in non-anesthetised non-restrained animals allows a more rigorous evaluation of the changes in hemodynamic variables during the acclimation to environmental hypoxia ( Kawaguchi et al., 2005 ). The work described here demonstrates for the first time that systemic hypoxia induces a tri-modal response: with an initial tachycardia and hypertensive phase that lasts approximately 10 min, followed by an immediate and profound drop in heart rate and blood pressure that can last as long as 24 hr, followed by a recovery to close to a normoxic state. In this context, we show that peripheral resistance and oxygen sensing, in this case in the skin, plays an essential role in this systemic cardiovascular response. These data demonstrate that peripheral tissues can play a fundamental role in cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia.

. We have proposed a model for hypoxic responses involving HIF isoform activity and nitric oxide homeostasis in the skin that argues that hypoxia results in an initial HIF-1α/NOS2/NO mediated increase in vascular diameter, and resulting increases in perfusion; followed by a HIF-2α/Arginase-induced reduction of intracellular L-arginine ( Cowburn et al., 2013 ). As L-arginine is necessary for NO production, this would suppress NO production by NO synthases, and ultimately cause vasoconstriction. This model for HIFα isoform action in hypoxic vascular tissues fits the observations described above for the loss of HIF-1α in the skin. In animals lacking HIF-2α in the epidermis, adaptation of skin temperatures in the first 12 hr of hypoxia follows the predictions of this model ( Figure 4A ), that is, we see elevated skin temperatures in the HIF-2α mutants relative to littermate control animals. These data are supported by infra-red analysis of skin temperature during short term hypoxia exposure ( Figure 4B ). The recorded drop in skin temperature is significantly less in the HIF-2α mutants relative to littermate control animals. Representative photomicrographs show the rapid drop in skin temperature during hypoxia exposure. However, after 24 hr, skin temperatures in mutants drop relative to littermate control animals, and remain lower than those of littermate control animals for 12 hr, before rising again to levels similar to those of littermate controls. Upon restoration of environmental normoxia, skin temperatures in mutants return to levels slightly higher than those seen in littermate control animals, that is, similar to those seen at steady state ( for statistical analysis see Figure 9F ). As shown in Figure 1, mean blood pressures of HIF-2α mutants are significantly lower than those of littermate control animals

. This increased metabolic activity does not return to levels seen in littermate control animals until the mice are returned to normoxia. Physical activity, similarly to the patterns described above, is greatly reduced in littermate and mutant animals during the initial 12 hr of hypoxia. However, activity of HIF-2α mutant animals recovers substantially between 12–48 hr, although it does not fully recover until the animals are restored to normoxia ( Figure 4I ). These results indicate a complex response of the skin to systemic hypoxia, and also demonstrate that that complexity is mirrored in the effect of those responses on the cardiovascular system. The crossover seen in skin temperature and blood pressure at 24 hr also indicates that there is likely a phase of adaptation at that time point revealed by the HIF-2α deletion, and related to a temporally specific action of HIF-2α in the adaptation and response to hypoxia. Given the complex role of HIF-2α in the epidermis, and our hypothesis that this could be determined by the differential effect of HIF-1α and HIF-2α on NO homeostasis, we next analysed the overall levels of NO metabolites induced by hypoxia in specific tissues following hypoxic exposure ( Figure 5 ). As can be seen in Figure 5A, there was a steep drop in plasma NO metabolites over the first day of hypoxia, followed by a more gradual decline over the following 3 days of exposure ( Figure 5A ). However, as shown in Figure 5B, in skin, and in Figure 5C, in lungs, differing levels of expression of hypoxia-sensitive genes involved in the NO synthesis pathway are evident. Of note, the skin shows an initial spike in arginase-1 and -2 expression in the first 24 hr of exposure, which then declines. Skin NOS2 expression over the same time is marginally higher, however. In the lung there is no substantial increase in NOS2 or arginase-1 or -2 expression until after two days of exposure to hypoxia

., 2008 ), and that this directly affects murine systemic blood pressure; it is also correlated with the tonic tensive state in mildly hypertensive humans ( Cowburn et al., 2013 ). Here we show for the first time that keratinocyte HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression affects the immediate, acute and chronic phases of the cardiovascular response to hypoxia. Hypoxia immediately heightens sympathetic tone in the skin to increase peripheral vascular resistance ( Simmons et al., 2007; Chalmers and Korner, 1966; Kollai, 1983 ). Hypoxia also increases nitric oxide release from keratinocytes to stimulate vasodilation and act as a neuromodulator of sympathetic activity, dampening vasoconstriction ( Ramchandra et al., 2005; Sartori et al., 2005; Hirooka et al., 2011 ). The opposing roles of keratinocyte HIF-1α and HIF-2α on nitric oxide synthesis ( Cowburn et al., 2013 ) would suggest divergent effects on sympathetic activity and blood flow in this highly vascular tissue. Epidermal HIF-1α is shown here to have a direct effect on peripheral vascular resistance and the tonic tensive status of the mouse. The opposite cardiovascular relationship is apparent in the HIF-2α mutant mouse. In the case of the HIF-2α mouse, however, there is a significant increase in diastolic and systolic pressures in the second phase of hypoxic response. This suggests that H-2 has a role in vasodilation during hypoxia. This is consistent with the model of HIF-α isoform activity and nitric homeasis in the skin ( Cowburn et al, 2013 ), where HIF-2/Argase suppresses intracellular L-argin, reducing NO production and resulting in vasostriction. In the case of H-2, this would result in vasodilation and increased perfusion. This is supported by the data in the H-2 mutant, where skin temperatures are elevated in the first 12 hr of hypia and drop in the following 24 hr. This is consistent with the model that H-2 has a role in vasodilation during hypia, and H-1 has a role in vasostriction during hypia. This is the first demonstration of a role of peripheral tissue in the systemic response to hypia, and shows that the skin plays a critical role in cardiovascular adaptation to hypia.
Researchers have developed a new method for mapping neural circuits with single-cell resolution by combining temporal focusing of two-photon excitation with spatial restriction of channelrhodin (Ch2) to the soma and proximal dendrites of neurons. This approach allows for reliable activation of individual neurons, verification of action potential generation with genetically encoded calcium indicators, and determination of synaptic connections with patch-clamp electrophysiological recording. The spatial restriction of Ch2 expression to the soma and proximal dendrites enables unmasking of connections from neurons whose somata are close to the dendrites of the postsynaptic cell, and prevents inadvertent depolarization of boutons or fibers that could compromise identifying the source of synaptic events. Ch2 harboring the Kv2.1 motif showed enhanced sensitivity, useful in situations where excitation power is limited. This method significantly enhances the ability to map connections with single-cell resolution. The development of spatial-restricted optogen constructs is one of the most effective means for achieving single resolution in local circuit experiments. This requires identification of a small compartment near the soma with selective expression of particular proteins with motifs for localization. The distribution of voltage-gated potassium channels defines a subcellular along the soma and proximal dendrites, and sufficiency of a short Kv.1 sequence for heterologous to this region made this strategy for restricting Ch2 expression. The alternative is restriction to the axon segment mediated by ankyrin binding present in voltageated channels. This leaves an indeterminate of circuit coinciding the dendors of the neuron, which can extend 200m or more around the soma. The optogen approach could be compromised by unintended activation of fibers or local boutons, which respond to focusing twooton excitation. Exclusion ops from axonal has been achieved by fusing with domains bind myos Va for transporting into dendrites, one motif from melanin sufficient exclude Ch2 from axons and enhance resolution neural maps. The Ch distribution however, remains dendritic and does not solve the problem of undesired activation while stimulating in proximity. To overcome, combined focusing with confinement Ch2 to the cell and proximal dendrites. This took advantage of Kv.1 channel unique localization clusters at soma and proximal dendrites through 66-amino domain in C-terminus drives association myos II and postol transport vesicles for somatic. This signal sufficient Ch2 trafficking retinal ganglion cells. Employed this to target Ch2 soma and proximal neurons in somatosensory cortex and added fluorescent tag identify Ch-expressing for twooton focused beam. Combined soma-target Ch2 with verification potential generation encoded indicator mapping. This allows precise activation brain for construction synaptic maps single without loss connections in region dend of recorded or activation axons. The-stim current declined 10-fold 50m the targeted versus 2-fold non-targeted. Reduced dendritic Ch opens possibility using stimulation recording identify currents nearby. To illustrate, compared distribution direct recorded Layer/ pyramidal in acute somatosens expressing non-target and targeted stimulating points 20m over 300 grid the soma. Stimulation non-target evoked currents 200m often indicative dend ar of cell. In contrast, targeted exhibited significant within 25-50m adjacent cell.

    Title: Negative reciprocity, not ordered assembly, underlies the interaction of Sox2 and Oct4 on DNA
    Abstract: The mode of interaction of transcription factors ( TFs ) on eukaryotic genomes remains a matter of debate. Single-molecule data in living cells for the TFs Sox2 and Oct4 were previously interpreted as evidence of ordered assembly on DNA. However, the quantity that was calculated does not determine binding order but, rather, energy expenditure away from thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we undertake a rigorous biophysical analysis which leads to the concept of reciprocity. The single-molecule data imply that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit negative reciprocity, with expression of Sox2 increasing Oct4’s genomic binding but expression of Oct4 decreasing Sox2’s binding. Models show that negative reciprocity can arise either from energy expenditure or from a mixture of positive and negative cooperativity at distinct genomic loci. Both possibilities imply unexpected complexity in how TFs interact on DNA, for which single-molecule methods provide novel detection capabilities.

    Supporting Text:
    Chen et al. concluded in their paper that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit ordered assembly, with ‘Sox2 engaging the target DNA first, followed by assisted binding of Oct4’ ( Chen et al., 2014 ). As we have seen, this conclusion is not justified by their analysis and the question of binding order remains unresolved. Furthermore, the quantity R which they calculated, although important as a measure of the cycle condition for the model in Figure 1A, turns out to be less informative about their data than the reciprocity introduced in Equation 20. Reciprocity is a quantitative measure of how two TFs influence each other’s genomic binding upon induction of expression: binding changes in the same direction with positive reciprocity and in the opposite direction with negative reciprocity. The experimental strategy of Chen et al., of measuring each TF in turn while inducing the other, can now be seen as a protocol for estimating the reciprocity of any two TFs. Aside from the single-molecule experiments themselves, this protocol involves two stable cell lines each with an inducible expression system. The 3T3 cells were also chosen because they do not express endogenous Sox2 and Oct4. However, it may be possible to account for endogenous TF expression by titrating the induced exogenous TF rather than just maximally inducing it. In effect, this would begin to map out the reciprocity surfaces plotted in Figure 2D and E and Figure 3B, C and D, whose shapes may reveal more about the impact of endogenous TFs. Indeed, much more may be learned by going beyond the simple positive or negative dichotomy on which we have focussed here. What we have found in analyzing the sign of the reciprocity is quite different from ordered assembly. Far from Sox2 ‘assisting’ Oct4, the data of Chen et al

. The data acquired by Chen et al. show that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit negative reciprocity, which means, in this case, that the fractional binding of Sox2 ( ie: the proportion of Sox2-binding sites occupied by Sox2 ) decreases when Oct4 is induced but the fractional binding of Oct4 increases when Sox2 is induced. The statistical significance of negative reciprocity is not as dramatic as for ρ>1—the probability that the reciprocity is not negative is 2 × 10−2—but this remains significant enough to require further analysis ( Materials and methods ). We find that the single-locus model cannot exhibit negative reciprocity at thermodynamic equilibrium but it can do so if the model is away from equilibrium. Hence, on the basis of this model, but by considering reciprocity rather than ρ, the data of Chen et al. do provide evidence for energy expenditure behind the scenes. But there is a further, more subtle problem. Sox2 and Oct4 bind at many loci in the genome, with widely differing strengths and cooperativities. Figure 1A and the single-locus model derived from it represent some kind of ‘average’ view of the underlying genomic diversity. While it is clear how to average a collection of numbers associated to a series of genomic loci, it is much less clear how to average a collection of models. The mathematical legitimacy of such procedures has hardly been studied. We therefore considered a more general ‘genomic-diversity’ model, which accommodates two types of loci at which Sox2 and Oct4 can bind with different strengths and cooperativities. We find that if both kinds of loci exhibit positive cooperativity or both exhibit negative cooperativity, then the reciprocity remains positive. However, negative reciprocity can now arise in two ways

. may be accounted for, by the genomic-diversity model at thermodynamic equilibrium ( Figure 3A ), if Sox2 and Oct4 sometimes help and sometimes hinder each other across the genome. This finding was unexpected. It is not surprising that TFs like Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit different cooperativities at different loci. However, for the variation in sign of that cooperativity across the genome to be relevant has significant ramifications. It tells us that single-molecule data, when coupled to the experimental strategy of Chen et al., provides more information than one might have expected. Indeed, it is remarkable that a single number, Γ=-0. 22, can suggest that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit both positive and negative cooperativity across genomic loci in vivo. However, by the same token, we may need to know a good deal more about how TFs interact across the genome to properly interpret single-molecule data. The implications of this finding will need to be addressed in future studies. In our view, the most intriguing consequence of our analysis is the tantalizing possibility of energy expenditure in the action of Sox2 and Oct4 on DNA. Although much is known about the molecular mechanisms of energy transduction, they have for the most part been treated no differently from all the other molecular complexity that has been uncovered in eukaryotic genomes. As we pointed out in the Introduction, physics offers a more fundamental perspective, in which energy expenditure is crucial for realising functionality that could not be achieved without it ( Hopfield, 1974; Coulon et al., 2013; Estrada et al., 2016; Sharma and O'Brien, 2018 ). Following the energy may offer an organizing principle that can help us rise above molecular complexity and understand the genomic logic behind evolutionary tinkering. It is challenging, however, to be confident of energy expenditure in vivo, especially with indirect experimental methods which average over genomic loci

. First, if the model is away from thermodynamic equilibrium due to energy expenditure behind the scenes and, second, if the model is at equilibrium but the loci exhibit mixed cooperativities, with one kind of locus being positive and the other kind being negative, so that Sox2 and Oct4 both help and hinder each other in binding across the genome. The available data do not distinguish between these two non-exclusive possibilities, either of which could account for the data of Chen et al. Evidence of mixed cooperativity across the genome or of energy expenditure has not previously been found in living cells and suggests unexpected complexity ‘behind the scenes’ in how Sox2 and Oct4 interact on DNA. The single-molecule methods of Chen et al. offer exciting capabilities for unravelling such mechanisms. Two further considerations are important to the broader context of the work described here. First, models are always necessary to draw conclusions from data and the conclusions drawn are thereby contingent on the assumptions underlying those models. These assumptions are subject to interpretation and judgement. This is unavoidable but not always appreciated and we review the implications further in the Discussion. Second, in contrast to model assumptions, it is a matter of fundamental physics that R in Equation 1 does not determine binding order for the model in Figure 1A. There are no assumptions or interpretations under which R could do so. Furthermore, what R does determine is a matter of substantial interest, which is whether or not the model in Figure 1A is away from thermodynamic equilibrium. That these issues have gone unnoticed suggests that the biophysical foundations of gene regulation are not well understood. Indeed, these foundations conceal many subtleties

. This paper is devoted to revisiting their assumptions and reanalysing their data on a rigorous biophysical foundation. In the remainder of this Introduction, we describe in informal language the path that we took and the novel insights that emerged about the interaction of Sox2 and Oct4 on the genome. As an initial check, we asked how much significance could be given to the estimate by Chen et al. that R>1. Based on a conservative statistical analysis of their data ( Materials and methods ), the probability that R≤1 is less than 10−9, so their estimate is highly significant. As for the data themselves, these were acquired by fluorescently labeling each TF and using a variety of powerful single-molecule techniques to follow individual TFs within the nuclei of living cells. These data suggest that the TF moves back and forth between two distinct states, one in which it is specifically bound to sites on DNA and one in which it is not specifically bound. ( The latter state is potentially complicated, involving both diffusion and non-specific binding to DNA. ) This conclusion is supported by a detailed biophysical analysis of the measurement process and the movement of TF molecules within the nucleus. We have nothing to say about this analysis of TF behavior and take it as our starting point. Our concern is with drawing conclusions about what happens on DNA. This implies a fundamental shift of viewpoint, from that of the TF, which is being directly observed, to that of the DNA, which is being acted upon. The data of Chen et. suggest that Sox2 and Oct exhibit ordered assembly, with Sox engaging the DNA first followed by binding of Oct. However, this conclusion is not justified by their analysis and the question of order remains unresolved. The quantity which they calculated, although important as a measure of the condition for the model in Figure 1, turns out to be less about their data than the reciprocity introduced in Equation. Reciprocity is a measure of how two TF influence each other’s binding upon induction of expression : changes in the same direction with positive reciprocity and opposite with negative reciprocity. The strategy of Chen et. of measuring each TF while inducing the other can be seen as protocol for estimating reciprocity of two TF. Aside the single-molecule themselves, this involves two cell lines with inducible system. 3T cells were chosen because they do not express endogenous Sox and Oct. However, may account for endogenous expression by titrating induced rather than maximally it. This would begin to map reciprocity surfaces in Figure 2 and 3, and whose shapes may reveal about impact endogenous. Much may be learned beyond simple positive or negative dichotomy focussed here.

    Title: Gustatory-mediated avoidance of bacterial lipopolysaccharides via TRPA1 activation in Drosophila
    Abstract: Detecting pathogens and mounting immune responses upon infection is crucial for animal health. However, these responses come at a high metabolic price ( McKean and Lazzaro, 2011, Kominsky et al., 2010 ), and avoiding pathogens before infection may be advantageous. The bacterial endotoxins lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) are important immune system infection cues ( Abbas et al., 2014 ), but it remains unknown whether animals possess sensory mechanisms to detect them prior to infection. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster display strong aversive responses to LPS and that gustatory neurons expressing Gr66a bitter receptors mediate avoidance of LPS in feeding and egg laying assays. We found the expression of the chemosensory cation channel dTRPA1 in these cells to be necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance. Furthermore, LPS stimulates Drosophila neurons in a TRPA1-dependent manner and activates exogenous dTRPA1 channels in human cells. Our findings demonstrate that flies detect bacterial endotoxins via a gustatory pathway through TRPA1 activation as conserved molecular mechanism.

   ., 2014 ) and avoidance of bitter and noxious compounds in Drosophila ( Kim et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2010; Du et al., 2015 ). We tested whether TRPA1 mediates gustatory avoidance of LPS in flies. We found that loss of dTrpA1 ( w1118;dTrpA11, Figure 1C and dTrpA11/dTrpA1ins, Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) and pan-neuronal dTrpA1 knockdown by two independent RNAi lines ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1D ) lead to impaired avoidance of LPS. Therefore, neuronal expression of dTrpA1 is required for LPS avoidance. Furthermore, Gr66a-specific knockdown of dTrpA1 abolished the LPS-induced behavior ( Figure 1D ), and restoration of dTrpA1 expression using either of two different dTrpA1 isoforms ( A and B ) in the entire dTrpA1 pattern or only in Gr66a gustatory neurons of dTrpA11/dTrpA1ins flies rescued the avoidance of LPS ( Figure 1E ). Female flies use gustatory detection of non-volatile compounds via Gr66a neurons to select oviposition sites ( Joseph and Heberlein, 2012 ). In a binary oviposition choice assay control females showed preference for control food over food supplemented with LPS ( Figure 2A ). This behavior was lost in dTrpA1-/- flies ( Figure 2A ), upon silencing Gr66a-expressing neurons ( Figure 2B ), and in Gr66a-specific dTrpA1 knockdown flies ( Figure 2C ). Altogether, these data show that LPS is avoided during feeding and oviposition and that dTrpA1 expression in bitter-sensing gustatory neurons is necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance. These data indicate that a TRPA1-dependent mechanism of avoidance of LPS may serve flies to prevent infection with Gram-negative bacteria. Indeed, we found that control animals, but not dTrpA1-/- mutants, preferred laying eggs on control food, rather than on food contaminated with E. coli ( Figure 2D ). 10. 7554/eLife. 13133. 005Figure 2. dTrpA1 expression in gustatory neurons is required for avoidance of LPS during oviposition

In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to the interactions between the immune and nervous systems ( McMahon et al., 2015 ). In particular, there is evidence that sensory neurons can directly detect bacterial components as potentially damaging stimuli, and initiate acute inflammatory and nocifensive responses ( Chiu et al., 2013; Meseguer et al., 2014 ). It has been shown that the Gram-negative bacterial wall component LPS induces hygienic grooming in Drosophila, an important behavioral defense against pathogens, via contact chemosensation ( Yanagawa et al., 2014 ). Thus, LPS may represent important sensory cues of food contamination with Gram-negative bacteria. To test whether LPS can be perceived by flies during food ingestion we used a binary food choice assay ( Isono and Morita, 2010 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). We found that control flies displayed significant avoidance towards food supplemented with LPS ( Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ). Because LPS is non-volatile we determined if this avoidance is mediated by gustatory neurons known to detect aversive compounds ( Gr66a ) ( Marella et al., 2006 ). Blocking neurotransmission in these neurons by expressing the light chain of tetanus toxin ( TNT ) abolished avoidance of LPS ( Figure 1B ), indicating that flies can detect LPS through a gustatory mechanism. 10. 7554/eLife. 13133. 003Figure 1.

( B ) PI for control food of Gr66a>TNT flies and in the corresponding driver-only and responder-only control flies ( n ≥ 6 ). ( D ) PI for control food of Gr66a>dTrpA1 RNAi flies ( n ≥ 4–8 )

. Application of HC030031 reduced the amplitude of currents recorded in the presence of LPS ( 35 ± 4% at -75 mV, n = 6, Figure 4C ), further confirming the TRPA1-dependence of these responses. Previous results suggest that LPS activates mouse TRPA1 channels by inducing mechanical perturbations in the plasma membrane upon insertion of the lipophilic moiety of the molecule ( Meseguer et al., 2014 ). It is conceivable that LPS activates dTRPA1 channels via the same mechanism, but additional experiments are required to verify this. Taken together, our data demonstrate that fruit flies possess a gustatory mechanism underlying the detection and avoidance of LPS. The avoidance of LPS-contaminated food during feeding and oviposition may serve to prevent Gram-negative bacterial infections, potentially compensating for the lack of adaptive immunity in these animals. The fact that this sensory mechanism exploits dTRPA1 suggests a broadly conserved principle whereby these channels play a crucial role in LPS detection by sensory neurons in flies and mammals, regardless of the particular sensory modality involved. Our findings, together with previous evidence of an olfactory-based detection of secondary metabolites of Gram-positive bacteria ( Stensmyr et al., 2012 ), underscore the need to consider the function of the sensory nervous system as a crucial part of a broad mechanistic understanding of pathogen-host interactions.

. Therefore, in order to further test whether dTRPA1 mediates responses to LPS in vivo we monitored intracellular Ca2+ dynamics in the ventral nerve cord of larvae, a preparation that allows better accessibility of chemical stimuli. Application of LPS or the dTRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate ( AITC ) induced robust Ca2+ responses, effects that were strongly reduced by incubation with the TRPA1 inhibitor HC030031 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ). In contrast, HC030031 did not affect the responses to a depolarizing solution containing high K+ concentration. 10. 7554/eLife. 13133. 006Figure 3. dTrpA1 is expressed in a subset of Gr66a-expressing neurons that can be directly stimulated by LPS.

    Title: Zinc finger protein Zfp335 is required for the formation of the naïve T cell compartment
    Abstract: The generation of naïve T lymphocytes is critical for immune function yet the mechanisms governing their maturation remain incompletely understood. We have identified a mouse mutant, bloto, that harbors a hypomorphic mutation in the zinc finger protein Zfp335. Zfp335bloto/bloto mice exhibit a naïve T cell deficiency due to an intrinsic developmental defect that begins to manifest in the thymus and continues into the periphery, affecting T cells that have recently undergone thymic egress. The effects of Zfp335bloto are multigenic and cannot be attributed to altered thymic selection, proliferation or Bcl2-dependent survival. Zfp335 binds to promoter regions via a consensus motif, and its target genes are enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. Restoring the expression of one target, Ankle2, partially rescues T cell maturation. These findings identify Zfp335 as a transcription factor and essential regulator of late-stage intrathymic and post-thymic T cell maturation.

    In this study, we identify a novel role for Zfp335 as an essential regulator of T cell maturation. By analyzing mice with a hypomorphic missense mutation in a C2H2 zinc finger of Zfp335, we reveal a selective defect in the accumulation of naïve T cells resulting from a maturation block in SP thymocytes and recent thymic emigrants. In line with another recent study ( Yang et al., 2012 ), we have shown that Zfp335 regulates transcription by binding to promoters of target genes. We have identified a set of direct targets in thymocytes and provide evidence that Zfp335 occupancy at a small subset of target sites was significantly decreased in mutant T cells. Zfp335 target genes were enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. In addition, we identified a new DNA recognition motif that is bound by Zfp335. Taken together, our findings suggest that Zfp335 acts as a novel transcription factor required for regulating expression of multiple genes required for late stage naïve T cell maturation. We provide evidence that Zfp335 regulates T cell maturation in part by promoting Ankle2 transcription. A study in Caenorhabditis elegans and HeLa cells showed a role for Ankle2 in nuclear envelope reassembly by promoting dephosphorylation of BAF during mitotic exit ( Asencio et al., 2012 ). As we found no significant defects in proliferation ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) and did not detect nuclear envelope abnormalities in blt/blt mature SP thymocytes by immunofluorescence microscopy ( data not shown ), it is likely that the requirement for Ankle2 is dependent on some other as-yet-unknown function of this protein. To our knowledge, this is the first time an in vivo role for Ankle2 has been reported, and a more detailed understanding of its function and mechanism of action in T cells will be an important subject for future studies

. according to the parameters we applied to our data set ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ) identified the motif shown in Figure 7A. These observations suggest that the discrepancy between our and the previously reported motif arises from differences in motif finding strategy. Importantly, the identification of a common motif in these distinct data sets strongly suggests that this sequence element is recognized by Zfp335 in a diversity of cell types. To understand which direct targets of Zfp335 were functionally relevant to the T cell maturation defect in blt/blt mice, we focused our efforts on a set of genes for which we had clear evidence of reduced Zfp335 occupancy and mRNA expression, the most prominent of which was Ankle2 ( ankyrin repeat and LEM domain-containing protein 2 ). Zfp335 binding to the Ankle2 promoter was effectively abolished in blt/blt thymocytes ( Figure 6A, D ) ; this was accompanied by decreased transcript expression across multiple stages of T cell development ( Figure 8A ) and consequently, a virtual absence of Ankle2 protein ( Figure 8B ). Exogenous expression of Zfp335 significantly increased Ankle2 mRNA levels in blt/blt T cells ( Figure 8C ), providing evidence that Zfp335 is both necessary and sufficient for Ankle2 expression. 10. 7554/eLife. 03549. 021Figure 8. Ankle2 is a functional target gene of Zfp335 and its dysregulation by Zfp335R1092W contributes to the maturation defect in blt/blt T cells.

. As discussed earlier, our data that only a small number of target genes are significantly deregulated suggests that other aspects of the Zfp335-dependent transcriptional program may remain sufficiently intact to allow most developmental processes, except for T cell maturation, to proceed relatively normally. For future studies, it will be important to test whether a null allele has additional consequences for immune regulation beyond the selective T cell maturation effects revealed by the bloto mutation. Genome-wide, we estimate that there are more than 2000 promoter regions containing Zfp335 motif sites. Our study detected approximately 150 ChIP-seq peaks in thymocytes, consistent with the generally accepted principle that additional molecular requirements beyond DNA sequence preference determine the stability of transcription factor binding to a given site. At this early stage, it is not known what these requirements are for Zfp335, but they are likely to involve local chromatin context and interactions with co-binding partners which remain to be defined. It is also unclear whether Zfp335 displays cell type-specific binding patterns, which may allow Zfp335 to fulfill various developmental roles by regulating different gene expression programs. Finally, although it has been proposed that Zfp335 activates target genes by recruiting H3K4 methyltransferases ( Yang et al., 2012 ), it is not clear if this is the sole mechanism, or that Zfp335 functions exclusively as a transcriptional activator. Consistent with the view that Zfp335 drives transcriptional activation, we observed that most target genes with deregulated expression in blt/blt thymocytes tended to be downregulated. However, we have noted exceptions in which some target genes—including Zfp335 itself—were modestly upregulated, suggesting the possibility that Zfp335 may also act as a repressor

. The T cell deficiency in blt/blt mice does not appear to be a consequence of defects in thymic selection, proliferation, or IL-7Rα expression, but is associated with reduced viability of mature SP thymocytes and recent thymic emigrants. Our finding that BCL2 overexpression failed to rescue the relative deficiency in blt/blt T cells, together with the unaltered expression of Bcl2 family genes ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2A ) or other well-defined pro-apoptotic genes such as members of the death receptor family ( data not shown ), suggests Zfp335 has an indirect and likely multigenic pro-survival influence. Although our data do not provide support for altered thymic selection being an explanation for the reduced T cell numbers in blt/blt mice, we cannot exclude the possibility that the selection of some T cell specificities is affected by the Zfp335 mutation and future deep sequencing studies will be needed to fully address this issue. The intact proliferation of blt/blt T cells contrasts with the defective proliferation of human lymphoblastic cells and neuronal stem cells carrying a H1111R mutation in ZFP335 ( ZNF335 ) ( Yang et al., 2012 ). We suspect that this difference is a consequence of the almost complete loss of protein caused by the H1111R mutation, compared to the more subtle influence of the R1092W mutation studied here. Naïve T cell deficiencies have been observed in several mouse lines with deletions in genes related to NF-κB signaling, such as RelB ( Guerin et al., 2002 ), NEMO ( Schmidt-Supprian et al., 2003 ), c-FLIP ( Zhang and He, 2005 ), TAK1 ( Sato et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Wan et al., 2006 ), and IKK2 ( Schmidt-Supprian et al., 2003; Silva et al., 2014 ). However, the expression of these genes was not altered in blt/blt T lymphocytes and we did not detect enrichment for NF-κB targets in the gene expression analysis ( data not shown )

. If we extend this observation to the genome-wide level to assume that Zfp335R1092W-induced transcriptional dysregulation contributes to the T cell maturation defect in bl/bl mice.

    Title: Avoidance of stochastic RNA interactions can be harnessed to control protein expression levels in bacteria and archaea
    Abstract: A critical assumption of gene expression analysis is that mRNA abundances broadly correlate with protein abundance, but these two are often imperfectly correlated. Some of the discrepancy can be accounted for by two important mRNA features: codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. We present a new global factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, and provide evidence that avoidance increases translational efficiency. We also demonstrate a strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes, and that these have a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we demonstrate that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance. Therefore, taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance.

   . In conclusion, our results indicate that the specificity of prokaryotic ncRNAs for target mRNAs is the result of selection both for a functional interaction and against stochastic interactions. Our experimental results support the view that stochastic interactions are selected against, due to deleterious outcomes on expression. We suspect avoidance of crosstalk interactions has several evolutionary consequences. First, as transcriptional outputs become more diverse in evolution, we expect that the probability of stochastic interactions for both new ncRNAs and mRNAs becomes higher. This will impact the emergence of new, high abundance RNAs, since selection for high abundance may be mitigated by deleterious crosstalk events. Second, we predict that stochastic interactions limit the number of simultaneously transcribed RNAs, since the combinatorics of RNA:RNA interactions imply that eventually stochastic interactions cannot be avoided. This may in turn drive selection for forms of spatial or temporal segregation of transcripts. Finally, taking codon usage, mRNA secondary structure and potential mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account allows better prediction of proteome outputs from genomic data, and informs the precise control of protein levels via manipulation of synonymous mRNA sequences ( Figure 2—figure supplement 5 ).

., 2014; Lu et al., 2007 ). We computed Spearman’s correlation coefficients between protein abundances and extrinsic avoidance, 5´ end internal mRNA secondary structure and codon usage. Of the three measures, avoidance is significantly correlated in all four datasets ( Spearman’s rho values are between 0. 11–0. 17 and corresponding p-values are between 0. 01 and 1. 3 × 10–12 ). In contrast, 5´ end mRNA structure significantly correlates in two datasets, and codon usage significantly correlates in all four datasets. This indicates that, despite strong selection against stochastic interactions, such interactions do significantly impact the proteome ( Figure 2A and Supplementary file 3 ). We have also conducted an ‘outlier analysis’ on one of the E. coli datasets ( Laurent et al., 2010 ). We have selected the top and bottom-most expressed genes relative to mRNA expression levels and computed Z-scores for each of codon-usage, internal secondary structure and avoidance measures. We found that avoidance measures show the most extreme shifts downwards for the bottom-most expressed genes and is shifted the highest for the top-most genes ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 13479. 006Figure 2. mRNA attributes have different impacts on protein abundance. ( A ) This heatmap summarizes the effect sizes of four mRNA attributes ( avoidance of mRNA:ncRNA interaction, 5´ end secondary structure, codon bias and mRNA abundance ) on protein expression as Spearman’s correlation coefficients, which are represented in gradient colors, while a starred block shows if the associated correlation is significant ( p<0. 05 ). ( B ) GFP expression correlates with optimized codon selection, measured by CAI ( Rs = 0. 29, p=0. 016 ). ( C ) GFP expression correlates with 5′ end secondary structure of mRNAs, measured by 5’ end intramolecular folding energy ( Rs = 0. 34, p=0. 006 )

. Our tests for avoidance can be divided into three main parts; ( 1 ) evolutionary conservation analyses to detect energy shifts in bacterial and archaeal genomes relative to dinucleotide shuffled negative controls, ( 2 ) analyses of proteomics, transcriptomics and GFP transformation data to predict the effect size of avoidance on protein expression and lastly ( 3 ) the application of avoidance hypothesis to design synonymous mRNAs that either produce high or low levels of corresponding protein. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 13479. 011 We also test how mRNA:ncRNA crosstalk impacts the translation of transformed mRNAs that have not coevolved with the ncRNA repertoire ( low avoidance mRNAs are rare in native datasets ). We examined two available E. coli-based GFP experimental datasets ( Goodman et al., 2013; Kudla et al., 2009 ), where synonymous mRNAs are generated for a GFP reporter gene. This enables the assessment of the impact of synonymous changes on protein abundance using fluorescence. Avoidance and mRNA secondary structure are both significantly correlated with fluorescence, whereas codon usage is not ( Spearman’s rho values are 0. 11 and 0. 65, the corresponding p-values are 3. 17 × 10−41 and 1. 69–20 ) ( Figure 2A ). Note that one of the GFP datasets ( Goodman et al., 2013 ) uses native E. coli mRNA 5´ ends for their constructs, whereas the other GFP dataset ( Kudla et al., 2009 ) is randomly generated. We observe that the influence of avoidance on gene expression for randomly sampled synonymous mRNAs is strong ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ), while endogenous gene expression is limited. Presumably, due to negative selection pruning low avoidance mRNAs from the gene pool ( Figure 2A ). For each of the seven datasets described above we have tested linear models of measures of mRNA levels, codon usage, internal secondary structure and avoidance ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and Supplementary file 5 )

. Measuring only extrinsic avoidance ( using shuffled mRNAs as negative controls ), we found that stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions are significantly underrepresented in most ( 73% ) of the prokaryotic phyla ( p<0. 05, one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test ) ( Figure 1B, C and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). This indicates that there is selection against stochastic interactions in both bacteria and archaea. We next sought to establish the degree to which intrinsic G+C features of RNAs lead to avoidance of stochastic interactions ( Figure 1D and 1—figure supplement 3 ). We computed Spearman’s correlation between mRNA abundances and three intrinsic features: avoidance, 5 end secondary structure and cod usage. Of the three, avoidance is significantly correlated in all datasets ( Spearman rho are between 0.11 and 0.17 and p-values between 0.01 and 1  ×10−12 ). In contrast, 5 end structure significantly correlates in two datasets and cod usage in four. This indicates that despite selection against stochastic interactions, interactions significantly impact the proteome ( Figure 1 and Supplementary 3 ). We also conducted an outlier analysis on one of E. coli dataset ( Laurent et al,201 ). We selected the top and bottom expressed genes relative to mRNA levels and computed Z-scores for each cod-usage, secondary and avoidance measures. We found avoidance measures the most shifts for bottom expressed and highest for top ( Figure— supplement ).

    Title: Dynamic neuromuscular remodeling precedes motor-unit loss in a mouse model of ALS
    Abstract: Despite being an early event in ALS, it remains unclear whether the denervation of neuromuscular junctions ( NMJ ) is simply the first manifestation of a globally degenerating motor neuron. Using in vivo imaging of single axons and their NMJs over a three-month period, we identify that single motor-units are dismantled asynchronously in SOD1G37R mice. We reveal that weeks prior to complete axonal degeneration, the dismantling of axonal branches is accompanied by contemporaneous new axonal sprouting resulting in synapse formation onto nearby NMJs. Denervation events tend to propagate from the first lost NMJ, consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible. These results show that NMJ denervation in ALS is a complex and dynamic process of continuous denervation and new innervation rather than a manifestation of sudden global motor neuron degeneration.

    Supporting Text:
    Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by upper and lower motor neuron ( MN ) loss. Loss of neuromuscular junctions ( NMJs ) is a key pathological event in ALS patients ( Fischer et al., 2004; Killian et al., 1994 ) and in animal models of the disease ( Clark et al., 2016; Fischer et al., 2004; Frey et al., 2000; Pun et al., 2006; Tallon et al., 2016 ). Denervation of NMJs is observed prior to symptom onset ( Clark et al., 2016; Fischer et al., 2004; Pun et al., 2006; Tallon et al., 2016; Vinsant et al., 2013 ) and before any significant MN axonal or cell body loss ( Fischer et al., 2004; Vinsant et al., 2013 ). However, whether early NMJ denervation arises from local branch-specific degeneration ( ‘dying-back hypothesis’ ) or is merely the manifestation of a diseased and globally degenerating motor neuron remains ill-defined. There is considerable evidence which suggests that a subset of degenerating motor-units ( MU, a motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates ) swiftly lose their NMJs while a distinct, yet unaffected, population compensates via axonal sprouting ( Pun et al., 2006; Schaefer et al., 2005 ), somewhat akin to a nerve injury. Indeed, NMJs innervated by fast-fatigable MNs are lost early, followed by fast-fatigue resistant and slow MNs ( Frey et al., 2000; Pun et al., 2006 ). This is further supported by electromyographic ( EMG ) recordings showing that the number of MUs declines in parallel with muscle strength ( Azzouz et al., 1997; Dantes and McComas, 1991; Hegedus et al., 2007; Hegedus et al., 2008; Kennel et al., 1996; McComas et al., 1971 ) and that surviving MUs increase in size in animal models and in patients ( Dantes and McComas, 1991; Dengler et al., 1990; McComas et al., 1971; Schmied et al., 1999 )

Overall, this detailed in vivo analysis reveals a previously unsuspected dynamism at the NMJ in an animal model of ALS. Our findings highlight a long temporal window between early branch-specific dismantling and global motor axon degeneration which could be therapeutically exploited in ALS ( Arbour et al., 2017; Moloney et al., 2014 ).

. From a therapeutic viewpoint, this distinction is of high importance since it could pinpoint the NMJ as an accessible target that can be exploited within a time window between the onset of structural changes and the global degeneration of the MU, as previously suggested ( Cantor et al., 2018; Miyoshi et al., 2017; Pérez-García and Burden, 2012 ). Here, we used longitudinal repeated in vivo imaging of single motor neuron axonal arbors and their NMJs to directly assess the time course and dynamics of structural changes during ALS progression. We predict that a MU-dependent mechanism would result in the more or less synchronous degeneration of the whole MU over a brief period, while a contribution of local neuromuscular changes would result in the asynchronous loss of NMJs within a single MU.

., 1971; Schmied et al., 1999 ). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the loss of NMJs within a single MU is a dichotomous and mostly synchronous event and that local synaptic events have a limited impact on the denervation process. Under this monotonic paradigm, degenerating MUs are irrevocably caught in a degenerative cascade while surviving MUs attempt to compensate, consequently undermining the relevance of the NMJ as a disease-modifying therapeutic target. However, the rescue of neuronal loss in SOD1 mice does not necessarily improve NMJ denervation ( Gould et al., 2006; Parone et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2007 ) suggesting that local branch-specific events may play a key role in NMJ denervation. In ALS, local alterations of synaptic function and molecular signaling take place very early at the NMJ ( Arbour et al., 2015; De Winter et al., 2006; Jokic et al., 2006; Rocha et al., 2013; Taetzsch et al., 2017; Tremblay et al., 2017 ), implying that local, MU-independent, structural changes could occur. Finally, ALS is a non-cell autonomous disease where cell types other than motor neurons contribute to the disease pathogenesis ( Boillée et al., 2006a; Ilieva et al., 2009 ). Contribution of various cell types known to interact with NMJs and motor axons has been suggested ( Arbour et al., 2015; Chiu et al., 2009; Keller et al., 2009; Lobsiger et al., 2009; Loeffler et al., 2016; Nardo et al., 2016; Turner et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012 ), which could contribute to NMJ loss. In this scenario, asynchronous branch-specific synaptic changes would take place over time within single MUs. Altogether, these divergent paradigms highlight that the precise sequence of events taking place at the NMJ in ALS remains ill-defined

., 2011; Schaefer et al., 2005; Turney et al., 2012 ), our results show that NMJs of WT mice remained innervated by the same MU and were very stable over long periods of time. We next performed imaging in symptomatic SOD1G37R/YFP animals ( all animals at or past disease onset ) to investigate whether the pattern of NMJ denervation in ALS mice was synchronous or asynchronous. Of note, SOD1G37R/YFP mice were phenotypically and histologically indistinguishable from SOD1G37R mice ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ), showing that YFP expression did not alter the disease course and that YFP-expressing MNs are not more susceptible to the disease. We found that YFP-labeled nerve terminals gradually retracted from some nAChR-rich postsynaptic sites ( Figure 2A–C, for example, NMJ A1, A3, A4 ) while other axonal branches remained perfectly overlapped ( e. g. NMJ A2 ). Some NMJs were even re-innervated by the MU ( Figure 2A, A4 inset, arrowhead, see below for more details ) further suggesting that the MU arborization was not globally degenerating at this stage. Strikingly, most MUs in SOD1 mutant mice ( 16/19 arbors, 10/11 animals ) behaved in a similar fashion, that is, losing NMJs over several imaging sessions rather than abruptly. These include partial ( 29/253 imaged NMJs, 12/19 arbors ) and complete NMJ losses ( 38/253 imaged NMJs, 10/19 arbors ). Thus, NMJ loss within a single MU starts as a slow asynchronous process, occurring independently of axonal degeneration. A number of visualized motor axons and their remaining NMJs were eventually lost in a synchronous manner ( 7/19 MU arbors, 5/11 mice; Figure 3A ) showing that global MU degeneration ultimately occurs. This phenomenon likely reflects an axonal or central event, such as MN death. Importantly, signs of NMJ denervation preceded most of these MU degenerations ( Figure 3B, 6/7 MU arbors )

    Researchers investigated the dynamics of neuromuscular junction (NM) remodeling in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using in vivo imaging of single axons and their NMJs over a three-month period. They found that motor units (MU) are dismantled asynchronously in SOD1G37 mice, with weeks prior to axonal degeneration, the dismantling of axonal branches is accompanied by contemporaneous axonal sprouting resulting in synapse formation onto NMJs. Denervation events tend to propagate from the first NM, consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible. These results show that NM denervation in ALS is a complex process of continuous denervation and new innervation rather than a manifestation of global motor degeneration.

    NM loss is a key pathological event in ALS patients and animal models of the disease, observed prior to symptom onset and significant axonal or cell loss. However, whether NM denervation arises from local-specific degeneration or global degenerating motor neuron remains unclear. There is evidence that subset degenerating MUs lose NM while unaffected compensate via axonal sprouting, akin to nerve injury. NM innervated by fast-fatigable MUs are lost, followed by fast-fatigue and slow MUs. Electromyographic recordings show number MUs decline parallel muscle strength and surviving MUs increase in animal and patients.

    This study reveals a previously unsuspected dynamism at NM in animal ALS, highlighting a temporal window between branch-specific dismantling and motor degeneration that could be therapeutically exploited. The distinction is important since could pinpoint NM as target that be exploited within time between onset structural and degeneration MU, previously suggested. Researchers used longitudinal in vivo imaging single neuron arbors and NM to assess time and dynamics structural changes during progression. They predict MU-dependent would result deg of whole over brief, while contribution local neuus changes result loss NM within single.

    Title: Estrogen receptor alpha in the brain mediates tamoxifen-induced changes in physiology in mice
    Abstract: Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy improves survival in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, long-term treatment comes with side effects that impact health and quality of life, including hot flashes, changes in bone density, and fatigue. Partly due to a lack of proven animal models, the tissues and cells that mediate these negative side effects are unclear. Here, we show that mice undergoing tamoxifen treatment experience changes in temperature, bone, and movement. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that tamoxifen treatment induces widespread gene expression changes in the hypothalamus and preoptic area ( hypothalamus-POA ). These expression changes are dependent on estrogen receptor alpha ( ERα ), as conditional knockout of ERα in the hypothalamus-POA ablates or reverses tamoxifen-induced gene expression. Accordingly, ERα-deficient mice do not exhibit tamoxifen-induced changes in temperature, bone, or movement. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the effects of tamoxifen on the hypothalamus-POA and indicate that ERα mediates several physiological effects of tamoxifen treatment in mice.

    Supporting Text:
    Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that exerts antiproliferative effects on cancer cells through ERα ( Davies et al., 2011 ), but can exert agonistic or antagonistic effects on the different estrogen receptors depending on cell type and context ( Watanabe et al., 1997; Mo et al., 2013 ). The hypothalamus-POA is rich in estrogen receptor expression, making it a prime candidate as a tamoxifen target ( Merchenthaler et al., 2004; Gofflot et al., 2007; Matsuda et al., 2013; Saito et al., 2016 ). Here, we take the first steps to define the cell types and cellular mechanisms that mediate some of the undesirable side effects experienced by people undergoing tamoxifen therapy. We demonstrate the utility of mice as a good model to study many of tamoxifen’s physiological effects; tamoxifen administration in mice increases heat dissipation, decreases movement, and increases bone density. These effects are similar to those experienced by people receiving tamoxifen therapy, who experience hot flashes, lethargy, and changes in bone density, among other symptoms ( Love et al., 1991; Powles et al., 1996; Fisher et al., 1998; Loprinzi et al., 2000; Haghighat et al., 2003; Howell et al., 2005; Kligman and Younus, 2010; Francis et al., 2015 ). Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we find that tamoxifen alters transcriptomes in the hypothalamus-POA, consistent with the hypothesis that tamoxifen treatment alters central nervous system function ( Eberling et al., 2004; Gibbs et al., 2014; Denk et al., 2015 ). Indeed, tamoxifen and its metabolites are detectable and up to 46-fold higher in the brain than in serum of breast cancer patients ( Lien et al., 1991 ). We report that tamoxifen treatment affects gene expression in many cell types but most strongly in neurons and ependymal cells. These findings are consistent with previous reports of tamoxifen-induced gene expression changes within neurons ( López et al

., 2019 ), leaving the hypothalamus-POA as the most likely mediator of the ERα-dependent physiological effects of tamoxifen reported here. Despite this, it is very likely that peripheral tissues are also affected by systemic tamoxifen administration, leading to other physiological effects that we did not examine. Indeed, there is evidence that estrogen suppression therapies, including tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, can lead to the dysregulation of energy balance and glucose homeostasis in humans and when modeled in rodents ( López et al., 2006; Lampert et al., 2013; Ceasrine et al., 2019; Scalzo et al., 2020 ). Together, these studies reveal widespread effects of tamoxifen treatment on the hypothalamus-POA and implicate ERα signaling within the Nkx2-1 lineage as a major mediator of the effects of tamoxifen on thermoregulation, movement, and bone homeostasis. In summary, the rodent model of tamoxifen treatment provided here mimics several of the key side effects of endocrine therapy observed in humans. If translatable to humans, our findings suggest the hypothesis that tamoxifen treatment may alter thermoregulation, physical activity, and bone through ERα signaling in the brain. A recent survey conducted in the online breast cancer communities showed that women often experienced more of tamoxifen’s side effects than men and one-third of patients did not feel that their side effects were taken seriously ( Berkowitz et al., 2021 ). The insights provided here are a first step toward the development of alternative or improved treatments that mitigate or circumvent some of the undesirable side effects of tamoxifen therapy.

. Finally, we show that ERα expression in the hypothalamus-POA is necessary for the tamoxifen-induced chances in gene expression in the hypothalamus-POA and the effects on thermoregulation, bone density, and movement. Together, these findings suggest that tamoxifen treatment modulates ERα signaling in the central nervous system to alter fundamental aspects of physiology and health. Dissecting central versus peripheral effects and mechanisms of tamoxifen therapy is the first step toward identifying strategies to mitigate the adverse side effects of this life-saving treatment.

. Estrogen receptor alpha ( ERα ) signaling regulates body temperature ( Bowe et al., 2006; Musatov et al., 2007; Mittelman-Smith et al., 2012; Martínez de Morentin et al., 2014 ), physical activity ( Musatov et al., 2007; Correa et al., 2015; van Veen et al., 2020 ), and bone density ( Farman et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Herber et al., 2019 ) through distinct neuronal populations. Indeed, the hypothalamus-POA is a demonstrated target of tamoxifen, leading to changes in food intake and body weight ( Wade and Heller, 1993; López et al., 2006; Lampert et al., 2013 ) and changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian ( Wilson et al., 2003; Aquino et al., 2016 ) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( Wilson et al., 2003 ) axes. Tamoxifen has also been shown to affect gene expression in the hypothalamus; its administration blocks the estrogen dependent induction of the progesterone receptor ( Pgr ) in the ventromedial hypothalamus ( VMH ) and increases the expression of estrogen receptor beta ( Esr2 ) in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus ( PVH ) ( Patisaul et al., 2003; Aquino et al., 2016; Sá et al., 2016 ). We hypothesized that tamoxifen alters estrogen receptor signaling in the hypothalamus-POA to mediate key negative side effects of tamoxifen therapy. To test this hypothesis, we modeled tamoxifen treatment in mice with a 28-day treatment course based on human dosage ( Slee et al., 1988 ) and asked if mice experience physiological effects similar to humans. We measured movement, bone density, and the temperature of the body core, tail skin, and thermogenic brown adipose tissue ( BAT ). Profiling genome-wide expression changes of individual cells in the hypothalamus-POA using Drop-seq, a droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing technology, revealed transcriptional changes induced by tamoxifen in multiple cell types

., 2014 ). Nevertheless, conditional knockout of ERα in the hypothalamus-POA blocked the majority of the physiological changes observed in wild-type mice by tamoxifen, indicating a pivotal role of ERα in mediating the homeostatic effects of tamoxifen. Together, these data indicate an indispensable role for ERα in the molecular and physiological response to tamoxifen treatment in mice. In addition, our data indicate that tamoxifen exerts potent effects on gene expression in a variety of neuronal subtypes, as well as in ependymal cells. It is very likely that the pleiotropic physiological effects of tamoxifen involve various estrogen responsive cells and brain regions. Determining which regions of the hypothalamus-POA respond directly to tamoxifen and which nuclei mediate the various effects of tamoxifen will require careful region and cell-type specific Esr1 deletion studies. Hot flashes are one of the most common complaints by people undergoing tamoxifen therapy or transitioning to menopause ( Stearns et al., 2002; Kligman and Younus, 2010 ). Hot flashes are characterized by frequent, sudden increases of heat dissipation from the skin, often accompanied with sweats and transient decreases in blood pressure. Tamox has been shown to affect thermoregulation in the hypothalamus-PO ( Wade and Heller,1993; López et al,2006; Lampert et al,2013 ). We find that tamox treatment increases the expression of genes involved in thermoreg in the hypothalam-PO, consistent with the hypothesis that tamox alters central nervous system function ( Eling et al,2004; Gibbs et al,2014; Den et,2015 ) Indeed, tamox and its metabolites are detectable up to 46-fold higher in the brain than serum of breast cancer patients ( et al,1991 ). Our data indicate that tamox treatment affects gene expression in many cell types but most strongly in neurons and ependal cells. These findings are consistent with previous reports of tamox-induced expression within neurons ( et al,2019 ) leaving hypothalam-PO as the most likely mediator of ER-dependent effects tamox reported here. Despite this, it is likely that peripheral tissues are affected by systemic tamox administration leading to other physiological effects we did not examine. There is evidence that estrogen therapies, including tamox or aromatase inhibitors can lead to dysregulation of energy and glucose homeostasis in humans and modeled rodents ( et al,2006; et,2013; et,2019; et2020 ) Together, these studies reveal effects of tamox treatment on hypothalam-PO and implicate ER signaling within Nk2-1 lineage as major of tamox on thermoreg, movement, and homeostasis In summary, rodent model of tamox treatment mimics several key effects of endocrine therapy observed humans. If translatable, our findings suggest that tamox may alter thermoreg, physical, and through ERα in brain.

    Title: ISG15 counteracts Listeria monocytogenes infection
    Abstract: ISG15 is an interferon-stimulated, linear di-ubiquitin-like protein, with anti-viral activity. The role of ISG15 during bacterial infection remains elusive. We show that ISG15 expression in nonphagocytic cells is dramatically induced upon Listeria infection. Surprisingly this induction can be type I interferon independent and depends on the cytosolic surveillance pathway, which senses bacterial DNA and signals through STING, TBK1, IRF3 and IRF7. Most importantly, we observed that ISG15 expression restricts Listeria infection in vitro and in vivo. We made use of stable isotope labeling in tissue culture ( SILAC ) to identify ISGylated proteins that could be responsible for the protective effect. Strikingly, infection or overexpression of ISG15 leads to ISGylation of ER and Golgi proteins, which correlates with increased secretion of cytokines known to counteract infection. Together, our data reveal a previously uncharacterized ISG15-dependent restriction of Listeria infection, reinforcing the view that ISG15 is a key component of the innate immune response.

   ., 2007 ). ISG15 seems to be unique among ubls, as it can both modify specific target proteins and non-specifically modify proteins cotranslationally ( Frias-Staheli et al., 2007; Durfee et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010 ). Since ISG15 is strongly induced by type I interferon, which is produced during bacterial infection, we aimed to decipher whether ISG15 is induced during Listeria infection and if so whether ISGylation acts as a means of host defense against invading bacteria. Here, we show that in nonphagocytic cells ISG15 is dramatically induced upon Listeria infection and that, surprisingly, early induction can be type I interferon independent. Listeria-mediated ISG15 induction depends on the CSP, which senses bacterial DNA and signals through STING, TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7. Most importantly, we demonstrate that ISG15 counteracts Listeria infection both in vitro and in vivo. We identified protein targets of ISGylation following overexpression of ISG15 using stable isotope labeling in tissue culture ( SILAC ) analysis and uncovered a prominent enrichment in integral membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. This enrichment correlated with an increase in canonical secretion of cytokines known to control infection, highlighting a new mechanism of regulation of the host response to an intracytosolic pathogen.

. Furthermore, we assessed cytokine secretion in transformed MEFs that lack ISG15, relative to their wild type counterparts following Listeria infection. Despite significantly higher levels of bacteria in the Isg15−/− MEFs, the cells secreted significantly less IL-6 than wild-type cells ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1E ). Therefore, ISG15 appears to be a critical modulator of cytokine secretion following Listeria infection. Collectively, our data reveal that during Listeria infection ISG15 modification of distinct ER and Golgi proteins increases secretion of cytokines which are known to counteract infection in vivo.

. In light of our results, ISG15's intracellular role as a modulator of cytokine secretion in nonphagocytic cells could also be responsible for reduced production of interferon γ. Increased cytokine secretion mediated by ISG15 is a previously uncharacterized way for the host to engage the immune system to combat both bacterial and viral infection; the first cells that encounter Listeria, ( i. e., nonphagocytic cells ) which are able to induce ISG15 at early time points could raise the alarm against an invading pathogen and as a result help alert innate immune cells to the site of infection. In particular, IL-6 and IL-8 are key mediators of neutrophil and monocyte recruitment in vivo and IL-6 has been repeatedly characterized as a critical mediator of the innate immune response to Listeria ( Baggiolini and Clark-Lewis, 1992; Dalrymple et al., 1995; Personnic et al., 2010 ). If cytokine secretion in the absence of ISG15 is less efficient, it could help to explain the moderate but statistically significant susceptibility of Isg15−/− mice to systemic Listeria infection. These data coupled with the aforementioned human ISG15-deficient patient susceptibility to BCG infection highlight the in vivo relevance of ISG15 as an antibacterial factor ( Bogunovic et al., 2012 ). Finally, the interferon-independent induction of ISG15 and potentially other ISGs may help to explain the still perplexing phenotype of interferon receptor-deficient mice ( Ifnar−/− ). IFNAR-deficient mice are highly resistant to Listeria infection when infected intravenously ( Auerbuch et al., 2004; Carrero et al., 2004; O'Connell et al., 2004; Stockinger et al., 2004 ). If certain subsets of cells are in fact able to induce ISGs in the absence of interferon and if these ISGs like ISG15 could contribute to an antibacterial state, this may explain why these mice are resistant to Listeria infection.

. Since ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier that is known to be covalently linked to hundreds of cellular and several viral substrates ( Giannakopoulos et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2005 ), our goal was to identify which substrates following overexpression of ISG15 could account for the protective effect detected in the context of Listeria infection and used a proteomic approach. We made use of SILAC coupled with LC-MS/MS and compared cells that express empty vector, cells that express ISG15 and cells that express ISG15 that were treated with interferon, the primary inducer of ISGylation ( Figure 4A, B ). We identified thirty ISGylated proteins modified following overexpression of ISG15 ( Figure 4C–E, Figure 4—source data 1, depicted in blue ). The proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium ( Vizcaino et al., 2014 ) via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier PXD001805 ( Radoshevich et al., 2015a ). Interestingly, these proteins have not yet been reported to be targets of ISGylation. Following interferon treatment, ISG15 modified twelve additional proteins distinct from those that were ISGylated after overexpression without treatment ( Figure 4C–E, Figure 4—source data 1, depicted in red ). Three of these proteins are known targets of ISGylation following interferon treatment in the aforementioned screens. The other nine are novel substrates of ISGylation. To gain more insight into the role of ISGylation of the modified substrates following overexpression, we performed a gene ontology ( GO ) analysis of the thirty ISGylated proteins. To our surprise over 80% of ISG15-target proteins are integral membrane proteins ( Figure 5A ). Even more intriguingly they are known to be primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus and/or are critical for glycosylation, ER morphology and ER to Golgi trafficking ( e. g

To test whether ISG15 and ISGylation are induced upon bacterial infection, we infected HeLa cells with Listeria. Upon L. monocytogenes infection, ISG15 was massively induced, whereas incubation with the related non-pathogenic bacterium, Listeria innocua, did not lead to an increase in ISG15 production ( Figure 1A ). We subsequently monitored ISG15 expression in cells infected with Listeria over time. ISG15 protein levels increased relatively rapidly; the unconjugated protein was already present at 6 hr post infection and accumulated steadily throughout the infection ( Figure 1B ). We next investigated whether ISG15 induction following Listeria infection also occurs in vivo. After 72 hr of systemic sub-lethal Listeria infection in mice, there was a robust induction of ISG15 and ISGylated conjugates in infected liver tissue, revealing that Listeria infection leads to ISG15 induction both in vitro and in vivo ( Figure 1C ). 10. 7554/eLife. 06848. 003Figure 1. ISG15 is induced by Listeria monocytogenes infection both in vitro and in vivo and ISG15 induction can be type I interferon independent. ( A ) HeLa cells were lysed and immunoblotted with α-ISG15, α-EF-Tu ( EF-Tu is a prokaryotic translation elongation factor that we use as an indicator of infection level ), and α-ACTIN following 12 or 24 hr of interferon β treatment at 1000 units/ml, infection with L. monocytogenes for 18 hr at multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 10 or 25 bacteria per human cell, and incubation with Listeria innocua at MOI of 10 or 25 bacteria per human cell.

Researchers have developed DeepRET, an open-source software for automated analysis of single-molecule Förster Resonance energy transfer (smRET) data using deep learning. SmRET is a method for studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules, but high-throughput methodologies and commercial instrumentation have outpaced the development of rapid, standardized, and automated analysis methods. DeepRET integrates features of smRET analysis and outputs common kinetic metrics. Its accuracy on ground truth data reached >95%, outperforming human operators and requiring ~1% of time. Its precise and rapid operation on data demonstrates DeepRET's capacity to quantify biomolecular dynamics and contribute to benchmarking smRET for structural biology.

DeepRET's neural network is trained for smRET but can be extended to other single-molecule trajectories, including tracking, constant measurements, and blinking using simulated or high-quality data. The network is expected to enable fully automated methodologies for biomolecular recognition, folding, and resolution. The strength of deep neural networks (DNN) is to learn complex functions and recognize aspects of input and model nonlinear relationships. DNN classify data into classes based on provided labels. The training of D is computationally intensive, but the final model can be shared and used for predictions at no cost.

DeepRET is an all-inclusive software with a pre-trained D at its core for rapid, objective, and assessment of smRET for quantifying biomolecular. It operates with minimal human intervention and requires a threshold on data quality as an initial step to detailed quantification of structural from images. This is attained through an intuitive interface that automates common smRET procedures from image analysis, intensity extraction, classification, and production of figures. DeepRET comes as a standalone executable for Windows and Mac users with limited skills to operate. A script version implemented in Python enables experts to adjust analysis for needs.

DeepRET is trained and tested on 2-ALEX and non-A smRET data. Other techniques such as 3- and 4 F, protein fluorescence enhancement, metal transfer, and intrap surface transfer could be implemented through additional training and software. The simulation in DeepRET is based on protein dynamics observed by smRET follows a Mark process. Any data can be simulated using the trace to meet requirements. In current, DeepRET operates immobilized particles, but implementing single-particle tracking would allow extraction dynamics on freely diffusing particles.

    Title: Interactions with RNA direct the Polycomb group protein SCML2 to chromatin where it represses target genes
    Abstract: Polycomb repressive complex-1 ( PRC1 ) is essential for the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. SCML2 is a mammalian homolog of Drosophila SCM, a Polycomb-group protein that associates with PRC1. In this study, we show that SCML2A, an SCML2 isoform tightly associated to chromatin, contributes to PRC1 localization and also directly enforces repression of certain Polycomb target genes. SCML2A binds to PRC1 via its SPM domain and interacts with ncRNAs through a novel RNA-binding region ( RBR ). Targeting of SCML2A to chromatin involves the coordinated action of the MBT domains, RNA binding, and interaction with PRC1 through the SPM domain. Deletion of the RBR reduces the occupancy of SCML2A at target genes and overexpression of a mutant SCML2A lacking the RBR causes defects in PRC1 recruitment. These observations point to a role for ncRNAs in regulating SCML2 function and suggest that SCML2 participates in the epigenetic control of transcription directly and in cooperation with PRC1.

    Supporting Text:
    Proteins belonging to the Polycomb and trithorax group are epigenetic regulators and maintain specialized chromatin structures that are refractory or permissive to transcription, respectively ( Schuettengruber et al., 2007 ). Unlike conventional transcription factors, these proteins do not contain a DNA binding domain that directs them to targets on chromatin; instead, there is accumulating evidence that recruitment and regulation of PcG proteins are coordinated by a number of molecular pathways that act in a combinatorial fashion to repress specific genes in different cell types ( Simon and Kingston, 2013 ). Drosophila SCM and its human homologs, including SCML2, associate with the PRC1 complex ( Shao et al., 1999; Levine et al., 2002; Gao et al., 2012 ), but their role in PRC1 function has remained elusive. Here, we have unveiled two mechanisms by which SCML2A contributes to PRC1 function: ( 1 ) SCML2 and PRC1 cooperate in chromatin binding, as evidenced by loss of BMI1 upon overexpression of SCML2AΔRBR, recruitment of BMI1 by SCML2A at artificial tethering sites, and the weak association of SCML2B to chromatin; and ( 2 ) SCML2 enforces repression at some target sites independent of the presence of PRC1. In addition, our results show that RNA binding also plays a role in SCML2 function, as it is required for its localization to chromatin. In Drosophila, the interaction of SCM and PRC1 relies on the C-terminal SPM domain ( Peterson et al., 2004 ) and our results show that a similar mechanism is conserved in humans. Genome-wide analyses revealed an extensive overlap of SCML2A target sites with those of BMI1 ( Figure 4 ), suggesting that this interaction is relevant in a chromatin context. Despite the considerable overlap some sites were occupied by SCML2 or BMI1 alone. The former might reflect the complexity of PRC1 subtypes in mammals and the fact that SCML2 is also part of PRC1. 2, which does not contain BMI1 ( Gao et al

. We propose that SCML2A is then retained at target genes through the interaction with PRC1 and that, in turn, SCML2A contributes to stabilizing PRC1. We also report that, at a subset of genes, SCML2 appears to enforce repression directly, independent of PRC1 recruitment, via mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. The identification of SCML2 as a PcG protein that binds RNA and contributes to repression of Polycomb targets will help shed new light on the interplay between ncRNAs and epigenetic regulation and on the combinatorial factors that drive the specificity of the diverse PcG complexes in different cellular contexts.

. 2, which does not contain BMI1 ( Gao et al., 2012 ) ; the latter is likely due to the higher sensitivity of the BMI1 antibody, although we cannot exclude that some BMI1 target sites are devoid of SCML2. Together with genetic evidence in Drosophila ( Simon et al., 1992 ) and mice ( Takada et al., 2007 ), these observations firmly establish SCML2 as an important player in Polycomb-mediated epigenetic regulation. Consistent with this, the SCML2B isoform, which lacks the SPM domain, does not bind to BMI1 and is unable to recruit PRC1 to chromatin ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) ; however, when artificially tethered to a chromatinized reporter, SCML2B is still capable to repress it ( Figure 4C ), suggesting that SCML2 ( and possibly other SCM homologs ) might directly enforce gene repression. This notion is further supported by the observation that knockdown for SCML2 causes derepression of target genes without affecting BMI1 levels ( Figure 7 ). This PRC1-independent silencing may be mediated by the MBT domain, which binds to methylated histone tails ( Grimm et al., 2007; Santiveri et al., 2008 ) and, in the case of L3MBTL1, represses transcription via chromatin compaction ( Trojer et al., 2007 ). In fact, the MBT domain of SCM in Drosophila is important for repression ( Grimm et al., 2007 ), and our results show that the MBT domain contributes to the chromatin localization of SCML2 ( Figure 3D ). In vitro binding assays and domain mapping experiments revealed the existence of a previously unknown RBR within SCML2. Despite the fact that the 74-residue fragment containing the RBR is both necessary and sufficient for RNA binding in vitro ( Figures 1 and 2 ), prediction algorithms failed to detect known protein folds or the propensity to form secondary structures in this region, suggesting that, in isolation, the RBR remains unstructured

Interaction with RNA regulates recruitment and assembly of several chromatin-associated factors, including members of the Polycomb and trithorax groups ( Rinn et al., 2007; Khalil et al., 2009; Kanhere et al., 2010; Tsai et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011; Kaneko et al., 2013, 2014 ). To find novel RNA-interacting proteins among potential epigenetic regulators, we performed a candidate-based screen using RNA immunoprecipitation ( RIP ) from HeLa S3 nuclear extracts. We observed that the PcG protein SCML2, a homolog of Drosophila SCM, consistently co-purified with a relatively large amount of RNA, especially when compared to EZH2 and MLL, which are part of complexes known to interact with ncRNAs ( Rinn et al., 2007; Kaneko et al., 2010, 2013; Wang et al., 2011; Figure 1A ). SCML2 did not co-precipitate with either EZH2 or MLL or vice versa ( data not shown ). 10. 7554/eLife. 02637. 003Figure 1. Identification of the RNA-binding region of SCML2.

., 2010 ), have also been proposed to guide PRC1 recruitment in specific contexts, but an overarching model remains lacking. Given that increasing evidence points to a role for noncoding RNAs ( ncRNAs ) in mediating recruitment of chromatin complexes ( Koziol and Rinn, 2010; Wang and Chang, 2011 ) and that at least one ncRNA has been shown to make contact with PRC1 ( Yap et al., 2010 ), we hypothesized that SCML might interact with ncRN to regulate P1 recruitment. Indeed, our data show that SCML binds ncRNA via the RBR and that this interaction is required for SCML localization to chromatin ( Figures 2 and 3 ). The RBR is a previously uncharacterized region of SCML and we mapped it to amino acids 256–330 ( Figures 1 and 2 ), which is necessary and sufficient for RNA binding in vitro ( Figures 1 and 2 ) and in vivo ( Figures 2 and 3 ). The RBR is not predicted to form secondary structures or contain known protein folds, suggesting it may be unstructured in isolation ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). Our results indicate that the R is essential for SCML function, as overexpression of a mutant SCML lacking the R causes defects in P1 recruitment and occupancy at target genes ( Figures 3 and 4 ). This is consistent with the idea that SCML is retained at target genes through its interaction with P1 and that, in turn, SCML contributes to stabilizing P1.

    Title: Mechanisms of ribosome stalling by SecM at multiple elongation steps
    Abstract: Regulation of translating ribosomes is a major component of gene expression control network. In Escherichia coli, ribosome stalling by the C-terminal arrest sequence of SecM regulates the SecA-dependent secretion pathway. Previous studies reported many residues of SecM peptide and ribosome exit tunnel are critical for stalling. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still not clear at the atomic level. Here, we present two cryo-EM structures of the SecM-stalled ribosomes at 3. 3–3. 7 Å resolution, which reveal two different stalling mechanisms at distinct elongation steps of the translation cycle: one is due to the inactivation of ribosomal peptidyl-transferase center which inhibits peptide bond formation with the incoming prolyl-tRNA; the other is the prolonged residence of the peptidyl-RNA at the hybrid A/P site which inhibits the full-scale tRNA translocation. These results demonstrate an elegant control of translation cycle by regulatory peptides through a continuous, dynamic reshaping of the functional center of the ribosome.

   ., 2015; Cheng, 2015; Cheng et al., 2015 ). Therefore, we set out to use this method to analyze the structures of the ribosomes stalled on SecM mRNA. Our structural data of the two predominant forms of stalled ribosomes, one in post-state, and the other in hybrid rotated state, indicate that a collection of interactions between SecM and the exit tunnel cooperatively induce conformational changes of the PTC, leading to translation arrest at distinct elongation steps, including peptide-bond formation and tRNA translocation.

., 2006 ). This hypothesis was argued by improved cryo-EM structure of SecM-arrested ribosome ( SecM-Gly-RNC ) at 5. 6 Å resolution ( Bhushan et al., 2011 ), which did not reveal any significant, systematic, and large-scale rRNA arrangement on the 50S subunit. Instead, it was proposed that an observed ∼2 Å shift in the position of the tRNA-nascent peptide linkage of SecM-tRNA away from the A-tRNA reduces the rate of peptide bond formation, resulting in translation stalling. However, with much improved resolution, we did not observe significant movement of the CCA-end of the P-site tRNA. Instead, the position of the tRNA-nascent peptide linkage of SecM-tRNA is similar to that seen in the structure of the ribosome with active PTC ( Figure 4B ) ( Polikanov et al., 2014 ). Through the comparison with reference states of the ribosomes that are capable or incapable of peptide-bond formation, we could provide an alternative mechanism of SecM-induced stalling in SecM-Gly-RNC ( Figure 7A ). 10. 7554/eLife. 09684. 029Figure 7. Schematic models of SecM-mediated translation stalling. ( A ) Model illustrating how interactions of SecM within the ribosomal tunnel in SecM-Gly-RNC promote conformational rearrangements of the 23S rRNA nucleotides of U2585, U2506, and A2602, and thereby locks the PTC in the inactive state and not optimized for stable binding and accommodation of the incoming A-site tRNA. ( B ) Model illustrating how interactions of SecM within the ribosomal tunnel in SecM-Pro-RNC alter the interaction between the A/P*-tRNA and the P-loop. The altered P-loop interaction increases the life time of A/P*-tRNA and slows down its translocation to classical P/P site. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 09684

To understand the molecular mechanism of SecM-dependent translational stalling, we set out to purify SecM-stalled ribosome nascent chain complexes ( RNCs ) using an in vitro translation system from E. coli and to analyze their structures using single particle cryo-EM technique. To facilitate biochemical characterization and purification, two similar constructs were prepared: one encodes, from the N- to C-terminus, a 2xStrep-TEV-tag, the N-terminal 40 residues of OmpA, a Myc-tag, SecM stalling sequence ( residues 150–166 ) and tandem stop codons ( SEC-STOP ) ; the other contains an additional 6X-His-tag ( SEC-HIS-STOP ) after SecM stalling sequence> ( Figure 1— figure supplement 1A ). After incubation of the plasmids with the S30-T7-based in vitro translation system, the presence and the amount of arrested peptidyl-tRNA can be detected using Western blot with primary antibody against Myc-tag ( Figure 1— figure supplement 1B–E ). We found that the peptidyl-tRNA in the reaction mixture started to accumulate after 5 min, peaked at 15 min and became diminished after 30 min. Therefore, we chose 15 min as the incubation time to purify SecM-stalled RNCs. The design of the SEC-HIS-STOP construct was to assess how frequent the ribosome would go beyond P166. As shown in Figure 1— figure supplement 1B, lower band corresponding to SecM-HIS peptide also existed in the reaction mixtures, in a comparable amount to the peptidyl-tRNA, indicating the ribosome was able to go beyond SecM coding sequence and reach the stop codon with increasing incubation time. However, after treatment of the samples with excessive RNase A, which destroys all RNAs and releases the peptide from the peptidyl-tRNA, only the band of SecM peptide, but not SecM-HIS, sharply increased, indicating that the peptidyl-tRNA in the reaction mixtures is indeed arrested on the very 3-end of SecM coding sequence

. A few ribosomal components lining the tunnel are also required for efficient stalling, for mutations of A2058G, A2062U, or A2503G, or insertion of one adenine nucleotide within the five consecutive adenine residues ( A749-A753 ), as well as mutations or deletion of selected residues from uL22 and uL4 could all alleviate translational stalling to certain extents ( Lawrence et al., 2008; Nakatogawa and Ito, 2002; Vazquez-Laslop et al., 2010; Woolhead et al., 2006 ). Previous structural studies of the SecM-arrested ribosome suggested that the interaction between the exit tunnel and the arrest peptide could change the conformation of the PTC ( peptidyl-transferase center ) to slow down the peptide bond formation ( Bhushan et al., 2011; Gumbart et al., 2012 ). However, the previous structures were not in sufficient resolution for direct visualization of the atomic interactions between the tunnel components and the nascent peptide. Furthermore, a recent study employed fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) to monitor the real-time translation of SecM on the ribosome ( Tsai et al., 2014 ), and revealed that the stalling is a dynamic process involving reduced elongation rates at a range of positions on the SecM mRNA, from G165 to 4–5 codons after the terminal P166 of the arrest sequence, including increased lifetime for both unrotated and rotated ribosomes at these codon positions. Nevertheless, although the stalling induced by SecM is not strictly a single-site event, G165 is the first predominant site of stalling ( Tsai et al., 2014 ). Recent advancement of cryo-EM single particle technique, such as the application of direct electron detection devices and efficient algorithms for conformational sorting of particles allow simultaneous high-resolution structural determination of several functional states from a single heterogeneous dataset ( Bai et al., 2015; Cheng, 2015; Cheng et al., 2015 )

Translation regulation, as an essential component of the gene expression control, is usually mediated by a variety of ribosome-interacting factors and could take place at different stages during the translation cycle ( Duval et al., 2015; Hinnebusch and Lorsch, 2012; Keiler, 2015; Spriggs et al., 2010; Starosta et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, protein synthesis can also be modulated by regulatory nascent peptides, as demonstrated by an increasing number of such sequences found throughout all kingdoms of life ( Cruz-Vera et al., 2011; Lovett and Rogers, 1996; Ramu et al., 2009 ). One such example is a variety of ribosome arrest peptides, often encoded by upstream open reading frames ( uORF ) or mRNA 5’ leaders that are utilized to regulate the expression of co-transcribed genes ( Cruz-Vera et al., 2011; Ito and Chiba, 2013; Morris and Geballe, 2000; Wethmar, 2014 ). Ribosome stalling by nascent peptides involves interactions of the regulatory peptide with the peptide exit channel on the 50S subunit, and in a few cases, requires coordination of small-molecule ligands or ribosomal components ( Bhush et al, 2011; Gart et al. 2012; Tsai et al 2014 ). In this study, we present cryo-EM structures of Sec-stalled ribosomes at 3.3–3.7 Å resolution, which reveal two distinct mechanisms of stalling at elongation steps of the translation cycle: one due to inactivation of the peptyl-transfer center which inhibits peptide bond formation with incoming tRNA the other the prolonged residence of peptRNA at A site inhibits full tRNA translocation. These results demonstrate elegant control of translation by regulatory peptides through dynamic reshaping the functional center of the ribosome.

    Title: Human foveal cone photoreceptor topography and its dependence on eye length
    Abstract: We provide the first measures of foveal cone density as a function of axial length in living eyes and discuss the physical and visual implications of our findings. We used a new generation Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to image cones at and near the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects. Cone density and other metrics were computed in units of visual angle and linear retinal units. The foveal cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fovea, but not in proportion to eye length. Despite retinal stretching ( decrease in cones/mm2 ), myopes generally have a higher angular sampling density ( increase in cones/deg2 ) in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes, offering the potential for better visual acuity. Reports of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision in myopes compared to emmetropes cannot be explained by increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression.

    Supporting Text:
    One might expect that eye growth would stretch the photoreceptor layer and would increase the spacing between cones, causing a longer eye to more coarsely sample an image relative to a shorter eye. However the situation is not that simple; the axial elongation associated with eye growth is accompanied by magnification of the retinal image ( Strang et al., 1998 ). If the enlargement of the retinal image exactly matched the stretching of the cone mosaic, then eyes of different lengths would sample the visual field similarly. In fact, in large scale studies, myopes generally attain reasonably good visual acuity with optical correction ( He et al., 2004; Jong et al., 2018 ). However, more careful inspection reveals that myopes generally ( 6 out of 9 studies ) have poorer angular resolution and have uniformly ( 3 out of 3 studies ) poorer retinal resolution. Table 1 summarizes published results from psychophysical foveal tasks. Most notably, Atchison et al. ( 2006 ) and Coletta and Watson ( 2006 ) show clear deficits in retinal resolution ( cyc/mm ) with increasing myopia using interferometric methods which bypass the optics of the eye and Rossi et al. ( 2007 ) show significant deficits in angular resolution ( cyc/deg ) in low myopes, even after using adaptive optics to correct for optical blur. All studies that find myopic visual deficits implicate retinal stretching as a possible cause, but what is actually happening structurally at the foveal center during myopic progression is not known. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to more carefully investigate how the length of the eye affects cone density at and near the foveal center. Two types of cone densities will be discussed in this study. Linear density quantifies how many cones are within a fixed area, in square mm, and serves as a way to evaluate physical retinal stretching caused by eye growth

. The most definitive studies of cone spacing as a function of axial length are done through direct imaging of the retina – wherein sharp images of the cones are enabled through the use of adaptive optics, a set of technologies that actively compensate the blur caused by aberrations of the eye ( Liang et al., 1997 ). Combined with confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy ( Webb et al., 1987 ), adaptive optics offers the highest contrast en face images of the foveal photoreceptor mosaic ever recorded in vivo ( Dubra et al., 2011; Roorda et al., 2002 ). Despite continued advances in image quality, previous studies investigating cone packing and eye length have not made their measurements at the foveal center, the most important region for spatial vision but the most difficult to image owing to the small size of photoreceptors. There are a number of studies on cone packing and eye length ( Chui et al., 2008; Elsner et al., 2017; Kitaguchi et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010; Obata and Yanagi, 2014; Park et al., 2013 ) and here we summarize the published results that are most relevant to our study. Chui et al. ( 2008 ) investigated angular and linear cone density at 1 mm and three degrees eccentricity. They found a significant decrease ( p<0. 05 ) in linear cone density as a function of eye length at 1 mm ( which, by angular distance, is closer to the fovea in a longer eye than in a shorter eye ) in all directions except in the nasal retina. They found that the angular cone density at three degrees ( which, by linear distance, is closer to the fovea, in a shorter eye than in a longer eye ) increased with eye length, but the trends were not significant. Li et al. ( 2010 ) made similar measures, but closer to the fovea ( from 0. 10 mm to 0. 30 mm eccentricity ). They found that linear cone density decreased with eye length, but the trends were not significant at the smallest eccentricities ( 0. 1 and 0. 2 mm )

All the biometric measures used to convert angular dimensions to linear retinal dimensions are listed on Table 2. The strong correlation between refractive error and eye length ( p<0. 0001 ) indicates that the myopia in this cohort was predominantly as a result of axial length. Images of the foveal region, the preferred retinal locus for fixation ( PRL ) and the fixation stability were recorded with an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope ( see Materials and methods ). The image of one subject ( 10003L ) is shown in Figure 3A. All the cones were resolved with our imaging system. The scatter plot indicates the scatter plot of fixation over the course of a 10 s video. Figure 3B shows the same image with all cones labeled and a color-coded overlay indicating the density. 16, 184 labeled cones are shown on the figure. The point of maximum density is indicated by the black cross and the PRL is indicated by the yellow ellipse ( best fit to the scatter plot locations in Figure 3A ). This eye has a peak linear density of 204, 020 cones/mm², and a peak angular density of 15, 851 cones/deg². Cone density plots in linear and angular units for all eyes are shown on Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2. Original images and a list of the cone locations for each can be downloaded from the Dryad Digital Repository https://datadryad. org/review? doi=doi:10. 5061/dryad. nh0fp1b. Figure 4 shows the linear cone density as a function of linear eccentricity, where the average linear cone density was computed in 25-micron wide annuli centered around the point of peak density. Figure 4—figure supplement 1 are plots of the average cone densities in linear and angular units as a function of eccentricity in microns and arcminutes. Figure 4—figure supplement 2 are plots of the average linear and angular cone densities as a function of horizontal and vertical direction

. 1 and 0. 2 mm ). When the data were plotted in angular units and angular distance from the fovea, they found that angular cone density trended toward an increase with eye length but none of the trends were significant. A more recent study measured peak cone densities in the fovea as well as axial length for 22 eyes of 22 subjects ( Wilk et al., 2017 ) but they did not plot peak cone density as a function of axial length, as it was not the aim of their study. We plotted the data they provided in their paper and found that the linear cone density at the foveal center dropped significantly with increases in axial length, similar to what was found by Li et al. ( 2010 ) and Chui et al. ( 2008 ), but the angular cone density had no dependency on eye length. Summary plots from previous literature are shown in Figure 2AB. Wilk et al. ( 2017 ) ’s data were consistent with a global expansion model and Li et al. ( 2010 ) and Chui et al. ( 2008 ) ’s data only leaned toward a model that falls between the global expansion and equatorial stretching models. If the trends found by Li et al. ( 2010 ) and Chui et al. ( 2008 ) near the fovea were to extend to the foveal center, then myopes would have higher foveal photoreceptor sampling resolution with a consequent potential for better performance on visual tasks compared to emmetropes. As such, the simplest explanation for visual deficits in myopes – increased separation between cones caused by retinal stretching – would have to be ruled out. With the improvements in resolution of adaptive optics ophthalmoscopes, imaging the smallest cones at the foveal center is now possible in many eyes, enabling a definitive analysis of the cone density at the fovea as a function of eye length.

. In order to show the trends of density with axial length Figure 5A and B plot linear and angular cone density as a function of axial length where the colors indicate different eccentricity - red to purple indicate 0 to 0.5 mm, green to 0.5 to 1.5, blue to 1.5 to 2.5, yellow to 2.5 to 3.5, orange 3 to 3.5 to 4, and brown 4 to 4. 5. The linear density at the fove center drops with increasing length but the trend is not significant. The angular density at the fove increases with length but the trend is not significant.

    Title: Genome-wide identification of lineage and locus specific variation associated with pneumococcal carriage duration
    Abstract: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive disease in infants, especially in low-income settings. Asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for disease, but variability in its duration is currently only understood at the serotype level. Here we developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data, and combined these results with whole genome sequence data. We estimated that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, whereas the host traits considered here ( age and previous carriage ) accounted for less than 5%. We further partitioned this heritability into both lineage and locus effects, and quantified the amount attributable to the largest sources of variation in carriage duration: serotype ( 17% ), drug-resistance ( 9% ) and other significant locus effects ( 7% ). A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration independent of serotype, potentially by disruption of the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance.

    Supporting Text:
    Other than serotype, the genetic determinants of pneumococcal carriage duration were previously unknown. By developing models for longitudinal swab data and combining the results with whole genome sequence data we have quantified and mapped the genetic contribution to the carriage duration of S. pneumoniae. We found that despite a range of other factors such as host age which are known to cause carriage duration to differ, sequence variation of the pneumococcal genome explains most of this variability ( 63% ). Common serotypes and resistance to erythromycin cause some of this effect ( 19% total ), as does the presence or absence of particular prophage sequence in the genome. Table 5 summarise the sources we found to be significantly associated with variation in carriage duration. We provide a quantitative estimate of how closely transmission pairs share their carriage duration, and show evidence for differences both between and within serotypes. The implication of phage as having a significant effect on carriage duration has interesting corollaries on pneumococcal genome diversification through frequent infection and loss of prophage, even during carriage episodes in this dataset. Investigating a mechanism for the prophage association, we found that having an intact comYC gene, which is frequently interrupted by prophage causing loss of function of the competence system, was associated with increased carriage duration. While the competence system is observed to remain intact over the evolutionary history of the species, these disruptive mutations spread irreversibly through the population as competent bacteria can acquire the mutation, and non-competent bacteria can no longer reverse it through recombination ( Croucher et al., 2014b ). Selection must therefore maintain the function at this locus over short timescales, and an increased carriage duration may be evidence of this

. We therefore hypothesise that the associated prophage sequences may affect carriage duration through disruption of the competence system, without which deleterious mutations will accumulate in the population due to Muller's ratchet. The results presented here have important implications for the modelling of pneumococcal transmission and their response to perturbation of the population by vaccine. Importantly, our analysis of heritability shows that variants other than serotype affect carriage duration, consistent with recent theoretical work ( Lehtinen et al., 2017 ). Here we have shown that these alleles do exist in a natural population, and also identified candidates for the loci which fulfil this role. Together these studies suggest that variants exist in the pneumococcal genome which alter carriage duration, which in turn is linked to antibiotic resistance. We were not able to fully explain the basis for heritability of carriage duration for a number of reasons. The close association of the phenotype with lineage limited our power to fine-map lineage associated variants other than capsule type which may affect carriage duration. Meta-analysis with more large studies with higher resolution may help to resolve these issues: we are conducting a similar study in Cape Town, South Africa which will combine sequence data with two-weekly swabs and will be compared to these results in future. Additional environmental factors that explain some of the remainder of the variance may include the variation of the host immune response and interaction with other infections or co-colonisation. In particular, co-infection with influenza A was not recorded but is known to affect population dynamics within the nasopharynx ( Kono et al., 2016 ). This is a phenotype which would have been difficult to assay by traditional methods such as in an animal model due to the cohort size needed and the length of time experiments would need to be run for

. In addition variation of pathogen protein sequence, accessory genes and interaction effects between genetic elements may also have as yet unknown effects on carriage duration. Changes in average carriage duration have been shown to be linked with recombination rate ( Chaguza et al., 2016 ), which has been found to correlate with antibiotic resistance ( Hanage et al., 2009 ) and invasive potential ( Chaguza et al., 2016 ). The carriage duration by different serotypes is widely used in models of pneumococcal epidemiology, and consequently is important in evaluating the efficacy of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) ( Melegaro et al., 2007; Weinberger et al., 2011 ). Additionally, modelling work has proposed that if alleles exist which alter carriage duration, these explain the long standing puzzle of how antibiotic-resistant and sensitive strains stably coexist in the population ( Lehtinen et al., 2017 ). Measurement of carriage duration and the analysis of its variance beyond the resolution of serotype will have important consequences for these models. We sought to determine the overall importance of the pathogen genotype in carriage duration in a human population, and to identify and quantify the elements of the genome responsible for the variation in carriage duration. By combining epidemiological modelling of longitudinal swab data with and genome wide association study methods on the connected sequences ( Figure 1 ), we made heritability estimates for carriage duration. We further partitioned the heritability into contributions from lineage and locus effects ( Earle et al., 2016 ) to quantify the variation caused by each individual factor.

. 445, consistent with our estimate for H2. After calculating the overall heritability, we wished to determine the amount that the specific variation in the pathogen genome contributes to changing carriage duration. In the context of genome wide association studies ( GWAS ) in bacteria strong linkage-disequilibrium ( LD ) is present across the entire genome, making it difficult to pinpoint variants associated with carriage duration and not just present in the background of longer or shorter carried lineages ( Chen and Shapiro, 2015 ). In S. pneumoniae, serotype and antibiogram are correlated with the overall genome sequence ( Brueggemann et al., 2003; Chewapreecha et al., 2014a; Enright and Spratt, 1998 ). If these factors are associated with carriage duration, large sets of variants which define long-carried and short-carried lineages will be correlated with carriage duration in a naive association test ( Chen and Shapiro, 2015; Read and Massey, 2014 ). A distinction has therefore been made between variants which evolve convergently and affect a phenotype independently of lineage – termed locus effects – to those which are collinear with a genotype which is associated with the phenotype, termed lineage effects ( Earle et al., 2016 ). Locus effects may be associated with a change in carriage duration due to convergent evolution ( which may occur through recombination between lineages ). In such regions, the causal loci and corresponding phenotypic effects are easier to identify ( Power et al., 2017 ). Linear mixed models can be used to find these variants which are associated with a bacterial phenotype independent of lineage; discovery of homoplasic and polygenic variation associated with the phenotype across the entire tree is well powered ( Earle et al., 2016 ). While the high heritability suggests many pathogen variants do affect carriage duration, it does not give information on how many of these will be locus or lineage effects

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen that can cause diseases such as pneumonia, otitis media and meningitis. Pneumococcal disease burden is highest in children ( O'Brien et al., 2009 ). For disease to be caused pneumococci must first transmit to the host, colonise the nasopharynx and finally cross into a normally sterile site. The pneumococcus spends most of the transmission cycle in the nasopharynx, and so understanding and predicting the amount of time spent in this niche is critical for understanding this bacterium's epidemiology, and therefore controlling transmission ( Abdullahi et al., 2012a; Melegaro et al., 2007 ). The nasopharynx is a complex niche in which each pneumococcal genotype must tackle a wide range of factors including host immune defence ( McCool et al., 2002 ), other bacterial species ( Pericone et al., 2000 ), and other pneumococcal lineages ( Auranen et al., 2010; Cobey and Lipsitch, 2012 ) in order to maintain the genotype's population. The average nasopharyngeal duration period is therefore influenced by host factors such as age and previous carriage, but also pneumoccal traits such as serotype and drug-resistance. The duration of pneumoccal carriage in the nasary is a prerequisite for disease, but variability in duration is currently only understood at the serotype level. Here we developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data and combined with whole genome data. We estimated that pneumoccal variation accounted for 63 of the variation, whereas host traits ( age and previous carriage ) accounted for less than 5. We partitioned this herit into lineage and locus effects and quantified the largest sources of variation: serotype 17, drug-resistance 9 and other locus 7. A pan-genome-wide study identified prophage sequences associated with decreased duration independent of serotype, potentially disrupting the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumoccal competition and antibiotic resistance

Here is a clear and concise summary of the article:

**Title:** Genome-wide identification of lineage and locus variation associated with pneumocococcal carriage duration

**Background:** Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive disease in infants, especially in low-income settings. Asymptomatic carriage in the nasophary is a prerequisite for disease, but variability in its duration is currently only understood at serotype level.

**Methods:** The researchers developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage from longitudinal swab data and combined with whole genome data. They estimated that pneumoccal variation accounted for 63% of the variation, whereas host traits (age and previous) accounted for less than 5%. They partitioned heritability into lineage and locus effects and quantified the largest sources of variation: serotype (17%), drug-resistance (9%), and other locus (7%).

**Findings:** A pan-genome-wide association study identified proph sequences associated with decreased duration independent of serotype, potentially disrupting the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumoccal competition and antibiotic resistance.

**Implications:** The study has important implications for modeling pneumoc transmission and response to perturbation of the population by vaccine. The analysis of heritability shows that variants other than serotype affect duration, consistent with theoretical work.

**Limitations:** The association of phenotype with lineage limited power to fine-map associated variants other than capsule which affect duration. Meta-analysis with large studies with higher resolution may help resolve issues.

**Conclusion:** The study sought to determine the importance of pathogen in carriage duration and identify elements responsible for variation. Combining epidemiological modeling with genome association methods, they made herit estimates and partitioned herit into lineage and locus effects.

    Title: Unnatural amino acid photo-crosslinking of the IKs channel complex demonstrates a KCNE1:KCNQ1 stoichiometry of up to 4:4
    Abstract: Cardiac repolarization is determined in part by the slow delayed rectifier current ( IKs ), through the tetrameric voltage-gated ion channel, KCNQ1, and its β-subunit, KCNE1. The stoichiometry between α and β-subunits has been controversial with studies reporting either a strict 2 KCNE1:4 KCNQ1 or a variable ratio up to 4:4. We used IKs fusion proteins linking KCNE1 to one ( EQ ), two ( EQQ ) or four ( EQQQQ ) KCNQ1 subunits, to reproduce compulsory 4:4, 2:4 or 1:4 stoichiometries. Whole cell and single-channel recordings showed EQQ and EQQQQ to have increasingly hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter first latency of opening compared to EQ - all abolished by the addition of KCNE1. As well, using a UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid in KCNE1, we found EQQQQ and EQQ crosslinking rates to be progressively slowed compared to KCNQ1, which demonstrates that no intrinsic mechanism limits the association of up to four β-subunits within the IKs complex.

    Supporting Text:
   . The implication of variable stoichiometry suggests a distribution of stoichiometries depending on the expression level ( Nakajo et al., 2010 ). A characterization of IKs currents in dog cardiac myocytes determined the V1/2 at 37°C for IKs across different regions of the ventricular wall to be ~25 mV ( Liu and Antzelevitch, 1995 ). Additionally, co-localization studies of KCNE1 and KCNQ1 in rat cardiomyocytes indicated that KCNE1 is present in excess ( Wang et al., 2013 ). Our results and these previous findings suggest that under these conditions, it is likely that many of the IKs channel complexes have a β-subunits configuration exceeding 2:4. A variable stoichiometry model for IKs has some interesting implications. A fully saturated channel has a depolarizing shift in the current-voltage relationship, extremely slowed activation and increased conductance ( Figure 1 and 2 ). However, during a normal cardiac action potential this would result in limited activation. If the stoichiometry can be regulated based on availability, ( Nakajo et al., 2010 ) then altering the expression could change the distribution of channel composition, shifting the overall activation kinetics of the current. Additionally, there is evidence for the association of other β-subunits. All five of the KCNE genes ( KCNE1-5 ) can be expressed in cardiomyocytes ( Lundquist et al., 2006; Bendahhou et al., 2005; Radicke et al., 2006 ). Each of these accessory proteins has been found to alter KCNQ1 channel gating in distinct ways ( Eldstrom and Fedida, 2011; Liin et al., 2015 ). There is also potential for different KCNE’s associating with the same channel to modulate its function ( Manderfield and George, 2008; Jiang et al., 2009 ). Flexibility in KCNQ1’s β-subunits association, both in number and in type, allows for a powerful mechanism to modulate repolarization in the heart through changes in expression.

To help differentiate possible channel complex stoichiometries, we created three IKs fusion constructs ( Figure 1A ). The C-terminus of KCNE1 was connected with the N-terminus of KCNQ1 via a flexible linker ( EQ ), forcing a 4:4 stoichiometry of β and α subunits. An additional one or three KCNQ1 subunits were linked to the construct to make EQQ and EQQQQ, respectively ( Yu et al., 2013; Wang, 1998; Nakajo et al., 2010 ). A priori, EQQ, establishes a 2:4 KCNE1 to KCNQ1 subunit stoichiometry, and leaves two unoccupied clefts on each channel’s exterior, while EQQQQ has a 1:4 ratio with three unoccupied clefts. KCNQ1, EQQQQ, EQQ and EQ were expressed independently in mammalian tsA201 cells and the resulting currents were characterized by whole cell patch clamp ( Figure 1B ). A 4 s isochronal activation protocol ranging from -80 to +100 mV was used to determine the V1/2 of activation ( Figure 1D ). As is known, KCNQ1 expressed alone had a V1/2 of -15. 5 mV, while the presence of additional tethered β-subunits resulted in a progressive depolarization of the V1/2 of activation to a maximum of ~+30 mV, ( Figure 1E and H ). This indicates that the linked subunits contribute to channel complex regulation. 10. 7554/eLife. 11815. 003Figure 1. Additional β-subunits can alter IKs channel complex gating properties. ( A ) Channel topology diagrams indicate the configuration and proposed stoichiometry of the channels. The KCNE1 sequences are shaded. Representative whole cell patch clamp recordings are shown for KCNQ1 ( black circle ), EQQQQ ( green diamond ), EQQ ( blue square ) and EQ ( orange triangle ), expressed alone ( B; open symbols ) or in combination with wild type KCNE1-GFP ( C; filled symbols ). ( D ) Currents were elicited using a 4 s isochronal activation protocol. Only odd numbered sweeps are shown for clarity

The number of β-subunits present in the IKs channel complex is critical for its regulation. Here, we have shown that up to four KCNE1 subunits can associate with the KCNQ1 tetramer. Variable association allows for greater flexibility in the modulation of IKs current but also potentially increases the heterogeneity of channel species in the membrane. The development of models of cardiac function, IKs channel structure and activity, pharmaceutical screens and transgenic animals should include consideration of this potential diversity in IKs channel configuration to best reflect the underlying physiology.

. They also found that the 2:4 ratio was not exceeded even in the presence of increasing KCNE1 concentrations. Their observation of a maximum of 2 KCNE1 subunits per tetramer suggests an intrinsic cooperative mechanism preventing the association of a third or fourth β-subunit during channel assembly. Here, we sought to clarify this issue using fusion channels where KCNE1 was linked to one ( EQ - 4:4 ), two ( EQQ – 2:4 ) or four ( EQQQQ - 1:4 ) KCNQ1s. The channel complexes were evaluated in mammalian cells on their own or in combination with additional independent KCNE1 subunits using whole cell patch clamp, single-channel recordings and UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid approaches. In each instance, we were able to demonstrate that all four of KCNQ1’s exterior clefts are accessible to KCNE1, confirming the variable stoichiometry model for channel complex assembly. In addition, the single channel analysis suggests that a 4:4 stoichiometry of KCNQ1 to KCNE1 maximizes channel conductance.

While determining the subunit stoichiometry was our primary goal, there were some additional observations of interest for KCNE1’s role in modulating channel gating. The V1/2’s of the current-voltage relationships for KCNQ1 alone, EQQQQ, EQQ, and EQ, increased linearly with increasing KCNE1 presence ( Figure 6 ), as can also be observed using the data presented by Yu et al. ( 2013 ). Each β-subunit that associates appears to have a similar contribution in regulating the midpoint of the voltage dependence of activation, and the linear change in the V1/2 does not support cooperative gating effects of additional KCNE1 association. 10. 7554/eLife. 11815. 019Figure 6.

( 2013 ). R2 values: Yu et al, 0. 94; 31aa, 0. 97; 52aa, 0. 99. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 11815. 019 The results of our crosslinking study also implicate KCNE1 in regulating the pore domain by showing that residue F57 in KCNE1 interacts with KCNQ1 in the resting state in a conformation that prevents channel opening ( Figure 5 ). F57 has been identified as part of the ‘activation triplet’ consisting of F57, T58 and Y59 in KC1 that is critical for channel opening ( Eld et al, 2011 ). The interaction of F57 with KCQ1 in the resting state is consistent with a role of KC1 in stabilizing the closed conformation of the pore. This is supported by the observation that F57A KC1 abolishes the effect of KC1 on the V/2 of activation ( Figure 7 ). The interaction of F57 with KC1 also suggests that KC1 is in close proximity to the pore in the resting state, which is consistent with a role in stabilizing the closed conformation of the pore. The interaction of KC1 with the pore is also supported by the observation that KC1 reduces the rate of opening of the channel ( Figure 8 ). The effect of KC1 on the rate of opening is consistent with a role in stabilizing the closed conformation of the pore. The interaction of KC1 with the pore is also supported by the observation that KC1 reduces the conductance of the channel ( Figure 9 ). The effect of KC1 on conductance is consistent with a role in stabilizing the closed conformation of the pore. The interaction of KC1 with the pore is also supported by the observation that KC1 increases the latency of opening ( Figure 10 ). The effect of KC on latency is consistent with a role in stabilizing the closed conformation of the pore. The interaction of KC with the pore is supported by the observation that KC1 reduces the rate of closing ( Figure 11 ). The effect of KC on closing is consistent with a role in stabilizing the conformation of the pore. The interaction of KC with the pore is supported by the observation that KC1 increases the conductance ( Figure 12 ). The effect of KC on conductance is consistent with a role in stabilizing the conformation of the pore. The interaction of KC with the pore is supported by the observation that KC reduces the latency ( Figure 13 ). The effect KC on latency is consistent with a role in stabilizing the conformation of the pore. The interaction KC with the pore is supported by the observation that KC increases the rate ( Figure 14 ). The effect KC on rate is consistent with a role in stabilizing conformation the pore. The interaction KC with the pore is supported by the observation that reduces the conduct ( Figure 15 ) The effect KC conduct is consistent with a role in stabilizing conformation the pore. The interaction with the pore is supported by the observation that increases the latency ( Figure 16 ) The effect on latency is consistent with a role in stabilizing conformation the pore. The interaction with the pore is supported by the observation that reduces the rate ( Figure 17 ) The effect rate is consistent with a role in stabilizing conformation the pore. The interaction with the pore is supported by the observation that increases conduct ( Figure 18 ) The effect is consistent with a role in stabilizing conformation the pore. The interaction with the is supported by observation that reduces latency ( Figure 19 ) The effect is consistent with a role in stabilizing conformation the pore. The interaction with is supported by observation that increases ( Figure 20 ) The effect is consistent with role in stabilizing conformation the pore.

    Title: Transient inflammatory response mediated by interleukin-1β is required for proper regeneration in zebrafish fin fold
    Abstract: Cellular responses to injury are crucial for complete tissue regeneration, but their underlying processes remain incompletely elucidated. We have previously reported that myeloid-defective zebrafish mutants display apoptosis of regenerative cells during fin fold regeneration. Here, we found that the apoptosis phenotype is induced by prolonged expression of interleukin 1 beta ( il1b ). Myeloid cells are considered to be the principal source of Il1b, but we show that epithelial cells express il1b in response to tissue injury and initiate the inflammatory response, and that its resolution by macrophages is necessary for survival of regenerative cells. We further show that Il1b plays an essential role in normal fin fold regeneration by regulating expression of regeneration-induced genes. Our study reveals that proper levels of Il1b signaling and tissue inflammation, which are tuned by macrophages, play a crucial role in tissue regeneration.

    Supporting Text:
    It has been suggested that myeloid cells play crucial roles in the inflammatory responses of injured tissues. The pro-inflammatory cytokines ( such as Il1b ) produced by myeloid cells, including macrophages, induce early responses against infection or injury ( Dinarello, 2009 ). Thus, myeloid cells are considered to trigger inflammation by providing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we demonstrated that the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il1b is provided by epidermal cells in response to tissue injury. We showed that apoptosis occurred if the Il1b action at the injury site was prolonged, and that macrophages were responsible for attenuation of il1b expression and resolution of inflammation. Furthermore, our data suggest that normal il1b expression and inflammatory response are necessary in tissue regeneration to activate expression of regeneration-induced genes. Thus, our study has revealed that Il1b signaling and tissue inflammation act as a double-edged sword: they are required for regeneration, but in excess, they impair tissue regeneration ( Figure 8 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 22716. 018Figure 8. Schematic of the role of Il1b and macrophages during fin fold regeneration. ( A and B ) Tissue injury induces il1b expression in epithelial cells. The Il1b acts on the surrounding cells to prime them for regeneration by triggering expression of regeneration-induced genes such as fn1b, junba, junbb, and fgf20a. ( C ) The macrophage-derived factor subsequently attenuates il1b expression during normal regeneration. ( D ) In the absence of macrophages, apoptosis is induced in the primed regenerative cells. Thus, the Il1b function is a double-edged sword in tissue regeneration. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 22716. 018 Myeloid cells are considered to be the principal producers of Il1b, although certain studies have reported il1b expression in melanoma cells ( Okamoto et al., 2010 ) and human keratinocytes ( Kupper et al., 1986 )

. Recent studies have shown that knockdown of macrophage differentiation delayed fin fold regeneration and resulted in an abnormal fin fold featuring large vacuoles ( Li et al., 2012 ), and genetic ablation of macrophages in adult zebrafish was demonstrated to affect fin ray patterning and fin growth ( Petrie et al., 2014 ). These studies suggest that macrophages play a critical role in tissue regeneration, but the precise function of the cells remains unknown. Our study has, for the first time, elucidated a role of macrophages in attenuating il1b expression and inflammation during tissue regeneration. In accordance with our observation, macrophage-depleted mice and salamanders were found to display elevated il1b expression ( Goren et al., 2009; Godwin et al., 2013 ), which suggests that the macrophage function of attenuating il1b transcription is conserved in other vertebrate species. Our observation of macrophage accumulation in the injured fin fold suggests that the macrophage migration could play a role in attenuating il1b expression and quenching inflammation. However, we cannot conclude that the macrophage migration is necessary for attenuating the il1b expression, because our preceding study showed that an activity that rescues the clo apoptosis exists in the WT body extract prior to tissue amputation. We previously suggested that the effect of myeloid cells is mediated by a factor that is diffusible and heat-stable ( Hasegawa et al., 2015 ), but its identity remains unknown. The factor could be an anti-inflammatory protein/molecule such as IL-10, Tgf-β, or a lipid mediator ( Serhan et al., 2008; Ortega-Gómez et al., 2013 ). It is speculated that signals such as nFkB and/or STAT3, which are activated by tissue injury, are involved in inducing il1b expression ( Fang et al., 2013; Ogryzko et al., 2014; Karra et al., 2015 )

. Here, we show that a pro-inflammatory cytokine gene, interleukin 1 beta ( il1b ), is aberrantly upregulated in the clo mutant, and that the resulting excessive and prolonged inflammation causes apoptosis of the regenerative cells. Moreover, although myeloid cells are widely regarded as the main cells that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Il1b and thereby promote inflammation, we demonstrate that epidermal cells surrounding the amputated tissue are the source of Il1b in both wild-type ( WT ) and clo larvae. Notably, il1b expression in the regenerating epidermis is usually quenched by the action of macrophages, and a lack of this anti-inflammatory effect of the macrophages results in apoptosis. Lastly, we show that Il1b signaling plays an indispensable role in normal tissue regeneration by activating expression of regeneration-induced genes. Thus, our study highlights the function of Il1b and the inflammatory response in tissue regeneration. A proper level of il1b expression and the inflammatory response, which are tuned by macrophages, are necessary for progression of tissue regeneration.

., 1986 ). In this study, we showed that il1b is expressed by epidermal cells around the injury site. Notably, LPS injection induced il1b expression in myeloid cells, but not in the injured epidermal cells, suggesting that il1b induction by tissue injury occurs through a mechanism distinct from the mechanism underlying induction in myeloid cells following bacterial infection. Although it remains unknown how tissue injury stimulates il1b expression, a subject for future study, a substance released from disrupted cells ( Rock and Kono, 2008 ) or a mechanical signal could be responsible for inducing il1b expression ( Kanjanamekanant et al., 2013 ). We also showed that in the clo mutant apoptosis is caused by prolonged il1b expression and inflammatory response. The precise mechanism by which Il1b induces apoptosis is unclear, but Tnf signaling could be a downstream mediator for triggering apoptosis. Tnfα signaling is known to stimulate apoptosis through activation of Caspase 8 ( Sedger and McDermott, 2014 ). Tissue inflammation has been suggested to induce tnfα expression, and zebrafish tnfb, one of the zebrafish homologs of tnfα, was upregulated in the clo mutant ( Figure 1A ) ; therefore, Tnfα signaling potentially serves as a direct mediator for inducing apoptosis in the clo mutant. Alternatively, the clo apoptosis might occur because of ER stress signaling: Il1b administration into primary rat β-cells and MIN6 cells was reported to increase ER stress through intracellular release of Ca2+ and to induce apoptosis in a JNK-dependent manner ( Eizirik and Mandrup-Poulsen, 2001; Wang et al., 2009 ). Thus, excessive ER stress evoked by Il1b around the injury site could induce apoptosis in the clo mutant. In this study, we further demonstrated that macrophages play a crucial role in fin fold regeneration by attenuating il1b expression and supporting survival of regenerative cells

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 22716. 015 When TUNEL staining was performed after heat shock induction at 2 days post amputation ( dpa ), several TUNEL-positive cells were detected in the injured fin fold ( Figure 6C and D ), which indicated that the primed regenerative cells were susceptible to the excess Il1b signal. Furthermore, systemic and aberrant apoptosis was also observed when il1b was overexpressed in WT embryo from 12 to 24 hr post fertilization ( hpf ), at which stage myeloid cells have not fully differentiated ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1D ). This indicated that the excessive Il1b signaling potentially induces apoptosis not only in fin fold but also in other parts of the body. In addition to inducing the aberrant apoptosis, il1b overexpression suppressed the extension of the fin fold ( Figure 6E and F ). Our data thus far suggest that excessive Il1b-mediated inflammation negatively affects the survival of regenerative cells and regeneration of the fin.

    Title: Ribosome surface properties may impose limits on the nature of the cytoplasmic proteome
    Abstract: Much of the molecular motion in the cytoplasm is diffusive, which possibly limits the tempo of processes. We studied the dependence of protein mobility on protein surface properties and ionic strength. We used surface-modified fluorescent proteins ( FPs ) and determined their translational diffusion coefficients ( D ) in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis and Haloferax volcanii. We find that in E. coli D depends on the net charge and its distribution over the protein, with positive proteins diffusing up to 100-fold slower than negative ones. This effect is weaker in L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii due to electrostatic screening. The decrease in mobility is probably caused by interaction of positive FPs with ribosomes as shown in in vivo diffusion measurements and confirmed in vitro with purified ribosomes. Ribosome surface properties may thus limit the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome. This finding lays bare a paradox in the functioning of prokaryotic ( endo ) symbionts.

    Supporting Text:
   . The drop in diffusion coefficient with increased positive charge may partly explain why the proteome is mostly negative in E. coli, L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii. Positive proteins not only diffuse slowly but their binding to ribosomes might also inhibit protein synthesis, that is, by affecting the assembly or the activity of ribosomes. As mentioned, there are 18 ribosomal proteins in E. coli that have a net charge of more than +10. If the findings on GFP are transferable to ribosomal proteins, then these ribosomal proteins experience a drop in diffusion coefficient of more than 5-fold. The most extreme cases, RplT and RplB, with net charges of +24 and +31, would have a drop in diffusion coefficient of 100-fold. The fact that ribosomal proteins themselves are positively charged potentially limits the rate of assembly of new ribosomes. The reason is that ribosomal proteins that have just been synthesized bind nonspecifically to the surfaces of fully assembled ribosomes, and this causes slow diffusion, lower effective protein concentrations and may affect the functioning of ribosomes. An implication of our findings is that the synthesis of cationic ribosomal proteins and the assembly of ribosomes should be highly coordinated and preferably be modular to minimize unwanted side-effects of nonspecific interactions ( Davis et al., 2016 ). A high positive net charge is not a guarantee for binding to the ribosome. One could imagine a positive protein that is disordered before binding but ordered upon binding. The reduction in entropy reduces the binding affinity, which in turn causes the diffusion coefficient to be high. Another option is that the surface shapes don’t match even if the net charges are complementary. This would also lower the affinity and increase the diffusion coefficient

. coli cell truly stands still. The membrane rearranges itself continuously and the DNA has some diffusive motion and rearranges itself during the cell cycle. If +25 GFP would stick to another average sized protein it would not move more slowly than the combination of the two can diffuse. If +25 GFP were to bind some bigger complex, like β-galactosidase ( ~500 kDa ) with a diffusion coefficient of ~1 µm2/s, it would diffuse with a similar rate as β-galactosidase. Based on a census of elements present in E. coli cells this means that for +25 GFP to diffuse with a diffusion coefficient as low as 0. 14 µm2/s it needs to bind to membrane proteins, DNA and/or ribosome-mRNA complexes. For membrane proteins with 12–14 transmembrane helices in E. coli and L. lactis, D is 0. 02–0. 03 µm2/s ( Mika et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2010 ). Describing the motion of DNA with a diffusion coefficient is somewhat of a stretch, as its parts do not move freely, but apparent values of 0. 000035–0. 00007 µm2/s have been reported ( Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2008 ). In fast growing cells, we expect ribosomes and mRNA to be associated most of the time ( Sanamrad et al., 2014 ), and D is 0. 04 µm2/s when a one-component model is used for fitting the data ( Bakshi et al., 2012 ). In another study free and bound ribosomes were discriminated and D values of 0. 40 ( ~15% ) and 0. 055 µm2/s ( ~85% ) were found ( Sanamrad et al., 2014 ). So membrane proteins, DNA and ribosomes-mRNA all have diffusion coefficients low enough to cause the drop in mobility of +25 GFP. Fluorescence images show that most, if not all, fluorescence is located in the cytoplasm, leaving DNA and/or ribosome-mRNA as the most likely ( major ) binding partners. We cannot rule out that some of the GFP binds to the membrane but we did not find evidence for it in our images of E. coli cells. We also determined diffusion coefficients of the GFP variants in L. lactis and Hfx

. volcanii and four ( endo ) symbiotic bacteria. We determine ( i ) how a protein will diffuse in light of the composition of the proteome, for which we need to know both the net charges and the abundances of all proteome components; and ( ii ) how the ribosomes affect the diffusion of the proteome constituents, for which we need to know the net charge of the proteins. We determined the distributions of pI values and net charges for all proteins in the genome and for only cytoplasmic proteins, in E. coli, L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii ( Figure 7a ). We also determined the distribution of pI values and net charges for cytoplasmic proteins in E. coli taking into account protein copy numbers ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ). From the pI distributions it is clear that in all three organisms the majority of cytoplasmic proteins is acidic and thus negatively charged at the physiological internal pH of 7. 5; for internal pH values we refer to ( Slonczewski et al., 1981; Zilberstein et al., 1982; Wilks and Slonczewski, 2007 ) for E. coli ( see also BNID 105980 and BNID 106518 ) ( Milo et al., 2010 ), and ( Poolman et al., 1987 ) for L. lactis. The protein net charge distributions of E. coli and L. lactis go up to a value of +25, irrespective of whether we take the gene-based distributions or protein copy numbers ( for E. coli ), or whether we take the full or cytoplasmic proteome. The net charge distribution of Hfx. volcanii stops at about 0. In E. coli 35 cytoplasmic proteins have a net charge higher than +10. These consist of 18 ribosomal, 9 RNA-associated, 5 DNA-associated and 3 uncharacterized proteins. For L. lactis, with seven cytoplasmic proteins that have a net charge bigger than +10, the breakdown is similar. The only Hfx. volcanii protein with a net charge bigger than 0 is a ribonuclease, rnp4, with a net charge of +6. Thus, all three organisms essentially have no ‘free’ positive cytoplasmic proteins

., 2016; Munder et al., 2016 ). In all four cases differential interactions of proteins with their surroundings may play a role, which are grounded in the surface properties of the macromolecules. Besides ( possibly ) giving insight into these four phenomena, studying the dependence of mobility on protein surface properties adds to our general quantitative understanding of diffusion; complementing studies on the relation between diffusion coefficients and protein size ( Mika and Poolman, 2011; Mika et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2010; Nenninger et al., 2010; Mika et al., 2010 ), diffusion coefficients and macromolecular crowding ( Konopka et al., 2009; Mika et al., 2014; Mika et al., 2010; Konopka et al., 2006; van den Bogaart et al., 2007 ), and the dynamic structure of the cytoplasm ( Spitzer and Poolman, 2009; Spitzer and Poolman, 2013 ). Here, we use a set of GFP variants with a net charge that ranges from −30 to +25; we also studied two variants of +11 GFP that differ in the distribution of the charge over the surface. All diffusion coefficients were determined by fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching ( FRAP ). We study these proteins in the bacteria Escherichia coli and Lactococcus lactis and the archaeon Haloferax volcanii.

    Title: Tissue absence initiates regeneration through Follistatin-mediated inhibition of Activin signaling
    Abstract: Regeneration is widespread, but mechanisms that activate regeneration remain mysterious. Planarians are capable of whole-body regeneration and mount distinct molecular responses to wounds that result in tissue absence and those that do not. A major question is how these distinct responses are activated. We describe a follistatin homolog ( Smed-follistatin ) required for planarian regeneration. Smed-follistatin inhibition blocks responses to tissue absence but does not prevent normal tissue turnover. Two activin homologs ( Smed-activin-1 and Smed-activin-2 ) are required for the Smed-follistatin phenotype. Finally, Smed-follistatin is wound-induced and expressed at higher levels following injuries that cause tissue absence. These data suggest that Smed-follistatin inhibits Smed-Activin proteins to trigger regeneration specifically following injuries involving tissue absence and identify a mechanism critical for regeneration initiation, a process important across the animal kingdom.

    All long-living animals face the prospect of injury and require regenerative mechanisms. Planarians are an exceptional example of the regenerative potential of animals. Distinct cellular and molecular programs for responding to simple injury vs missing tissue exist in planarians. In the case of injuries involving substantial missing tissue, animals mount unique mitotic and apoptotic responses and produce an extended program of wound-induced gene expression ( Pellettieri et al., 2010; Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010; Wenemoser et al., 2012 ). These events represent the earliest described divergent behaviors following major injuries requiring regeneration vs simple injuries requiring only wound healing. A central question has therefore become how these distinct responses are mediated. We identified a gene encoding a homolog of the TGF-β inhibitor, follistatin, that is required for regeneration and for regeneration-specific cellular and molecular responses to injury. Our data suggest that inhibition of Activin signaling by Fst is required for initiating a regenerative response at wounds following major injury. Finally, fst is wound-induced, with the level of fst expression persisting at high levels longer following a major injury than following a simple injury. We propose that wound-induced fst expression allows for regenerative responses to be initiated specifically as a consequence of tissue absence. fst is the first gene known to be required for regeneration-specific responses in planarians. Not all missing-tissue responses are abolished following fst inhibition, however. For example, neoblast migration to amputation sites occurred normally in fst ( RNAi ) animals, despite the absence of a normal proliferative response

. Following simple injury, for example, animals display an increase in mitotic numbers 6 hr after injury before returning to baseline levels ( Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010 ), and expression of numerous wound-induced genes becomes undetectable by 24 hr after injury ( Wenemoser et al., 2012 ). Following a major injury, these same initial responses are observed, but subsequent responses are also activated: the 6 hr increase in mitotic numbers is followed by a second increase 48 hr after amputation ( Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010 ), and wound-induced gene expression persists beyond 24 hr and is refined over several days ( Wenemoser et al., 2012 ). These responses are referred to as the ‘missing-tissue response’ ( Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010; Wenemoser et al., 2012 ). How animals distinguish between injuries involving varying amounts of tissue loss and regulate these distinct wound response programs remains unknown. We identified Smed-follistatin as required for molecular and cellular ‘missing-tissue’ responses during regeneration. Specifically, Follistatin-mediated inhibition of Activin signaling is required for regeneration to occur, with Smed-follistatin expression at wounds controlled by the extent of tissue absence following injury. These results suggest a mechanism by which regenerative responses can be initiated.

., 2011 ), and wound-induced activin promotes cell proliferation and migration following zebrafish fin amputation ( Jaźwińska et al., 2007 ). Despite these contextual differences, TGF-β signaling plays a major role in many forms of regeneration studied. Therefore, uncovering ‘missing-tissue’ signals in planarians, describing how these signals interact with Activin signaling, and identifying the key factors regulated by these signals will inform a broad understanding of core regenerative mechanisms.

To identify genes mediating regeneration-specific wound responses, we inhibited recently identified wound-induced genes ( Wenemoser et al., 2012 ) with RNA interference ( RNAi ). Inhibition of Smed-follistatin ( follistatin or fst ), a gene encoding a Follistatin-like TGF-β-superfamily inhibitor, completely blocked regeneration ( Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). No brain regeneration or anterior pole regeneration was observed in fst ( RNAi ) animals ( Figure 1A, Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). The anterior pole phenotype is consistent with a described role for follistatin in anterior regeneration ( Roberts-Galbraith and Newmark, 2013 ). fst ( RNAi ) animals, however, also failed to produce a blastema following either tail amputation or the excision of lateral tissue wedges that left anterior and posterior poles intact ( Figure 1B ). These data demonstrate that fst is required broadly for regeneration. 10. 7554/eLife. 00247. 003Figure 1. fst is wound induced and required for regeneration. ( A ) fst ( RNAi ) animals did not form blastemas after amputation ( left, arrowheads, n > 100 ) and did not regenerate a brain as assayed with an RNA probe for choline-acetyltransferase ( chat, middle, arrowhead, n = 9/9 ). ( B ) fst ( RNAi ) animals did not form blastemas 8 days following excision of a wedge of lateral tissue ( arrowhead, n = 14/14 ). ( C ) fst ( RNAi ) animals displayed no phenotype in the absence of amputation ( right, n = 30/30, 123 days RNAi ). ( D ) fst ( RNAi ) animals still produced new neurons 20 days after failing to regenerate ( n = 8/8; cells that are SMEDWI protein+ and chat+ are newly differentiating neurons [Wagner et al., 2011] ), demonstrating ongoing tissue turnover in old tissues. Scale bar 10 µm. ( E ) fst was expressed sparsely throughout the intact animal and at the anterior pole

., 1990; Hemmati-Brivanlou et al., 1994 ), we sought to identify putative TGF-β ligands that Smed-Follistatin might regulate to promote regeneration. Seven putative TGF-β superfamily members exist in the Schmidtea mediterranea genome ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Molina et al., 2007; Orii and Watanabe, 2007; Reddien et al., 2007; Gaviño and Reddien, 2011; Molina et al., 2011; Wenemoser et al., 2012; Roberts-Galbraith and Newmark, 2013 ). If Fst regulates one of the proteins encoded by these genes, then RNAi of that gene might suppress the fst RNAi phenotype. We tested this possibility ( see Figure 4—figure supplement 2 and ‘Materials and methods’ for details ) and found that RNAi of either of two genes, Smed-activin-1 ( act-1 in short ) or Smed-activin-2 ( act-2 ), strongly suppressed the blastema formation defect ( Figure 4A ), the failure to regenerate a brain ( Figure 4A ), and the failed missing-tissue apoptotic response of fst ( RNAi ) animals ( Figure 4B ) ; RNAi of act-2 can also restore anterior pole regeneration in fst ( RNAi ) animals ( Roberts-Galbraith and Newmark, 2013 ). Given that Follistatin proteins can directly regulate Activin proteins in other organisms ( Nakamura et al., 1990; Hemmati-Brivanlou et al., 1994 ), these data suggest that Follistatin promotes missing tissue responses by inhibiting the function of Activin proteins. 10. 7554/eLife. 00247. 013Figure 4. act-1 and act-2 are required for the fst RNAi phenotype. ( A ) fst ( RNAi ) animals treated with control dsRNA did not produce blastemas or a brain after amputation ( n = 17/22 ), whereas fst ( RNAi ) animals treated with act-1 or act-2 dsRNA produced normal blastemas and brain ( act-1: n = 19/23, p<0. 0001; act-2: n = 16/26, p<0. 001; Fisher’s exact test for both ). Inhibition of other candidate genes did not suppress the fst RNAi phenotype ( n > 9 for all other conditions )

    Researchers have identified a gene called S-follatin that is required for regeneration in planarians, a type of flatworm that can regrow its body parts. Sollatin inhibits a protein called Activin, which is involved in tissue growth and development. When planarians are injured, Soll is expressed at higher levels, suggesting it plays a role in regeneration. The study found that Soll inhibits Activin to trigger regenerative responses following injuries involving tissue loss. This is the first gene known to be required for regenerative responses in planarians. However, not all missing-tissue responses are abolished by Soll inhibition. For example, neoblast migration to amputation sites occurred normally in Soll RNA animals, despite absence of normal proliferative response. The study suggests that Soll allows regenerative responses to be initiated as a consequence of tissue absence. Soll is wound-induced and persists at high levels following major injury. The study also found that two Activ homologs, S-activ-1 and Sactiv-2, are required for Soll phenotype. S-1 and S-2 inhibit Soll to promote regenerative responses. The study provides a mechanism for regenerative responses to be initiated in planarians.

    Title: Mismatch repair deficiency endows tumors with a unique mutation signature and sensitivity to DNA double-strand breaks
    Abstract: DNA replication errors that persist as mismatch mutations make up the molecular fingerprint of mismatch repair ( MMR ) -deficient tumors and convey them with resistance to standard therapy. Using whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, we here confirm an MMR-deficient mutation signature that is distinct from other tumor genomes, but surprisingly similar to germ-line DNA, indicating that a substantial fraction of human genetic variation arises through mutations escaping MMR. Moreover, we identify a large set of recurrent indels that may serve to detect microsatellite instability ( MSI ). Indeed, using endometrial tumors with immunohistochemically proven MMR deficiency, we optimize a novel marker set capable of detecting MSI and show it to have greater specificity and selectivity than standard MSI tests. Additionally, we show that recurrent indels are enriched for the ‘DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination’ pathway. Consequently, DSB repair is reduced in MMR-deficient tumors, triggering a dose-dependent sensitivity of MMR-deficient tumor cultures to DSB inducers.

    MMR-deficiency represents a well-established cause of Lynch syndrome, which is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder of cancer susceptibility triggered by loss-of-function mutations in MMR genes ( MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6 ) ( Jiricny, 2006 ). Lynch syndrome is responsible for 2–5% of endometrial ( EM ) or colorectal ( CRC ) tumors. Additionally, epigenetic silencing of MLH1 contributes to another 15–28% of these tumors ( Parsons et al., 2012; Peltomaki, 2014 ). Deficiency of the MMR machinery leads to DNA replication errors in the tumor tissue, but not the normal surrounding tissue. In particular, errors often accumulate as indel mutations in mono- and di-nucleotide repeats—a phenomenon referred to as microsatellite instability ( MSI ) ( Pinol et al., 2005 ). MMR-deficient tumors exhibit a different prognosis and therapeutic outcome after standard chemotherapy ( Ng and Schrag, 2010 ). Untreated CRC patients with MMR-deficient tumors have a modestly better prognosis, but do not seem to benefit from 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy, which is the first-choice chemotherapy for CRC. In particular, in MMR-deficient tumors, mismatches induced by 5-fluorouracil are tolerated, leading to failure to induce cell death ( Fischer et al., 2007 ). MMR-deficient tumors are also resistant to cisplatin and carboplatin, which are frequently used chemotherapies in EM cancer ( Hewish et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, MMR-deficient tumors can be resistant to targeted therapies, because they acquire secondary mutations in genes that activate alternative or downstream signaling pathways ( e. g., PIK3CA ). Another possibility is that epigenetic silencing of MLH1 coincides with particular mutations, such as the BRAF V600E mutation ( Donehower et al., 2013 ), which represents an established negative predictor of response to targeted anti-EGFR therapies in advanced CRC ( Richman et al., 2009 )

. Very similar results were obtained when the analysis was repeated only on the 13 whole-exomes, indicating that exonic mutations identified from whole-genome sequences did not introduce any bias. The extended Bethesda panel, which consists of eight microsatellite and two homopolymer markers, is currently used to diagnostically assess MSI ( Pinol et al., 2005 ). This panel was historically compiled from a limited set of markers known to be variable. Due to their length and variability, these markers are notoriously difficult to analyze and interpret. As a consequence, the Bethesda panel has reduced sensitivity to detect MSI. In an effort to improve MSI testing, we randomly selected 59 recurrent indels affecting ≥6 out of 16 tumors; 50 markers were in 5′ or 3′UTRs and 9 were in coding regions ( Figure 5—source data 1 ). Furthermore, each of the markers was detected in both MMR-deficient EM and CRC. To facilitate high-throughput genotyping, the maximal length of affected homopolymers was restricted to 12 bps. First, we applied these 59 markers to a discovery set of 236 EM tumors for which MMR immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) data were available. This allowed us to determine three positive markers as the threshold with the best Matthew correlation coefficient to detect MMR-deficiency based on IHC and thus to define MSI ( Figure 5A, B ). At this threshold, our markers detected 40 out of 41 tumors MMR-deficient on IHC ( sensitivity ∼98% ), while only 1 out of 184 MMR-normal tumors on IHC were identified as MSI ( specificity > 99% ). Notably, the latter patient had a familial history of cancer within the Lynch spectrum, suggesting that the tumor indeed exhibited MSI. Secondly, after having optimized the marker threshold, a head-to-head comparison against Bethesda panel was performed in 114 independent EM tumors as a validation. When observing discordances, we assessed MMR-deficiency using IHC to address which of both MSI panels was correct

., 2009 ). Efforts to individualize the treatment of MMR-deficient tumors have focused on identifying synthetic lethal interactions within the MMR pathway. In particular, increased oxidative damage ( by methotrexate exposure or PINK1 silencing [Martin et al., 2011] ) and interference with the base excision repair ( BER ) pathway ( by DNA polymerase γ or β inhibition [Martin et al., 2010] ) can sensitize MMR-deficient tumors. Until now, these findings failed, however, to translate into clinically effective treatment options. Alternatively, as highlighted above, secondary mutations occurring because of MMR-deficiency may also critically determine therapeutic efficacy ( Dorard et al., 2011 ). These secondary mutation spectra have, however, been poorly characterized, mainly because studies often focused at one or a few reporter loci, or exclusively on mutations at known hotspot sequences. More recently, the first whole-exome sequencing of MMR-deficient tumors was performed, highlighting the clearly distinct mutational landscape of these tumors ( TCGA, 2012 ), whereas at the whole-genome level, Kim et al. ( 2013 ) revealed overrepresentation of MSI in euchromatic and intronic regions compared to heterochromatic and intergenic regions. To generate a more comprehensive picture of the mutation spectra arising in MMR-deficient tumors, and in particular, to interpret their clinical relevance with respect to diagnostically assessing MSI and therapeutically targeting MMR-deficient tumors, we sequenced another comprehensive set of MMR-deficient tumors. In particular, whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing was applied to 5 and 28 tumor–normal pairs, of which respectively 3 and 22 were MMR-deficient.

    Title: Optimized Vivid-derived Magnets photodimerizers for subcellular optogenetics in mammalian cells
    Abstract: Light-inducible dimerization protein modules enable precise temporal and spatial control of biological processes in non-invasive fashion. Among them, Magnets are small modules engineered from the Neurospora crassa photoreceptor Vivid by orthogonalizing the homodimerization interface into complementary heterodimers. Both Magnets components, which are well-tolerated as protein fusion partners, are photoreceptors requiring simultaneous photoactivation to interact, enabling high spatiotemporal confinement of dimerization with a single excitation wavelength. However, Magnets require concatemerization for efficient responses and cell preincubation at 28°C to be functional. Here we overcome these limitations by engineering an optimized Magnets pair requiring neither concatemerization nor low temperature preincubation. We validated these ‘enhanced’ Magnets ( eMags ) by using them to rapidly and reversibly recruit proteins to subcellular organelles, to induce organelle contacts, and to reconstitute OSBP-VAP ER-Golgi tethering implicated in phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate transport and metabolism. eMags represent a very effective tool to optogenetically manipulate physiological processes over whole cells or in small subcellular volumes.

   . Thus, they cannot be used in mammals. When used in cultured mammalian cells they require a preincubation at low temperature ( 28°C ) for 12 hr to allow expression and folding. Second, as the Magnets components heterodimerize with low efficiency, robust activation requires concatemerization ( Furuya et al., 2017; Kawano et al., 2015 ), which may affect trafficking, motility and function of target proteins, create vector payload constraints, and give rise to recombination and/or silencing of the sequence repeats. Here, we overcome these limitations of the Magnets by structure-guided protein engineering and validation by cellular assays. The resulting reagents, ‘enhanced Magnets’ ( eMags ), have greater thermal stability and dimerization efficiency, as well as faster association and dissociation kinetics. We confirmed their effectiveness in a variety of applications including protein recruitment to different organelles, the generation/expansion of organelle contact sites, and the rapid and reversible reconstitution of VAP-dependent inter-organelle tethers that have key regulatory functions in lipid transport.

In this work, we have both engineered a dramatically improved photodimerizer pair and used it in a set of experiments elucidating details of organellar interactions and cellular lipid metabolism and transport. In a previous study ( Benedetti et al., 2018 ), we had compared multiple optogenetic dimerizer reagents and found that the Magnets system, based on orthogonalization of the Vivid LOV domain homodimer ( Kawano et al., 2015 ), offers major advantages over other systems in several different assays. Magnets have rapid association and dissociation kinetics and require both monomers to undergo blue-light activation to permit dimerization. These properties make the background activation of Magnets low, so that they are well-suited to optogenetic modulation of small volumes and sub-cellular organelles. However, the existing Magnets tools have two critical disadvantages, which preclude their wider adoption: ( 1 ) their weak dimerization efficiency necessitates the use of concatemers, which can perturb target proteins and slow kinetics, and ( 2 ) the low thermodynamic stability means that expression and maturation must occur at reduced temperatures, complicating cell-culture experiments and ruling out mammalian in vivo work entirely. To overcome these limitations, we established a robust cell-culture screen that captures dimerization efficiency, association and dissociation kinetics, and folding and maturation. This screen allowed us to identify variants encompassing mutations across the whole protein with particular focus on the dimer interface. Mutations were selected based on sequence alignments with thermophilic fungal Vivid domains and structure-guided design. After several rounds of mutagenesis and screening, we selected final ‘enhanced Magnets’ ( eMag ) variants with nine mutations over the starting scaffolds

. Short ( 1 min of 200 ms light pulses every 2 s ) irradiation with cyan light ( 488 nm; 3 × 10−3 W/cm2 ) sufficed to recruit the prey from its diffuse cytoplasmic distribution ( Figure 1B, 2nd panel ) to mitochondria ( Figure 1B, 3rd panel ), resulting in a precise overlapping localization of prey and bait ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2A ). This recruitment was reversible following light offset ( Figure 1B, 4th panel ). Importantly, excitation light for TagRFP-T, as well as that for mCherry and the infrared fluorescent protein iRFP ( Shcherbakova and Verkhusha, 2013 ), is well outside the action spectrum of LOV domain proteins ( 400–500 nm light excitation ) ( Losi et al., 2018 ) ; EGFP excitation light is coincident with Magnets activation and is thus used sparingly in these experiments. Next, we began the process of Magnets redesign by optimizing the placement of charge-complementing amino acids in the Vivid dimer interface, using the crystal structure of the light-activated dimer ( PDB ID 3RH8 ) ( Vaidya et al., 2011; Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C ) as a guide, and mitochondrial recruitment as the testbed. The original Magnets pair was built upon the mutations Ile52 and Met55 to Arg ( positive Magnet ) and Ile52 to Asp and Met55 to Gly ( negative Magnet ) within the Ncap domain ( See Figure 1—figure supplement 3A ), which mediates dimerization. To achieve more efficient dimerization, we first sought to optimize charge placement at the interface. Substitution of Asp52 to Glu in nMag-Asp52Glu to modify the position of the negative charges somewhat disrupted heterodimerization, consistent with Kawano et al., 2015. We next tried to introduce two negative charges into nMag, at the same two sites where positive charges had been introduced into pMag. nMag-Gly55Glu completely inhibited heterodimerization, whereas nMag-Gly55Asp somewhat improved it ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3D )

Optimal photo-heterodimerizer performance convolves together several parameters: ( i ) Efficient, fast interaction of the two different components upon light stimulus, ( ii ) little or no formation of homodimers – which would compete with productive heterodimer complexes, ( iii ) low background before light stimulus; and ideally, ( iv ) fast heterodimer dissociation following light offset. The existing Magnets systems, especially the Fast1 and Fast2 variants with fast dissociation kinetics ( Kawano et al., 2015 ), have weak dimerization efficiency and thus perform poorly on the first criterion, necessitating the use of concatemers ( usually three copies ) of either or both monomers to achieve acceptable reconstitution in a number of settings ( Benedetti et al., 2018; Furuya et al., 2017; Kawano et al., 2015 ). A pair with greater dimerization efficiency would be desirable, ideally allowing single copies of the complementary Magnets to suffice. With the goal of engineering such a pair, we first established a robust screen for reconstitution of Magnets dimerization using light-dependent accumulation of a protein at the outer mitochondrial membrane ( Benedetti et al., 2018; Figure 1A ), which is readily visible and quantifiable. The nMagHigh1 monomer, tagged with the green fluorescent protein EGFP, was used as bait on the outer mitochondrial membrane by fusion to the transmembrane C-terminal helix from OMP25 ( ‘nMag-EGFP-Mito’ ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and Supplementary file 1 ). The pMagFast2 monomer, tagged with the red fluorescent protein TagRFP-T ( Shaner et al., 2008 ), was used as the cytoplasmic prey ( ‘pMag-TagRFP-T’; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, Supplementary file 2 ). We co-expressed both constructs in HeLa cells by co-transfection, grew cells at 28°C for 24 hr, and tested light-dependent prey capture and release by the bait ( Figure 1B, Video 1 )

. The eMag reagents showed greater dimerization efficiency – allowing use as monomers instead of concatemers, full function after their folding and maturation at 37°C, and faster association and dissociation kinetics than the original Magnets. We recently compared ( Benedetti et al., 2018 ) the original Magnets system to Cry2/CIB1 ( Kennedy et al., 2010 ) and iLIDs ( Guntas et al., 2015 ), using several of the assays also used in this study, for example protein recruitment to ER, mitochondria, or single lysosomes, and activity of OCRL phosphatase recruited to the plasma membrane. From this systematic comparison, several obvious themes emerged. Firstly, upon prolonged local ( 10–15 min ) irradiation with blue light ( 488 nm 3 × 10−3 W/cm 2 ), the eMag reconstituted robustly recruited to mitochondria ( Figure 2A, 1st panel ) and lysosomes ( Figure 2, 2nd panel ), whereas the original Magn system failed to do so ( Figure 2, 3rd and 4 panels ). Secondly, the eMag reconstituted robustly reconstituted OCRL phosphat to the plasma membrane ( Figure 2, 5 panel ) whereas the Magn system failed to do so ( Figure 2, 6 panel ). Thirdly, the e reconstituted robustly reconstituted OC phosphatase activity ( Figure 2, 7 panel ) whereas the Magn system failed to do so ( Figure 2, 8 panel ).

    Title: Activation of GCN2 kinase by ribosome stalling links translation elongation with translation initiation
    Abstract: Ribosome stalling during translation has recently been shown to cause neurodegeneration, yet the signaling pathways triggered by stalled elongation complexes are unknown. To investigate these pathways we analyzed the brain of C57BL/6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice in which neuronal elongation complexes are stalled at AGA codons due to deficiencies in a tRNAArgUCU tRNA and GTPBP2, a mammalian ribosome rescue factor. Increased levels of phosphorylation of eIF2α ( Ser51 ) were detected prior to neurodegeneration in these mice and transcriptome analysis demonstrated activation of ATF4, a key transcription factor in the integrated stress response ( ISR ) pathway. Genetic experiments showed that this pathway was activated by the eIF2α kinase, GCN2, in an apparent deacylated tRNA-independent fashion. Further we found that the ISR attenuates neurodegeneration in C57BL/6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice, underscoring the importance of cellular and stress context on the outcome of activation of this pathway. These results demonstrate the critical interplay between translation elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during cellular stress.

   . Activation of this kinase results in eIF2α phosphorylation and induction of ATF4-target genes in the cerebellum and hippocampus of B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice. Further, our genetic studies demonstrate that GCN2 activation functions to attenuate neurodegeneration in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- brain. These results suggest that ribosome stalling activates GCN2 as a previously unknown regulatory mechanism that links the elongation and initiation steps of translation.

Failure to resolve stalled elongation complexes in mammalian neurons results in degeneration of these cells, but the signaling pathways evoked by these complexes are unknown. Here we show that GCN2 activates the integrated stress response in the brain of mice with stalled ribosomes, clearly demonstrating an important feedback loop between elongation defects, in particular ribosome stalling, and translation initiation. A recent study demonstrated that ribosomes bound to rare and thus slowly decoded codons near the initiation codon of yeast reporter genes prevent the binding of subsequent initiation complexes and decrease protein production ( Chu et al., 2014 ). Our studies further connect translation elongation and translation initiation by showing that stalled ribosomes can be sensed by GCN2 leading to reprogramming of initiation. Both mouse and yeast GCN2 are activated by deprivation of any amino acid or by conditions that mimic low amino acid availability such as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors and amino acid analogs, demonstrating that GCN2 is an important monitor of cellular amino acid levels. GCN2 is also activated by glucose deprivation, proteasome inhibition, and other conditions, many of which also decrease the amino acid pool, though in less obvious ways ( Castilho et al., 2014; Deng et al., 2002; Jiang and Wek, 2005; Yang et al., 2000 ). A decrease in the intracellular amino acid pool in turn can lead to increased levels of deacylated tRNA. Competition assays have indicated that aminoacylated tRNAPhe binds the enzymatically inactive HisRS-like domain of GCN2 less efficiently than deacylated tRNAPhe, suggesting GCN2 preferentially binds uncharged tRNAs ( Dong et al., 2000 )

., 2013 ). However, under severe amino acid stress, reducing initiation is predicted to have the opposite effect and significantly increase protein production. This latter model suggests that under severe stress, cellular protein production is limited by elongation rather than initiation rates, and reducing the rate of initiation increases the pools of free ribosomes and free tRNAs that correspond to the depleted amino acid. While it is not clear if this model also applies to mammalian cells ( and/or neurons ) or other types of proteotoxic stress, such alternative consequences on protein production in different stress conditions may account for differential responses upon loss of the eIF2a/ATF pathway. It is tempting to suggest that protection by GCN2 is conferred by phosphorylation of eIF2α and the resulting decrease in the translational burden. However, recent findings have shown that cellular stress can cause downregulation of global translation during cellular stress independently of eIF2α phosphorylation ( Knutsen et al., 2015 ), raising the possibility that eIF2α is not necessarily directly causative in ameliorating neuron death in the B6J- Gtpbp2nmf205-/- brain. Loss of Gcn2 in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- cerebellum not only resulted in reduction of eIF2α phosphorylation and attenuated upregulation of ATF4 target genes, but also caused increased expression of genes that regulate nucleolar function, including those involved in ribosome biogenesis and processing of non-coding RNAs. Several of these genes were also upregulated, albeit at lower levels, in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- cerebellum suggesting that neurons may sense a deficiency of functional ribosomes and correspondingly activate genes involved in ribosome biogenesis

. Neither Xbp1 splicing nor BiP levels were upregulated in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- cerebellum ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and data not shown ) suggesting eIF2α phosphorylation and ATF4 activation was regulated by a eIF2α kinase other than PERK. The eIF2α kinase GCN2 is activated by amino acid deprivation and other conditions that increase levels of uncharged tRNAs. Amino acid deprivation would be expected to also result in ribosome stalling. Thus we hypothesized that GCN2 is the primary effector of eIF2α phosphorylation in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- brain. To test this, B6J. Gcn2-/- and B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice were crossed to generate B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/-; Gcn2-/- mice and phosphorylation of eIF2α in cerebellar extracts from these mice and B6J. Gcn2-/- mice was examined. Levels of p-eIF2α ( Ser51 ) in the cerebellum from B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/-; Gcn2-/- mice were similar to those observed in the cerebellum of B6J. B6Nn-Tr20 and B6J. Gcn2-/- mice demonstrating that GCN2 is the kinase responsible for the increase in p-eIF2α levels ( Figure 3A ). To determine if loss of Gcn2 also impacts ATF4 activation in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- cerebellum, we first analyzed several known ATF4-target genes that were highly induced in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- cerebellum. RT-qPCR was performed on cerebellar cDNA generated from 3-week-old B6J, B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/-, B6J. Gcn2-/-, and B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/-; Gcn2-/- mice ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ). As expected, we observed significant induction of these genes in B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- relative to levels in the B6J cerebellum. However, in the absence of GCN2, upregulation of these genes was dramatically attenuated suggesting ATF4 activation was also regulated by GCN2 in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- cerebellum. To further define GCN2-dependent changes in gene expression, we performed RNA-Seq analysis from cerebella isolated from 3-week-old B6J, B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/-, B6J. Gcn2-/-, and B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/-; Gcn2-/- mice

., 2015; Sherman and Qian, 2013 ). Pausing of translating ribosomes can be induced by cellular stress including temperature and oxidative stress ( Knight et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2013; Shalgi et al., 2013; Zhong et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, misregulation of elongation may contribute to disease pathology resulting in neurological dysfunction such as observed in Fragile X syndrome ( Chen et al., 2014; Darnell et al., 2011; Udagawa et al., 2013 ). Recently we reported that ribosome stalling is intimately associated with cerebellar and retinal degeneration in the C57BL6/J ( B6J ) -nmf205 mutant mouse ( Ishimura et al., 2014 ). In this mouse model, two mutations are necessary to induce neuron loss: a loss of function mutation ( Gtpbp2nmf205-/- ) in a translational GTPase GTPBP2 ( guanosine triphosphate-binding protein 2 ) and a hypomorphic mutation in the nervous system-specific n-Tr20 ( nTRtct5 ) tRNA ( Ishura et al, 2014 ) leading to ribosome stalling at AG codons in the cerebellum and retinal neurons. In this study, we show that ribosome stalling activates the integrated stress response ( ISR ) pathway in the cerebell and hippocampus of B6-Gbpnm205-/- mice by phosphorylation of eIFα ( Ser51 ) and activation of ATF4, a key transcription factor in the ISR pathway. Genetic experiments demonstrate that GC2, an eIFα kinase, is responsible for this activation in an apparent deacylated tRNA-independent fashion. Furthermore, we found that ISR attenuates neurodegeneration in B6-Gbpnm-205/- mice underscoring the importance of cellular context on the outcome of activation of this pathway. These results demonstrate the interplay between elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during cellular stress.

    Title: A century of trends in adult human height
    Abstract: Being taller is associated with enhanced longevity, and higher education and earnings. We reanalysed 1472 population-based studies, with measurement of height on more than 18. 6 million participants to estimate mean height for people born between 1896 and 1996 in 200 countries. The largest gain in adult height over the past century has occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20. 2 cm ( 95% credible interval 17. 5–22. 7 ) and 16. 5 cm ( 13. 3–19. 7 ) taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South Asia over the century of analysis. The tallest people over these 100 years are men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of 20th century, whose average heights surpassed 182. 5 cm, and the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896 ( 140. 3 cm; 135. 8–144. 8 ). The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was 19-20 cm a century ago, and has remained the same for women and increased for men a century later despite substantial changes in the ranking of countries.

    Supporting Text:
    We estimated that people born in 1896 were shortest in Asia and in Central and Andean Latin America ( Figure 1 and Figure 2 ). The 1896 male birth cohort on average measured only 152. 9 cm ( credible interval 147. 9–157. 9 ) in Laos, which is the same as a well-nourished 12. 5-year boy according to international growth standards ( de Onis et al., 2007 ), followed by Timor-Leste and Guatemala. Women born in the same year in Guatemala were on average 140. 3 cm ( 135. 8–144. 8 ), the same as a well-nourished 10-year girl. El Salvador, Peru, Bangladesh, South Korea and Japan had the next shortest women. The tallest populations a century ago lived in Central and Northern Europe, North America and some Pacific islands. The height of men born in Sweden, Norway and the USA surpassed 171 cm, ~18–19 cm taller than men in Laos. Swedish women, with average adult height of 160. 3 cm ( 158. 2–162. 4 ), were the tallest a century ago and 20 cm taller than women in Guatemala. Women were also taller than 158 cm in Norway, Iceland, the USA and American Samoa. 10. 7554/eLife. 13410. 003Figure 1. Adult height for the 1896 and 1996 birth cohorts for men.

See www. ncdrisc. org for interactive version. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 13410. 004 Changes in adult height over the century of analysis varied drastically across countries. Notably, although the large increases in European men’s heights in the 19th and 20th century have been highlighted, we found that the largest gains since the 1896 birth cohort occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20. 2 cm ( 17. 5–22. 7 ) and 16. 5 cm ( 13. 3–19. 7 ) taller, respectively ( Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 )

. The divergence between estimates and data for earlier birth cohorts is because participants from these birth cohorts were generally older when their heights were measured. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 13410. 010 Men born in 1996 surpass average heights of 181 cm in the Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia, Latvia and Denmark, with Dutch men, at 182. 5 cm ( 180. 6–184. 5 ), the tallest people on the planet. The gap with the shortest countries – Timor-Leste, Yemen and Laos, where men are only ~160 cm tall – is 22–23 cm, an increase of ~4 cm on the global gap in the 1896 birth cohort. Australia was the only non-European country where men born in 1996 were among the 25 tallest in the world. Women born in 1996 are shortest in Guatemala, with an average height of 149. 4 cm ( 148. 0–150. 8 ), and are shorter than 151 cm in the Philippines, Bangladesh and Nepal. The tallest women live in Latvia, the Netherlands, Estonia and Czech Republic, with average height surpassing 168 cm, creating a 20 cm global gap in women’s height ( Figure 5 ). Male and female heights were correlated across countries in 1896 as well as in 1996. Men were taller than women in every country, on average by ~11 cm in the 1896 birth cohort and ~12 cm in the 1996 birth cohort ( Figure 9 ). In the 1896 birth cohort, the male-female height gap in countries where average height was low was slightly larger than in taller nations. In other words, at the turn of the 20th century, men seem to have had a relative advantage over women in undernourished compared to better-nourished populations. A century later, the male-female height gap is about the same throughout the height range. Changes in male and female heights over the century of analysis were also correlated, which is in contrast to low correlation between changes in male and female BMIs as reported elsewhere ( NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, 2016 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 13410. 011Figure 9

. As a result, South Korean women moved from the fifth shortest to the top tertile of tallest women in the world over the course of a century. Men in South Korea also had large gains relative to other countries, by 15. 2 cm ( 12. 3–18. 1 ). There were also large gains in height in Japan, Greenland, some countries in Southern Europe ( e. g., Greece ) and Central Europe ( e. g., Serbia and Poland, and for women Czech Republic ). In contrast, there was little gain in height in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. 10. 7554/eLife. 13410. 005Figure 3.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 13410. 007 The pace of growth in height has not been uniform over the past century. The impressive rise in height in Japan stopped in people born after the early 1960s ( Figure 6 )

We found that over the past century adult height has changed substantially and unevenly in the world’s countries, with no indication of convergence across countries. The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was ~19 cm for men and ~20 cm for women a century ago, and has remained about the same for women and increased for men a century later despite substantial changes in the ranking of countries in terms of adult height. Data from military conscripts and personnel have allowed reconstructing long-term trends in height in some European countries and the USA, albeit largely for men, and treating it as a'mirror' to social and environmental conditions that affect nutrition, health and economic prosperity, in each generation and across generations ( Tanner, 1987; Fogel, 2004; Komlos, 2009; Martins et al., 2014; Martorell, 1995 ). Our results on the large gains in continental European countries, e. g., Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands, are consistent with previous studies ( Komlos,2009 ; Fogel, 2004 ). However, we found that the largest gains in height since the 189 cohort occurred in South Korean and Iranian men who became 20. 2 ( 17.5–22.7 ) and 16. 5 ( 13.3–19.7 ) taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in height in some sub-Saharan countries and South Asia over the century of analysis. The tallest people over 100 years were born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of 20 century, whose average height surpassed 182. 5, and shortest were born in Guatemala in 189 140. 3 ( 135.8–144.8 ). The height differential between the tallest and shortest was 19–20 a ago and has remained the same for women and increased for men a century later despite changes in the ranking of countries.

    Title: Opioids depress breathing through two small brainstem sites
    Abstract: The rates of opioid overdose in the United States quadrupled between 1999 and 2017, reaching a staggering 130 deaths per day. This health epidemic demands innovative solutions that require uncovering the key brain areas and cell types mediating the cause of overdose— opioid-induced respiratory depression. Here, we identify two primary changes to murine breathing after administering opioids. These changes implicate the brainstem’s breathing circuitry which we confirm by locally eliminating the µ-Opioid receptor. We find the critical brain site is the preBötzinger Complex, where the breathing rhythm originates, and use genetic tools to reveal that just 70–140 neurons in this region are responsible for its sensitivity to opioids. Future characterization of these neurons may lead to novel therapies that prevent respiratory depression while sparing analgesia.

    Supporting Text:
    Nearly 400, 000 people in the United States died from a drug overdose involving a prescription or illicit opioid between 1999 and 2017 ( Scholl et al., 2018 ). This epidemic is not unique to the United States and with the increasing distribution of highly potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl, it has become a global public health emergency ( Rudd et al., 2016 ). Death from opioid overdose results from slow and shallow breathing, also known as opioid induced respiratory depression ( OIRD, Pattinson, 2008 ). Like humans, breathing in mice is severely depressed by opioids and this response is eliminated when the µ-Opioid receptor ( Oprm1 ) is globally deleted ( Dahan et al., 2001 ). Oprm1 is broadly expressed, in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, including sites that could modulate breathing such as: the cerebral cortex, brainstem respiratory control centers, primary motor neurons, solitary nucleus, and oxygen sensing afferents ( Mansour et al., 1994; Kirby and McQueen, 1986 ). Therefore, either one or multiple sites could be mediating the depressive effects of opioids on breathing. Indeed, multiple brain regions have been shown to independently slow breathing after local injection of opioid agonists ( Kirby and McQueen, 1986; Montandon et al., 2011; Mustapic et al., 2010; Prkic et al., 2012 ). Although informative, doubts remain for which of these sites are necessary and sufficient to induce OIRD from systemic opioids for three reasons. First, injection of opioid agonists or antagonists into candidate areas modulates µ-opioid receptors on the cell body ( post-synaptic ) as well as receptors on incoming terminals ( pre-synaptic ). Second, these studies necessitate anesthetized and reduced animal preparations, which alter brain activity in many of the candidate Oprm1 expressing sites

. Our studies were limited to two opioids ( morphine and fentanyl ) at a specific dose and it will be important in future work to determine if these two brain sites are also critical for OIRD caused by these opioids at different doses or other opioids altogether. The two hallmark changes during OIRD, decreased inspiratory airflow and delayed initiation, perfectly match the opioid induced depression of amplitude and frequency in the preBötC slice. We show that ~140 Oprm1 glutamatergic preBötC neurons mediate this effect. And surprisingly, half this number, just ~70 glutamatergic neurons are sufficient to rescue opioid depression of the preBötC rhythm ( 50 Dbx1/FOXP2 and 20 FOXP2 in Foxp2-Cre;Oprm1f/f, Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ). Further, given the importance of Dbx1 neurons in respiratory rhythm generation ( Gray et al., 2010; Bouvier et al., 2010 ), rescuing Oprm1 in just ~50/140 Dbx1 neurons ( the Foxp2+ subset ) may be sufficient to prevent preBötC depression, the smallest number of neurons we propose. This small number is remarkably consistent with the number of Dbx1 neurons that must be lesioned to arrest preBötC activity ( Wang et al., 2014 ). Given the similarity of these effects, we hypothesize that opioids are primarily acting by silencing presynaptic release, effectively removing these neurons from the network. Alternatively, it is proposed that just a small subset of preBötC excitatory neurons may generate the inspiratory rhythm ( Phillips et al., 2019 ) and perhaps these key Oprm1 neurons are enriched within this subgroup. In this instance, since hyperpolarization of preBötC rhythmogenic neurons slows and silences breathing ( Koizumi et al., 2016 ), opioids may act postsynaptically as proposed by others ( Montandon et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 1996 )

. And third, there is not a standard and quantitative definition for how breathing changes in OIRD, and this makes comparing studies that use different breathing metrics measured in different experimental paradigms challenging. To address these limitations, we conducted a detailed quantitative analysis of OIRD in awake animals and identify two key changes to the breath that drive the depressive effects of opioids. These two metrics thereafter define OIRD in our study and can serve as a rubric for others. We then locally eliminate the µ-opioid receptor in awake mice, disambiguating pre and post-synaptic effects, and use these metrics to define two key brain sites that mediate OIRD. Recently, a similar approach demonstrated some role for these sites in OIRD ( Varga et al., 2020 ). Among these two sites in our study, we find that one is dominant and driven by just 140 critical neurons in vitro and, importantly, these neurons are not required for opioid-induced analgesia, suggesting a neutral target for developing safer opioids or rescue strategies for opioid overdose.

. This alone is interesting, as it suggests that modulation of only a small subset of neurons with the preBötC is enough to significantly impact its ability to generate a rhythm. We also determined that within the preBötC, Oprm1 ( mRNA ) was expressed by glycinergic ( Slc6a5 expressing ), gabaergic ( Gad2/Slc32a1 expressing ), and glutamatergic ( Slc17a6 expressing ) neural types alike ( Figure 4C ) and therefore Oprm1 ( mRNA ) expression is not exclusive to any known rhythmogenic preBötC subpopulation. Slices containing the preBötC autonomously generate respiratory-like rhythmic activity in vitro which is depressed in both rate and amplitude by bath administration of opioid agonists ( Gray et al., 1999; Lorier et al., 2010 ), similar to opioid effects we observed on breathing in vivo. To determine which neural class mediates the depression of preBötC activity, we measured rhythmic bursting activity in vitro ( Figure 4D ) after selectively genetically deleting Oprm1 from each neural class. We achieved this deletion by crossing Oprm1f/f mice with each of the following: Slc17a6-Cre, Slc32a1-Cre, Gad2-Cre, or Slc6a5-Cre transgenic animals. preBötC slices from control mice ( Oprm1f/f, Oprm1f/+, or Oprm1+/+ ) burst every 5–10 s and this activity was eliminated in 100% of slices by bath application of the selective µ-Opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala2, NMe-Phe4, Gly-ol5]-enkephalin ( DAMGO, 50 nM ), and subsequently rescued by opioid antagonist naloxone ( Figure 4E, F ). Strikingly, the bursting rhythm of Slc17a6-Cre;Oprm1f/f slices was not slowed by DAMGO, whereas the rhythm in Gad2-, Slc32a1-, and Slc6a5-Cre; Oprm1f/f slices was entirely eliminated, akin to wild type controls ( Figure 4E, F, Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ). This demonstrates that glutamatergic excitatory neurons, representing ~50% of all preBötC Oprm1-expressing neurons and therefore 4% of preBötC neurons, mediate OIRD in vitro

., 2013; Cui et al., 2016 ). Indeed, the preBötC has been proposed to play a key role in OIRD since localized injection of opioids results in respiratory depression and localized naloxone reverses decreased breathing after administration of systemic opioids ( Montandon et al., 2011; Montandon and Horner, 2014 ). However, such experiments fail to distinguish between the action of opioids on presynaptic terminals ( Mudge et al., 1979 ) of distant neurons projecting into the preBötC versus direct action on preBötC neurons themselves ( Figure 2A; Montandon et al., 2011; Dobbins and Feldman, 1994; Gray et al., 1999 ) To overcome this, we genetically eliminated the µ-Opioid receptor ( Oprm1 ) from preBötC cells exclusively, sparing projecting inputs, by stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated virus constitutively expressing Cre (AAV-Cre Oprm1f ) into the preBöt of Opr1f mice. This resulted in no change in breathing in response to opioids, indicating that Opr1 in preöt neurons is not necessary for OIRD. However, this does not rule out the possibility that Oprm in preBöt is sufficient to mediate OIRD. To determine this, we crossed Opr1f mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the Db1 promoter ( Db1-Cre Opr1f ) to selectively delete Opr1 in Db1 neurons. This resulted in no change in breathing in response to opioids, indicating that Opr1 in Db1 neurons is not necessary for OIRD. However, this does not rule out the possibility that Opr in Db1 is sufficient to mediate OIRD. To determine this, we crossed Opr1 mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the Db1 promoter ( Db-C Opr1f ) to selectively delete Opr in Db1. This resulted in no change in breathing in response to opioids, indicating that Opr in Db neurons is not necessary for OIRD. However, this does not rule out the possibility that Opr in Db is sufficient to mediate OIRD To determine this, we crossed Opr1 mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of Db promoter ( Db-C Opr1 ) to selectively delete in Db. This resulted in no change in breathing response to opioids, indicating that in Db is not necessary for OIRD However, this does not rule out the possibility that Db is sufficient to mediate O To determine this, we crossed mice with expressing Cre under control of Db ( Db-C Opr ) to selectively delete Db This resulted in no change in response to opioids indicating that Db is not necessary for O However this does not rule the possibility that is sufficient mediate O To determine we crossed with expressing under Db ( Db-C Opr to selectively delete Db This in resulted no change to indicating that is not necessary O However does not rule possibility that sufficient mediate O determine we crossed with expressing under Db ( Db Opr to delete selectively This in resulted no change indicating that not necessary O does rule possibility mediate O determine we crossed with expressing under ( Db Opr to delete selectively in This resulted no change indicating not necessary O rule mediate O determine we with expressing under ( Db Opr to delete selectively in resulted no change indicating not necessary mediate O

    Title: Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide is a functional receptor for human hepatitis B and D virus
    Abstract: Human hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection and HBV-related diseases remain a major public health problem. Individuals coinfected with its satellite hepatitis D virus ( HDV ) have more severe disease. Cellular entry of both viruses is mediated by HBV envelope proteins. The pre-S1 domain of the large envelope protein is a key determinant for receptor ( s ) binding. However, the identity of the receptor ( s ) is unknown. Here, by using near zero distance photo-cross-linking and tandem affinity purification, we revealed that the receptor-binding region of pre-S1 specifically interacts with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide ( NTCP ), a multiple transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver. Silencing NTCP inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NTCP expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to these viral infections. Moreover, replacing amino acids 157–165 of nonfunctional monkey NTCP with the human counterpart conferred its ability in supporting both viral infections. Our results demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV.

   ., 2009 ). Although a number of HBV receptor candidates have been reported in the past, none has been confirmed to be functional in supporting viral infection ( Glebe and Urban, 2007 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 00049. 003Figure 1.

Right: peptides at indicated concentrations were added to PTHs before HBV inoculation. The cell culture medium was replenished every 2 days

. This may at least partially explain the observations that primary hepatocytes typically remain susceptible to HBV infections in vitro for only a few days after isolation from liver tissues ( Gripon et al., 1988; Seeger et al., 2007 ). NTCP is functionally conserved in mammalians, but protein sequences of NTCP vary among species, which is likely to contribute to the narrow species tropism of viral infection. Strikingly, despite the high level of protein sequence homology between human and monkey NTCP, the later did not support HBV and HDV infection. Replacing a small motif of aa 157–165 of mkNTCP with the corresponding hNTCP residues converted mkNTCP to a receptor for pre-S1 binding as well as HDV and HBV infection. Further studies are warranted to determine if and how NTCP contributes to the species specificity of HDV and HBV infection in other species. It also remains to be determined if other molecule ( s ) additional to NTCP contributes to the cellular entry of HBV and/or HDV as a coreceptor ( s ) or receptor component ( s ), and if other host factors such as the microenvironment or architecture of hepatocytes in liver, or soluble blood components like those that have been shown to involve in infections of other viruses ( Shayakhmetov et al., 2005; Morizono et al., 2011 ), contribute to HBV and/or HDV infection. Expression and subcellular distribution of NTCP are precisely regulated under physiological conditions. NTCP accounts for most, if not all, hepatic Na+-dependent bile acid transport ( Stieger, 2011 ). NTCP expression is low and inversely correlated with the degree of dedifferentiation of cancer cells in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( Kullak-Ublick et al., 1997; Zollner et al., 2005 ) and the severity of HBV-related liver cirrhosis ( Lee and Kim, 2007 ). The newly discovered role of NTCP as an entry receptor for HBV and HDV raises interesting questions regarding its involvement in viral pathogenesis

In this study, by employing a unique approach of tandem affinity purification combined with MS analysis against a Tupaia hepatocyte proteome database established by deep sequencing, we revealed that the liver bile acid transporter, NTCP, specifically interacts with a key region in the pre-S1 domain of the HBV envelope L protein. By performing a series of virological analyses, we showed that silencing NTCP expression markedly inhibited viral infection of HBV and HDV in Tupaia as well as human hepatocytes. Exogenous expression of NTCP rendered nonsusceptible human hepatoma cells susceptible to the viral infections. The authentic viral infections in cells complemented with NTCP were shown by the kinetic analyses of several markers of viral infections, in particular the quantification of newly synthesized viral replicative intermediates. Moreover, the NTCP-rendered infections were blocked by known entry inhibitors. NTCP residues 157 to 165 were identified to be critical for pre-S1 binding and viral infections. These data clearly demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for both HBV and HDV. Identification of cellular receptor ( s ) of HBV and HDV has been challenging. In our study, we utilized a short peptide ligand, WTb, which was originated from the known receptor-binding domain of the L protein ( Barrera et al., 2005; Glebe et al., 2005; Gripon et al., 2005; Engelke et al., 2006; Schulze et al., 2010 ), but with specially designed properties suitable for photo-cross-linking and tandem purification. Two photo-leucines were incorporated into the critical receptor-binding region of WTb without interfering with its receptor-binding activity, which allowed highly specific zero distance cross-linking of its direct binding partner ( s ) but not other neighboring molecules. A biotin moiety of WTb facilitated purification of the complex of WTb and its binding partner ( s ) by streptavidin beads

    Title: Sepsis leads to lasting changes in phenotype and function of memory CD8 T cells
    Abstract: The global health burden due to sepsis and the associated cytokine storm is substantial. While early intervention has improved survival during the cytokine storm, those that survive can enter a state of chronic immunoparalysis defined by transient lymphopenia and functional deficits of surviving cells. Memory CD8 T cells provide rapid cytolysis and cytokine production following re-encounter with their cognate antigen to promote long-term immunity, and CD8 T cell impairment due to sepsis can pre-dispose individuals to re-infection. While the acute influence of sepsis on memory CD8 T cells has been characterized, if and to what extent pre-existing memory CD8 T cells recover remains unknown. Here, we observed that central memory CD8 T cells ( TCM ) from septic patients proliferate more than those from healthy individuals. Utilizing LCMV immune mice and a CLP model to induce sepsis, we demonstrated that TCM proliferation is associated with numerical recovery of pathogen-specific memory CD8 T cells following sepsis-induced lymphopenia. This increased proliferation leads to changes in composition of memory CD8 T cell compartment and altered tissue localization. Further, memory CD8 T cells from sepsis survivors have an altered transcriptional profile and chromatin accessibility indicating long-lasting T cell intrinsic changes. The sepsis-induced changes in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell pool and transcriptional landscape culminated in altered T cell function and reduced capacity to control L. monocytogenes infection. Thus, sepsis leads to long-term alterations in memory CD8 T cell phenotype, protective function and localization potentially changing host capacity to respond to re-infection.

    In the present study, we demonstrate that sepsis leads to a lasting change in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell compartment in the sepsis survivors. This occurs as a result of proliferation in the lymphopenic environment that occurs after sepsis, seen in both patients and mice, wherein TCM have higher proliferative capacity than TEM. This biasing toward TCM alters the localization of memory CD8 T cells. Further, the memory CD8 T cell pool has an altered transcriptional landscape and chromatin accessibility, which is associated both with the transition toward TCM and functional alterations. The culmination of these sepsis-induced changes alters the function of the memory CD8 T cells and reduces their capacity to control virulent L. m. infection. There are several important implications of the present study, and the biasing toward TCM, that are relevant to our understanding of the immunoparalysis state. Among these is the relationship to tissue resident memory CD8 T cells ( TRM ), which provide sensing and alarm function at sites of prior infection ( Masopust et al., 2001; Schenkel et al., 2013 ). The present study focuses on the influence of sepsis on circulating TEM and TCM CD8 T cells; however, the substantial population of TRM throughout the body may be an interesting source of future interrogation. Danahy et al. previously demonstrated that TRM were not susceptible to sepsis-induced lymphopenia, due to their exclusion from the vasculature ( Danahy et al., 2017 ). In the present study, recovery in cellularity was observed with time after sepsis, but the biasing toward TCM may pose a particular problem for TRM. Specifically, Slütter et al. demonstrated that lung TRM are seeded from circulating TEM ( Slütter et al., 2017 ). Thus, the challenge to the TRM may be twofold: ( 1 ) the reduced seeding of cells during the lymphopenic state and ( 2 ) reduced TEM pool from which to seed the TRM

The sepsis-induced immunoparalysis state poses a substantial threat to the health and long-term survival of septic patients ( Delano and Ward, 2016a; Delano and Ward, 2016b; Dombrovskiy et al., 2007; Donnelly et al., 2015 ). A major contributing factor to sepsis-induced immunoparalysis is the intrinsic and numerical deficits imposed on naive and memory CD8 T cells ( Jensen et al., 2018a ). In particular, deficits in existing memory CD8 T cells can enhance host susceptibility to pathogens against which the host was previously immune or vaccinated. To understand how CD8 T cells respond to septic insult and the lymphopenic state, septic patients were recruited within 24 hr of admission and the frequency and number of CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood were compared to that of healthy controls. Patient cohorts did not exhibit substantial demographic differences though septic patients were severely ill, as defined by APACHE II and SOFA scores ( Table 1 ). While there was not a difference in the frequency of CD8 T cells among lymphocytes between septic patients and healthy controls ( Figure 1a and b ), there was a cohort of septic patients with a substantially reduced number of CD8 T cells per mL of blood ( Figure 1c ) reflecting the sepsis-induced lymphopenia. It is relevant to consider that admission time may not correspond to the onset of sepsis such that admitted patients may have not yet experienced or already recovered from sepsis-associated lymphopenia. Thus, numeric variability in samples may reflect a broad range of insult and recovery within the 24 hr of admission. Notably, robust induction of Ki67 expression, a marker of recent proliferation, by CD8 T cells ( Figure 1a and d ) was observed, regardless of degree of lymphopenia

., 2017 ) or altered monocyte/ macrophage activity ( Jensen et al., 2021a; Roquilly et al., 2020 ), can influence CD8 T cell capacity to migrate into sites of infection. Even when T cells are spared from the cytokine storm by vascular exclusion ( i. e. tissue residence ) CD8 T cell-mediated protection can be hampered by inability of other cells ( e. g. endothelia ) to respond to the inflammatory cues provided by CD8 T cells ( Danahy et al., 2017 ). Yet, these impairments are largely characterized proximal to the septic insult. However, sepsis-induced impairments are long-lasting and may not be consistent across time ( Jensen et al., 2018a ). Specifically, the lymphopenic environment is transient yet the ability to control cancer can remain reduced long after numeric recovery is complete ( Danahy et al., 2019 ). Thus, while there does not appear to be preferential susceptibility to sepsis, if and how different subsets of memory CD8 T cells recover may dramatically shape how hosts respond to pathogen re-encounter and thereby contribute to the immunoparalysis state. Here, using samples from septic patients and well described experimental models we demonstrate increased proliferation of CD8 T cells ( particularly central memory cells [TCM] ) in septic patients and mice after cecal ligation and puncture ( CLP ) -induced sepsis, relative to non-septic controls. As a consequence of this increased proliferation, there is a remodeling of the memory CD8 T cell pool. This compositional change in turn leads to lasting changes in the localization, function, and protective capacity of pre-existing memory CD8 T cells.

. Further depth of interrogation is achieved with memory P14 CD8 T cells, relative to the bulk antigen-experienced CD8 T cell population, given that memory P14 CD8 T cells are not specific for antigens evoked/released during the septic event, and the influence of sepsis on this discrete pre-existing memory CD8 T cell population delineates from potential ‘secondary’ antigen encounter and from potential and anticipated novel Ag-specific CD8 T cell responses to the septic event. Following septic insult, the lymphopenic state impacted naïve and Ag-exp cells to the same degree ( Figure 2c ), as has been previously reported ( Condotta et al., 2013; Duong et al., 2014; Jensen et al., 2018a ). Importantly, the memory P14 CD8 T cells were similarly susceptible to sepsis-induced lymphopenia as the endogenous Ag-exp cells ( Figure 2c ). Additionally, there was induction of Ki67 expression by memory P14 CD8 T cells after sepsis ( Figure 2d and e ), demonstrating that the P14 CD8 T cells can be used to model the influence of sepsis on pre-existing memory CD8 T cells. When the number of memory P14 CD8 T cells per mL of blood was quantified, we observed numeric loss and recovery of P14 CD8 T cells in CLP hosts ( Figure 2f ), similar to prior reports of homeostatic proliferation following sepsis-induced lymphopenia ( Unsinger et al., 2009 ). Thus, pre-existing memory CD8 T cells numerically recover with time after sepsis, potentially due to increased proliferation in response to the sepsis-induced lymphopenic environment. To address how this numeric recovery may alter the composition of the memory T cell compartment phenotypic characterization of splenic memory P14 CD8 T cells from Sham and CLP mice was performed >30 days post-surgery ( Figure 3a ). Additionally, Flow cytometric analysis of splenic memory14 CD8 cells from CLP mice revealed increased proportion of TCM ( Figure 3b ) and reduced TEM ( Figure 3 ) compared to Sham mice. This bias toward TCM was also observed in memory CD8 cells from septic patients ( Figure 4 ). This compositional change in the memory CD8 cell pool was associated with alterations in the transcriptional profile of CD8 cells ( Figure 5 ) and chromatin accessibility ( Figure 6 ) indicating lasting intrinsic changes to CD8 cells following seps-induced lymphopenia. The transcriptional and chromatin changes were associated with the transition toward TCM ( Figure 5 and 6 ) and functional alterations in CD8 cells ( Figure 7 and 8 ). The seps-induced changes in the composition of the memory CD8 cell pool and transcriptional landscape culminated in reduced capacity of CD8 cells to control virulent L monocytogen infection ( Figure 9 and 10 ). Thus seps leads to long-lasting alterations in memory CD8 cell phenotype, protective function, and localization, potentially changing host capacity to respond to re-infection

The study demonstrates that seps leads to lasting changes in the composition of the memory CD8 cell compartment in seps survivors. This occurs as a result of proliferation in the lymphic environment that occurs after seps, seen in both patients and mice, TCM have higher proliferative capacity than TEM. This bias toward T alters localization of memory CD cells. Further the memory8 cell has altered transcriptional landscape and chromatin, associated with transition toward TCM and functional. The culmination of seps-induced changes the function of memory8 cells and reduces capacity to control virulent L. infection. The study has several implications for understanding immunopar state, including relationship to tissue memory CD8 cells which provide sensing and function at sites of prior infection ( Masust et al. 2001 ; Schkel et al 2013 ) The study focuses on influence seps on TEM and TCM8 cells, substantial population TR throughout body may be interesting future interrogation.

    Title: APOBEC3A deaminates transiently exposed single-strand DNA during LINE-1 retrotransposition
    Abstract: Long INterspersed Element-1 ( LINE-1 or L1 ) retrotransposition poses a mutagenic threat to human genomes. Human cells have therefore evolved strategies to regulate L1 retrotransposition. The APOBEC3 ( A3 ) gene family consists of seven enzymes that catalyze deamination of cytidine nucleotides to uridine nucleotides ( C-to-U ) in single-strand DNA substrates. Among these enzymes, APOBEC3A ( A3A ) is the most potent inhibitor of L1 retrotransposition in cultured cell assays. However, previous characterization of L1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of A3A did not yield evidence of deamination. Thus, the molecular mechanism by which A3A inhibits L1 retrotransposition has remained enigmatic. Here, we have used in vitro and in vivo assays to demonstrate that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration. These data provide a mechanistic explanation of how the A3A cytidine deaminase protein can inhibit L1 retrotransposition.

The DNA lesion resulting from cleavage of this region could then be repaired using the top-strand genomic DNA as a template, leaving no detectable evidence of thwarted L1 retrotransposition events. 10. 7554/eLife. 02008. 016Figure 4. A model for A3A-mediated inhibition of L1 retrotransposition. The left side of the Figure shows L1 integration reactions that occur via TPRT. The right side of the Figure shows the predicted structures of the resultant L1 retrotransposition events. Shown are transiently exposed single-strand genomic DNA regions that ultimately give rise to target site duplications ( TSDs: orange lines ), the L1 RNA ( red line ), the L1 cDNA ( blue line ), and the A3A protein ( green oval ). UGI expression ( red stop sign ) can inhibit UNG activity. ( A ) Deamination of the L1 cDNA: in the presence of cellular RNase H, A3A-mediated deamination of the L1 ( − ) strand cDNA ( blue lettering ) in the presence of UGI leads to C-to-T mutations on the L1 non-coding strand and G-to-A mutations on the L1 ( + ) coding strand. ( B ) Deamination of the 5′ flanking top-strand genomic DNA: in the presence of UGI, deamination of the transiently exposed single-strand 5′ flanking genomic DNA ( top orange line ) during TPRT results in C-to-T changes in the 5′ TSD relative to the 3′ TSD. ( C ) Deamination of the 3′ flanking bottom-strand genomic DNA: in the presence of UGI, deamination of transiently exposed single-strand 3′ flanking genomic DNA during TPRT, in principle, is predicted to result in a G-to-A change in the 3′ TSD relative to the 5′ TSD. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02008. 016 The over-expression of A3A does not abolish L1 retrotransposition completely, but reduces it to ∼30% of control levels. Moreover, some L1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of A3A and UGI lacked evidence of deamination

., 2011; Hancks and Kazazian, 2012 ). Given the mutagenic potential of active L1s, it is not surprising that host cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to restrict L1 retrotransposition ( Levin and Moran, 2011 ). Previous studies revealed that over-expression of the wild-type ( WT ) APOBEC3A cytidine deaminase protein ( A3A ), but not deaminase-defective A3A mutants, could potently inhibit L1 retrotransposition in cultured human cells ( Chen et al., 2006; Muckenfuss et al., 2006; Bogerd et al., 2006b; Kinomoto et al., 2007; Niewiadomska et al., 2007 ). However, deamination events were not detected in L1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of WT A3A ( Chen et al., 2006; Muckenfuss et al., 2006; Bogerd et al., 2006b; Kinomoto et al., 2007 ). Thus, the molecular mechanism by which WT A3A inhibits L1 retrotransposition has remained a mystery. Here, we employ an in vitro assay ( L1 Element Amplification Protocol or LEAP ) that recapitulates the first strand cDNA synthesis step of the L1 integration to elucidate a mechanism for A3A-mediated inhibition of L1 retrotransposition. In LEAP reactions that include RNase H, an enzyme that specifically degrades the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA heteroduplex, we report that single-strand L1 cDNAs are rendered susceptible to A3A-mediated deamination. These data suggest that newly synthesized L1 cDNAs remain annealed to their mRNA templates after reverse transcription, protecting the L1 cDNA from deamination by A3A. We further demonstrate that engineered L1 retrotransposition events derived from cultured human cells that co-express A3A and the uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein ( UGI ) contain strand-specific, A3A-mediated C-to-U deamination events. Together, these data indicate that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration

We propose a straightforward model for how A3A inhibits L1 retrotransposition ( Figure 4 ). In the presence of cellular RNase H, the ( − ) strand L1 cDNA becomes vulnerable to A3A deamination ( Figure 4A ). Normally, these events would be repaired by combined actions of UNG and APE, which we speculate could lead to the integration of a 5′ truncated L1 cDNA that lacks evidence of deamination. However, in the presence of ectopically expressed UGI, A3A-mediated deamination events become unveiled in the retrotransposed L1s ( Figure 3D, F, 4A ). We further propose that A3A can act on transiently exposed single-strand genomic DNA flanking L1 integration sites ( Figure 4B, C ). The deamination of 5′-flanking top-strand genomic DNA could account for generation of inexact target-site duplications ( Figure 3D ). Interestingly, the structure of the proposed L1 integration intermediate resembles R-loop intermediates, formed during immunoglobulin class switching, that are targeted by an A3A related enzyme, activation-induced cytidine deaminase ( AID ) ( Goodman et al., 2007 ). The deamination of 3′ flanking bottom-strand genomic DNA, in principle, could also lead to the generation of inexact TSDs ( Figure 4C ). While we did not observe these events in cultured cells, we did observe deamination events in the single-strand DNA oligonucleotide primer used to simulate 3′ flanking genomic DNA in LEAP assays ( Figure 2D ). It is intriguing to speculate that, in the absence of UGI, A3A-mediated editing within 3′ flanking bottom-strand genomic DNA could ultimately lead to loss of the L1 cDNA. Indeed, the ERCC1/XPF endonuclease has been implicated in limiting L1 retrotransposition by cleaving the transiently exposed single-strand 3’ flanking bottom-strand genomic DNA during TPRT ( Gasior et al., 2008 )

. 2% of 5′-TCA-3′ substrates within 100 L1 cDNAs contained signatures of deamination ( Figure 2D, Figure 2—figure supplement 2, bottom chart in the left panel ). The slightly increased number of deamination events observed with RNase H alone may reflect endogenous cytidine deaminase activity present in HeLa RNP preparations. APOBEC3B ( A3B ) might be responsible for these events as it is expressed in HeLa cells and can suppress L1 retrotransposition ( Chen et al., 2006; Bogerd et al., 2006b; Wissing et al., 2011 ). These results suggest that the L1 cDNA, when annealed to the L1 mRNA in an mRNA/cDNA heteroduplex, is protected from mutation by cellular deaminases. Our results demonstrated that rA3A could deaminate single-strand L1 cDNAs in vitro. We therefore hypothesized that A3A may deaminate transiently exposed single-strand DNA intermediates that arise during L1 TPRT in cultured cells. Uridine residues are efficiently removed from DNA through combined actions of uracil DNA glycosylase ( UNG ) and apurinic endonuclease ( APE ). However, in the presence of ectopically expressed U, A3-mediated deamination events become evident in retroposed Ls ( Figure 3D, F, 4 ). We propose that A3 can act on transiently exposed-strand genomic DNA flanking L integration sites ( Figure 4, B, C ). The deamination of 5 flanking-str genomic DNA could account for generation of inexact-site duplications ( Figure 3 ). The structure of proposed L integration resembles R-loop intermediates formed during immunoglobulin class switching that are targeted by A3 related cytidine deaminase (ID Goodman et al,2007 ). deamination of 3 flanking-str genomic, in principle, could lead to generation inexact TSDs ( 4 ) While we did not observe these in cultured cells, did observe deamination in single-str oligonucleotide used simulate 3 fl genomic in LEAP ( 2 ) It is intriguing that in absence U A3-mediated within 3 fl-str genomic could lead to loss L cDNA Indeed ER1/X endonuc has implicated in limiting L by cleaving transient exposed-str 3 fl genomic during TP ( Gasior et al2008 )

    Title: Rem2 stabilizes intrinsic excitability and spontaneous firing in visual circuits
    Abstract: Sensory experience plays an important role in shaping neural circuitry by affecting the synaptic connectivity and intrinsic properties of individual neurons. Identifying the molecular players responsible for converting external stimuli into altered neuronal output remains a crucial step in understanding experience-dependent plasticity and circuit function. Here, we investigate the role of the activity-regulated, non-canonical Ras-like GTPase Rem2 in visual circuit plasticity. We demonstrate that Rem2-/- mice fail to exhibit normal ocular dominance plasticity during the critical period. At the cellular level, our data establish a cell-autonomous role for Rem2 in regulating intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, prior to changes in synaptic function. Consistent with these findings, both in vitro and in vivo recordings reveal increased spontaneous firing rates in the absence of Rem2. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Rem2 is a key molecule that regulates neuronal excitability and circuit function in the context of changing sensory experience.

   ., 2014 ). Interestingly, this model posits the existence of a key regulator or ‘sensor’ molecule whose main function is to assess cell-wide activity levels, indicated by changes in Ca2+ influx, and implement downstream signaling mechanisms that alter intrinsic excitability ( Liu et al., 1998; O'Leary et al., 2014; Siegel et al., 1994 ). However, the identity of such sensor molecules and signaling pathways remains largely unknown. The activity-regulated Ras-like GTPase Rem2 is an excellent candidate to link the activity of a neural circuit with functional plasticity. Rem2 is a member of the Rad/Rem/Rem2/Gem/Kir ( RGK ) protein family, a Ras-related subfamily of small GTPases ( Finlin et al., 2000 ), whose expression and function are regulated by neuronal activity in response to calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels ( Ghiretti et al., 2014 ). Further, gene knockdown approaches in cultured cortical neurons and Xenopus laevis optic tectum established that Rem2 is a positive regulator of synapse formation and a negative regulator of dendritic complexity ( Ghiretti et al., 2013; Ghiretti et al., 2014; Ghiretti and Paradis, 2011; Moore et al., 2013 ), suggesting Rem2 may regulate structural plasticity in an activity-dependent manner. Because Rem2 expression and signaling is sensitive to neuronal activity levels ( Ghiretti et al., 2013; Ghiretti et al., 2014 ), and Rem2 signaling regulates changes in gene expression ( Kenny et al., 2017 ), we hypothesized that Rem2 could be a key regulator of cortical plasticity mechanisms in the intact nervous system. To test this hypothesis, we generated Rem2 knockout mice to directly assess how Rem2 influences cortical plasticity in the mammalian visual system. We found that Rem2-/- mice exhibit a deficit in late-phase OD plasticity during the critical period, whereas early-phase OD plasticity and adult OD plasticity are normal

. In contrast, Rem2-/- mice display both impaired synaptic scaling up ( Figure 5 ) and altered intrinsic excitability ( Figure 7 ), as well as a generalized increase of individual eye responses with 6d MD ( Figure 3C ). These latter results are similar to those observed following binocular deprivation, which leads to increased cortical responsiveness to both eyes ( Mrsic-Flogel et al., 2007 ). While it may seem counterintuitive to observe impaired synaptic scaling and increased intrinsic excitability as we do in the cortex of Rem2-/- mice, it is apparently this combination of cellular phenotypes that lead to the observed increase in spontaneous firing rates observed in vivo. Thus, while it remains to be determined exactly how these two processes function synergistically to maintain proper circuit function, our discovery of the role of Rem2 in this process provides novel insight into the importance of neuronal regulation of intrinsic excitability to sculpting network output. While a number of molecules have been implicated in regulation of synaptic scaling ( Arc ( Gao et al., 2010; Shepherd et al., 2006 ), BDNF ( Kaneko et al., 2008a; Rutherford et al., 1998 ), Homer1a ( Hu et al., 2010; Nedivi, 1999 ), MHCI ( Goddard et al., 2007; Syken et al., 2006 ), and NARP ( Chang et al., 2010; Gu et al., 2013 ), a comparable understanding of the regulation of neuronal intrinsic excitability is lacking. Rem2 is a noncanonical Ras-like GTPase, expressed throughout the cell ( Ghiretti and Paradis, 2011 ) and is unlikely to be regulated by its nucleotide binding state ( Correll et al., 2008 ) in contrast to canonical Ras family members. The mechanism by which Rem2 transduces signals is an open area of investigation, although it has been shown to associate with VGCC subunits ( Chen et al., 2005; Finlin et al., 2006; Finlin et al., 2005; Pang et al., 2010 ) and CaMKII ( Flynn et al., 2012; Royer et al., 2017 )

. These functional deficits depend specifically on deletion of Rem2 from excitatory neurons in the cortex. At the cellular level, we found that Rem2-/- neurons exhibit altered regulation of synaptic function and increased intrinsic excitability. Further, using sparse deletion methods, we found that the effects on intrinsic excitability are cell-autonomous, and precede the effects on synaptic regulation. Consistent with the observed increase in intrinsic excitability, we demonstrated that Rem2 also induces changes in spontaneous firing rates both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, thesedatasuggestthatRem2 providesanewunderstanding ofthemolecular processesthatcoordinate changes inintrinsicexcitability, spontaneous firing rates, synapse regulation, and ultimately circuit function.

. Interestingly, these processes rely heavily on physiological and morphological plasticity at the level of individual neurons ( El-Gaby et al., 2015; Lüscher and Malenka, 2011; Martin et al., 2000; Yager et al., 2015 ). Therefore, it is likely that Rem2 acts in other brain regions and throughout the life of the animal, based on transcriptional profiling experiments performed in adult animals ( Liput et al., 2016; Mardinly et al., 2016 ). Our data indicate that Rem2 functions at the nexus of a signaling network that senses and responds to changes in neuronal activity in order to preserve proper circuit function in the face of changing sensory experience. In the future, defining these Rem2-dependent signaling mechanisms will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that instruct activity-dependent modifications of neural circuitry.

. 6d MD ), in the presence or absence of Rem2, has different effects on intrinsic excitability ( Figure 7 ). These data imply the existence of other signaling pathways, in addition to Rem2, which also function to regulate intrinsic excitability in the context of sensory deprivation and further, are responsive to the amount of deprivation that has occurred. Given the baseline change in intrinsic excitability observed in the absence of Rem2, we next sought to address whether this shift was dependent on circuit level changes in network excitability as a result of synapse loss, or rather reflected a cell-autonomous function of Rem2. To address this question, we performed acute, sparse deletion of Rem2 in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in binocular visual cortex in animals that were typically reared in a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle, which would allow for some level of Rem2 expression. Rem2flx/flx mice were injected at P18-20 with either a dilute control virus ( AAV-GFP ) or virus expressing Cre recombinase ( AAV-GFP-Cre; Figure 8A ). Our injection strategy causes expression of GFP ( AAV-GFP ), or expression of GFP and deletion of Rem2 ( AAV-GFP-Cre ), from a few dozen neurons, while leaving the majority of the circuit unaffected. We previously verified using qPCR that 3–5 days of viral infection is sufficient to delete Rem2 exons 2 and 3 ( Kenny et al., 2017 ), Figure 1A ). Acute cortical slices were then isolated either 4 days post infection ( 4 d. p. i., Figure 8A left ) or 10–12 d. p. i. ( Figure 8A right ), and f-I curves constructed from GFP+, layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons to determine if Rem2 regulates neuronal intrinsic excitability in a cell-autonomous manner. Surprisingly, we found that acute, sparse deletion of Rem2 from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons 4 d. p. i. led to a significant increase in intrinsic excitability in response to current injection ( Figure 8B, Rem2flx/flx + AAV GFP-Cre 4 d. p. i

Gene knockdown approaches in cultured neurons and Xenopus lavis optic tect established Rem as a positive regulator of synapse and negative of dendritic complexity, suggesting it may regulate plasticity in activity-dependent. Rem expression and signaling is sensitive to neuronal levels and regulates changes in gene expression, leading to the hypothesis that it could be a regulator of cortical plasticity in the nervous system.

The combination of these cellular phenotypes leads to the observed increase in firing in vivo. Rem is a non-canonical-like GTPase, expressed throughout the cell and unlikely regulated by nucleotide state, unlike canonical members. The mechanism by which transduces is open investigation, but has associated with VG subunits and CaMK. The deficits depend on deletion from excitatory neurons in cortex. The cellular, found Rem- exhibit altered regulation and increased excitability. Using sparse methods, effects on excit are cellonomous and precede synaptic. Consistent the increase excit, demonstrated Rem changes in firing in vitro and vivo. Together, suggest Rem provides understanding of molecular processes that coordinate excitability, firing, syn regulation, and circuit.

    Title: Physical limits to magnetogenetics
    Abstract: This is an analysis of how magnetic fields affect biological molecules and cells. It was prompted by a series of prominent reports regarding magnetism in biological systems. The first claims to have identified a protein complex that acts like a compass needle to guide magnetic orientation in animals ( Qin et al., 2016 ). Two other articles report magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein and then tugging the ferritin or heating it with a magnetic field ( Stanley et al., 2015; Wheeler et al., 2016 ). Here I argue that these claims conflict with basic laws of physics. The discrepancies are large: from 5 to 10 log units. If the reported phenomena do in fact occur, they must have causes entirely different from the ones proposed by the authors. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes is found to seriously limit their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells.

    Supporting Text:
    The calculations presented here evaluate the mechanisms that might underlie recent observations on a molecular compass ( Qin et al., 2016 ) and neural activation with static magnetic fields ( Wheeler et al., 2016 ) or high-frequency magnetic fields ( Stanley et al., 2015 ). These calculations show that none of the biophysical schemes proposed in these articles is even remotely plausible, and a few additional proposals were eliminated along the way. The forces or torques or temperatures they produce are too small by many orders of magnitude for the desired effects on molecular orientation or on membrane channels. If the phenomena occurred as described, they must rely on some entirely different mechanism. Barring dramatic new discoveries about the structure of biological matter, the proposed routes to magnetogenetics, based on either pulling or heating a ferritin/channel complex with magnetic fields, have no chance of success. One does have to ask why none of these authors attempted a back-of-the-envelope estimate to bolster the claims in their papers. Neither, it seems, did the referees who reviewed the manuscripts, nor the authors of three pieces that heralded these articles ( Leibiger and Berggren, 2015; Lewis, 2016; Lohmann, 2016 ). Why is it important to do so? First of all, claims that violate the known laws of physics often turn out to be wrong ( Maddox et al., 1988 ). There is, of course, always a small chance of discovering new physics, but only if one understands what the old physics predicts and recognizes the discrepancy. If any of the claims in these articles were substantiated – a room-temperature molecular magnet or measurable forces and heating from ferritin – their implications for our basic understanding of nanoscale matter would far outweigh their biological significance. More importantly though, calculations are most useful when done ahead of time, to guide the design of experiments

., 2010 ). On this background, a recent article by Qin et al. ( 2016 ) introduces a new proposal. As for magnetotactic bacteria, the principle is that of a compass needle that aligns with the magnetic field, but here the needle consists of a single macromolecule. This putative magnetic receptor protein was isolated from the fruit fly and forms a rod-shaped multimeric complex that includes 40 iron atoms. The authors imaged individual complexes by electron microscopy on a sample grid. They claim ( 1 ) that each such rod has an intrinsic magnetic moment, and ( 2 ) that this moment is large enough to align the rods with the earth’s magnetic field: “about 45% of the isolated rod-like protein particles oriented with their long axis roughly parallel to the geomagnetic field”. We will see that neither claim is plausible based on first principles: With the goal of controlling the activity of neurons, Wheeler et al. ( 2016 ) reported the design of a molecular system intended to couple magnetic fields to ionic current across the cell membrane. Their single-component protein consists of a putative mechano-sensitive cation channel ( TRPV4 ) fused on the intracellular face to two subunits of ferritin. The hope was that “the paramagnetic protein would enable magnetic torque to tug open the channel to depolarize cells”. Indeed, the report includes experimental results from several preparations suggesting that neural activity can be modulated by static magnetic fields ( There is a similar claim in Stanley et al. ( 2015 ) ; but the evidence is scant and hard to interpret: only 18 of ~2000 cells'responded' ( their Supplementary Figure 10 ) ). What could be the underlying biophysical mechanism? Ferritin is a large protein complex with 24 subunits that forms a spherical shell about 12 nm in diameter. Wheeler et al

There has been renewed interest recently in the effects of magnetic fields on biological cells. On the one hand we have the old puzzle of magnetosensation: How do organisms sense the Earth’s magnetic field for the purpose of navigation? The biophysical basis for this ability is for the most part unresolved. On the other hand lies the promise of'magnetogenetics': the dream of making neurons and other cells responsive to magnetic fields for the purpose of controlling their activity with ease. The two are closely linked, because uncovering Nature’s method for magnetosensation can point the way to effectively engineering magnetogenetics. The physical laws by which magnetic fields act on matter are taught to science students in college ( Feynman et al., 1963 ). Obviously those principles impose some constraints on what biological mechanisms are plausible candidates, for both magnetosensation and magnetogenetics. A recent spate of high-profile articles has put forward audacious proposals in this domain without any attempt at such reality checks. My goal here is to offer some calculations as a supplement to those articles, which makes them appear in a rather different light. These arguments should also help in evaluating future hypotheses and in engineering new molecular tools.

. The hope was that a high-frequency magnetic field could be used to heat the iron core of ferritin, leading to a local temperature increase sufficient to open the TRPV1 channels, allowing cations to flow into the cell. Stanley et al. ( 2015 ) compared three different options for interaction between the ion channels in the plasma membrane and the ferritin protein: In one case the ferritin was expressed in the cytoplasm, in another it was targeted to the membrane by a myristoyl tail, and in the third it was tethered directly to the channel protein by a camelid antibody linkage. The direct one-to-one linkage between ferritin and ion channel worked best for generating Ca influx via high-frequency magnetic fields, leading the authors to conclude that “Because temperature decays as the inverse distance from the particle surface, heat transfer is likely to be most efficient for this construct, suggesting that heat transfer from the particle could be limiting the efficiency of the other constructs. ” Here I consider whether heat transfer from the ferritin particle is a likely source of thermal activation for the TRPV1 channel at all. Magnetic heating of nanoparticles is indeed a very active area of research ( Pankhurst et al., 2003 ). A sample biomedical application is to inject nanoparticles into cancerous tissue, and then damage the tumor selectively by magnetic heating ( Hergt et al., 2006; Maier-Hauff et al., 2011 ). Typical nanoparticles of interest are made of magnetite or maghemite, sometimes doped with other metals, and measure some tens of nanometers in size ( Hergt et al., 2006 ). A typical heating apparatus for small preparations – like in the experiments of Stanley et al. ( 2015 ) – consists of an electric coil with a few windings, several centimeters in diameter, that carries a large oscillating current

Generally speaking, magnetic fields interact only weakly with biological matter. The reason magnetic fields are used for whole-body medical imaging, and why they have such appeal for magnetogenetics, is that they penetrate through tissues essentially undisturbed. The other side of this coin is that evolution had to develop rather special mechanisms to sense a magnetic field at all, especially one as weak as the Earth’s field. This mechanism is well understood in just one case: that of magnetotactic bacteria ( Bazylinski and Frankel, 2004 ). These organisms are found commonly in ponds, and they prefer to live in the muck at the bottom rather than in open water. When the muck gets stirred up they need to return to the bottom, and they accomplish this by following the magnetic field lines down. For that purpose, the bacterium synthesizes ferrimagnetic crystals of magnetite and arranges them in a chain within the cell. This gives the bacterium a permanent magnetic moment, and allows it to act like a small compass needle. The cell’s long axis aligns with the magnetic field and flagella in the back of the cell propel it along the field lines. It has been suggested that magnetosensation in animals similarly relies on a magnetite mechanism, for example by coupling the movement of a small magnetic crystal to a membrane channel ( Kirschvink et al., 2001 ). A competing proposal for magnetosensation suggests that the magnetic field acts on single molecules in certain biochemical reactions ( Ritz et al., 2010 ). In this so-called 'radical pair mechanism' the products of an electron transfer reaction depend on the equilibrium between singlet and triplet states of a reaction intermediate, and this equilibrium can be biased by an applied magnetic field. These two hypotheses and their respective predictions for magnetosensation have been reviewed extensively ( Johnsen and Berg, 2013 ), and will not be discussed further here. The focus is on magnetogenetics, the idea that magnetic fields can be used to control activity of neurons and other cells.

    Title: Transient nuclear Prospero induces neural progenitor quiescence
    Abstract: Stem cells can self-renew, differentiate, or enter quiescence. Understanding how stem cells switch between these states is highly relevant for stem cell-based therapeutics. Drosophila neural progenitors ( neuroblasts ) have been an excellent model for studying self-renewal and differentiation, but quiescence remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that when neuroblasts enter quiescence, the differentiation factor Prospero is transiently detected in the neuroblast nucleus, followed by the establishment of a unique molecular profile lacking most progenitor and differentiation markers. The pulse of low level nuclear Prospero precedes entry into neuroblast quiescence even when the timing of quiescence is advanced or delayed by changing temporal identity factors. Furthermore, loss of Prospero prevents entry into quiescence, whereas a pulse of low level nuclear Prospero can drive proliferating larval neuroblasts into quiescence. We propose that Prospero levels distinguish three progenitor fates: absent for self-renewal, low for quiescence, and high for differentiation.

    Quiescent stem cells preserve the stem cell pool for activation following disease or injury. Moreover, cancer stem cells can enter remission during treatment, possibly using mechanisms similar to stem cell quiescence, and re-initiate proliferation months to years later. Thus, studying stem cell quiescence may help design clinical approaches to prevent tumor dormancy and cancer recurrence, as well as to aid in activating stem cells for tissue repair. Drosophila neuroblasts have served as a model system for identifying conserved signaling pathways that regulate stem cell proliferation and quiescence ( Ebens et al., 1993; Datta, 1995; Britton and Edgar, 1998; Doe et al., 1998; Egger et al., 2008; Tsuji et al., 2008; Sousa-Nunes et al., 2010; Homem and Knoblich, 2012; Weng and Cohen, 2012 ). Drosophila neuroblasts delaminate from neuroectoderm during early embryogenesis, and then they go through multiple rounds of asymmetric cell division before exiting cell cycle at the end of embryogenesis; upon cell cycle exit, neuroblasts can undergo apoptosis ( Karcavitch and Doe, 2005; Maurange and Gould, 2005; Ulvklo et al., 2012 ) or enter quiescence ( Truman and Bate, 1988; Datta, 1995; Tsuji et al., 2008; Chell and Brand, 2010; Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011 ). During neuroblast asymmetric division, the scaffolding protein Miranda ( Mira ) is partitioned into the differentiating daughter cell, called a ganglion mother cell ( GMC ), and it carries at least three cargo proteins: the translational repressors Staufen and Brain tumor ( Brat ) and the transcriptional repressor Prospero ( Hirata et al., 1995; Broadus and Doe, 1997; Ikeshima-Kataoka et al., 1997; Broadus et al., 1998; Schuldt et al., 1998; Shen et al., 1998; Bello et al., 2006; Betschinger et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2006 ). In the GMC, Mira appears to be degraded and its cargo is released into the cytoplasm ( Staufen, Brat ) or the nucleus ( Prospero )

. High levels of the vertebrate ortholog Prox1 can also trigger differentiation ( Dyer, 2003; Takahashi et al., 2006; Foskolou et al., 2013 ) ; thus it is interesting that low levels of nuclear Prospero promote neuroblast quiescence without triggering differentiation ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ). Prox1 activates some target genes at high levels but represses some target genes at low levels ( Chen et al., 2008a, 2008b ). We suggest a speculative model for Prospero function: low levels of Prospero are sufficient to repress most progenitor-specific genes in neuroblasts ( worniu, asense, miranda, and cycE ) but do not repress the expression of deadpan ( perhaps due to lack of high affinity Prospero binding sites ). In contrast, high levels of Prospero are sufficient to repress deadpan ( perhaps via low affinity binding sites ) and may even activate neuronal differentiation genes ( Figure 4G ). In embryonic neuroblasts, the temporal transcription factors Pdm and Cas schedule the timing of neuroblast quiescence, but how they regulate Prospero nuclear import is unknown. In larval neuroblasts, Grh prevents accumulation of nuclear Prospero which would induce neuroblast cell cycle exit and differentiation ( Maurange et al., 2008; Chai et al., 2013 ), again by an unknown mechanism. The protein Caliban is known to promote Prospero nuclear export in S2 cells ( Bi et al., 2005 ), but it is unknown whether Caliban has a similar role in neuroblasts or if down-regulation of Caliban levels or activity leads to increased nuclear Prospero in neuroblasts entering quiescence.

. Prospero is an atypical homeodomain protein that directly binds and represses progenitor and cell cycle genes to initiate GMC and neuronal differentiation ( Li and Vaessin, 2000; Choksi et al., 2006 ) ; the mammalian ortholog Prox1 has a similar role in repressing cell cycle gene expression ( Dyer, 2003; Foskolou et al., 2013 ). In addition, keeping high levels of Prospero out of the neuroblast nucleus is essential to prevent neuroblast differentiation ( Choksi et al., 2006; Cabernard and Doe, 2009; Bayraktar et al., 2010 ). In this study, we show that the Prospero differentiation factor is transiently detected at low levels in the neuroblast nucleus just prior to entry into quiescence. We find that loss of Prospero prevents entry into quiescence, whereas a pulse of low level nuclear Prospero drives proliferating larval neuroblasts into quiescence. We propose a model in which low levels of Prospero repress all cell cycle and progenitor genes except deadpan, whereas high levels of Prospero additionally repress deadpan to allow neural differentiation.

. Interestingly, Prospero can also transiently arrest the cell cycle without inducing differentiation in embryonic longitudinal glial progenitors ( Griffiths and Hidalgo, 2004 ), although the relative levels of Prospero have not been explored in this system. 10. 7554/eLife. 03363. 009Figure 4. Prospero is sufficient to induce neuroblast quiescence. ( A–C ) Transient overexpression of nuclear Prospero in neuroblasts ( worniu-gal4 UAS-HA:prospero tub-gal80ts ) results in neuroblast quiescence ( A ) or differentiation ( B ). Third-instar larvae were shifted from 22°C to 30°C to inactivate Gal80, which resulted in nuclear Prospero in neuroblasts. Low levels of nuclear Prospero result in neuroblast quiescence ( Dpn+ Elav− ) ( A ) whereas high levels of nuclear Prospero suppress Deadpan and activate Elav to induce differentiation ( Dpn− Elav+ ) ( B ).

    Title: Kinetics of HIV-1 capsid uncoating revealed by single-molecule analysis
    Abstract: Uncoating of the metastable HIV-1 capsid is a tightly regulated disassembly process required for release of the viral cDNA prior to nuclear import. To understand the intrinsic capsid disassembly pathway and how it can be modulated, we have developed a single-particle fluorescence microscopy method to follow the real-time uncoating kinetics of authentic HIV capsids in vitro immediately after permeabilizing the viral membrane. Opening of the first defect in the lattice is the rate-limiting step of uncoating, which is followed by rapid, catastrophic collapse. The capsid-binding inhibitor PF74 accelerates capsid opening but stabilizes the remaining lattice. In contrast, binding of a polyanion to a conserved arginine cluster in the lattice strongly delays initiation of uncoating but does not prevent subsequent lattice disassembly. Our observations suggest that different stages of uncoating can be controlled independently with the interplay between different capsid-binding regulators likely to determine the overall uncoating kinetics.

    Supporting Text:
    Measurement of the single-particle uncoating kinetics of authentic HIV capsids immediately after removing the protective barrier of the viral membrane has allowed us to observe the effects of capsid-binding molecules on discrete steps in the capsid uncoating process. The order of events established with our new assays would have been obscured in ensemble measurements due to dephasing. We observed the following main characteristics of HIV-1 capsid uncoating and its interactions with capsid-binding molecules: ( 1 ) The integrity and stability of capsids in a population is highly heterogeneous, whereby the majority of capsids contain defects and/or uncoat immediately after removal of the viral membrane. ( 2 ) In the absence of capsid binders, uncoating is an all-or-none process that proceeds rapidly after the first defect is created. ( 3 ) Capsid-binding molecules exhibit differential effects on the steps that control initiation and continuation of uncoating. The structural heterogeneity of the HIV capsid is well described, with the assembly process yielding a variety of conical, tubular and other shapes that often contain structural defects such as gaps in the CA lattice ( Briggs et al., 2003; Frank et al., 2015; Mattei et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2013 ). Here, we identify functionally distinct classes of capsids on the basis of their GFP release kinetics, allowing us to quantify the functional heterogeneity for hundreds of capsids within a population and relate them to different assembly states. By utilizing a pore-former to permeabilize the viral membrane in a controlled manner while recording capsid opening traces, we are able to observe early events that occur upon exposure of the capsid to a change in conditions and thus capture unstable assembly states

. This approach circumvents the need for isolating viral cores, a process which exposes cores to experimental buffer conditions for extended periods of time ( Shah and Aiken, 2011 ) and would result in a loss of this information. Our results show that the assembly states range from incomplete or imperfect ( leaky ) lattices to fully assembled ( closed ) capsids that nevertheless exhibit pronounced differences in uncoating kinetics. Here, we have quantified the fraction of particles of different stability for a viral particle that lacks HIV envelope protein and has GFP inserted into the Gag polyprotein. These features may affect maturation and capsid assembly or lead to misclassification of some particles, for example as a result of incomplete proteolysis. It is therefore important to note that wild type HIV may exhibit a different distribution of capsid stability types. Nevertheless, it is striking that 60–80% of capsids in our experiments are not fully closed and are unable to retain GFP upon membrane permeabilization. This category includes early assembly intermediates but mostly structures that are essentially fully assembled ( as judged by our CypA paint method, see below ) yet unable to form a closed cone. We assign the latter class of leaky structures to capsids with holes that are also observed in intact viral particles by cryo-electron microscopy ( Mattei et al., 2016 ) and by GFP release in vivo ( Yu et al., 2013 ). The abundance of these types of particles obtained here using a viral preparation protocol that avoids harsh treatments ( such as centrifugation ) suggests that capsid assembly frequently becomes trapped at this stage, whereby remodeling of the lattice to allow it to close might be a slow process. Host cell proteins that interact with the viral capsid after cell entry often recognize assembled CA rather than CA monomers ( Yamashita and Engelman, 2017 )

. The observation that CypA binding at low concentrations is neutral with respect to capsid opening provides an added dimension to our single-particle assay. The ability to ‘paint’ the capsid with fluorescent CypA at sub-stoichiometric ratios ( about 1:20 CypA:CA ) enables kinetic studies of capsid disassembly. We observed that defective capsids collapsed rapidly after membrane permeabilization suggesting that they are only stable in the presence of the high concentrations of free CA inside the viral membrane ( most CA released by proteolysis during maturation is not incorporated into the capsid and remains in solution at a concentration in the low mM range ). Similarly, we found that lattice disassembly of an initially intact capsid is a rapid process that ensues as soon as the first gap in the lattice has appeared, that is uncoating is primarily controlled by the slow rate of removing the first ( few ) CA subunits. The ability to simultaneously monitor appearance of the first defect and overall lattice stability allows us to define different stages of ‘uncoating’ and study how they may be influenced by external factors, as demonstrated here by dissecting the effects of two known capsid-binding molecules, PF74 and hexacarboxybenzene. PF74 is a drug molecule designed to target CA ( Blair et al., 2010 ). At high concentration ( ≥10 µM ), it blocks HIV infection at a stage before reverse transcription ( Price et al., 2014 ). It has been described as stabilizing self-assembled hexameric CA or CA-NC tubes but destabilizing HIV cores ( Bhattacharya et al., 2014; Da Silva Santos et al., 2016; Fricke et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2011 ). In our assay, PF74 uncoupled the step of capsid opening from lattice disassembly. Addition of PF74 led to a pronounced acceleration of capsid opening but the remaining lattice was highly stabilized. This observation reconciles the previous ambiguity regarding the mode of action of PF74

. The half-life of the HIV capsid is sufficiently long to use PFO-permeabilized viral particles as a platform to quantify the binding of labeled proteins to authentic viral capsids at the single-particle level as shown in Figure 3A. To demonstrate this approach, we added CypA labeled with Alexa Fluor 568 ( AF568 ) at the same time as PFO to the flow channel and followed the fluorescence signals of GFP packaged into the virion and AF568-CypA using dual-color TIRF microscopy. For binding analysis, we selected particles with capsids that remained intact ( GFP-positive ) for a sufficient period of time to obtain a binding equilibrium. Using a calibration value obtained by single-molecule photobleaching, we converted the AF568 intensity to obtain the number of CypA molecules bound at each location corresponding to a closed capsid. Representative traces of CypA binding to closed capsids are shown in Figure 3B. As before, PFO-mediated permeabilization of each individual particle was evident from the large drop in GFP intensity to a level corresponding to the pool of GFP trapped inside the closed capsid. Coincident with GFP signal loss, we observed a rapid increase in the CypA signal up to an equilibrium binding level. We then obtained the CypA binding kinetics for the entire population of closed capsids in the field by aligning all single-particle traces at the time of membrane permeabilization. The aligned traces recorded in the presence of 1 μM CypA are shown as a heatmap in Figure 3C. The median binding trace showed that binding equilibrium was rapidly established, suggesting that the PFO-permeabilized membrane does not present a significant barrier for diffusion of proteins to and from the capsid. The number of molecules bound at equilibrium in the experiment shown in Figure 3C had a median of 73 molecules per capsid

. Single-particle traces of opening capsids ( Figure 4D ) were characterized by the following phases: First, rapid binding of CypA upon membrane permeabilization, reaching a binding equilibrium while the capsid remained closed ( Figure 4E, left heatmap ). Second, the CypA fluorescence signal started to decay within a short dwell time of capsid opening ( GFP release ) and then reached a stable level above background. We interpret the second phase as the disassembly of most of the CA lattice. The median disassembly kinetics after capsid opening ( Figure 4E, right heatmap ) were governed by a half-life of approximately 70–100 s. The rapid decay of the lattice after initiation of uncoating observed here with labeled monomeric CypA is consistent with previous measurements in vitro and in cells using a tetrameric probe, CypA-dsRed, that binds irreversibly to CA ( Yamashita and Engelman,2017 ). The half-life of disassembly was independent of the concentration of Cyp used in the range 0.1–10 µM, indicating that disassembly is not limited by diffusion of Cyp to the capsid. In contrast to PF74, hexarboxbenzene at 10 µM delayed the initiation of capsid unating but did not prevent subsequent disassembly ( Figure 4F ). The effect of hexarboxbenzene on capsid unating is consistent with its binding to a conserved arginine cluster in the capsid lattice ( Bhattacharya et al, 2014 ). The observation that hexarbenzene delays but does not prevent capsid unating suggests that the conserved cluster is involved in the initiation of unating rather than the disassembly of the lattice. Our results indicate that different stages of capsid unating can be controlled independently by the interplay between caps-binding molecules and that likely determine the overall unating kinetics

The article discusses the kinetics of HIV-1 capsid unco, a tightly regulated process required for the release of viral cDNA prior to nuclear import. The authors developed a single-particle fluorescence method to follow the real-time unco kinetics of authentic capsids in vitro after permeabilizing the viral membrane. They observed that the opening of the first defect in the lattice is the rate-limiting step of unco, followed by rapid collapse. The caps-binding PF74 accelerates caps opening but stabilizes the lattice, while binding to a polyan to a conserved arginine in the lattice delays initiation of unating but does not prevent lattice disassembly. The authors suggest that different stages of unating can be controlled by the interplay between caps-binding molecules and likely determine the overall unating kinetics.

The article is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections. The language is formal and technical, but accessible to a general audience. The use of diagrams and figures helps to illustrate the complex concepts. However, some sentences are long and convoluted, and could be broken up for clarity. Overall, the article is well-written and effectively communicates the research findings.

Here are some minor suggestions for improvement:

* In the introduction, consider adding a brief background on the importance of understanding HIV-1 capsid unco and its relevance to HIV infection.
* In the methods section, provide more detail on the single-particle fluorescence method and how it was developed.
* In the results, consider adding more detail on the heterogeneity of capsids and how it was quantified.
* In the discussion, expand on the implications of the findings and how they relate to previous research.
* Consider adding a conclusion section summarizing the main findings and their significance.

Overall, the article is well-written and effectively communicates the research. With some minor revisions, it can be even clearer and more accessible to a general audience.

    Title: The cJUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway promotes genome stability and prevents tumor initiation
    Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women. Analysis of breast cancer genomic DNA indicates frequent loss-of-function mutations in components of the cJUN NH2-terminal kinase ( JNK ) signaling pathway. Since JNK signaling can promote cell proliferation by activating the AP1 transcription factor, this apparent association of reduced JNK signaling with tumor development was unexpected. We examined the effect of JNK deficiency in the murine breast epithelium. Loss of JNK signaling caused genomic instability and the development of breast cancer. Moreover, JNK deficiency caused widespread early neoplasia and rapid tumor formation in a murine model of breast cancer. This tumor suppressive function was not mediated by a role of JNK in the growth of established tumors, but by a requirement of JNK to prevent tumor initiation. Together, these data identify JNK pathway defects as ‘driver’ mutations that promote genome instability and tumor initiation.

    Supporting Text:
    Loss-of-function mutations in the JNK signaling pathway ( e. g. MAP3K1, MAP2K4, and MAP2K7 ) are implicated in the etiology of breast cancer ( Banerji et al., 2012; Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; Ciriello et al., 2015; Ellis et al., 2012; Kan et al., 2010; Nik-Zainal et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014 ). These potential ‘driver’ mutations in breast cancer cause disruption of JNK signaling. To test whether JNK pathway disruption influences breast cancer development, we examined the effect of JNK-deficiency in the mammary epithelium. The JNK1 ( encoded by Mapk8 ) and JNK2 ( encoded by Mapk9 ) isoforms exhibit partially redundant functions ( Davis, 2000 ). We therefore examined compound JNK deficiency in the mammary epithelium using Control ( MECRE: Wap-Cre+/- Mapk8+/+ Mapk9+/+ and MEWT: Mapk8LoxP/LoxP Mapk9LoxP/LoxP ) mice and JNK-deficient ( MEKO: Wap-Cre+/- Mapk8LoxP/LoxP Mapk9LoxP/LoxP ) mice. Lactation induces Wap-Cre expression ( Wagner et al., 1997 ). Studies using Rosa26mTmG+/- female reporter mice demonstrated Cre-mediated recombination in cytokeratin 8 ( CK8 ) positive luminal epithelial cells ( Figure 1A ), but not in cytokeratin 5 ( CK5 ) positive myoepithelial cells ( Figure 1B ). We examined female control ( MEWT and MECRE ) mice and JNK-deficient ( MEKO ) mice to determine whether JNK deficiency causes breast tumor development. We found no breast cancer or pre-malignant mammary lesions in a cohort of 22 control MECRE mice ( Figure 1—source data 1 ). However, studies of a cohort of 19 control MEWT mice identified one palpable breast tumor ( adenosquamous carcinoma ) in a 78 wk old mouse ( Figure 1C ). In addition, mammary intraepithelial neoplasia ( MIN ) was detected in one MEWT mouse during microscopic analysis of tissue sections following necropsy. In contrast, the incidence of palpable breast tumors ( 31% of mice, median age 80 wk; p=0

. This represents a potential opportunity for the design of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of tumors with defects in JNK signaling. The TRP53 pathway is known to be important for genome stability and tumor suppression. Our data demonstrate that the JNK pathway similarly promotes genome stability and tumor suppression. The number of SNVs and indels caused by TRP53 deficiency was greater than that caused by JNK deficiency. Nevertheless, the number of CNVs were similar on both genetic backgrounds. These observations indicate that while both TRP53-deficiency and JNK-deficiency can cause genomic instability, the mechanisms engaged by these two pathways may be different. The identification of JNK pathway mutations as ‘driver’ mutations for breast cancer was not anticipated. For example, the JNK pathway can promote cell proliferation and survival through regulation of AP1 transcription factors ( Das et al., 2007; Lamb et al., 2003; Ventura et al., 2003 ). Indeed, the JNK/JUN signaling pathway may promote the proliferation of some breast tumor cells in vitro ( Guo et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2017 ). It is therefore possible that JNK signaling may have pro-oncogenic functions in certain tumor types or under specific conditions ( Whitmarsh and Davis, 2007 ). Nevertheless, our analysis establishes that a major role of JNK signaling in the breast epithelium is tumor suppression ( Figure 1 and 3 ). This role of JNK signaling is consistent with the discovery of frequent JNK pathway gene ablation and mutation in human breast cancer ( Banerji et al., 2012; Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; Ciriello et al., 2015; Ellis et al., 2012; Kan et al., 2010; Nik-Zainal et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014 )

., 2012; Wang et al., 2014 ). The major conclusions of this study are that: ( 1 ) JNK deficiency in the mammary epithelium can cause murine breast cancer; and ( 2 ) JNK deficiency rapidly accelerates tumor development in a mouse model of breast cancer. These observations indicate that JNK can act as a breast cancer tumor suppressor. This is a significant finding because frequent mutational inactivation of genes that encode JNK pathway components ( e. g. MAP2K4 and MAP3K1 ) are detected in human breast cancer ( Garraway and Lander, 2013 ). However, it should be noted that the compound disruption of JNK expression that we have studied most likely differs from the loss of individual JNK pathway components ( e. g. MAP2K4 and MAP3K1 ) because of partial compensation by alternative signaling molecules, including MAP2K7 and members of the MAP3K family. Whether reduced JNK activity caused by loss of MAP2K4 or MAP3K1 phenocopies the effects of compound JNK deficiency on breast cancer is unclear. An important goal for future studies will be to directly test the effect of MAP2K4 and MAP3K1 gene mutation on breast cancer.

. This observation likely accounts for the effect of mutational inactivation of JNK signaling to promote tumor development ( Figure 1 and 3 ). In contrast to this tumor-suppressive role of JNK during early stages of carcinogenesis ( Figure 7 ), JNK does not markedly influence the late-stage tumor phenotype ( Figure 6 ). Thus, JNK does not change tumor cell proliferation, invasion or migration in vitro or tumor formation in orthotopically transplanted mice in vivo ( Figure 6 ). However, JNK deficiency does repress tumor cell anoikis and promotes growth in soft agar in vitro ( Figure 6 ). JNK therefore plays a major role in early tumor development, but only a minor role in established tumors. An important question relates to the mechanism of breast tumor suppression by the JNK signaling pathway. Part of the mechanism may reflect the pro-apoptotic role of JNK ( Tournier et al., 2000 ). Mutations in key genes can enable epithelial cell survival in the luminal space, resulting in ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) and cancer ( Halaoui et al., 2017; Leung and Brugge, 2012; Pradeep et al., 2012; Taraseviciute et al., 2010 ). Indeed, JNK deficiency has been shown to impair efficient epithelial cell death in response to cell detachment ( anoikis ) in vitro and cause both occlusion of mammary ducts ( Cellurale et al., 2012; Girnius and Davis, 2017 ) and delayed involution ( Girnius et al., 2018 ) in vivo. It is therefore possible that these types of cell survival responses in the mammary epithelium may contribute to tumor development. However, this mechanism may not be sufficient to account for the tumor formation caused by JNK deficiency ( Figure 1 ) or the observed acceleration of tumor formation caused by JNK deficiency in a mouse model of breast cancer ( Figure 3 )

., 2001 ). The sequencing of breast tumor genomic DNA has revealed mutations in genes that encode members of this pathway, including MAP3K1, MAP2K4, and MAP2K7 ( Banerji et al., 2012; Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; Ciriello et al., 2015; Ellis et al., 2012; Kan et al., 2010; Nikain et al,2016; Shah et al,201; Stephens et al,2012; Wang et,2014 ). These ‘driver mutations in the J pathway cause disruption of J signaling. To determine whether J pathway influences breast development, we examined the effect of J-deficiency in mammary epithelium. J1 encoded by Map8 and J2 encoded by Map9 isoforms exhibit redundant functions ( Davis,200 ) We therefore examined compound J deficiency in mammary epithel using control ( MRE: W-C+/-Map8+9+Map+ and WT Map8LoP/LoP Map9LoP/Lo ) and J-deficient (ME: W-C-Map8LoP/LoP Map9Lo/LoP ) mice. Lact induces W-C expression ( Wagner et,199 ) Studies Rosa26Tm+ reporter mice demonstrated Cre-mediated recombination cytokeratin 8 CK positive luminal epithelial ( Figure 1 ) but not cytokeratin 5 positive myoepithelial ( Figure 1 ) We examined control (ME WT MRE ) and J-deficient (ME ) mice to determine whether J causes breast development We found no cancer or prealign mammary in cohort 22 MRE mice Figure—data 1 However, studies of cohort 19 WT identified palpable tumor adenocarcinoma in 78 old mouse Figure 1 In addition mam intraepithelial ne (MIN ) detected one WT mouse microscopic tissue necrops In contrast incidence palp breast 31 mice median 80 p=0.
Researchers have identified peptidylglyc α-amating monxygenase (PAM), an enzyme responsible for generating amidated bioactive peptides, as crucial for cilium assembly in Chlamdomonas and mammalian cells. P is present in the Golgi and cilia of C. reinii and mammalian cells, including tracheal epithelial, fibroblasts, and spermatozoa. In C. reinii, P activity is associated with the axonem superstructure, suggesting a conserved signaling function in eukotic cilia. P plays a conserved role in early ciliogenesis, linking amidation and assembly in multiple cell types. In C. reinii, P knockdown resulted in loss of cilia beyond the transition zone, abnormal Golgi architecture, and altered c assembly components. Decreased P expression reduced motile cilia on the ventral surface of planaria, with cytoplasmic axemes lacking ciliary membrane. Primary cilia on neuroepithelial cells in P-/- mice were also aberrant. P activity and post-Gol trafficking contribute to cili defects, providing a link between amidation and assembly. P is conserved in multiple cell types, required for biogenesis of motile cilia in C. rein and ventral epithelium planaria, and primaryilia neuroepith cells. In C. rein, P reduction did not affect growth, but led to loss ofilia, with c stubs containing electron-dense material. Basal docking and division were comparable, but microtule extension from basal was disrupted in Pami cells, similar to IFT and I46 mutants. PH and bifunctional P in planaria revealed complexities in regulation. PH activity was reduced in S-ph and S-p RNA animals, with predominant role in gliding. Double knockdown resulted in loss motilia and ectopic axemes in cytoplasm.

    Title: Myosin III-mediated cross-linking and stimulation of actin bundling activity of Espin
    Abstract: Class III myosins ( Myo3 ) and actin-bundling protein Espin play critical roles in regulating the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells, and their defects cause hereditary hearing impairments. Myo3 interacts with Espin1 through its tail homology I motif ( THDI ), however it is not clear how Myo3 specifically acts through Espin1 to regulate the actin bundle assembly and stabilization. Here we discover that Myo3 THDI contains a pair of repeat sequences capable of independently and strongly binding to the ankyrin repeats of Espin1, revealing an unexpected Myo3-mediated cross-linking mechanism of Espin1. The structures of Myo3 in complex with Espin1 not only elucidate the mechanism of the binding, but also reveal a Myo3-induced release of Espin1 auto-inhibition mechanism. We also provide evidence that Myo3-mediated cross-linking can further promote actin fiber bundling activity of Espin1.

    Supporting Text:
    The most important findings of this study are the structure-based discovery of two strong and independent Espin1 binding sites in the tail region of each class III myosins, and Myo3 binding-induced auto-inhibition release of Espin1. These discoveries, together with our cell-based filopodia formation and localization assay and microscopic-based actin bundling assay, provide compelling evidences showing that Myo3 and Espin1 work together to assemble and promote higher order parallel actin bundle formation in cellular processes such as stereocilia. We believe that our model reveals the probable underlying molecular mechanism of hearing loss development ( stereocilia degeneration ) in humans with mutations in Myo3a ( DFNB30 ) ( Walsh et al., 2002 ). It is believed that the delayed hearing loss phenotype in DFNB30 subjects could be due to Myo3b compensatory mechanism ( Manor et al., 2012 ), a hypothesis supported by our results as well. With the help of the motor domain-mediated high affinity binding of Myo3 to actin filaments ( Dose et al., 2007; Kambara et al., 2006 ), the full-length Myo3/Espin1 complex may have even higher actin fiber bundling activity than the Myo3-ABR12/Espin1 complex studied in this work. As such, our study reveals a previously unrecognized direct myosin binding-induced actin bundling activity regulation mechanism of an actin filament cross-linker protein. It also demonstrates an intimate synergistic action mechanism between two classes of actin binding proteins, namely actin filament-based myosin motors and actin filament cross-linking protein, in controlling actin fiber size and stability. It has been reported that another unconventional myosin in stereocilia, Myosin XVa, can form a complex with an actin capping protein Eps8 to regulate stereocilia elongations ( Manor et al

., 2011 ), suggesting that working together with actin binding proteins to regulate actin skeletal dynamics might be a new mode of function for unconventional myosins. Fitting with this model, stereocilia in jerker mice are thinner in their diameters likely due to loss of Espin1-mediated higher order actin fiber assembly, easier to form tapered structures and easier to degenerate presumably due to stability decrease of less bundled actin fibers in stereocilia ( Sekerkova et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2000 ). As one of the three known actin cross-linkers in stereocilia, the abundance of Espin is relatively low compared to fascin and plastin ( Shin et al., 2013 ). It has been proposed that Espin may play a regulating role in elongation and widening of actin bundle by concentrating at the tip of stereocilia instead of major structural cross-linking roles ( Avenarius et al., 2014; Loomis et al., 2003 ). Interestingly, the abundance of Myo3 ( both Myo3a and Myo3b together ) is similar to that of Espin ( a few hundred copies per stereocilium ) ( Shin et al., 2013 ), indicating that Myo3 and Espin1 may work together to regulate higher order actin bundle structure formation and stability in stereocilia. Both Myo3 and Espin1 are known to concentrate at the tips of stereocilia in hair cells and at the tips of filopodia when expressed in heterologous cells ( Merritt et al., 2012; Salles et al., 2009; Schneider et al., 2006 ). It is possible that stabilization of the growing end of the actin filaments at the plus ends by both Myo3 and Espin1 is a critical driving force for actin filament elongations ( Avenarius et al., 2014; Loomis et al., 2003; Shin et al., 2013 ). The Myo3 binding-mediated cross-linking of Espin1 cargo is in sharp contrast to the cargo binding-mediated motor dimerization and processivity induction known in a number of other unconventional myosins ( myosin V, VI and VII ) ( Lu et al., 2014; Sakai et al

Class III myosins ( Myo3 ), together with class IX myosins, are two special groups of the myosin superfamily as these two sub-families of actin motors contain enzymatically active domains and thus are regarded as motorized signaling molecules ( Bähler, 2000 ). The first member of Myo3 was identified in Drosophila photoreceptors and named as NinaC ( neither inactivation nor afterpotential C ) ( Montell and Rubin, 1988 ). There are two paralogs of Myo3 in vertebrate, Myo3a and Myo3b, both of which are known to express in vertebrate retina and cochlea ( Dose and Burnside, 2000, 2002; Shin et al., 2013 ). It is believed that they may play partially redundant roles as transporters that are crucial for vertebrate photoreceptor and stereocilia ultrastructure maintenance ( Manor et al., 2012; Mecklenburg et al., 2015; Merritt et al., 2012 ). Myo3 across different species all contain an N-terminal S/T kinase domain before their motor head. The kinase domain has been reported to regulate the motor’s ATPase activity ( Komaba et al., 2010; Quintero et al., 2010 ). The tail regions of Myo3 from different species are less conserved. Drosophila NinaC contains a PDZ binding motif at its very C-terminus capable of binding to a master scaffold protein called INAD ( Inactivation no afterpotential D ) ( Wes et al., 1999 ). Vertebrate Myo3 tails share a conserved vertebrate specific domain referred to as tail homology I motif ( THDI ) ( Figure 1A ) ( Dose et al., 2003 ). The THDI mediates binding of Myo3 to its cargo protein Espin1 ( Ectoplasmic specialization protein 1 ) and allows Myo3 to transport Espin1 to the tips of actin bundle-based structures such as filopodia and stereocilia. Once tip localized, Espin1 WH2 domain promotes the elongation of actin protrusions ( Merritt et al., 2012; Salles et al., 2009 ). However, the detailed molecular basis governing the Myo3 and Espin1 interaction is not clear. 10. 7554/eLife. 12856. 003Figure 1

., 2014; Sakai et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2009 ). Such large differences in their cargo bindings probably match with the distinct functional properties of these myosins. For a fast-moving cargo transporting motor such as myosin VI, it is important that the motor assumes as a dimer and gets activated for moving in one direction upon binding to a cognate cargo. In such a case, the binding of a cargo protein to the motor tail exerts large impact on the motor activity regulations. As a high duty ratio motor, processive and rapid movement along the actin filaments is not likely to be the main function of Myo3, although the motor can still move towards the plus end of actin filaments ( Les Erickson et al., 2003; Merritt et al., 2012; Salles et al., 2009; Schneider et al., 2006 ). Instead, one of Myo3’s key functions appears to coordinate with its cargo protein Espin1 to regulate Espin1-mediated actin filaments assembly and stability. Whether such myosin binding-mediated cargo activity regulation is also adopted by other unconventional myosins, particularly for those not known to play transporting roles, is an interesting research topic in the future. We provide detailed structural information regarding Myo3b/Espin1 interaction. We demonstrate that the Espin1 binding sites in Myo3 are located in its tail region and that My3 induces Esp1 auto-inhibition. We also show that My3 cross-linking of Esp1 promotes actin bundling activity of Esp1. Our results suggest that My3 and Esp1 work together to regulate higher order actin bundle formation in stereilia.

    Title: Structural determinants of voltage-gating properties in calcium channels
    Abstract: Voltage-gated calcium channels control key functions of excitable cells, like synaptic transmission in neurons and the contraction of heart and skeletal muscles. To accomplish such diverse functions, different calcium channels activate at different voltages and with distinct kinetics. To identify the molecular mechanisms governing specific voltage sensing properties, we combined structure modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, free energy, and transition kinetics of the activated and resting states of two functionally distinct voltage sensing domains ( VSDs ) of the eukaryotic calcium channel CaV1. 1. Both VSDs displayed the typical features of the sliding helix model; however, they greatly differed in ion-pair formation of the outer gating charges. Specifically, stabilization of the activated state enhanced the voltage dependence of activation, while stabilization of resting states slowed the kinetics. This mechanism provides a mechanistic model explaining how specific ion-pair formation in separate VSDs can realize the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels.

    Supporting Text:
    Our advanced structure models of the activated and resting states of CaV1. 1 VSDs fill an important gap in the understanding of the voltage sensing mechanism in eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channels. The results presented in this study demonstrate two surprisingly different VSDs, which substantially differ in the range of S4 helix displacement during activation/deactivation, as well as in the number and position of ionic bonds formed between the outer gating charges and countercharges of the ENC in the resting and activated states. These structural differences correspond to differences in the free energy states and kinetics of the state transitions, which in turn correlate with the experimentally determined kinetics and voltage dependences of current activation. Throughout this structure-function study, the combination of MD simulation and MSM proved to be of exceptionally high predictive value. All tested interaction partners suggested by the model showed the predicted effects on channel gating when experimentally tested by mutagenesis and electrophysiology analysis. Conversely, alterations of kinetic properties first recognized experimentally were reliably reproduced and explained by our computer model. Overall, the structures of the lowest energy states of CaV1. 1 VSDs display the basic features of the sliding helix model ( Catterall et al., 2017 ) and of previous simulations of VSD structures ( Tuluc et al., 2016b; Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2012 ). Notably, two of the resting states predicted by our models closely correspond to recently described cryo-EM structures of homotetrameric NaV channels with the VSD in a down-state. Our resting state 1 structure of VSD IVa resembles a mutated NaVAb captured in the resting state by disulfide locking ( Cα RMSD of 1. 7 Å ) ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4, Wisedchaisri et al., 2019 ). Our resting state 2 structure of VSD I resembles that of a NaVAb/NaV1

., 2015; Zhao et al., 2019 ). Biophysically it is characterized by slow kinetics and right-shifted voltage dependence of activation ( Tuluc et al., 2016a ). Together these attributes make CaV1. 1 a prime candidate for studying how specific structural features of the VSDs determine voltage dependence and kinetics of channel activation. Here, we applied molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulation and Markov state modeling ( MSM ) combined with site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiological analyses to identify the molecular mechanism by which individual VSDs determine the characteristic voltage dependence and kinetics of current activation. Our structure models of the activated and resting states of CaV1. 1 VSDs I and IV are consistent with the sliding helix model and yielded reliable predictions of the importance of ion-pair formation between the outer gating charges and various countercharges within the particular VSD. Our data provide novel insight in how the stabilization of the VSDs in resting and/or the activated states shapes the kinetics and voltage dependence of activation, respectively.

Voltage-gated calcium channels ( CaV ) translate membrane depolarization into calcium influx. Thus, they contribute to cellular excitability and they couple electrical activity to fundamental cell functions like contraction of heart and skeletal muscle, secretion of neurotransmitters and hormones, and the regulation of gene expression. Together with voltage-gated sodium channels ( NaV ), CaVs form a structurally related ion channel superfamily with a fourfold symmetry ( Figure 1A ). Their pore-forming α1 subunits are composed of four homologous but non-identical domains ( repeats I-IV ), each containing six transmembrane helices ( S1-S6 ). The S5 and S6 helices plus the connecting P loop of all four repeats form the central channel pore with the selectivity filter and the activation gate ( Catterall et al., 2020 ). Helices S1-S4 of each repeat form separate voltage sensing domains ( VSDs ). The S4 helix contains positively charged residues ( termed gating charges ) in every third position, and its movement across the electric field upon membrane depolarization is thought to initiate the conformational change resulting in channel opening ( Catterall et al., 2017 ). Several high-resolution structures of prokaryotic and eukaryotic NaV channels have been solved ( Lenaeus et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2018; Payandeh et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2012 ). Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy ( cryo-EM ) enabled the determination of the structure of the voltage-gated calcium channel CaV1. 1 at 3. 6 Å resolution, displaying a closed pore and the VSDs in the activated up-state ( Wu et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2015 ). Very recently, three cryo-EM structures of homo-tetrameric sodium channels experimentally locked in resting ( or VSD-down ) states have been reported ( Wisedchaisri et al., 2021; Wisedchaisri et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019 )

., 2019; Xu et al., 2019 ). However, up to now the resting states of eukaryotic CaV and NaV channels remained inaccessible to experimental structure determination. Nevertheless, many years of experimental work and structure modeling provide ample support for the sliding helix model of the voltage sensor action ( Catterall et al., 2017; Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2012 ). According to this model, the negative membrane potential at rest pulls the positively charged S4 helices down toward the cytoplasmic side of the membrane holding the channel gate closed. The reversal of the electric field upon membrane depolarization causes the outward displacement of the S4 helix by about 10 Å. The movement of two to three positive gating charges through the hydrophobic constriction site ( HCS ) in the center of the VSD is facilitated by the transient formation of ion-pair interactions with negative countercharges in the other helices of the VSD ( Catterall et al., 2017 ). While this model describes the principal mode of voltage sensor action, without further structure-function data, it does not explain how the four homologous but structurally distinct VSDs of eukaryotic channels cooperate in channel gating and how the unique gating properties of different channel isoforms are achieved. The distinct structure of the four VSDs of eukaryotic NaV and CaV suggests that there might be considerable variability between the four VSDs of a channel in the movement of the S4 helices and the molecular interactions of their gating charges. In fact, accumulating evidence indicates functional differences between the VSDs of individual channel isoforms ( Ahern et al., 2016; Pantazis et al., 2014; Tuluc et al., 2016a ). The rabbit skeletal muscle CaV1. 1 is the first member of the CaV family for which the structure has been solved ( Wu et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2019 )

Based on the cryo-EM structure of CaV1. 1 ( Wu et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2015 ), we generated a new structural model to study the molecular mechanisms determining the specific gating properties of this voltage-gated calcium channel. To this end, we used the Rosetta computational modeling software ( Bender et al., 2016; Rohl et al., 2004 ) to build a homology model of the human eukaryotic CaV1. 1 and included all missing loops and modeled both splice variants with and without exon 29 ( Tuluc et al., 2009 ). The resulting models were equilibrated and simulated at 300 K in the membrane environment to identify favorable side-chain orientations and to relax the protein. CaV1. 1 is a pseudo-tetrameric channel with a domain-swapped arrangement in which each VSD ( S1-S4 ) is positioned next to the pore domain ( S5-6 ) of the adjacent subunit ( Figure 1B ). We analyzed the structures of the activated and resting states of Ca1.1 VSD I and IV using molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulation and Markov state modeling ( MSM ) to determine the free energy states and kinetics of the transitions between the two states. The results showed that both VSD displayed the features of the sliding helix model ( Catter et al. 2017 ; Yarovarovoy et al. 2012 ) but differed in the formation of ionic bonds between the outer gating charges and countercharges of ENC in the resting and activated states. Stabilization of the activated state enhanced the voltage of activation, while stabilization of the resting slowed the kinetics. This mechanism provides a mechanistic explanation how ionair formation in VSD can realize the characteristic properties of voltage-gated cation channels.

    Title: Optimal level activity of matrix metalloproteinases is critical for adult visual plasticity in the healthy and stroke-affected brain
    Abstract: The ability of the adult brain to undergo plastic changes is of particular interest in medicine, especially regarding recovery from injuries or improving learning and cognition. Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) have been associated with juvenile experience-dependent primary visual cortex ( V1 ) plasticity, yet little is known about their role in this process in the adult V1. Activation of MMPs is a crucial step facilitating structural changes in a healthy brain; however, upon brain injury, upregulated MMPs promote the spread of a lesion and impair recovery. To clarify these seemingly opposing outcomes of MMP-activation, we examined the effects of MMP-inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stoke-affected adult mice. In healthy animals, 7-day application of MMP-inhibitor prevented visual plasticity. Additionally, treatment with MMP-inhibitor once but not twice following stroke rescued plasticity, normally lost under these conditions. Our data imply that an optimal level of MMP-activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity to occur.

    Supporting Text:
    The objective of this study was to examine if MMPs are crucial for adult visual plasticity, and if inhibition of their upregulation following cortical stroke may be beneficial for rescuing lost plasticity. A combination of in vivo optical imaging and behavioral vision tests revealed that an optimal level of MMP-activity is essential for adult visual plasticity to occur in the healthy and stroke-affected brain. In healthy adult mice, MMP-inhibition with GM6001 prevented both ocular dominance plasticity and experience-driven improvements of the optomotor reflex of the open eye after MD, indicating that MMP-activation is required for normal adult plasticity. In addition, blockade of elevated MMP-activity after a cortical stroke rescued compromised plasticity. Specifically, a single but not two-times treatment with GM6001 after a cortical PT-lesion in the neighboring S1 region fully rescued experience-dependent ocular dominance plasticity in adult V1, which is normally lost under these conditions. These observations suggest that MMP-activity has to be within a narrow window to allow visual plasticity: if MMP-activity is downregulated ( with inhibitors ) or upregulated ( after stroke ) experience-induced plastic changes are compromised. In a healthy brain, the enzymatic activity of MMPs has plasticity promoting effects ( Milward et al., 2007; Huntley, 2012 ). Consequently to increased neuronal activity, activated MMPs can lessen physical barriers ( loosen up the ECM ) or via the degradation of certain receptors influence signaling pathways. Such changes within neuronal cells and their synapses thereby alter the structure and activity of neuronal networks ( Milward et al., 2007; Huntley, 2012 ). Involvement of MMPs in synaptic circuit remodeling has been mainly studied in the hippocampus, yet, their abundant expression in the central nervous system ( CNS ) indicates a much broader function

. Thus, in contrast to the OD-plasticity results, rescue of optomotor improvements was present regardless of the duration of the treatment, adding to the idea that separate mechanisms and different neuronal circuits are responsible for OD- and interocular plasticity ( Greifzu et al., 2011; 2014; Kang et al., 2013 ). Together, our results establish a novel function of MMPs in experience-enabled enhancements of the optomotor reflex of the open eye after MD in adult mice. In conclusion, our present data highlight a critical role of MMPs in adult visual plasticity. They further suggest that upregulation of MMP-activity shortly after a cortical lesion compromises experience-induced visual plasticity, which in turn can be rescued by brief MMP-inhibition. Precise regulation of MMP-activity therefore seems to be essential for facilitating plasticity in the adult brain and offers new opportunities in treatment and recovery after stroke. It remains to be determined which particular MMPs account for the present results.

. This is in line with a recent observation, that a different broad-spectrum MMP-inhibitor ( FN-143 ) did not attenuate brain damage resulting from photothrombosis, but partially rescued barrel cortex plasticity ( Cybulska-Klosowicz et al., 2011 ). The present results, together with the above mentioned study, are not easy to reconcile with findings where MMP-inhibitors reduced the volume of a brain injury ( Gu et al., 2005; Wang and Tsirka, 2005; Vandenbroucke and Libert, 2014 ). The difference might arise from the method used for stroke induction, dosage of inhibitors, timing and duration of the treatment and severity of the lesion. Behavioral vision tests additionally revealed an involvement of MMPs for interocular plasticity during MD. The optomotor reflex is known to be mediated by subcortical pathways ( Giolli et al., 2006 ). While visual capabilities measured by optomotry mainly reflect the properties of the retinal ganglion cells that project to these subcortical structures ( Douglas et al., 2005 ), daily testing in the optomotor setup after MD induces a cortex-dependent and experience-enabled enhancement of spatial vision through the open eye ( Prusky et al., 2006 ). Although inflammation was shown to interfere with the experience-enabled optomotor changes ( Greifzu et al., 2011 ), little is known about the cellular origins or signaling pathways responsible for this plasticity paradigm. Here, we found that daily application of the MMP-inhibitor during MD prevented enhancements in both the spatial frequency and contrast sensitivity thresholds of the optomotor reflex of the open eye, while vehicle-treated control mice displayed the typical experience-enabled optomotor improvements. On the other hand, treatment of mice with the same inhibitor once or twice following cortical stroke rescued the impaired optomotor improvements

., 1996; Rosenberg, 2002; Agrawal et al., 2008 ). Excessive MMP-activity after stroke caused blood brain barrier disruption, upregulation of inflammatory mediators, excitotoxicity and eventually cell death ( Romanic et al., 1998; Lo et al., 2002; Gu et al., 2005; Wang and Tsirka, 2005; Yong, 2005; Morancho et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2014; Vandenbroucke and Libert, 2014 ). Recent studies reported increased enzymatic MMP9 activity within 24 h after a PT-stroke, and application of a broad spectrum MMP-inhibitor ( FN-439 ) applied at the time of stroke induction, partially rescued impaired barrel cortex plasticity ( Cybulska-Klosowicz et al., 2011; Liguz-Lecznar et al., 2012 ). Here we tested whether inhibition of upregulated MMP-activity ( resulting from PT-stroke ) may rescue cortical plasticity also when the treatment starts after lesion induction. Indeed, a single GM6001-treatment after PT in the neighboring S1 fully rescued plasticity in both of our experimental paradigms, OD- and interocular plasticity. Importantly, successful treatment did not have to start immediately after stroke induction ( 1 h ) because treatment 24 h after had the same beneficial effect, highlighting the therapeutic potential of brief MMP-inhibition for stroke recovery. Beneficial treatment was, however, dependent on the number of injections: a single but not two-times injection of the MMP-inhibitor rescued OD-plasticity. The reduced plasticity-promoting effect in V1 of mice treated twice with GM6001 is likely due to too excessive MMP-downregulation, which in turn interfered with MMP facilitation of MD-induced plasticity. Consistent with this interpretation, it was reported that a particular dosage, timing as well as duration of MMPs-inhibition mattered for reduciton of lesion sizes after intracerebral hemorrhage, blood brain barrier permability or neurovascular remodeling in post-stroke period ( Wang and Tsirka, 2005; Zhao et al

., 2006; Sood et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2014 ). Together with the results from healthy animals, our data suggest that the plasticity-promoting effects of MMPs are dependent on a well-balanced level of activation, and if that balance is disturbed, experience-induced plastic changes are compromised. There are several plausible mechanisms by which MMP-inhibition rescues OD-plasticity after stroke in S1. Stroke influences brain function in numerous ways e. g., causing inflammation and apoptosis, or disrupting the tightly regulated balance of neuronal inhibition and excitation ( Neumann-Haefelin et al., 1995; Schiene et al., 1996; Witte and Stoll, 1997; Que et al., 1999a; 1999b; Witte et al., 2000 ) also in perilesional areas ( Murphy and Corbett, 2009 ). One of the major consequences of ischemic damage is an elevated level of the neurotransmitter glutamate, leading to excitotoxicity and neuronal death ( Lai et al., 2014 ). On the other hand, stroke can lead to increased tonic inhibition in the peri-infarct zone, and reducing this inhibition can promote functional recovery ( Clarkson et al., 2010 ). In addition, focal ischemia can induce spreading depression within ipsilateral and contralateral areas, leading to loss of plasticity ( et al. 2014 ). Our results suggest that MMP-inhibition may counteract some of these negative effects by reducing excitotoxicity, inflammation and promoting plasticity in the peri-infar zone. In conclusion, our data highlight a critical role of MMPs in adult plasticity and suggest that upregulation of MMPactivity after stroke compromises plasticity, which can be rescued by brief MMP-inhibition. This is in line with a recent observation that a broad-spectrum MMP-inhib ( FN-143 ) did not attenuate brain damage from photothromosis but partially rescued barrel plastic (Cyuls-Kowicz et al,201 ). The results together with the above study are not easy to reconcile with findings where MMP-inhib reduced the volume of brain injury ( et al 2005; Wang Tsir 200; Vandenroucke Libert 2014 ) The difference may arise from the used stroke induction, dosage of inhibitors, timing and duration of treatment and severity of lesion. Behavioral tests revealed involvement of MMPs in inter plasticity during MD. The optotor is known to be mediated by subcort pathways ( et 2006 ) While capabilities measured by optot mainly reflect properties of retinal ganglion cells project to subort structures ( et 200 ) testing in optotor after MD induces cortex-dependent experience-enabled spatial vision through open ( 200 ) Although inflammation shown to interfere with experience opt changes (201 ) little known about cellular or signaling pathways responsible this paradigm Here we found application MMP-inhib during prevented enhancements both spatial and sensitivity thresholds optotor open eye while vehicle-treated mice displayed experience opt improvements On other hand treatment mice same once following stroke rescued impaired opt improvements

The final answer is: 
The study investigated the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in adult brain plasticity, specifically in healthy and stroke-affected mice. The results showed that an optimal level of MMP activity is crucial for visual plasticity to occur in both healthy and stroke-affected brains. In healthy mice, MMP-inhibition with GM600 prevented ocular plasticity and experience-driven improvements in the optotor reflex of the open eye, indicating MMPactivation is required for adult plastic. In contrast, blockade of elevated MMPactivity after cortical stroke rescued plastic, specifically a single but not twice treatment with GM1 after stroke in the neighboring S1 region fully rescued experience-dependent ocular plasticity in V1, which is lost under these conditions. The data suggest MMPactivity has to be within a narrow window to allow plasticity, if MMPactivity is downregulated (inhibitors) or upregulated after stroke-induced changes are compromised. The study highlights a novel function of MMPs in experience enhancements of the optotor reflex of the eye in adult mice and establishes a critical role of MMPs in adult plasticity, suggesting upregulation of MMPactivity after stroke compromises plasticity, which can be rescued by brief MMP-inhibition.

    Title: Auxiliary subunits keep AMPA receptors compact during activation and desensitization
    Abstract: Signal transduction at vertebrate excitatory synapses involves the rapid activation of AMPA ( α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate ) receptors, glutamate-gated ion channels whose four subunits assemble as a dimer-of-dimers. Technical advances in cryo-electron microscopy brought a slew of full-length structures of AMPA receptors, on their own and in combination with auxiliary subunits. These structures indicate that dimers might undergo substantial lateral motions during gating, opening up the extracellular layer along the central twofold symmetry axis. We used bifunctional methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers to calibrate the conformations found in functional AMPA receptors in the presence and absence of the auxiliary subunit Stargazin. Our data indicate that extracellular layer of AMPA receptors can get trapped in stable, opened-up conformations, especially upon long exposures to glutamate. In contrast, Stargazin limits this conformational flexibility. Thus, under synaptic conditions, where brief glutamate exposures and the presence of auxiliary proteins dominate, extracellular domains of AMPA receptors likely stay compact during gating.

    Supporting Text:
   . Trapping with bis-MTS cross-linkers so far indicated more conformational flexibility of the LBD layer in desensitized than activated AMPA receptors. However, synaptic AMPA receptors are rarely expressed alone and are instead associated with various auxiliary proteins that re-define their kinetic properties ( Schwenk et al., 2012; Jackson and Nicoll, 2011 ). We therefore wondered if the presence of auxiliary subunits, such as Stargazin ( Stg ), could affect conformational flexibility of AMPA receptors. Recently, cryo-EM structures of AMPA receptors in complex with auxiliary subunits have been acquired in resting, active and desensitized states ( Figure 1B ) ( Chen et al., 2017; Twomey et al., 2017a ). These structures all estimate reduced separation of V666C residues when compared to receptors without auxiliary proteins. For example, sulfhydryl groups of V666C residues on subunits A and C are 19 Å apart in the activated receptors without Stg and 15 Å in complex with Stg ( Figure 1C ). In the desensitized state, the equivalent residues are 21 Å apart in homologous kainate receptors ( PDB: 5KUF [Meyerson et al., 2016] ) and 17 Å in desensitized GluA2 receptors associated with GSG1L auxiliary proteins ( Figure 1C, PDB: 5VHZ [Twomey et al., 2017b] ). If auxiliary subunits keep the LBD layer more compact, we reasoned that their presence should also limit the effects of longer bis-MTS cross-linkers. For example, the longest cross-linker ( M10M ) could be expected to have less effect on the desensitized V666C receptors in the presence of Stg. To test this hypothesis, we repeated the trapping experiments on complexes of AMPA receptors with Stg ( Figure 6 ). GluA2 and Stg were co-expressed and association of complexes was assessed by measuring the ratio of kainate current over glutamate current ( KA/Glu )

. Furthermore, any large structural rearrangements of the extracellular domains would need to be accommodated by the crowded synaptic environment ( High et al., 2015; Tao et al., 2018 ) and potential presynaptic interaction partners ( Saglietti et al., 2007; Elegheert et al., 2016 ). When in complex with auxiliary subunits, no functional state of AMPA receptors necessitates large domain movements, and compact arrangements of the extracellular layer can sustain the gating process. We conclude that extracellular domains of synaptic AMPA receptors are unlikely to undergo large structural rearrangements during synaptic transmission and instead work in a fairly compact conformational regime, unless faced with long exposures to glutamate in pathological conditions.

AMPA-type glutamate receptors are found at excitatory synapses throughout the mammalian brain, where they convert glutamate release into membrane depolarization. Their fast kinetics ( Colquhoun et al., 1992; Geiger et al., 1995; Taschenberger and von Gersdorff, 2000 ), as well as the physical attributes of synapses ( Xu-Friedman and Regehr, 2003 ), allow them to follow glutamate transients at rates above 100 Hz. However, the structural dynamics underlying their rapid signaling are unclear. AMPA receptors are tetrameric ligand-gated ion channels. Ignoring their intracellular regions, they consist of three layers formed from distinct domains ( Figure 1A ). The two extracellular layers assemble from amino-terminal domains and ligand-binding domains, ATDs and LBDs, respectively. These adopt local dimer pairs in resting and active receptors. These dimers pack around a central twofold symmetry axis that switches into fourfold symmetry in the transmembrane ion channel layer. Although the ATD dimers associate with high affinity ( KD nM to μM ( Zhao et al., 2017 ), the association of ATD dimers into a tetramer as well as of LBDs into dimers and tetramers is too weak to measure. In case of the LBDs, this weak association has direct functional consequences, because the LBD intra-dimer interface ruptures upon desensitization ( Sun et al., 2002; Armstrong et al., 2006; Dürr et al., 2014; Twomey et al., 2017b ). The crowded and narrow synaptic cleft is scarcely wider than the receptors are tall themselves and has narrow edges ( Zuber et al., 2005; Tao et al., 2018 ). This observation suggests that conformational dynamics of the receptor domains and their relation to synapse dimensions has implications in both health and disease

Technical advances in cryo-electron microscopy have revolutionized the study of membrane proteins, and the supply of structural information is greater than ever before. However, as the catalogue of images swells, the need to relate their geometry to dynamics becomes more pressing. In case of AMPA receptors, full-length structures in complexes with various ligands and auxiliary subunits have been published. Here, we have used a classical crosslinking approach allied to rapid perfusion to measure distances up to 18 Å in AMPA receptor extracellular domains across different functional states and in the time domain. Bis-MTS cross-linkers have been used previously to aid identification of movements underlying state transitions in AMPA and NMDA receptors ( Armstrong et al., 2006; Tajima et al., 2016 ). Here, we report effects with a strong dependence on the target site, length of the cross-linker, functional state of the receptor and the presence or absence of auxiliary subunits. Since most bis-MTS cross-linkers are alkyl chains and hence flexible, they can cross-link pairs of Cys residues closer to each other than the extended length of the cross-linker. For example, M10M could cause the same effect when bound to two Cys that are 7 or 15 Å apart, acting as a universal inhibitor for a range of Cys distances. For this reason, we used bis-MTS ranging from 7 to 18 Å in length ( M1M – M10M ). Our results show an optimum ( inhibitory ) effect of the cross-linkers at position V666C, with M10M not producing as strong effect as shorter cross-linkers. This is inconsistent with the interpretation of the universal inhibitor and suggests bis-MTS cross-linkers exert their effect mainly by preventing the engineered residues from separating more than the extended length of the cross-linker. We also tested a rigid cross-linker, bMTSp, whose length matches closely that of flexible M6M ( 12 and 13 Å, respectively )

. For example, if the extracellular layer of AMPA receptors can undergo large conformational changes rapidly, that is on the millisecond timescale of fast excitatory transmission, this could disrupt possible interactions of the extracellular domains with the pre- and postsynaptic anchoring proteins ( Elegheert et al., 2016 ). Activity-dependent anchoring might be a way to regulate synaptic strength ( Constals et al., 2015 ). On the other hand, slow rearrangements could be relevant for trafficking, and in disease states. Advances in the structural biology of ionotropic glutamate receptors ( iGluRs ) have produced a catalogue of static conformational snapshots. Several agonist-bound structures ( Nakagawa et al., 2005; Dürr et al., 2014; Meyerson et al., 2014 ) suggest that local dimers in the ATD and LBD layer move apart from each other substantially. This movement away from the central twofold symmetry axis results in an ‘open’ extracellular layer, with the tops of the ATD and LBD dimers splaying wide open ( desensitized structure in Figure 1A ). The timescale of this broad lateral movement is unknown, because the structural experiments necessarily took place over seconds to minutes. In contrast, desitized structures with auxiliary subunits ( Chen et al,2017; Twy et al,2017a ) show reduced separation of the AT and LBD dimers, indicating a more compact extracellular layer ( Figure 1B ). We hypothesized that auxiliary subunits limit conformational flexibility of the extracellular layer. To test this, we used bifunctional methaniosulfate cross-linkers to calibrate the conformation of AMP receptors in the presence and absence of the auxiliary sub Stargin. Our data indicate that extracellular of AMP receptors can get trapped in stable, opened conformation, especially long exposures glutamate. In contrast, Starg limits this conformation flexibility. Thus, under synaptic conditions where glutamate and presence auxiliary dominate, extracellular of AMP receptors likely stay compact during gating.

    Title: High-dimensional analysis of intestinal immune cells during helminth infection
    Abstract: Single cell isolation from helminth-infected murine intestines has been notoriously difficult, due to the strong anti-parasite type 2 immune responses that drive mucus production, tissue remodeling and immune cell infiltration. Through the systematic optimization of a standard intestinal digestion protocol, we were able to successfully isolate millions of immune cells from the heavily infected duodenum. To validate that these cells gave an accurate representation of intestinal immune responses, we analyzed them using a high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry panel and confirmed our findings by confocal microscopy. Our cell isolation protocol and high-dimensional analysis allowed us to identify many known hallmarks of anti-parasite immune responses throughout the entire course of helminth infection and has the potential to accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helminth immune responses that have previously been unfeasible.

    Supporting Text:
   . While the RIN numbers might not have been correctly calculated, and a technical optimization of the TapeStation protocol might be necessary, no RNA degradation was observed in naïve and day 14 hr. polygyrus samples, suggesting that the extraction of high-quality RNA is feasible from both naïve and day 14 hr. polygyrus-infected mice using our cell isolation protocol. Thus, our cell isolation protocol and high-dimensional analysis allowed us to characterize many known hallmarks of innate and adaptive anti-parasite immune responses throughout the entire course of helminth infection. We were able to validate these changes using confocal microscopy and while we could observe differences in the reported cell ratios, changes between naïve and infected samples were faithfully reported by both approaches. Importantly, many of these changes were only observed locally, highlighting the requirement for good cell isolation techniques to investigate intestinal responses against helminths directly. In addition to flow cytometric immunophenotyping, we were also able to extract high-quality RNA from cells isolated with our protocol, which could accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helminth immune responses through current single-cell analysis tools, such as single cell RNA sequencing, which has previously been unfeasible.

. While this method results in a high cell yield from steady state intestines, the isolation of cells from severely infected segments remains challenging ( Reißig et al., 2014; Scott et al., 2016; Webster et al., 2020 ) ( Figure 1b ). One of the most prominent examples are infections with intestinal helminths, which represent over 50% of all parasitic infections in human and livestock populations ( McSorley and Maizels, 2012; Hotez et al., 2008; Jourdan et al., 2018; Jackson et al., 2009 ). This has limited our analysis of anti-parasite immune responses to imaging approaches, phenotypical observations in transgenic mouse strains or the assessment of secondary locations like the draining lymph nodes, blood or spleen ( McSorley and Maizels, 2012; Maizels and McSorley, 2016; Mishra et al., 2014 ), which might only partially reflect local immunity. As helminth infections are strongly linked to chronic impairments that affect nutrition availability ( Koski and Scott, 2001; Crompton and Nesheim, 2002 ) ; memory, cognition and physical development ( Ezeamama et al., 2005; Pabalan et al., 2018; Nokes et al., 1992 ) ; changes in the microbiota ( Gause and Maizels, 2016; Ramanan et al., 2016 ) and modulation of local and systemic immunity ( Mishra et al., 2014; Maizels et al., 2009 ), an optimized digestion protocol is needed to further investigate the infected intestinal tissue.

Difficulties with intestinal digests during helminth infection have been associated with a strong anti-parasite type 2 immune response that drives mucus production ( Hashimoto et al., 2009; von Moltke et al., 2016 ), alters the epithelium ( Gerbe et al., 2016; Howitt et al., 2016 ), induces immune cell infiltration ( Inclan-Rico and Siracusa, 2018 ) and causes tissue remodelling ( Motran et al., 2018; Boyett and Hsieh, 2014 ) ( Figure 1c ). In order to investigate a model of both acute and chronic helminth infection, we infected C57BL/6 mice with Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri ( also known as Heligmosomoides bakeri; Behnke and Harris, 2010 ), a naturally occurring rodent parasite with an exclusive intestinal life cycle ( Monroy and Enriquez, 1992; Reynolds et al., 2012 ). Infective L3 larvae penetrate the intestinal tissue of the duodenum within 24 hr of ingestion, undergo larval development in the muscularis externa and return to the lumen within 10 days post infection, where the adult worms mate and develop a chronic infection in C57BL/6 mice ( Reynolds et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2016 ). The peak of acute immunity is usually studied around day 14 post infection and we focused on this time point and the heavily infected duodenum ( Filbey et al., 2014; Elliott et al., 2008 ), to optimize our digestion protocol. In order to develop a digestion protocol for heavily infected intestines, we followed a systematic approach and optimized each step of the standard intestinal digestion protocol. First, we modified the EDTA wash steps to remove the increased amount of mucus but did not observe an improvement in cell yield ( Figure 1d and Figure 1—figure supplement 1; digestion protocols #1, 2, 6 )

Recent advances in single cell analysis have significantly increased our understanding of multiple diseases and cell types in different tissues ( Svensson et al., 2018; Hwang et al., 2018 ). However, many of these technologies require single cell suspensions as an input, which limits our assessment of difficult-to-process tissues ( Hwang et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018 ). One prominent example is the intestine, which is at the center of many research questions that focus on nutrient uptake ( Kiela and Ghishan, 2016 ), host-microbiome interactions ( Belkaid and Hand, 2014; Tilg et al., 2019; Sekirov et al., 2010 ), local and systemic immune tolerance ( Worbs et al., 2006; Harrison and Powrie, 2013; Whibley et al., 2019 ) and gastrointestinal diseases and infections ( Mowat and Agace, 2014; Sell and Dolan, 2018; Fletcher et al., 2013; Hendrickson et al., 2002; Saleh and Elson, 2011 ), but represents a challenging tissue to digest ( Weigmann et al., 2007; Reißig et al., 2014 ). The standard digestion procedure to isolate intestinal immune cells located in the small intestinal lamina propria consists of three steps ( Weigmann et al., 2007; Reißig et al., 2014; Scott et al., 2016; Esterházy et al., 2019 ) ( Figure 1a ). First the intestinal segment of interest is collected, opened longitudinally to remove its luminal content, washed and cut into small pieces. These pieces then undergo several wash steps with EDTA containing wash buffers at 37°C to remove the epithelial layer and make the lamina propria accessible for enzymatic digestion. Lastly, the tissue is enzymatically digested with collagenases ( Collagenase VIII from Clostridium histolyticum being among the most popular ) and later filtered to obtain a single cell suspension

. Our optimized lamina propria cell isolation protocol for H. polygyrus-infected intestines thus included three 10 min 2 mM EDTA wash steps ( each followed by vigorous vortexing ) and a 30 min digest with 1 mg/ml Collagenase A, 20% FCS and 0. 05 mg/ml DNase ( see Appendix 1 for step-by-step instructions ). When we compared intestinal digests from naïve animals using the standard or optimized cell isolation protocol, we observed highly comparable outcomes ( Figure 1d; digestion protocols #1 and 13 ). Both digestion protocols resulted in a cell yield of 3–6 million live cells per duodenum with 70–80% viability and 20–30% frequency of CD45+ cells. To assess the effectiveness of our digestion protocol during the different stages of H. polygyrus infection, we harvested the duodenum from naïve C57BL/6 mice and at day 7, day 14 and day 28 of H. polygyrus infection, which represented time points of larval development in the muscularis externa, as well as acute and chronic adult worm infection, respectively. We observed that samples from all time points could be successfully digested using our optimized digestion protocol ( Figure 1e ) and compared to the standard protocol ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1; digestion # 1, 2, 6 ), with comparable cell yield and viability ( Figure 1f ) and frequency of CD45+ cells ( Figure 1g ). To validate the accuracy of our cell suspensions, we analyzed them using high-dimensional flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Flow cytometry allowed us to identify known hallmarks of anti-parite immune responses throughout the course of H. polyrus infection ( Figure 2 ), such as the increase in CD4+ and CD8 T cells, neutrophils, eosinophils and macrophages at day 7 and 14 post infection ( Figure 2a–d ). Confocal microscopy confirmed these changes in the lamina propria ( Figure 2e–h ) and observed differences in cell ratios between naïve and infected samples ( Figure 2i ). Importantly, many of these changes were only observed locally, highlighting the requirement for good cell techniques to investigate intestinal responses against helths directly. In addition to flow cytometric immunophenotyping, we were able to extract high-quality RNA from isolated cells with our protocol, which could accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helth immune through current tools, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, which previously unfeasible.

    Title: Quantitative time-resolved analysis reveals intricate, differential regulation of standard- and immuno-proteasomes
    Abstract: Proteasomal protein degradation is a key determinant of protein half-life and hence of cellular processes ranging from basic metabolism to a host of immunological processes. Despite its importance the mechanisms regulating proteasome activity are only incompletely understood. Here we use an iterative and tightly integrated experimental and modelling approach to develop, explore and validate mechanistic models of proteasomal peptide-hydrolysis dynamics. The 20S proteasome is a dynamic enzyme and its activity varies over time because of interactions between substrates and products and the proteolytic and regulatory sites; the locations of these sites and the interactions between them are predicted by the model, and experimentally supported. The analysis suggests that the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is the transport of the substrates into the proteasome. The transport efficiency varies between human standard- and immuno-proteasomes thereby impinging upon total degradation rate and substrate cleavage-site usage.

    Using tightly integrated experimental and computational modelling analyses, recent advances in our understanding of proteasome structure and function, and previous attempts at modelling proteasome dynamics ( Liepe et al., 2014a ), we elaborate the first comprehensive mathematical model that is able to describe the regulatory components of 20S proteasomes; and the complex interactions between substrate/product transport and substrate hydrolysis over time for representative peptides. Modelling helps us to understand how the 20S proteasome catalyzes the degradation of specific proteins in cells ( Pickering and Davies, 2012; Ben-Nissan and Sharon, 2014; Höhn and Grune, 2014; Fabre et al., 2015 ) ; it also forms the basis for future studies of the main active forms of proteasome in cells, for example, when it is bound to the regulatory complexes 19S and PA28 ( Fabre et al., 2015 ). Indeed, in 19S or PA28 single-capped proteasomes all steps considered in our model are still present, including the regulation of the gate by non-catalytic modifier site ( s ) and the gate binding affinity since one of the proteasome gates is not bound to the regulatory complexes and will therefore be regulated as described here. We observe similar proteasome dynamics over time when using purified 20S proteasome as well as protein homogenates, where 20S proteasomes are surrounded by several regulatory molecules. It suggests that with the present model we describe a core of proteasome features that could reflect proteasome dynamics also in more complex scenarios such as might exist inside the cellular environment. Our model therefore also provides an interpretative framework for general studies of proteasome action, keeping in mind that substrate-specific effects need to be accounted for ( Mishto et al., 2014 ). Simple ( e. g

., 2014 ). Simple ( e. g., MM-type ) models, which have been largely used in analysing proteasome functionality so far, are clearly not capable of describing proteasome dynamics; this is becoming apparent since time-course data is much less forgiving and harder to fit to than for example, dose-response curves. The 20S proteasome is a dynamic enzyme and its catalytic activity varies over time in a way that can only be understood if the structural characteristics of the proteasome are taken into account. Kinetics change over longer time scales than the structural dynamics described by Osmulski et al. ( 2009 ) and they are influenced by the interactions of substrates and products with both proteolytic and regulatory sites. Our analysis suggests that the cavity of 20S proteasomes is progressively filled by peptides that can further facilitate other molecules to enter the chambers until the effective cavity volume has been almost completely filled. In fact, the estimated numbers of substrate and product molecules ( C ) that are inside the proteasome cavity are close to the possible maxima ( Box 2 ). Peptide accumulation over time leads to activation of non-catalytic modifier sites, which our analysis shows to be located inside the proteasome cavity. 10. 7554/eLife. 07545. 025Box 2. Filling kinetics of the proteasome inner cavity over time. A key part of the peptide transport dynamics is the maximum capacity ( C ) of the two proteasome ante-chambers and the main chamber. C describes the maximal number of molecules of a given substrate can be allocated inside the proteasome chamber at the same time. C is dependent on the volume of the proteasome chamber and on the volume of the substrate molecules. For this reason C is expected to be substrate specific. The model estimates of C for the three tested substrates are in agreement with values predicted by computing the maximal number of substrates that could be located inside the proteasome chamber

., 2013; Bellavista et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, i-proteasome deficient mice show altered proteasome-dependent kinetics of pathogen epitope generation ( Basler et al., 2013 ). Such different kinetics could, for example, lead to the remodelling of immunodominance of viral epitopes ( Zanker et al., 2013 ) or to the lack of CD8+ T cell-mediated response towards specific viral antigens ( Deol et al., 2007 ). As we will show below, our framework allows us to start from simple models of proteasome function, and identify which mechanistic shortcomings they exhibit. We focus on the dynamics of the digestion of a set of exemplar peptides, and show that this process is regulated carefully and by three distinct mechanisms, that act in concert to regulate proteasomal activity. Here considering different mechanisms, coupled to state-of-the art statistical model selection techniques ( Kirk et al., 2013 ), allows us to elucidate steps in the proteasomal dynamics that cannot be probed directly through experiments. Model selection naturally extends the conventional hypothesis testing approach, and by accounting for uncertainty fairly and correctly, can be applied to systems with many unknown kinetic parameters ( which are, in any case, inferred together with their respective uncertainties ) ( Liepe et al., 2013; Babtie et al., 2014 ).

., 2009; Ruschak and Kay, 2012 ), binding of regulatory complexes such as 11S or 19S to the proteasome α rings ( leading to the formation of PA28-capped proteasomes and 26S proteasomes, respectively ) ( Dick et al., 1996; Emmerich et al., 2000; Köhler et al., 2001; Ruschak and Kay, 2012; Raule et al., 2014 ), and activation of non-catalytic modifier sites ( Schmidtke et al., 2000; Kisselev et al., 2002, 2003 ) whose location in the proteasome remain unknown ( Liepe et al., 2014a ). In mammals different 20S proteasome isoforms exist, which carry different catalytic β subunits. Upon an inflammatory stimulus such as IFN-γ the catalytic standard β1, β2 and β5 subunits peculiar of the standard proteasome ( s-proteasome ) are replaced by the immuno-subunits β1i, β2i and β5i in the newly synthesized immunoproteasome ( i-proteasome ). Proteasome isoforms degrade substrates with different rates, but generate the same peptide pool ( Mishto et al., 2014 ). And while there exist differences between substrates, the 20S i-proteasome has been shown often to have a higher polypeptide degradation rate than its standard counterpart ( Bellavista et al., 2013 ). Why s- or i-proteasomes should degrade specific substrates more rapidly is a matter of ongoing debate. Different steps of the proteolysis process may be responsible for isoform specific kinetics: transport of the substrate through the gate and the antechambers; binding to substrate binding sites and ensuing peptide-bond hydrolysis ( Huber et al., 2012; Arciniega et al., 2014 ) ; and the release from the substrate binding sites and finally from the proteasome gate. The question is also of direct medical relevance: different degradation kinetics of specific substrates by s- and i-proteasomes, or i-proteasome carrying genetic polymorphisms/mutations, have been suggested to be involved in a variety of pathologies ( Basler et al., 2013; Bellavista et al., 2013 )

. Proteins, and especially oxidised proteins—that is, those that reflect the presence of cellular stress conditions—can also be degraded by 20S proteasomes without prior poly-ubiquitination ( Aiken et al., 2011; Pickering and Davies, 2012; Ben-Nissan and Sharon, 2014; Höhn and Grune, 2014 ). In addition to stress response, the 20S proteasomes present in cells ( Fabre et al., 2015 ) have been shown to regulate the abundance of a host of signalling molecules involved in cell cycle progression, cellular growth control, differentiation, and survival ( Fabre et al, 2015 ). The 20 proteasome is also involved in the regulation of the cell cycle by degrading cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases ( Fab et al. 2015 ) and in the regulation of apoptosis by degrading pro-apoptotic proteins ( Fab et al 2015 ). The 20S proteome is also involved in the regulation of the cell cycle by degrading cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases ( Fab et al 201 ) and the regulation of apoptosis by degrading pro-apopt proteins ( et al 201 ) The 20 proteome is involved in the regulation of the cell by degrading cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases ( Fab et 201 ) and the regulation of apoptosis by degrading pro-apopt proteins ( et 201 ) The 20 proteome is involved in the regulation of cell by degrading cyclins cyclin-dependent kinases ( et 201 ) and regulation of apoptosis degrading pro-apopt proteins ( 201 ) The 20 proteome is involved in regulation of cell by degrading cyclin-dependent kinases (201 ) and regulation apoptosis degrading pro-apopt (201 ) The 20 proteome is involved in regulation cell degrading cyclin-dependent (201 ) and apoptosis degrading-apopt (201 ) The 20 proteome is involved regulation degrading cyclin-dependent (201 and apoptosis degrading (201 ) The 20 proteome is involved degrading cyclin-dependent ( and apoptosis (201 The 20 proteome is degrading cyclin ( and apoptosis ( The 20 prote is degrading ( and apoptosis The prote is degrading ( and apoptosis The is degrading ( and apoptosis is degrading The degrading and apoptosis degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading degrading de

    Title: The β-alanine transporter BalaT is required for visual neurotransmission in Drosophila
    Abstract: The recycling of neurotransmitters is essential for sustained synaptic transmission. In Drosophila, histamine recycling is required for visual synaptic transmission. Synaptic histamine is rapidly taken up by laminar glia, and is converted to carcinine. After delivered back to photoreceptors, carcinine is hydrolyzed to release histamine and β-alanine. This histamine is repackaged into synaptic vesicles, but it is unclear how the β-alanine is returned to the laminar glial cells. Here, we identified a new β-alanine transporter, which we named BalaT ( Beta-alanine Transporter ). Null balat mutants exhibited lower levels of β-alanine, as well as less β-alanine accumulation in the retina. Moreover, BalaT is expressed and required in retinal pigment cells for maintaining visual synaptic transmission and phototaxis behavior. These results provide the first genetic evidence that retinal pigment cells play a critical role in visual neurotransmission, and suggest that a BalaT-dependent β-alanine trafficking pathway is required for histamine homeostasis and visual neurotransmission.

   ., 2012; Pfister et al., 2011 ). There is evidence that several members of the SLC family of proteins that can transportβ-alanine are present in the retina, including taurine transporter ( Slc6a6/TauT ) ( Liu et al., 1993 ). This suggests a conserved function for β-alanine trafficking in mammals and Drosophila. Our current work, together with previous reports, provides evidence for the formulation of a more complete histamine recycling pathway, which is critical for sustaining photoreceptor synaptic transmission ( Figure 6 ). In this pathway, carcinine is synthesized in epithelial glial cells within the optic lamina, and is transported back to photoreceptor cells via the synaptic cleft. Once in the photoreceptor cells it is hydrolyzed into histamine and β-alanine by Tan, and histamine is used as neurotransmitter. Meanwhile, β-alanine is released via an unknown mechanism, and is subsequently delivered to and stored within pigment cells by BalaT. Finally, β-alanine is transported back to epithelial glia through the network of retinal pigment cells and laminar glia for histamine inactivation and carcinine synthesis. 10. 7554/eLife. 29146. 024Figure 6. A model of the histamine recycling pathway. Histamine is initially synthesized by histidine decarboxylase ( Hdc ) in photoreceptor cells ( PR ). Upon light stimulation, PRs release histamine into the synaptic cleft. Released histamine is quickly taken up by an unknown histamine transporter into epithelial glial cells that express Ebony. In these glia, histamine is conjugated to β-alanine, which inactivates histamine and generates carcinine. Carcinine is released into the synaptic cleft and subsequently internalized, via CarT, by the PRs

Histamine is the primary neurotransmitter released by photoreceptors in flies, and the synthesis of histamine can occur de novo by photoreceptor cell-specific histidine decarboxylase ( Burg et al., 1993; Hardie, 1987 ). However, during light stimulation, flies depend primarily on histamine recycling to sustain tonic visual transmission. Histamine is inactivated when Ebony catalyzes its conjugation to β-alanine in laminar glial cells ( Borycz et al., 2002; Richardt et al., 2002 ). In photoreceptors, CarT and Tan are involved in transporting carcinine and regenerating histamine, respectively ( Chaturvedi et al., 2016; Stenesen et al., 2015; Wagner et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2015 ). Histamine is then loaded into synaptic vesicles, but fate of the β-alanine generated by Tan remains unknown. Here, we identify a new β-alanine transporter, BalaT, and provide evidence that BalaT is required for visual transmission. BalaT is a plasma membrane protein, and is sufficient to facilitate β-alanine uptake in cultured cells. BalaT is expressed predominantly by retinal pigment cells, and the specific expression of BalaT in these cells rescues photoreceptor synaptic transmission in balat1 mutant flies. The reduced levels and altered distribution of β-alanine in the heads of balat1 mutants support the hypothesis that BalaT functions to transport β-alanine. Therefore, we suggest that a novel β-alanine transporter, BalaT, functions in retinal pigment cells to help recycle β-alanine. Disrupting the synthesis of histamine and carcinine abolishes photoreceptor synaptic transmission ( Borycz et al., 2002; Burg et al., 1993 ). The transport of β-alanine seems less important, as it is present at higher concentrations in Drosophila. Two common metabolic pathways have been shown to synthesize β-alanine: ( 1 ) aspartate decarboxylase, encoded by the black gene ( Hodgetts, 1972; Phillips et al

. In addition, establishing and maintaining a β-alanine pool play key roles in sustaining visual synaptic transmission. The majority of pigment granules, which reduce the intensity of light exposure, are formed in retinal pigment cells of the Drosophila compound eye. Recently, it has been demonstrated that retinal pigment cells are functionally equivalent to cells within the mammalian retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ), in terms of chromophore cycling ( Travis et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2010, 2012 ). Just like chromophore ( a subunit of rhodopsin ) is sent back to pigment cells for regeneration, it has been suggested that the metabolism of β-alanine involves pigment cells ( Borycz et al., 2012 ). Several observations indicate that BalaT functions in retina pigment cells to help regenerate histamine. Most notably, BalaT is expressed in pigment cells and visual transmission is rescued in balat mutants by the expression of wild-type BalaT in pigment cells, but not photoreceptor neurons. Our work provides strong genetic evidence for the involvement of retinal pigment cells in histamine recycling, and suggests that BalaT is the key player responsible for the transport of β-alanine into pigment cell. It has been suggested that the transportation of histamine metabolites within the Drosophila visual system is mediated by a network of retinal pigment cells and laminar glia that are interconnected by gap junctions, and that this transport network is essential for fly vision ( Chaturvedi et al., 2014 ). However, histaminergic photoreceptor cells directly acquire carcinine from synaptic terminals within the optic lamina through a CarT-dependent trafficking pathway ( Xu et al., 2015 ). Here we provided evidence that the intercellular gap junctions between retinal pigment cells and laminar glial cells are involved in trafficking β-alanine, another histamine metabolite

In Drosophila photoreceptors, carcinine is hydrolyzed to form histamine and β-alanine ( True et al., 2005; Wagner et al., 2007 ). Histamine is then released as a neurotransmitter, taken up by laminar glial cells, and then conjugated with β-alanine to form carcinine. Although it is known that CarT transports carcinine into photoreceptors, it is unclear how β-alanine is delivered to laminar glia. To begin to understand this process, we sought to identify a β-alanine transporter in the fly visual system. We speculated that a transporter responsible for β-alanine uptake would likely be enriched in fly heads, so we examined previous RNA-seq data comparing mRNAs isolated from the head with mRNAs isolated from the body ( Xu and Wang, 2016 ). Among ~600 putative transmembrane transporters encoded by the Drosophila genome, we identified 20 head-enriched genes ( Table 1 ) that represented potential β-alanine transporters ( Figure 1A ). 10. 7554/eLife. 29146. 003Figure 1.

    Title: Time line of redox events in aging postmitotic cells
    Abstract: The precise roles that oxidants play in lifespan and aging are still unknown. Here, we report the discovery that chronologically aging yeast cells undergo a sudden redox collapse, which affects over 80% of identified thiol-containing proteins. We present evidence that this redox collapse is not triggered by an increase in endogenous oxidants as would have been postulated by the free radical theory of aging. Instead it appears to be instigated by a substantial drop in cellular NADPH, which normally provides the electron source for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. This decrease in NADPH levels occurs very early during lifespan and sets into motion a cascade that is predicted to down-regulate most cellular processes. Caloric restriction, a near-universal lifespan extending measure, increases NADPH levels and delays each facet of the cascade. Our studies reveal a time line of events leading up to the system-wide oxidation of the proteome days before cell death.

    In this study, we used a quantitative redox proteomic approach combined with metabolic measurements to assess a time line of physiological redox events that occur in aging non-dividing cells, using chronologically aging S. cerevisiae as a model system. We made the very surprising observation that early during the chronological aging process and significantly before cell death sets in, yeast cells undergo an abrupt loss in redox homeostasis as indicated by the massive oxidation of the large majority of thiol-containing cytosolic, nuclear, and mitochondrial proteins. Importantly, this oxidation event is significantly delayed by caloric restriction and even more so by a shift to hypometabolic cultivation conditions, suggesting that maintenance of redox homeostasis might contribute to the lifespan extending effects of these regimens. To begin to understand what physiological event ( s ) trigger the observed redox collapse, we compared the kinetics of oxidation in almost 300 different protein thiols. We noted that thiol oxidation occurs in at least two waves. The first wave, which affects only a very small subset of identified thiol-containing proteins ( <10% ), hit cells cultivated in standard media within 24–48 hr after reaching exponential growth. At this point, cells had stopped dividing ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ), transitioned to respiratory growth, and NADPH levels, which transiently increased during the diauxic shift, had started to decrease significantly ( Figure 6B ). The second wave of oxidation, which occurred about 24 hr later, affected nearly 70% of the remaining identified yeast protein thiols ( Figure 2 ). Yet as observed before, yeast cells were able to maintain their energy resources ( i. e., ATP levels ) and to survive for several more days after the collapse. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that many of the very early oxidation targets are cysteines that form part of a C-X2/3-C motif ( e. g

., 2008 ). We recently used OxICAT in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to quantify the steady-state oxidation status of almost 400 different yeast protein thiols and identify those proteins that contain peroxide and redox-sensitive cysteines ( Brandes et al., 2011 ). We then reasoned that by monitoring the exact oxidation status of these proteins during the chronological lifespan of yeast, we will obtain a spatial and temporal read-out of the prevailing oxidation conditions during the aging process. We should also be able to uncover protein targets whose oxidative thiol modifications might contribute to the physiological alterations that are observed in aging organisms and might even be able to establish a clear correlation between onset and extent of oxidative stress and lifespan. The chronological lifespan of S. cerevisiae represents a popular model system for analyzing aging in postmitotic cells. Chronological lifespan is defined as the length of time that non-dividing cells remain viable in a high metabolic state ( Fabrizio and Longo, 2007; Fontana et al., 2010 ). In support of the free radical theory of aging, chronological lifespan decreases in yeast strains lacking the oxidant scavenging enzymes superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) or catalase ( Longo et al., 1996 ) and increases when glutathione or SOD levels are elevated ( Harris et al., 2003 ). Also, caloric restriction, a nearly universal measure to extend lifespan, has been shown to significantly increase chronological lifespan in yeast ( Fontana et al., 2010 ). Although the molecular mechanism by which caloric restriction extends lifespan has not been elucidated, one unifying trait among calorically restricted organisms is a significantly increased oxidative stress resistance ( Barja, 2002 ). In this study, we used chronologically aging S. cerevisiae to determine the onset, extent, and targets of protein oxidation in postmitotic aging cells

. By monitoring the thiol oxidation status of almost 300 different protein thiols, we discovered that yeast cells undergo a global redox collapse that leads to massive thiol oxidation in almost 80% of identified proteins several days prior to cell death. Cluster analysis revealed that this general protein oxidation is preceded by the oxidation of a subset of conserved proteins, one of which is NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase, a key enzyme in maintaining redox homeostasis. Redox metabolite and NADPH studies suggested that protein oxidation is triggered by a decrease in cellular NADPH concentration. Consistent with this hypothesis, caloric restriction delayed NADPH decrease, early protein oxidation, global redox collapse, and cell death. Our results suggest that the decrease in cellular NADPH levels initiates oxidation of the cellular redox machinery and triggers system-wide oxidation events, which significantly precede cell death.

The graphs shown provide a comparative assessment of cell viability ( based on data shown in Figure 1A ), ATP levels ( Figure 2B ), NADPH levels ( Figure 6B ), EGSH measurements ( Figure 6A ), and thiol oxidation states of representative early ( i. e., PYC2 ) and general targets ( e. g., GapDH/TDH ) ( Table 1 ) during the chronological lifespan of yeast strain DBY746 under standard and caloric restriction conditions. A colored scale for each assessed parameter is provided. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 00306. 014 It was intriguing to observe that early protein oxidation is, at least in its initial stage, a fully reversible event in yeast. Moreover, we found that more than 80% of viable cells were recovered from day 3- and day 4-old cultures despite an almost fully oxidized thiol proteome. It has been suggested that oxidative thiol modifications, such as those detected by our OxICAT method, might serve a beneficial purpose for cells by preventing irreversible thiol modifications that would ultimately lead to protein degradation and potentially cell death ( Gallogly and Mieyal, 2007 ). It is thus tempting to speculate that the initially reversible thiol modifications that we observe in chronologically aging yeast cells might in fact represent a ‘pro-active’ response of yeast cells to protect their proteins against irreversible protein modifications and damage, and thereby extend lifespan. Quantitative studies conducted in diamide-treated HeLa and HEK cells revealed that over 50% of protein thiols undergo reversible thiol modifications in response to diamide stress, providing evidence that the combined redox proteome of mammalian cells has a higher redox buffering capacity than glutathione ( Hansen et al., 2009 )

., 2012 ). The high degree of overlap between our identifications and the list of previously identified redox-sensitive proteins in eukaryotes makes us confident about the specificity of our method. Our finding that over 80% of an unbiased population of thiol-containing yeast proteins have the capacity to become significantly oxidized under physiologically relevant growth conditions ( Figure 1—Source data 1 ) suggests that reversible cysteine oxidation, such as that detected with our OxICAT method, is a much more widespread event than previously anticipated. Despite the limited supply of nutrients in the stationary phase, oxygen consumption measurements indicate that chronologically aging yeast cells are metabolically active in this phase ( Fabrizio et al., 2003; Fabrizio and Longo, 2003 ). Consistent with earlier ATP measurements conducted in chronologically aging yeast cells ( Goldberg et al., 2009 ), we found that intracellular ATP is indeed maintained at levels equivalent to or above those present during exponential growth for up to 5 days when cultivated under standard postmitotic growth conditions and for at least 7 days under caloric restriction conditions ( Figure 2B ). These results demonstrate that chronologically aging yeast cells are not starving and are able to maintain their energy resources and survive for extended periods of times despite ( or possibly even because of ) a heavily oxidized proteome. Analysis of the kinetics of protein thiol oxidation revealed that the majority of protein thiols in yeast follow the trend observed for GapDH oxidation: the thiol oxidation state is low for the initial 2 days of cultivation then suddenly increases by day 3 in standard media or by day 5 in caloric restriction media. In addition, however, we noticed several protein thiols whose oxidation appeared to precede that of GapDH ( e. g., PY2 ) and others whose oxidation occurred later ( e. g.,DH ). This indicates that the oxidation of thiol is not a single event, but rather a series of events that occur during the lifespan of chronologically aging yeast.

    Title: Mechanism of chiral proofreading during translation of the genetic code
    Abstract: The biological macromolecular world is homochiral and effective enforcement and perpetuation of this homochirality is essential for cell survival. In this study, we present the mechanistic basis of a configuration-specific enzyme that selectively removes D-amino acids erroneously coupled to tRNAs. The crystal structure of dimeric D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase ( DTD ) from Plasmodium falciparum in complex with a substrate-mimicking analog shows how it uses an invariant ‘cross-subunit’ Gly-cisPro dipeptide to capture the chiral centre of incoming D-aminoacyl-tRNA. While no protein residues are directly involved in catalysis, the unique side chain-independent mode of substrate recognition provides a clear explanation for DTD’s ability to act on multiple D-amino acids. The strict chiral specificity elegantly explains how the enriched cellular pool of L-aminoacyl-tRNAs escapes this proofreading step. The study thus provides insights into a fundamental enantioselection process and elucidates a chiral enforcement mechanism with a crucial role in preventing D-amino acid infiltration during the evolution of translational apparatus.

   . Since the cellular milieu will be in abundance with L-aa-tRNAs, when compared to D-aa-tRNAs, such a positioning of the critical enantioselective components, as seen here, prevents even a promiscuous deacylation of L-aa-tRNAs leading to their depletion from the pool, as shown by the biochemical studies with 1000-fold excess of DTD in two different systems. The essential role of Gly-cisPro motif in chiral discrimination is also strongly indicated by its absolute invariance in all DTD sequences from eubacteria to higher eukaryotes ( Figure 8C ). Previous work has shown the ability of L-proline to catalyze asymmetric synthesis of simple sugars leading to their enantioenrichment ( Breslow and Cheng, 2010; Hein and Blackmond, 2012 ). Based on the work, there has been a proposal of a role of L-proline in symmetry-breaking during the prebiotic era. In the present work also, we show the critical role of a proline residue as a part of a motif in a process involved in enforcement of homochirality. 10. 7554/eLife. 01519. 026Figure 8. Strict conservation of the Gly-cisPro motif in DTDs.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01519. 026 Overall, the work has unveiled a fundamental cellular mechanism that is responsible for enforcing and perpetuating L-aa homochirality in proteins

. The atomic B-factors of the ligand clearly show a sharp rise in the side chain atoms beyond the Cβ ( Figure 2C, Figure 2—figure supplement 5, Supplementary file 1B ). The superimposition of all the copies of ligand from both the crystal forms I and II shows considerable deviations in only the side chain atoms beyond Cβ ( Figure 2—figure supplement 6 ). The lack of recognition of side chain atoms indicates that residues with different side chain chemistries and sizes are treated alike. Such a side chain-free recognition mechanism provides the basis for how nature has designed a single deacylase to deal with any D-aa-tRNA and reveals the crucial role played by weak hydrogen bonds in D-chirality selection. If an L-aa was to bind in this pocket, it would have to do so in one of the three theoretically possible conformations shown in Figure 4. In conformation I, where the side chain swaps positions with Hα, it would result in serious clashes with several atoms in the binding pocket ( Figure 4C ). Even the Cβ of L-Tyr would have short contacts of 3. 08 Å with the Cδ and 2. 69 Å with the carbonyl oxygen of Pro150. In conformation II, the side chain would occupy the place of the amino group ( Figure 4D ). In this position it would be placed adjacent to 5′-OH and would therefore have short contacts with the preceding nucleotide ( C75 ). In fact, the Cβ itself would have a short contact ( 2. 56 Å ) with the amide nitrogen of the substrate ( ester oxygen in the real substrate ). It should be highlighted here that the side chain rejection in both positions occurs at the Cβ level itself, which implies that an amino acid with even a minimal side chain like L-Ala will be rejected from occupying these two positions. In the third possibility of conformation III, the amino group would swap its position with Hα ( Figure 4E )

. The resultant tetrahedral transition state would be stabilized by the oxyanion hole formed by main chain nitrogen atoms of Phe89 and Thr90 situated at a distance 3. 03 Å and 4. 05 Å respectively from the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate. It would then result in the subsequent cleavage of the ester bond between the D-aa and the tRNA. Therefore, taken together with studies on Pab-NTD and the primordial nature of its fold and function, the above data indicate that the DTD fold is an RNA-based catalyst in the proofreading reaction. A striking feature of the amino acid recognition site is the capture of all the atoms attached to the chiral centre Cα and the role of cross-subunit interactions, particularly a Gly-cisPro motif from both monomers inserted into the active site of the dimeric counterpart that plays a central role in the recognition mechanism, as described in ‘Mechanism of L-amino acid rejection from the active site’. The aminoacyl moiety has interactions with residues from both monomers. The carbonyl oxygen interacts with the main chain nitrogen of Phe89 and the side chain amide of Gln88. Both the residues belong to the –SQFTL– motif. The α-amino group of D-tyrosine has an interaction with carbonyl oxygen of Gly149 from the cross-subunit Gly-cisPro motif. Such a capture of the carbonyl oxygen and the amino group of the incoming D-aa, automatically positions the Cβ in such a way that it makes favorable C-H…O hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Pro150, again from the cross-subunit Gly-cisPro motif. In addition, the Cα also makes a weak C-H…N bond with the Gln88 side chain amide nitrogen. The interaction distances of the aminoacyl moiety have been summarized in Supplementary file 1A. With this mode of recognition of the configuration, the side chain of D-tyrosine is positioned in such a way that it projects out of the binding pocket and has no interaction beyond the Cβ atom as seen in Figure 2C

., 2007 ). Unlike in the case of PheRS, the catalytic role of RNA in DTD could not be directly probed with a modified tRNA having a terminal 2′-deoxyadenosine since tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase ( TyrRS ) attaches the amino acid on 2′-OH of the ribose, which is then transesterified to 3′-OH for proofreading reaction. As we show later, this transesterification is required for DTD to act since it is expected to recognize aminoacyl moiety only when it is attached to the 3′-OH. A comparison of non-cognate and cognate substrate analog-bound structures of Pab-NTD had revealed that the space available in the reaction zone is crucial for catalysis. It was shown that upon cognate substrate binding this space is constricted due to a subtle movement of a crucial Lys side chain ( Hussain et al., 2010 ). This limited space, therefore, does not allow the putative catalytic water molecule to be accommodated in that site as it would have serious short contacts, and hence no deacylation. Although we do not observe a water molecule in that region in DTD, there is enough space available for a water molecule to be positioned without any clashes. Furthermore, it is worth noting here that the site of catalysis in DTD is much more accessible to the external bulk solvent as compared to Pab-NTD and could be a plausible reason as to why we do not observe the water molecule crystallographically. Therefore, considering the structural similarity and conservation of substrate-binding modes between DTD and Pab-NTD along with the experimental evidence showing the absence of any direct role of protein residues in catalysis, we conclude that DTD is an RNA-based catalyst in the proofreading reaction.

    Title: Obligate coupling of CFTR pore opening to tight nucleotide-binding domain dimerization
    Abstract: In CFTR, the chloride channel mutated in cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patients, ATP-binding-induced dimerization of two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains ( NBDs ) opens the pore, and dimer disruption following ATP hydrolysis closes it. Spontaneous openings without ATP are rare in wild-type CFTR, but in certain CF mutants constitute the only gating mechanism, stimulated by ivacaftor, a clinically approved CFTR potentiator. The molecular motions underlying spontaneous gating are unclear. Here we correlate energetic coupling between residues across the dimer interface with spontaneous pore opening/closure in single CFTR channels. We show that spontaneous openings are also strictly coupled to NBD dimerization, which may therefore occur even without ATP. Coordinated NBD/pore movements are therefore intrinsic to CFTR: ATP alters the stability, but not the fundamental structural architecture, of open- and closed-pore conformations. This explains correlated effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP-driven and spontaneous activity, providing insights for understanding CF mutation and drug mechanisms.

    Supporting Text:
    The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) is a chloride ion channel which belongs to the superfamily of ATP binding cassette ( ABC ) proteins ( Riordan et al., 1989 ). Following phosphorylation of the cytosolic regulatory ( R ) domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKA ), CFTR channels are gated by cytosolic ATP ( Figure 1a ). The ion pore within the TMDs opens upon formation of a tight head-to-tail NBD dimer stabilized by two molecules of ATP occluded at the dimer interface ( Vergani et al., 2005 ) ; each nucleotide is sandwiched between the conserved Walker A and B sequences of one NBD and the signature sequence of the other ( Smith et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2003 ). Pore closure accompanies NBD dimer disruption prompted by ATP hydrolysis at the composite interfacial site harbouring the Walker motifs of NBD2 ( site 2 ) ( Vergani et al., 2005 ) : the other site ( site 1 ) is catalytically inactive retaining ATP bound throughout multiple gating cycles ( Aleksandrov et al., 2002; Basso et al., 2003 ). As evidence of such strict coupling between NBD and transmembrane domain ( TMD ) movements, a hydrogen bond between the side chains of NBD2 Walker-A threonine ( T1246 ) and an arginine ( R555 ) adjacent to the NBD1 signature sequence was shown to form in open, but not in closed, channels ( Vergani et al., 2005 ). These two positions have co-evolved as a pair ( Vergani et al., 2005 ), and in crystal structures of nucleotide-bound ABC NBD dimers the analogous side chains also form a hydrogen bond, the arginine serving as hydrogen donor and the threonine/serine side chain as acceptor ( Smith et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2003 )

While ATP-driven CFTR pore openings are known to be coupled to the formation of a tight NBD dimer ( Vergani et al., 2005 ), the mechanism of spontaneous openings, observable in the absence of ATP, is unknown. Here we show that spontaneous openings are also linked to tightening of the NBD interface around composite site 2, just as in the presence of bound ATP. Such strict coupling between NBD and pore movements – regardless of the absence or presence of ATP – strongly constrains mechanistic models of ATP-dependent channel gating, and understanding of the underlying driving forces, which are likely conserved among ABC proteins. It also helps explain modulatory effects of mutations, or of physiological or pharmacological gating regulators. For example, the G551D CF mutation converts ATP at site 2 into an inhibitory ligand, due to electrostatic repulsion between the γ-phosphate of ATP bound to the Walker motifs, and the introduced negative charge in the signature sequence ( Lin et al., 2014 ). Such an effect would not be expected if the opposing NBD interfaces did not approach each other in the open-channel state, but is readily explained by openings being strictly linked to NBD dimer formation even in the G551D mutant. Furthermore, although reported low-probability ATP-independent pore openings of a CFTR construct lacking NBD2 ( CFTR residues 1–1197; [Wang et al., 2007] ) can clearly not be linked to NBD dimer formation, the present results argue that upon pore opening its remaining NBD-TMD coupling machinery undergoes movements similar to those that accompany NBD dimerization when neither 'limb' is truncated. Because of the tightened NBD interface, the ATP binding sites of open CFTR channels are likely inaccessible to the bulk solution even in the absence of bound ATP, just as in its presence ( Chaves and Gadsby, 2015 ), suggesting that ATP binding/unbinding can take place only in the closed-channel state

. Finally, what can we infer about the mechanism by which binding of the natural ligand ATP promotes CFTR channel opening? The presence of bound ATP does not alter the global arrangement of conformations: rather ATP acts as a'molecular glue' to stabilize the transition state and the open state. Because ATP-induced openings are terminated by ATP hydrolysis ( Csanády et al., 2010 ), energetic interpretation of ATP-binding induced gating effects cannot be based on the comparison of WT gating in the presence and absence of ATP ( Figure 1d, WT+ATP vs. WT ). However, comparing gating parameters for spontaneous activity of WT CFTR and ATP-driven activity of hydrolysis-incompetent mutant CFTR channels offers some insight into the impact of ATP binding on gating energetics ( Figure 3c, gray vs. orange free energy profiles ). Mutations that disrupt ATP hydrolysis in site 2 all prolong τb and reduce CFTR gating to an equilibrium, by forcing the channels to close back through the same high-energy transition state they had traversed upon opening ( cf. Figure 3a ) ( Vergani et al., 2005; Csanády et al., 2010; Sorum et al., 2015 ). For instance, comparison of Po and τb of the site 2 Walker-A mutant K1250R CFTR in saturating ATP ( Po ~ 0. 6, τb = 9323 ms [Vergani et al., 2005] ) with those of spontaneously gating WT CFTR suggests that the presence of bound ATP stabilizes the open-channel state by ~10. 3 kT ( Figure 3c, right gray arrow ) and increases ΔΔG ( T−O ) ∘ by ~5. 1 kT, respectively, which implies that bound ATP stabilizes the transition state by only ~5. 2 kT ( Figure 3c, left gray arrow ). Thus, intriguingly, although the NBD interface is already tightened within site 2 in the ATP-bound transition state ( Vergani et al., 2005; Sorum et al., 2015 ), the'molecular glue' effect of bound ATP is further strengthened when the channel reaches the stable open state

. Two immediate corollaries ensue. First, the ATP-free open-channel state is unlikely to be an integral component of the ATP-dependent gating cycle ( Szollosi et al., 2010; but, cf. Jih et al., 2013 ). Second, despite suggested similarities ( Wang et al., 2010; Kirk et al., 2011; Okeyo et al., 2013 ), the principles that drive gating of CFTR channels are fundamentally different from those of ligand-gated channels, such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Ligand-gated channels obey cyclic equilibrium mechanisms in which ligand binding/unbinding can occur both in the closed- and the open-channel state, and the activating effect of the ligand is based on the thermodynamic principle of detailed balance which constrains the product of the equilibrium constants around a cycle to be unity: thus, opening ( 'isomerization' ) is driven by the concurrent conformational change of the ligand binding site which increases its affinity for the ligand ( Grosman and Auerbach, 2001 ). But in CFTR the ligand binding site is occluded in open channels, so that an open-state 'binding affinity' cannot be defined ( the rates for both ATP binding and unbinding are zero ). Thus, even when disruption of ATP hydrolysis forces CFTR channels to gate at equilibrium, that gating follows a reversible linear sequence ( cf., Figure 3a ), rather than a cycle subject to the principle of detailed balance. Strong correlation between effects on unliganded and liganded channel activity, and energetic additivity of such effects, has been reported for a range of diverse 'allosteric modulators' acting on various regions of the channel. For instance, both unliganded and liganded Po is increased in a physiological context by R-domain phosphorylation, presumably by altering R-domain interactions with the TMDs ( Vergani et al, 2005 ), and both liganded and unlig Po are reduced by the G551 mutation ( Lin et al, 2014 ), which disrupts electrostatic repulsion between the γ-phosphate of ATP and the introduced negative charge in the signature.

    Title: Pre-transition effects mediate forces of assembly between transmembrane proteins
    Abstract: We present a mechanism for a generic, powerful force of assembly and mobility for transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers. This force is a pre-transition ( or pre-melting ) effect for the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases in the membrane. Using large-scale molecular simulation, we show that a protein with hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase embedded in an ordered bilayer stabilizes a microscopic order–disorder interface. The stiffness of that interface is finite. When two such proteins approach each other, they assemble because assembly reduces the net interfacial energy. Analogous to the hydrophobic effect, we refer to this phenomenon as the 'orderphobic effect'. The effect is mediated by proximity to the order–disorder phase transition and the size and hydrophobic mismatch of the protein. The strength and range of forces arising from this effect are significantly larger than those that could arise from membrane elasticity for the membranes considered.

    Supporting Text:
   . The typical range is ≈10 to 30 nm. In comparison, given the elastic moduli of the membranes we consider, elastic responses will generate attractive forces between transmembrane proteins that are much smaller in strength and range, typically −5kBT and 1 nm, respectively ( Haselwandter and Phillips, 2013; de Meyer et al., 2008 ). Moreover, similarly weak and short ranged forces are found from solvation theory that accounts for linear response in microscopic detail while not accounting for the possibility of an underlying phase transition ( Lagüe et al., 1998 ). As in the hydrophobic effect ( Chandler, 2005 ), the strength and range of the orderphobic force leverages the power of a phase transition, depending in this case on the ability of the orderphobic protein to induce a disordered layer in its vicinity. This ability depends upon the proximity to the membrane’s phase transition, and, for the simple protein models considered in this paper, it depends upon the protein’s radius and hydrophobic mismatch with the membrane. The spatial extent of the disordered region increases with proximity to phase coexistence as shown in Figure 5A. 10. 7554/eLife. 13150. 009Figure 5. Strength of the orderphobic force. ( A ) Radial variation of the order parameter showing the extent of the disordered region as a function of temperature, for a protein of radius 1. 9 nm and hydrophobic thickness 2. 3 nm.

. Further, an obvious consequence of the orderphobic effect is the existence of a driving force that will move orderphobic proteins from an ordered phase to a disordered phase, and the creation of large disordered domains as a result of clustering orderphobic proteins. Both of these effects have been noted in simulations of disordering α-helix proteins in a membrane exhibiting coexisting liquid-ordered and liquid disordered domains ( Schäfer et al., 2011; Domański et al., 1818 ). Further, there is a dual to the orderphobic effect: a transmembrane protein in the disordered phase that favors the ordered phase can nucleate an ordered region and order–disorder interface. For example, one of our model proteins with a positive mismatch ( ℓ=𝒟o ) would induce order in its vicinity. This effect is illustrated in the Appendix. Interfaces separating the ordered and disordered regions will again provide a force for assembly. This case corresponds to the situation of lipid rafts ( Simons and Ikonen, 1997 ), which consists of ordered domains floating in otherwise disordered membranes. The stable interface separating domains then serves as a concrete geometrical definition of the raft. This orderphilic effect will depend upon the extent to which the surface of the transmembrane protein is commensurate with the ordered phase structure. Hydrophobic mismatch is but one possibility. β-sheets that align neighboring lipids are others. The fact that the orderphilic effect is a pre-transition effect for the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases implies it should occur in disordered membranes that are thermodynamically close to coexistence between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases. The orderphobic effect may also be of direct relevance in understanding the behavior of lung-surfactant monolayers

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 13150. 009 Furthermore, Figure 5B shows that the strength of the effect is maximal for a hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase, and it decreases as the hydrophobic thickness approaches that of the ordered phase. In the case of zero mismatch ( i. e., ℓ=𝒟o ) the value of the order parameter in the vicinity of the protein is consistent with that of a pure bilayer in the ordered state. Therefore, the model proteins with zero mismatch do not induce a disordered region, and the orderphobic effect vanishes. See Figure 5B and D. Figure 4 also shows that the orderphobic effect produces excess mobility, by proteins melting order in a surrounding microscopic layer and by facilitating the motions of neighboring proteins. This finding explains how protein mobility and reorganization can be relatively facile in the so-called 'gel' phases of membranes. Further information on this phenomenon is provided in Appendix. Our prediction of enhanced lipid mobility surrounding orderphobic proteins may be amenable to experimental tests by single molecule tracking techniques ( Eggeling et al., 2009 ). Biological membranes and transmembrane proteins are far more complicated than the models considered in this paper. Part of the complexity is associated with multiple components, which allow for more than one order–disorder transition. For example, with a membrane composed of three components, coexistence can be established between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases ( Veatch and Keller, 2005 ), and both of these phases exist in bio-membranes ( Swamy et al., 2006; Owen et al., 2012; Polozov et al., 2008 ). The fact that liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases can coexist with finite line tension ( Veatch and Keller, 2005 ) implies the existence of a first-order transition between them ( Chandler, 1987 ) and thus the relevance of the orderphobic effect

We choose the MARTINI model of hydrated dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine ( DPPC ) lipid bilayers ( Marrink et al., 2007 ) to illustrate the orderphobic effect. See Materials and methods. This membrane model exhibits an ordered phase and a disordered phase. Figure 1A contrasts configurations from the two phases, and it shows our estimated phase boundary between the two phases. The ordered phase has regular tail packing compared to the disorganized tail arrangement of the disordered phase. A consequence of the regular tail packing is that hydrophobic thickness of the ordered phase, 𝒟o is larger than that of the disordered phase, 𝒟d. Correspondingly, the area per lipid in the ordered phase is smaller than that in the disordered phase. 10. 7554/eLife. 13150. 003Figure 1. First-order phase transition in a model lipid bilayer.

., 1988; Smith et al., 1990 ). Presumably, the ordered domain of the phase diagram in Figure 1A partitions into several subdomains coinciding with one or more of these possibilities. With advanced sampling techniques ( Frenkel and Smit, 2001 ), free energy functions of characteristic order parameters can be computed to estimate the positions of boundaries between these various ordered behaviors. Here, we do not pursue this additional level of detail and focus on the orderobic effect in the simple case of a single order–dis phase transition. The orderobic effect is not limited to the MARTINI model and should be applicable to other models of lipid bilayers that exhibit a first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases, such as the GROMOS model (Fren et al.,2008 ) and the CHARMM model (Brooks et al,2000 ).

    Title: Relationship between simultaneously recorded spiking activity and fluorescence signal in GCaMP6 transgenic mice
    Abstract: Fluorescent calcium indicators are often used to investigate neural dynamics, but the relationship between fluorescence and action potentials ( APs ) remains unclear. Most APs can be detected when the soma almost fills the microscope’s field of view, but calcium indicators are used to image populations of neurons, necessitating a large field of view, generating fewer photons per neuron, and compromising AP detection. Here, we characterized the AP-fluorescence transfer function in vivo for 48 layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex, with simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached recordings from transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f. While most APs were detected under optimal conditions, under conditions typical of population imaging studies, only a minority of 1 AP and 2 AP events were detected ( often <10% and ~20–30%, respectively ), emphasizing the limits of AP detection under more realistic imaging conditions.

    Supporting Text:
    Genetically encoded calcium indicators ( GECIs ) are widely used with two-photon laser scanning microscopy to report neuronal activity within local populations in vivo ( Luo et al., 2018 ). This optical approach is minimally invasive and enables simultaneous measurement of activity from hundreds or even thousands of neurons at single-cell resolution, over multiple sessions. Using a contemporary GECI such as GCaMP6s, fluorescence changes associated with isolated spikes ( action potentials, APs ) in vivo can be detected when imaged at sufficiently high spatiotemporal resolution ( Chen et al., 2013 ) ( http://dx. doi. org/10. 6080/K02R3PMN ). Yet undetected APs are common in population imaging experiments ( Theis et al., 2016; Berens et al., 2018 ). Inferring the underlying AP train or firing rate from calcium imaging remains challenging for several reasons. First, population imaging studies necessarily employ a large field of view containing many neurons. In contrast, the AP to calcium-dependent fluorescence transfer function is typically characterized with a soma filling the field of view of the microscope, to maximize photon flux from the soma and thereby signal-to-noise ratio. Second, there is no ground truth spiking information available for most neurons in a population. Spiking information, often from a cell-attached recording, can be used to refine the spike inference model and thereby optimize AP detection. Third, the AP to calcium-dependent fluorescence transfer function may be different for each neuron due to various intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as neuron-to-neuron differences in indicator expression. Compared to viral expression, transgenic mouse lines offer convenience ( e. g. bypassing virus injection and associated procedures ) and achieve more uniform GECI expression in genetically defined neuronal populations ( Madisen et al., 2015; Daigle et al., 2018 )

., 2015; Daigle et al., 2018 ). Using our intersectional transgenic mouse lines that enable Cre recombinase-dependent expression of GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f, we simultaneously characterized the spiking activity and fluorescence of individual GECI-expressing pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex ( V1 ). We then tested the performance of several spike inference models, detecting APs under optimal conditions ( models refined using the spiking information, with the soma filling the field of view ) and under the less optimal conditions typical of population imaging experiments. Our results provide insight into the relationship between spiking activity in vivo and fluorescence signals and will aid the interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging datasets.

. 5 when imaging with GCaMP6f and a field of view of several hundred micrometers. In summary, 1 AP and 2 AP events were detected with high probability when images were acquired with high spatial and temporal resolution and when analysis was performed with an event detection algorithm optimized for each neuron using known AP times. Even with known AP times to optimize detection for each neuron, event detection was severely impaired by a reduction in spatial and temporal resolution to mimic a typical two-photon population imaging experiment. In a typical two-photon population imaging experiment, no electrophysiology recording is available to optimize event detection. Often, the shape of the calcium transient is estimated from published indicator rise and decay times or derived from a representative sample of fluorescence transients. What are typical event detection and false positive probabilities under these sub-optimal conditions when the underlying AP times are unknown? Is performance degraded equally for high and for low resolution images? We compared event detection from high-resolution and downsampled images using three spike inference algorithms: unconstrained non-negative deconvolution ( NND; Friedrich et al., 2017 ), non-negative deconvolution with an L0 constraint to enforce event sparseness ( Exact L0; Jewell et al., 2020 ), and a biophysical model that explicitly accounts for intracellular calcium dynamics ( MLspike; Deneux et al., 2016 ). These three algorithms are among the highest performing spike inference algorithms ( Berens et al., 2018 ). For each neuron, the algorithms were deployed to estimate the number of APs in each image of the movie. All three algorithms estimated AP numbers that approximately recapitulated the number of APs measured with electrophysiology, but the number of APs per frame was typically not an integer due to imperfect spike inference ( Figure 6A, D )

Calcium imaging is widely used to report neuronal spiking activity in vivo. However, accurate spike inference from calcium imaging remains a challenge, and there are relatively few ground truth datasets with simultaneous calcium imaging and electrophysiology to aid the development of more accurate spike inference algorithms. In a recent challenge, ~40 algorithms were trained and tested on datasets consisting of 37 GCaMP6-expressing neurons, underscoring the need for additional GCaMP6 calibration data ( Berens et al., 2018 ). In addition to supporting efforts toward spike inference, an improved understanding of the relationship between spiking and observed fluorescence signals is necessary to further broaden the utility and impact of calcium imaging. To these ends, we contribute a ground truth dataset consisting of 48 V1 L2/3 excitatory neurons recorded at single-cell resolution ( available at https://portal. brain-map. org/explore/circuits/oephys ) and characterized their AP-to-calcium fluorescence transfer function. Complementing existing datasets with viral GECI expression ( Chen et al., 2013; Theis et al., 2016; Dana et al., 2016 ), our work facilitates interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging studies using mainstream transgenic mouse lines, such as the Allen Institute’s Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset ( http://observatory. brain-map. org/visualcoding ) ( de Vries et al., 2020 ). Previous studies have established that most APs can be detected with GCaMP6 indicators under near-optimal conditions ( Chen et al., 2013 ). Yet undetected APs are common in population imaging experiments ( Theis et al., 2016; Berens et al., 2018 )

. 7 for four neurons, to 0. 6 for three neurons, and to 0. 5 for one neuron. Neuropil subtraction was performed as described for the Allen Brain Observatory ( de Vries et al., 2020 ). Electrophysiology and calcium imaging data were analyzed using custom MATLAB and Python scripts. For electrophysiology, Vm was filtered between 250 Hz and 5 kHz, and automated AP detection was performed using a threshold criterion ( 5×std of Vm ). For calcium imaging, in-plane motion artifacts were corrected ( Dombeck et al., 2007 ), and neuron/ROI selection was performed using a semi-automatic algorithm ( Chen et al., 2013 ) ( kindly provided by Karel Svoboda, Janelia Research Campus ). Ring-shaped ROIs were used to select GCaMP6-positive excitatory neurons, with GCaMP6 expression typically excluded from the nucleus and restricted to the cytoplasm. To construct AP-calcium fluorescence response curves, we first identified all isolated AP events. For GCaMP6s, isolated events were separated from previous and subsequent events by ≥1000 and ≥500 ms, respectively. For GCaMP6f, isolated events were separated from previous and subsequent events by ≥300 ms. One result of finding isolated events is that only a minority of APs were used to construct AP-calcium fluorescence response curves. Within each event, APs were summed over 250 ms. Fluorescence traces were aligned to the first AP in each event, with t = 0 preceding the AP by <1 frame ( 6. 3 ms at 158 Hz ). For each event, ΔF/F = ( F-F0, local ) /F0, global, where F0, local was the mean fluorescence over 100 ms before the first AP, and F0, global was the minimum F0, local across trials. For GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f, peak ΔF/F was calculated by first finding tmax, the time of the maximum ΔF/F ≤ 500 ms and 300 ms after the first AP, respectively. Peak Δ/F was used to construct the AP-calc transfer function for each neuron. The APalc transfer function was fit with a logistic sigmoidal curve, y=1/(1+exp(−(x−x /k) ), where x is the AP number of APs, and k is the steepness of the curve. For each neuron, the APalc transfer was calculated as the ratio of peak Δ/F to the maximum Δ/F over all APs. The APalc transfer was then used to estimate the number of APs in each image of the movie using each of the three spike inference algorithms ( NND, L0, and MLike ). For each neuron, the algorithms were deployed to estimate the number of APs in each image of the movie. All algorithms estimated numbers that recapitulated the number of APs measured electrophys, but the number of AP per frame was typically not an integer due to imperfect spike inference ( Figure 6, D ) The APalc transfer was also used to estimate the number of APs in each image of the movie for each algorithm. The AP transfer was calculated as the ratio of peak Δ/F to the maximum Δ over all APs. The AP transfer was used to estimate the number of AP in each image of the movie for each algorithm. The AP was calculated as the ratio of peak to the maximum over all AP. The was used to estimate the number in each of the for each.

    Title: A biological switching valve evolved in the female of a sex-role reversed cave insect to receive multiple seminal packages
    Abstract: We report a functional switching valve within the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla. The valve complex is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. Females have a penis-like intromittent organ to coercively anchor males and obtain voluminous semen. The semen is packed in a capsule, whose formation is initiated by seminal injection. It is not only used for fertilization but also consumed by the female as nutrition. The valve complex has two slots for insemination so that Neotrogla can continue mating while the first slot is occupied. In conjunction with the female penis, this switching valve is a morphological novelty enabling females to compete for seminal gifts in their nutrient-poor cave habitats through long copulation times and multiple seminal injections. The evolution of this switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla.

    Supporting Text:
   . The spermathcal plate has two slots available for insemination ( Figure 1E ). In Neotrogla and the related species ( Lepinotus ), content of the capsule is digested as nutrition during the seminal capsule being attached to the spermathecal plate ( the transparent capsule shown in Figure 1B is a digested and empty one: Yoshizawa et al., 2014 ). Therefore, if there is only one slot for insemination, as in the spermatheca of Lepinotus, females cannot receive another capsule while digesting one. With the switching valve, the female Neotrogla ( and possibly Sensitibilla and Afrotrogla ) can selectively use one of two slots for insemination, with leaving the other slot empty. This enables the females to immediately receive an additional seminal package from the same or other males by using the empty slot. Males are predicted to prudently allocate limited resources, such as nutritious seminal gifts and sperm, to multiple females, especially when operational sex ratio is biased to females, rendering female-female competition for male-derived nuptial gifts ( i. e, propensity for multiple mating ) more intense ( Abe and Kamimura, 2015 ). The male-holding organ ( spiny female penis ) and female-induced long copulation durations of 40 – 70 hr ( compared to just ~50 min for formation of one seminal capsule in close relatives ) in Neotrogla ( Yoshizawa et al., 2014 ) thus can be considered as exaggerated adaptations for such escalated competition for nuptial gifts in this group of insects inhabiting highly oligotrophic cave habitats ( Lienhard and Ferreira, 2013; Lienhard and Ferreira, 2015; Yoshizawa et al., 2014 ). The condition of having two freshly deposited spermatophores at once is comparable to that in multiple sperm storage organs reported for females of some animal groups, such as dung flies, Drosophila, or tephritid fruit flies ( Ward, 1993; Pitnick et al., 1999; Twig and Yuval, 2005 )

. This inclination is due to the fan-like geometry of the actuator muscle whose parts can pull the CE in the preferred direction to work against the passive closing forces generated by the resilin patches around the valve complex. This muscle-closure element configuration could be advantageous since each muscle bundle pulls in an optimal direction to incline the CE into one of the two opening positions. Additionally, there is no need for lubrication since the moveable parts do not move against each other. Compared to technical switching valves, this design is advantageous to some extent because the muscle forces are not redirected via a lever arm. The presence of a spermathecal plate with a valve function to control seminal flow may further refine our understanding of the causes and consequences of the reversed sexual selection in this genus. Female-female competition for males ( sex-role reversal ) to receive nutritious seminal substances is considered as the most important factor driving the evolution of the female penis ( Yoshizawa et al., 2014 ). Among all animals with known sex-role reversal, Neotrogla is the only example in which a female penis evolved ( Kamimura and Yoshizawa, 2017 ). In a close relative of Neotrogla, the barklouse species Lepinotus patruelis ( Wearing-Wilde, 1996 ), the sex-roles are also reversed, but the species possesses normal genital structures. Therefore, it is very likely that, in addition to the sex-role reversal, there is at least one other key factor that enabled the evolution of a female penis. Although females of all three known genera of Sensitibillini possess a spermathecal plate, females of Sensitibilla do not have a penis-like organ ( Lienhard, 1893; Lienhard et al., 1893 ). This strongly suggests that the evolution of the spermathecal plate, possibly including a switching valve, preceded the evolution of the female penis

The present analyses show that females of Neotrogla use a special mechanism to actively control the direction of seminal flow ( Figures 1E and 2A–D ). This biological switching valve allows females to receive two seminal packages ( i. e., more nutrition ) from the same or different males within a short time span. In particular, the switching valve allows to receive a second seminal capsule while the first one is consumed. A similar but less sclerotized structure can be observed in close relatives of Neotrogla ( Sensitibilla and Afrotrogla, all belonging to the tribe Sensitibillini ), suggesting that the structure probably originated in their common ancestor ( Lienhard, 1893; Lienhard et al., 1893 ). Neotrogla is distributed in South America, whereas Sensitibilla and Afrotrogla are distributed in southern Africa. Therefore, the origin of this switching valve dates to at least the break-up of the two continents, over 100 million years ago ( Seton et al., 2012 ). In other psocodeans, no sclerite or muscle corresponding to those of the spermathecal plate elements have been observed ( Badonnel, 1934; Klier, 1956; Wearing-Wilde, 1995 ). The spermathecal plate thus clearly represents an evolutionary novelty ( Müller and Wagner, 2003 ). The mechanism of flow control and redirection within this biological switching valve is fundamentally different from that in man-made switching valves, which are used, for example in the oil and gas industry. Technical switching valves use the active rotation of tube or ball elements with various openings to redirect the flow and both closing as well as opening involve an active movement of the valve. In contrast, the observed biological switching valve involves a passive movement component. The seminal flow injected by a male is redirected by a differential inclination of the CE ( Figure 2E )

., 1999; Twig and Yuval, 2005 ). Although theory predicts that having multiple sperm stores can be a powerful mechanism for choosing sperm ( Hellriegel and Ward, 1998 ), evidence is scarce for a gain in fitness by actively selecting for particular sperm from among multiple mates ( e. g., Demont et al., 2012; Schäfer et al., 2013 ). In addition, in the case of Neotrogla and related barklice ( Lepinotus patruelis ), the content of the seminal capsule is digested quite rapidly if not used for fertilization ( Wearing-Wilde, 1995; Yoshizawa et al., 2014 ). Therefore, the switching valve system reported here likely represents an adaptation for direct benefits ( i. e., for obtaining more nutrients ) rather than for genetic benefits ( i. e., for choosing sperm from high-quality males ).

., 2014 ). Although there is only a single inlet spermathecal duct present, occasionally two seminal capsules are attached simultaneously to a plate-like structure on the spermatheca ( termed ‘spermathecal plate’: [Lienhard et al., 1893; Yoshizawa et al., 2014] ). The semen within the capsule is used not only for fertilization but is also consumed by the female as nutrition. To compete for nutritious semen, the direction of sexual selection is reversed in Neotrogla ( sex-role reversal: Yoshizawa et al., 2014 ). Each seminal capsule is voluminous ( ~0. 05 mm3, corresponding to ~300 ml scaled up to humans ), and the duration of the copulation is very long ( for 40 to 70 hr ). In a closely related species lacking reversal of genital structure ( Lepinotus patruelis, Trogiidae ), the seminal transfer for forming a similarly voluminous seminal capsule is known to complete in 50 min ( Wearing-Wilde, 1995 ). The female penis of Neotrogla bears a lot of spines, by which females anchor a male coercively during copulation. Therefore, females are obviously responsible for this very long copulation, probably to obtain more semen from a male ( Yoshizawa et al., 2014 ). After consumption of the semen, the capsule is digested ( Yoshizawa et al. 2014 ). The spermathe plate has two slots for insemination ( Figure 1E ). Neotla and related species ( Lepot ) content the capsule is digested nutrition during seminal being attached to sperhe plate ( the transparent shown in Figure 1 is digested empty: Yoshawa et al,201 ). If there is only one slot for inse, in sperhe of Lepot cannot receive another while digesting. With the valve, Neotla and possibly Sensib and Afrog can use one of two slots for inse, leaving other empty. This enables females to receive additional seminal from same or other males using empty slot. Males are predicted prudently allocate resources, such as nutritious gifts and sperm, to females, especially when sex ratio is biased to females, rendering female competition for male-derived nupt gifts ( i. e. propensity multiple mating ) more intense ( Abe and Kamura,201 ) The-holding organ ( sp female penis ) and induced cop durations 40–70 hr compared just 50 for formation one capsule in relatives Neot ( Yoshawa et,201 ) can be considered as adaptations for escalated competition nupt gifts this group inhabiting oligot habitats (ien and Ferreira,2013;ien and Fer,2015; Yoshawa et,201 ) The condition having two deposited at once is comparable to multiple storage reported females some groups, such as flies Dophila or fruit ( Ward,199; Pitnick et,199; Twig and Yu,200 )

    Title: Munc18-1-regulated stage-wise SNARE assembly underlying synaptic exocytosis
    Abstract: Synaptic-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor ( SNARE ) proteins couple their stage-wise folding/assembly to rapid exocytosis of neurotransmitters in a Munc18-1-dependent manner. The functions of the different assembly stages in exocytosis and the role of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly are not well understood. Using optical tweezers, we observed four distinct stages of assembly in SNARE N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker domains ( or NTD, MD, CTD, and LD, respectively ). We found that SNARE layer mutations differentially affect SNARE assembly. Comparison of their effects on SNARE assembly and on exocytosis reveals that NTD and CTD are responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, respectively, whereas MD regulates SNARE assembly and fusion. Munc18-1 initiates SNARE assembly and structures t-SNARE C-terminus independent of syntaxin N-terminal regulatory domain ( NRD ) and stabilizes the half-zippered SNARE complex dependent upon the NRD. Our observations demonstrate distinct functions of SNARE domains whose assembly is intimately chaperoned by Munc18-1.

    Synaptic SNARE assembly underlies the strength, speed, and precision of neurotransmission, as well as many neurological disorders. Because SNAREs assemble in multiple stages, SNARE folding intermediates, energetics, and kinetics are intrinsically coupled, making it difficult to characterize SNARE assembly using traditional experimental approaches. By applying high-resolution optical tweezers, we have systematically measured the folding energies and kinetics of both wild-type and mutant SNARE complexes in the absence and presence of Munc18-1. Because of the stage-wise SNARE assembly, crosslinking at the N-terminal edge of NTD ( Figure 1B ) slightly affects the measured NTD energy, but not energies and kinetics of other domains ( Gao et al., 2012; Zorman et al., 2014 ). In addition, the NTD energies of the mutants relative to that of the WT barely change with the crosslinking site. Combining our findings with previous results on exocytosis, we confirmed distinct functions of different SNARE assembly stages in synaptic exocytosis. We showed that tight thermodynamic coupling requires specific SNARE assembly intermediates and pathways. MD mutations cause significant heterogeneity in SNARE assembly kinetics and/or abolish independent MD assembly. Furthermore, the MD is targeted by many regulatory proteins that control SNARE assembly, including complexin ( Chen et al., 2002; Sudhof and Rothman, 2009; Krishnakumar et al., 2011 ) and synaptotagmin ( Choi et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2015; Chapman, 2008 ). Thus, the SNARE engine consists of four stages of zippering in NTD, MD, CTD, and LD with distinct functions. The NTD is responsible for initiating specific formation of the trans-SNARE complex and docking vesicles to the plasma membrane ( Walter et al., 2010 ). The MD serves as a checkpoint to further ensure proper SNARE assembly and as a master switch to control CTD assembly

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 09580. 008 The molecular mechanism by which Munc18-1 regulates SNARE assembly, although essential for membrane fusion, has long been a matter of debate ( Rizo and Sudhof, 2012 ). On one hand, Munc18-1 can significantly enhance the rate and specificity of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion under certain conditions ( Shen et al., 2007; Rathore et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2015 ). On the other hand, Munc18-1 tightly associates with syntaxin in a closed conformation that inhibits SNARE assembly ( Colbert et al., 2013; Burkhardt et al., 2008; Dulubova et al., 1999 ). Munc18-1 also binds with over micromolar affinities to the t-SNARE complex ( Zhang et al., 2015 ), VAMP2 ( Parisotto et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2010b ), and the ternary SNARE complex ( Dulubova et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2007; Rathore et al., 2010 ). The exact functions of these associations in SNARE assembly and membrane fusion are not well understood ( Shen et al., 2007; Burkhardt et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2013 ). SNAREs couple their exergonic folding to membrane fusion ( Sudhof and Rothman, 2009; Rothman, 2014 ). Such a thermodynamic coupling mechanism predicts that any perturbation in SNARE assembly impacts membrane fusion

. The Munc18-1-mediated SNARE assembly was not abolished by the two VAMP2 layer mutations L60A and L63A ( Figure 9B ). This finding suggests that, despite their effect on the accuracy of intrinsic SNARE assembly, neither MD mutation significantly affect Munc18-1-dependent de novo SNARE assembly. Finally, we found that Munc18-1 similarly promoted SNARE assembly ( Figure 9D ) when the SNARE complex was crosslinked at a site N-terminal to the SNARE bundle ( Construct I in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ), indicating that the Munc18-1 activity was not caused by specific SNARE crosslinking. Interestingly, in this case, SNARE assembly occurred in two steps: t-SNARE formation at 12-17 pN, followed by cooperative SNARE zippering at 5-10 pN. Thus, Munc18-1 may mediate de novo SNARE assembly via a t-SNARE intermediate. 10. 7554/eLife. 09580. 024Figure 9. Munc18-1 helps to initiate SNARE assembly.

., 1998 ), respectively. They found that Vps33 interacts with the entire Qa- and R-SNARE motifs through two non-overlapping surfaces on Vps33 and aligns the SNARE helical NTDs in proximity and register ( state iii ). Because the structures of all SNARE complexes and SM proteins are highly conserved, they predicted that SM proteins serve as a template to initiate SNARE assembly into a partially zippered complex. Our discoveries of Munc18-1-mediated de novo SNARE assembly and half-zippered SNARE complex strongly support this prediction, which in turn offers a molecular mechanism for our observations ( state iii ). In addition, we previously showed that representative SNARE complexes mediating diverse membrane trafficking pathways slowly initiate their NTD assembly and pause in half-zippered states. These observations make SM-mediated SNARE assembly necessary. Our findings also corroborates that Munc18-1 enhances assembly of trans-SNARE complexes, thereby promoting liposome-liposome fusion ( Rathore et al., 2010 ; Shen et al. 2007 ; Yu et al. 2015 ).
Researchers investigated the assembly of integrin adhesomes, the protein complexes that facilitate cell-matrix adhesion, by examining the cytosolic state of integrin-adesome components and their exchange with adhesion sites. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) and recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), they found that the integrin adesome is pre-assembled in the cytos as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites. Stationary adhesions release the same types of protein complexes they recruit, keeping the cyolic pool of building blocks spatially uniform. A model proposes that multi-protein blocks enable rapid and modular assembly of adhesion and symmetric exchange of blocks preserves their specifications and the assembly logic of the system.

The integrin adesome is extensively pre-assembled in the cytos, forming multi-pro building for cell-matrix adhesion sites. Results indicate these blocks are size-confined and correspond to functional layers of focal adhes anchoring, integr regulation, force, and actin. In the cytos, blocks cannot form bigger structures due to dependencies between interactions. The plasma membrane system can switch to self-assemble adhesion by passing checkpoints that induce protein interactions in integrin adesome. These include mechanical stabilization of matrix-anchored integrin by actin polymerization, activation of vinculin by phosphatid-inos-4-bisphosphate (PIP), and mechanical of talin and CAS by actomy contractility.

Symmetric exchange between adhesion and cytos satisfies the requirement for correct assembly by ensuring blocks enter and exit adhesion without altering. A model of switchable formation adhesion via pre-as multi-protein blocks is proposed. Integrin adesome is pre-as in cytos multi-pro building for adhesion. Blocks are combinatorially diversified but confined in size. Most blocks form modules consistent with previously reported anchoring, mechanensing, and act regulation layers across adhes. In cytos, pre-as blocks cannot assemble bigger due to mutual exclusiveness interactions and alloic regulations. Plasma system can switch to assemble adhesion by passing checkpoints enabling protein integrin adesome. These include anchoring integrin to extracellular, mechanical tal and CAS by actomy contractility, and vinculin and tal by PIP on membrane.

Interestingly, disassembling adhes might exchange cytos asymmetrically. A study in mouse fibroblasts found FAK and vinculin with pax close dissembling adhes but far from them. Integr adesome contains hundred proteins with multiple binding each. Upon signals, components self-as along plasma to form nascent adhesion and mature focal complexes. Adhesion assemble, disassemble, and change by exchanging with cytos. Stationary adhes maintained by balanced exchange with cytos.

    Title: An electrophysiological marker of arousal level in humans
    Abstract: Deep non-rapid eye movement sleep ( NREM ) and general anesthesia with propofol are prominent states of reduced arousal linked to the occurrence of synchronized oscillations in the electroencephalogram ( EEG ). Although rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep is also associated with diminished arousal levels, it is characterized by a desynchronized, ‘wake-like’ EEG. This observation implies that reduced arousal states are not necessarily only defined by synchronous oscillatory activity. Using intracranial and surface EEG recordings in four independent data sets, we demonstrate that the 1/f spectral slope of the electrophysiological power spectrum, which reflects the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity, delineates wakefulness from propofol anesthesia, NREM and REM sleep. Critically, the spectral slope discriminates wakefulness from REM sleep solely based on the neurophysiological brain state. Taken together, our findings describe a common electrophysiological marker that tracks states of reduced arousal, including different sleep stages as well as anesthesia in humans.

   . The overall slowing of EEG activity and the occurrence of oscillations in lower frequency bands has previously been linked to reduced arousal levels ( e. g. slow waves and spindles in sleep [Prerau et al., 2017], delta waves and alpha oscillation under propofol anesthesia [Purdon et al., 2013] ). REM sleep, also called ‘paradoxical’ sleep ( Siegel, 2011 ), is characterized by a ‘wake-like’ EEG without prominent oscillations in humans. Differentiating between wakefulness and REM solely from the electrophysiological brain state has been challenging and to date still requires simultaneous EMG and EOG recordings to detect muscle atonia and rapid eye movements ( Iber et al., 2007 ). Here, we demonstrate that the non-oscillatory, aperiodic part of the power spectrum, which is devoid of prominent low-frequency oscillatory components and can be approximated by the 1/f decay of the power spectrum estimated from the 30 to 45 Hz frequency range, reliably differentiates wakefulness from all three states of reduced arousal level, namely REM, N3 sleep and general anesthesia with propofol. 1/f dynamics are observed across a variety of tasks ( He et al., 2010; Miller et al., 2009a; Miller et al., 2009b; Voytek et al., 2015 ), change with lifespan ( Voytek et al., 2015 ), and exhibit state-dependent variations during sleep ( Freeman and Zhai, 2009; Leemburg et al., 2018; Miskovic et al., 2019; Robinson et al., 2011 ) and anesthesia ( Colombo et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2017 ). Critically, these dynamics can be observed irrespective of the employed recording modality and species ( Colombo et al., 2019; Freeman and Zhai, 2009; Gao et al., 2017; He et al., 2010; Leemburg et al., 2018; Miskovic et al., 2019 ). However, to date, the underlying neural mechanisms giving rise to the prominent 1/f decay of the electrophysiological power spectrum are not well understood ( Buzsáki et al., 2012; He et al., 2010; Miller et al

. 9% ) ; Figure 1c, Table 1 ). Notably, recordings from subdural grid electrodes ( n = 4 ) showed the same pattern: The spectral slope decreased from wakefulness to anesthesia in the majority of recording sites ( 129 of 147 ECoG ( 87. 75% ) ; Figure 1—figure supplement 2a ). Taken together, we observed a more negative spectral slope under anesthesia compared to wakefulness in both scalp as well as intracranial EEG ( Figure 1b, c ). Our results indicate that the spectral slope differentiates between wakefulness and general anesthesia in humans. This effect spanned all scalp and the majority of intracranial electrodes, hence, supporting the notion that propofol anesthesia induces a global, brain-wide state change ( Brown et al., 2010 ). Having established that the spectral slope differs significantly between wakefulness and propofol anesthesia, we next examined if this state-dependent modulation generalized to other forms of decreased arousal, such as sleep. We specifically sought to determine if the spectral slope could discern wakefulness from different sleep stages. We analyzed two datasets obtained during a full night of sleep. In Study 3, we obtained polysomnography recordings from 20 healthy subjects, which included scalp EEG, as well as electrocardiography ( ECG ), electromyography ( EMG ) and electrooculography ( EOG ). To determine the precise spatial extent and subcortical contributions, we again recorded intracranial EEG in a separate cohort for Study 4 ( n = 10; electrode coverage see Figure 1—figure supplement 1b ). Critically, we combined intracranial EEG with polysomnography ( scalp EEG, ECG, EMG, EOG ) to enable comparable sleep staging across both the scalp and intracranial studies. We observed that the time-resolved spectral slope closely tracked the technician-scored hypnogram ( Figure 2a ). To quantify this effect, we compared spectral slope estimates across wakefulness, N3 and REM sleep

. Collectively, our results from four independent studies provide five main advances: First, the spectral slope tracks changes in arousal levels in both propofol anesthesia and sleep in humans with high temporal precision and is observable on a wide range of timescales from sub-second epochs to full night recordings. Second, our results provide empirical evidence for the notion that the slope in the range from 30 to 45 Hz correlates well with all stages of arousal. Previous studies analyzing the spectral slope during states of reduced arousal have either employed different frequency ranges ( Colombo et al., 2019; Freeman and Zhai, 2009; He et al., 2010; Miskovic et al., 2019 ) or focused either on anesthesia ( Colombo et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2017 ) or sleep ( Miskovic et al., 2019; Pereda et al., 1998; Shen et al., 2003 ). Here, we demonstrate that this frequency range is well suited to track arousal in both anesthesia and different sleep levels including REM and NREM sleep. Third, the spectral slope mirrored the rapid changes in excitability observed over the course of a slow wave directly tracking cortical ‘up- ‘and ‘down-states’, hence, providing a mechanistic link between the spectral slope and population synchrony during slow oscillations. Fourth, our observations support the premise that anesthesia is a brain-wide state ( Brown et al., 2010 ), whereas sleep exhibits network-specific activity patterns. Here, we observed that sleep dependent slope modulations were strongest in the medial temporal lobe and medial PFC, two key regions for sleep-dependent memory consolidation ( Diekelmann and Born, 2010; Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013; Stickgold and Walker, 2013 ). Fifth, the spectral slope can be reliably estimated from scalp EEG recordings, thus, providing an accessible marker that can easily be incorporated into intraoperative neuromonitoring or automatic sleep stage classification algorithms

., 2013 ) also follow a power law but these scale-free behaviors likely have a different neurophysiological basis than the 1/f drop-off of the power spectrum ( He et al., 2010 ). Recent findings suggested that 1/f dynamics differentiate wakefulness from general anesthesia ( Colombo et al., 2019; Gao, 2016 ). For instance, using intracranial recordings in macaque monkeys, it had been shown that the spectral slope between 30 and 50 Hz reliably tracked changes in arousal level under propofol anesthesia from induction to emergence ( Gao et al., 2017 ). Moreover, it has been reported that that the spectral slope between 1 and 40 Hz in human scalp EEG recordings discriminated states with conscious content, namely wakefulness and ketamine anesthesia, from states where no conscious report was possible, i. e. Xenon and propofol anesthesia ( Colombo et al., 2019 ). Collectively, these studies implied that propofol anesthesia was accompanied by a steeper decay of the power spectrum ( Colombo et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2017 ). With regard to sleep physiology, it had been observed that the spectral exponent of human scalp EEG becomes more negative during NREM sleep, when estimated e. g. in the 1 to 5 Hz ( Shen et al., 2003 ), 3 to 30 Hz ( Pereda et al., 1998 ) or 0. 5 to 35 Hz frequency range ( Miskovic et al., 2019 ). A similar pattern was observed in intracranial recordings with subdural grid electrodes in humans between 10 and 30 Hz (Leurg et al,2018 ) and 0.5 to 30 Hz (Movic et al,2019 ).
Researchers have discovered that stromules, dynamic tubular extensions of chloroplasts, interact with microtubules (MTs) and actin filaments (AF) to facilitate chloroplast movement during innate immunity. MTs promote stromule extension and stabilization, while AFs anchor stromules and provide points for chloroplast positioning. A correlation between strom direction and chloroplast movement was observed, suggesting strom-directed chloroplast movement is a general function of stromules in epider cells. Results show MTs and AFs facilitate peruclear clustering of chloroplasts during innate response. A model proposes stromules extend along MTs, connect to AF points surrounding nuclei, guiding chloroplast movement to nuclei during immunity.

 Silencing γ-tubulin complex 4 (G4) caused MT bundling and dynamics, resulting in longer stromules with slower extension and retraction. Strom extension does not require AFs, but they function as anchor points stabilizing stromules and chloroplast bodies. AFs play a role in chloroplast movement directed by stromules, which is disrupted by inhibitors. However, strom-directed chloroplast movement was observed when AFs partially disrupted, suggesting chlor anchoring restricts strom movement. A function of stromules is to direct chloroplast movement during innate response. During immunity, a model proposes stromules extend MT towards nuclei, attach to AF points, and peruclear attachments guide chloroplast to nucleus.

Cytoskeletal elements support various cellular functions, including cytoplasm streaming, cell division, elongation, growth, ves trafficking, nuclear positioning, and morphogenesis. This study shows stromules along MT and AFs stabilize strom and chloroplast-nuclear connections during innate response. Stromules direct chlor movement and AF anchoring guide peruclear chlor clustering innate. Previous studies indicated AF and MT during strom formation. Initial study used cytoskeletal inhibitors implicating AF and MT during strom, suggesting AF promote while MT restrict strom and plast movement. Strom visualized by differential contrast interacting with AF labeled GFP-Talin and rearranging AF changed strom morphology. Movement AF implicated by myosin XI domain and small domain localizing chloroplast. Knockdown myos XI disrupted strom or quantitatively decreased plastids with strom. However, dynamics along AF were not examined. Longer myos XI domain and full myos XI do not localize chloroplast. Time-lapse confocal microscopy of strom and AF dynamics was conducted.

In future, molecular components for strom dynamics and movement and importance peruclear clustering during immunity will be investigated. Stromules play a role in innate and programmed cell death. During response, chloroplast move nucleus and chloroplast connections are established. Mechanism behind peruclear clustering and chlor interactions unknown. Results indicate AF and MT during peruclear clustering. MT promote strom extensions, contributing strom movement, while AF position chloroplast towards nucleus. Reinforce AF as points for strom previously shown in Arabidopsis hypocotyl and study showing strom maintaining contact with nuclei. Model during effector immunity, MT facilitate strom extensions and strom bind AF around nuclei. Role MT during formation requires studies, but data suggests connections formed, strom guide or pull chloroplast nucleus, resulting peruclear clustering.

    Title: Robust and accurate prediction of residue–residue interactions across protein interfaces using evolutionary information
    Abstract: Do the amino acid sequence identities of residues that make contact across protein interfaces covary during evolution? If so, such covariance could be used to predict contacts across interfaces and assemble models of biological complexes. We find that residue pairs identified using a pseudo-likelihood-based method to covary across protein–protein interfaces in the 50S ribosomal unit and 28 additional bacterial protein complexes with known structure are almost always in contact in the complex, provided that the number of aligned sequences is greater than the average length of the two proteins. We use this method to make subunit contact predictions for an additional 36 protein complexes with unknown structures, and present models based on these predictions for the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic ( TRAP ) transporter, the tripartite efflux system, the pyruvate formate lyase-activating enzyme complex, and the methionine ABC transporter.

   ., 2009; Dago et al., 2012 ). In this study, we examine residue–residue covariation across protein–protein interfaces using a pseudo-likelihood-based statistical method. In a large set of complexes of known structure, we find that covarying pairs of positions are almost always in contact in the three-dimensional structure, provided there are sufficient aligned sequences. We find further that significant residue–residue covariance occurs frequently between physically interacting protein pairs but very rarely between non-interacting pairs, and hence should be useful for predicting whether two proteins interact. We use the pseudo-likelihood method to predict contacts across protein-interfaces for 36 evolutionarily conserved complexes of unknown structure and present structure models for four of the complexes particularly well constrained by these data.

Our results demonstrate unequivocally that there is strong selective pressure at protein–protein interfaces beyond simple residue conservation, and that co-evolving residue pairs are nearly always in contact in the protein complex. Not all contacting residues across protein interfaces likely co-evolve nor all protein–protein interfaces. Nevertheless, as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, there is clearly sufficient coevolutionary signal to significantly constrain models of a large number of protein complexes. There is a notable contrast in the utility of intra-monomer and intersubunit predicted contacts for structure modeling. We found previously ( Kamisetty et al., 2013 ) that contacts could be predicted with high accuracy for monomeric proteins, provided there were sufficient aligned sequences, but in such cases there was almost always already a structure of a family member from which comparative models could be built, limiting the utility of the predicted contacts in structure prediction ( Though predicted contacts can be useful in modeling allosteric changes in protein structures [Hopf et al., 2012; Morcos et al., 2013] ). In contrast, here we find that more than half of the complexes for which the protein families of the constituent subunits are sufficiently large for accurate contact prediction do not currently have three-dimensional structures. Hence, while predicted contacts can be very accurate for both monomeric globular proteins and for protein–protein complexes, they are more useful for structure modeling for the latter due to the much poorer representation of protein complexes in the PDB. While our approach of constructing a global statistical model from paired sequence alignments is generally applicable to any taxa, the current study focuses on prokaryotes and mitochondria. Doing so allows us to largely avoid the problem of distinguishing between paralogs by exploiting the operon architecture of bacterial genomes ( Jacob et al

We began by studying residue–residue coupling parameters in the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit—the largest evolutionarily conserved bacterial multiprotein complex with an atomic resolution structure. For each individual protein in the complex, we constructed multiple sequence alignments by querying the UniProt sequence database ( Wu et al., 2006 ) for homologous sequences. For every pair of proteins in the complex, we then constructed a paired multiple sequence alignment ( ‘Materials and methods’ ). For each such paired alignment, we built a GREMLIN global statistical model, computed normalized coupling strengths from the two body coupling parameters, and ranked inter protein residue pairs based on these scores ( ‘Materials and methods’ ). A coupling strength larger than one indicates higher than average coupling between two residues. We find that in the 50S ribosomal subunit only a small fraction of residue pairs coevolve, as indicated by coupling strengths ( y axis of Figure 1A ) greater than 1. 5. Remarkably, the two residues in each of these pairs are almost all within 8 Å of each other in the 50S crystal structure ( Figure 1A ) and all are within 12 Å. The locations of the covarying residue pairs in the 50S structure ( with the individual proteins pulled apart for clarity ) are shown in Figure 1B; yellow lines indicate distances less than 8 Å and orange lines, distances less than 12 Å. For the 50S ribosome, the GREMLIN model was built using sequence data from ∼1500 non-redundant genomes; Figure 1D suggests that for complexes with such large numbers of aligned sequence, residue–residue interactions across interfaces can be predicted with quite high confidence based on amino acid sequence covariation. 10. 7554/eLife. 02030. 003Figure 1. Residue pairs with high normalized coupling strengths are in contact in the 50S ribosomal subunit

These predictions should contribute to the determination of the structures of these biologically important complexes. 10. 7554/eLife. 02030. 007Figure 3. Predicted residue–residue interactions across protein interfaces of unknown structure. Strongly co-evolving residue pairs for complexes without known structure that had at least one prediction with GREMLIN score greater than or equal to 0. 85.

Full dataset is provided with the deposited data. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02030. 007 Are the predicted contacts useful in assembling models of the protein complex from models of each component? We evaluated this on a docking test set containing 18 protein complexes from the benchmark set where at least one component ( or a close homolog ) had a known structure in the apo form ( ‘Materials and methods’, docking test-set ). We developed a docking protocol that used the predicted contacts as distance restraints and sampled the space of physically plausible structures to generate models of the protein–protein complex. The model with the best restraint score had an interface that was within 4 Å ( in root mean square deviation ) of the native interface in 14 of the 18 cases and had more than half the native contacts in 16 of the 18 cases ( Figure 4A, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ). Two of the cases in which the iRMSD ( interface root-mean-square deviation ) was the highest ( bottom of table in A ) are illustrated in Figure 4B–C: the high iRMSD is due to large changes in the conformation of one of the monomers upon binding; despite these changes the binding interface is reasonably accurately identified

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02030. 004 For a large protein–protein complex, can the sum of the coupling strengths between pairs of proteins in the complex be used to distinguish directly interacting and non-interacting protein pairs? In the 50S subunit, every pair of proteins with summed coupling strengths ( numbers in Figure 1C ) greater than 1. 5 interacts with each other ( boxes in Figure 1C ). There are, however, several instances of protein pairs that contact in the 50S subunit for which no covariance is observed; clearly not every interaction will be identified by the sum of the coupling strengths, for example between two proteins that are held together primarily by the ribosomal RNA. How many aligned sequences are required for accurate contact prediction? To assess the dependence on alignment depth, we generated paired sub-alignments with varying numbers of sequences for every pair of 50S proteins and recomputed coupling strengths for each sub-alignment. For each alignment depth, we calculated the fraction of residue pairs within 12 Å for different ranges of coupling strengths. We find that the greater the number of aligned sequences, the lower the value of the coupling strength above which residue pairs are likely to be in contact in the structure ( Figure 1D ). For example, if the number of aligned sequences is greater than the sum of the lengths of the two proteins, residue–residue contact predictions are likely to be accurate if the coupling strength is 2 or greater ( Figure 1D: orange dots ), while if there are twice as many sequences, contact predictions are accurate above a coupling strength of 1. 5 ( the cutoff shown in Figure 1A ). A sigmoidal function of the coupling strength and the number of sequences per position in the complex accurately fits the observed contact frequency data ( ‘Materials and methods’ and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) ; we refer to the fitted values as GREMLIN scores for the remainder of the paper

  Researchers have developed a method to predict residue-residue interactions across protein interfaces using evolutionary information. They found that pairs of residues that covary across protein interfaces are almost always in contact in the 3D structure, provided there are sufficient aligned sequences. This method was used to predict contacts for 36 protein complexes with unknown structures and models for 4 complexes, including the tripart ATP-independent periplasm (TR) transporter, tripart efflux system, pyruvate form lyase-activating enzyme, and methine ABC transporter. The results show that there is strong selective pressure on protein interfaces beyond residue conservation and co-evolving pairs are nearly in contact in the complex. However, not all contacting residues across interfaces co-evolve nor all protein interfaces.

The method was tested on the 50S ribosomal subunit, the largest evolutionarily conserved multiprotein complex with atomic structure. For each protein in the complex, multiple alignments were constructed by querying the Uni sequence database for homologs. For each pair of proteins, a paired alignment was built and a GREIN statistical model computed coupling strengths. The results show that only a fraction of pairs co-evolve, indicated by coupling strengths greater than 1.5, and the residues are almost within 8Å of each other in the 50 structure. The method was used to predict contacts for 36 complexes with unknown structures and models for 4 complexes, including the tripart ATP-independent peripl (TR) transporter, tripart efflux, pyvate formase-activating enzyme, and methine ABC. The results show that residue-residue interactions across interfaces can be predicted with high confidence based on amino sequence covariance.

    Title: Active sensing in the categorization of visual patterns
    Abstract: Interpreting visual scenes typically requires us to accumulate information from multiple locations in a scene. Using a novel gaze-contingent paradigm in a visual categorization task, we show that participants' scan paths follow an active sensing strategy that incorporates information already acquired about the scene and knowledge of the statistical structure of patterns. Intriguingly, categorization performance was markedly improved when locations were revealed to participants by an optimal Bayesian active sensor algorithm. By using a combination of a Bayesian ideal observer and the active sensor algorithm, we estimate that a major portion of this apparent suboptimality of fixation locations arises from prior biases, perceptual noise and inaccuracies in eye movements, and the central process of selecting fixation locations is around 70% efficient in our task. Our results suggest that participants select eye movements with the goal of maximizing information about abstract categories that require the integration of information from multiple locations.

    Supporting Text:
   . In contrast, our work shows that high-efficiency active sensing is a natural strategy for eye movements that humans adopt without overt deliberation, as evidenced by the inter-saccadic intervals matching naturalistic tasks and the fact that our participants reached near-asymptotic efficiency already in the first session of our task. Second, by using a pattern categorization task we could ensure that no single location was especially informative but that the task required an integration of information from multiple locations both to select the next eye movement and to solve the task, and specifically that a closed-loop strategy was necessary for solving the task efficiently. This is in contrast with studies that attempted to quantify the general informativeness of single locations in a scene ( Gosselin and Schyns, 2001 ), and showed that they are the target of fixations humans tend to choose in general ( Peterson and Eckstein, 2012; Toscani et al., 2013; Chukoskie et al., 2013 ), or visual search in which, by the nature of the task, the target location is fully informative by itself ( Najemnik and Geisler, 2005 ). As such, most previous studies have not addressed the important interplay between information gathering and fixation selection characteristic of naturalistic active sensing: that, in general, the most informative location is ever-changing, dependent on the history of fixations one has already performed. Third, in contrast to active sensing for simple visual search ( Najemnik and Geisler, 2005; Navalpakkam et al., 2010; Morvan and Maloney, 2012 ), our formalism extends the range of active sensing to tasks which have arbitrary, not necessarily spatial, latent features ( such as categories ). In particular, it provides the first fixation-by-fixation analysis of information gathering under active eye movements by carefully matching our observer model to participants’ performance

. For maximal efficiency, this requires a closed loop interaction between perception, which integrates information from the locations already fixated with prior knowledge about the prevalence of different animals and their fur patterns, and thus maintains beliefs about which animal might be present in the image, and the planning of eye movement, which should direct the next fixation at a location which has potentially the most information relevant for the categorization ( Figure 1 ). Inspired by this example, and to allow a mathematically tractable quantification of the information at any fixation location, we designed an experiment with visual patterns that were statistically well-controlled and relatively simple, while ensuring that foveal vision would dominate by using a gaze-contingent categorization task in which we tracked the eye and successively revealed small apertures of the image at each fixation location. In contrast to previous studies ( Najemnik and Geisler, 2005; Renninger et al., 2007; Peterson and Eckstein, 2012; Morvan and Maloney, 2012 ), our task required multiple locations to be visited to extract information about abstract pattern categories. 10. 7554/eLife. 12215. 003Figure 1. Active sensing involves an interplay between perception and action. When trying to categorize whether a fur hidden behind foliage ( left ) belongs to a zebra or a cheetah, evidence from multiple fixations ( blue, the visible patches of the fur, and their location in the image ) needs to be integrated to generate beliefs about fur category ( right, here represented probabilistically, as the posterior probability of the particular animal given the evidence ). Given current beliefs, different potential locations in the scene will be expected to have different amounts of informativeness with regard to further distinguishing between the categories, and optimal sensing involves choosing the maximally informative location ( red )

Although our participants performed better when revealings were chosen by the BAS algorithm than with their own scan paths, our results suggest that this suboptimality in participants’ performance was to a large part due to prior biases, perception noise, and saccadic inaccuracies constraining the selection of fixation locations rather than an inefficient active sensing strategy. In particular, our participants’ eye movements were substantially more efficient than heuristic strategies that only employed a subset of the elements of a fully closed-loop active sensing strategy, and were about 70% as efficient as the optimal active sensor that operated with the participants’ own prior bias, perception noise, and saccadic inaccuracies. Importantly, this estimate does not conflate the inference process with the selection process in that even if the participant’s inference is biased or inconsistent, we can measure, given those beliefs, the extent to which they select fixation locations optimally. The 30% inefficiency we found may be due to unmodeled constraints in human eye movement strategies, such as the biases for cardinal directions or fixating the centre of an image that were apparent in our data ( Figure 3A ) and that may also be beneficial in natural environments ( Tatler and Vincent, 2008; 2009 ). Such suboptimalities are conceptually different from those that we factored out using the specific biases and noise included in the BAS model. The latter are suboptimalities that arise in the execution of a planned saccade ( as in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ), while the former could be suboptimalities of the planning itself. Therefore, as we were interested in the degree of ( sub ) optimality of the planning component, we chose not to factor out potential biases for cardinal directions or locations

Several lines of evidence suggest that humans and other animals direct their sensors ( e. g. their eyes, whiskers, or hands ) so as to extract task-relevant information efficiently ( Yarbus, 1967; Kleinfeld et al., 2006; Lederman and Klatzky, 1987 ). Indeed, in vision, the pattern of eye movements used to scan a scene depends on the type of information sought ( Hayhoe and Ballard, 2005; Rothkopf et al., 2007 ), and has been implied to follow from an active strategy ( Najemnik and Geisler, 2005; Renninger et al., 2007; Navalpakkam et al., 2010; Nelson and Cottrell, 2007; Toscani et al., 2013; Chukoskie et al., 2013 ) in which each saccade depends on the information gathered about the current visual scene and prior knowledge about scene statistics. However, until now, studies of such active sensing have either been limited to search tasks or to qualitative descriptions of the active sensing process. In particular, no studies have shown whether the information acquired by each individual fixation is being optimized. Rather, the fixation patterns have either been described without a tight link to optimality ( Ballard et al., 1995; Epelboim and Suppes, 2001 ) or compared to an optimal strategy only through summary statistics such as the total number of eye movements and the distribution of saccade vectors ( Najemnik and Geisler, 2005; 2008 ) that could have arisen through a heuristic. Therefore, these studies leave open the question as to what extent eye movements truly follow an active optimal strategy. In order to study eye movements in a more principled quantitative manner, we estimated the efficiency of eye movements in a high-level task on a fixation-by-fixation basis

. Should such suboptimalities turn out to be part of the execution process, then our estimate of 70% would become a lower bound on the efficiency of the planning process. Our results contrast with recent studies suggesting that the pattern of eye movements do not follow an active sensing strategy. In one study, using a simple object localization task, it was found that the choice of fixation locations was close to random despite obvious learning of the underlying stimulus statistics ( Holm et al., 2012 ). In another study, using a simplified visual search task, participants’ eye movements were virtually unaffected by the configuration of the visual stimuli presented in the trial ( Morvan and Maloney, 2012 ). In contrast, we found that participants used both their prior knowledge of stimulus statistics as well as evidence accumulated about the current visual scene to guide their eye movements. We speculate that better performance in our case may be due to our more naturalistic task, which involves the extraction of abstract latent features, revealing more typical processing of the sensorimotor system. Although our task was designed to emulate many features of natural vision, there remain several differences. First, our gaze-contingent display involved exposing small patches of the image at each fixation whereas in natural vision information is gathered from the entire field of view. Second, our task was a categorization rather than search, which may have different requirements for eye movements. Nonetheless, our results suggest that active sensing is a natural strategy for eye movements in tasks that require integration of information from multiple locations.

    Title: Molecular determinants of large cargo transport into the nucleus
    Abstract: Nucleocytoplasmic transport is tightly regulated by the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ). Among the thousands of molecules that cross the NPC, even very large ( >15 nm ) cargoes such as pathogens, mRNAs and pre-ribosomes can pass the NPC intact. For these cargoes, there is little quantitative understanding of the requirements for their nuclear import, especially the role of multivalent binding to transport receptors via nuclear localisation sequences ( NLSs ) and the effect of size on import efficiency. Here, we assayed nuclear import kinetics of 30 large cargo models based on four capsid-like particles in the size range of 17–36 nm, with tuneable numbers of up to 240 NLSs. We show that the requirements for nuclear transport can be recapitulated by a simple two-parameter biophysical model that correlates the import flux with the energetics of large cargo transport through the NPC. Together, our results reveal key molecular determinants of large cargo import in cells.

    Supporting Text:
    Our approach based on modified capsids with tuneable surface properties and quantitative imaging in permeabilised cells enabled us to arrive at a substantially enhanced quantitative understanding of large cargo transport through the NPC. Assaying nuclear import kinetics in an unprecedented cargo size and #NLSs range, we have shown that the requirements for transport scale non-linearly with size and can be recapitulated by a two-parameter biophysical model that correlates the import flux to the energetic requirements for nuclear transport. For small cargo transport, biochemical or physicochemical properties of the cargo surface have been shown to influence nuclear transport ( Frey et al., 2018; Naim et al., 2009 ). While we do not claim that surface effects play no role in large cargo transport, based on the prediction from our experimental assay we would suggest that the binding of multiple Importin complexes seem to partially mask the cargo surface properties. Our work significantly expands the range of sizes and #NLSs for which nuclear import has been characterised: Tu et al., 2013 previously reported a single molecule study of a β-galactosidase cargo, which has four NLSs. This approximately cylindrical molecule is 18 nm at its longest axis, similar to MS2S37P, and 9 nm along its shorter axis. If the cargo crosses the NPC in a favourable orientation ( through its narrow end ), this would result in a lower cost of insertion and explain well why for this substrate 4 NLSs are sufficient for import ( Tu et al., 2013 ). By comparison, our smallest cargo, MS2S37P, which is spherical with a 17 nm diameter, was not substantially imported below 10 NLSs within the timeframe of our assay. For the larger MS2, more than 30 NLSs were required to detect a clear signal. It is important to note that in addition to cargo shape ( Mohr et al

Cargo transport across the nuclear envelope is a hallmark of eukaryotic cells and is central to cellular viability ( Knockenhauer and Schwartz, 2016; Jamali et al., 2011; Fahrenkrog and Aebi, 2003 ). In a typical HeLa cell, more than 2000 nuclear pore complexes ( NPCs ) span the nuclear envelope ( Ribbeck and Görlich, 2001; Maul et al., 1972 ). With ≈120 MDa in metazoans ( Reichelt et al., 1990 ) and roughly half that weight in yeast ( Rout and Blobel, 1993; Yang et al., 1998 ), the NPC is among the largest macromolecular complexes found inside the cell. NPCs are the gatekeepers of nucleocytoplasmic transport and restrict access of cargoes larger than the typically reported threshold of 40 kDa ( Paine et al., 1975; Keminer and Peters, 1999; Mohr et al., 2009 ), albeit recent work points to a rather ‘soft’ barrier model and a gradual decrease of passive transport rates with size ( Timney et al., 2016 ). However, cargoes that present a nuclear localisation sequence ( NLS ) and bind nuclear transport receptors ( NTRs ) can rapidly enter into the nucleus. Several studies have characterized the NTR-mediated transport process, typically focusing on cargoes with one to five NLSs, and their nuclear import kinetics have been shown to follow a mono-exponential behaviour ( Ribbeck and Görlich, 2001; Kopito and Elbaum, 2007; Timney et al., 2006 ). NPCs are remarkable in the diversity of sizes of cargoes they can transport, ranging from import of nuclear proteins ( including histones and transcription factors ), to viral import and nuclear export of pre-ribosomal subunits and mRNA complexes ( Panté and Kann, 2002; Grünwald and Singer, 2010; Grünwald et al., 2011; Babcock et al., 2004; Mor et al., 2010; Au and Panté, 2012 ). How very large cargoes ( >15 nm ) can be efficiently transported is still an enigma, especially considering the dimensions and structure of the transport conduit itself

. However, additional mechanisms would be required for cargo release into the nucleoplasm such as the previously reported structural destabilisation of mature capsids ( Cui et al., 2013 ) or other mechanism that can disassemble capsid that are docked at the NPC. Collectively, this suggests that 36 nm capsids might be able to enter the NPC barrier, but are too large to pass the NPC intact into the nucleus ( i. e. undock or release ). We, thus, focus our global quantitative analysis on the three capsids for which we could experimentally identify conditions of functional import and nuclear enrichment. Our results on large cargo import kinetics ( Figure 3 ) highlight the strikingly different #NLS requirements for the nuclear import of differently sized cargoes. We formulate here a biophysical model that considers the translocation of a large ‘spherical object’ through the crowded NPC permeability barrier ( scheme in Figure 5A ) and enables us to extract key information about the energetics of transport from our kinetic data. The final steady state accumulation and the late kinetics of the capsid import are affected by a number of factors that are still incompletely understood – such as the competition between Ran and NTRs for the cargo, the back leakage of the cargo into the cytoplasm and potential clogging of the pores by the capsids ( Kim and Elbaum, 2013a; Kim and Elbaum, 2013b ). For this reason, we focus our quantitative analysis on the initial flux J ( slope of the kinetic curve at the initial time point ). Unlike the steady state accumulation, the initial flux J of cargoes into the nucleus is independent of the rates of cargo-NTR dissociation kinetics and is less affected by any potential rate-limiting steps in the Ran cycle ( Kim and Elbaum, 2013a; Kim and Elbaum, 2013b; Görlich et al., 2003 )

We used a combination of spectroscopy and semi-automated microscopy assays to investigate the kinetics of nuclear import of cargoes ranging from 17 to 36 nm in diameter and with a number of NLSs between 0 and 240 in permeabilised cells. Our results uncovered the quantitative dependence of cargo size and NLS number in an understudied size range. The results are rationalized using a minimal physical model of nuclear transport that takes into account the energy gain from NTR binding to FG motifs, and the free energy cost needed for the insertion of a large particle into a densely filled channel.

., 2009 ), its mechanical stability and rigidity are likely to play a role in nucleocytoplasmic transport: the import rate of proteins is inversely correlated with its mechanical stability ( Infante et al., 2019 ), and flexibility is likely relevant for the transport of large deformable synthetic cargoes, such as polymer vesicles ( Zelmer et al., 2020 ). While our simple biophysical model can explain the experimental data very well with only two fitting parameters per capsid ( FR and ϵ ) it also raises several interesting questions. The model provides quantitative estimates of the free energy cost of capsid insertion into the FG Nup assembly, as well as the effective binding energy needed to compensate for the insertion cost. Notably, despite the fact that a single MS2 capsid already occupies ≈1/3 of the estimated volume of the central NPC channel ( Isgro and Schulten, 2005 ) ( as illustrated in the cartoon in Figure 5 ) the free energy cost of insertion is relatively low ( on the order of a few kBT’s ), and is similar for the capsids of different sizes. This might indicate that further mechanisms facilitate large cargo transport, such as NPC scaffold dilation, a hypothesis supported also by multiple evidences for tentative hinge elements in the NPC scaffold structures ( Bui et al., 2013; Kelley et al., 2015 ), or bistability in the FG density in the radial direction induced by such extremely large cargo ( Osmanović et al., 2013 ). In terms of the effective interaction energy ϵ, the largest MS2 capsid required a fit with the lowest effective binding energy, while the smallest caps with the highest. This is consistent with the idea that multiple NTRs mask the surface properties of the capsid and reduce the effective interaction with the FG. Our results suggest that the binding of multiple NTR to the capsid is sufficient to compensate for the energetic cost of insertion into the NPC, and that the number of Ns required depends on the size of the capsid. This is supported by the fact that the smallest caps with the lowest number of Ns ( 10 ) were not imported within the timeframe of our assay, while larger caps with more than 30 Ns were imported efficiently. This is in line with the idea that the binding of multiple NTR to the capsid reduces the effective interaction with the FG and compensates for the energetic cost of insertion, and that the number of Ns required depends on the size of the caps. Our results also suggest that the binding of multiple NTR to the capsid is sufficient to mask the surface properties of the caps and reduce the interaction with the FG. This is supported by the fact that the smallest caps with the lowest number of N ( 10 ) were not imported within the timeframe of our assay, while larger caps with more than 30 N were imported efficiently. This is in line with the idea that binding multiple NTR to the capsid reduces the effective interaction with FG and compensates the energetic of insertion, and the number of N depends on the size of caps. Our results also suggest that the binding multiple N to the caps is sufficient to mask the surface of caps and reduce the interaction FG. This supported by the fact that smallest with lowest N ( 10 ) not imported within timeframe our assay, larger with more than 30 imported efficiently. This in line that multiple N to caps reduces effective FG and compensates insertion, and number depends size.

    Title: CD28 expression is required after T cell priming for helper T cell responses and protective immunity to infection
    Abstract: The co-stimulatory molecule CD28 is essential for activation of helper T cells. Despite this critical role, it is not known whether CD28 has functions in maintaining T cell responses following activation. To determine the role for CD28 after T cell priming, we generated a strain of mice where CD28 is removed from CD4+ T cells after priming. We show that continued CD28 expression is important for effector CD4+ T cells following infection; maintained CD28 is required for the expansion of T helper type 1 cells, and for the differentiation and maintenance of T follicular helper cells during viral infection. Persistent CD28 is also required for clearance of the bacterium Citrobacter rodentium from the gastrointestinal tract. Together, this study demonstrates that CD28 persistence is required for helper T cell polarization in response to infection, describing a novel function for CD28 that is distinct from its role in T cell priming.

    CD28 is essential for CD4+ T cell priming and differentiation into effector T cell subsets, and here, we demonstrate a previously undescribed role for CD28 following T cell activation. We show that CD28 expression is required after T cell priming for the expansion of Th1 cells and for the differentiation and maintenance of Tfh cells. Maintained CD28 expression is also required for clearance of the enteropathic bacteria C. rodentium after oral infection. Our data demonstrate that even though maintained CD28 expression is required for both Th1 and Tfh cells, the downstream effects of CD28 are different for each of these cell types. The impaired numbers of Th1 at day 7 but not earlier in the response is likely to be due to reduced proliferation of activated CD4+ T cells, which is IL-2-driven at this time in the response ( Sarawar and Doherty, 1994 ). This observation is supported by previous in vitro experiments that show activated Th1 cells, but not Th2 cells, require CD80/86 for IL-2 production and proliferation in vitro ( Schweitzer and Sharpe, 1998 ). In contrast, proliferation of Tfh-precursors is independent of IL-2 ( Choi et al., 2011 ), and consistent with this, we have shown that Tfh-precursors from Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ mice have comparable proliferation rates to controls. However, Tfh-precursors from Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ mice are reduced in number, and this is most pronounced in cells that have lost CD28. This occurs at a time in the response where B cells provide a second round of antigen presentation to Tfh-precursors, allowing for stabilization of Bcl-6 expression and full differentiation into Tfh cells ( Baumjohann et al., 2011; Choi et al., 2011 ), suggesting that CD28:CD80/86 interactions are important for Tfh differentiation during early T:B interactions. We identified that CD28 is also required for maintenance of the Tfh population in established germinal centers, by preventing apoptosis of these cells

. The expression of CD28 and its ligands increases progressively after priming, raising the possibility that CD28 signaling is utilized during the effector phase of the immune response. Despite the central role of CD28 signaling in T cell biology, a role for sustained CD28 expression in CD4+ T cell subset differentiation and maintenance has not been described. This is likely to be because the role for CD28 after T cell priming is difficult to determine experimentally. CD28-deficient helper T cells do not become activated, and thus cannot be used to evaluate the role for CD28 after T cell priming. Moreover, CD28 has two ligands, CD80 and CD86, which it shares with the inhibitory receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 ( CTLA-4 ). Consequently, manipulating CD80/86 cannot be used to draw conclusions on the role of CD28 alone, as CTLA-4 ligation will also be affected. The role for CD28 on activated T cells is particularly pertinent as CD28 expression is lost on a proportion of activated T cells with age, in HIV infection, and in the number of immune disorders in primates ( but not rodents ) ( Weng et al., 2009; Aberg, 2012; Broux et al., 2012 ), and the functional consequence of this loss of CD28 is unknown. In addition, the CD28 pathway is an area of considerable research interest as it can be manipulated by a number of therapeutics: blocking this pathway is being used to treat autoimmune and inflammatory disease and to prevent transplant rejection ( Salomon and Bluestone, 2001 ). In contrast, engaging this pathway can expand anti-tumor T cells and regulatory T cells ( Carreno et al., 2005 ). Because of the considerable therapeutic potential of this pathway, understanding its biology is of direct clinical relevance. Studies have suggested that CD28 may play a role following T cell priming, for example blocking CD28 ligands during an ongoing immune response can impair the germinal center response ( Han et al

T cell activation requires two signals: peptide in the context of the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) interacting with the T cell receptor ( TCR ), and a co-stimulatory signal ( Lafferty and Cunningham, 1975 ). The binding of CD28 to its ligands, CD80/CD86, initiates a transcriptional program that enables effective T cell proliferation and differentiation. In the absence of CD28 signaling T cells fail to respond, and become anergic ( Diehn et al., 2002; Riley et al., 2002 ). CD28 signaling is essential for multiple facets of CD4+ T cell activation ( Harding et al., 1992 ), including proliferation, survival ( Boise et al., 1995 ), glucose metabolism ( Frauwirth et al., 2002 ), and migration ( Marelli-Berg et al., 2007 ). Consequently, CD28-deficient mice have reduced expansion of effector CD4+ T cells and do not form T helper type 1 ( Th1 ) and T follicular helper ( Tfh ) cells after infection or immunization. Tfh cells provide growth and differentiation signals to germinal center B cells, enabling them to exit the germinal center as long-lived plasma cells or memory B cells ( Crotty, 2011 ). Th1 cells are formed during a Type 1 immune response and facilitate the clearance of intracellular pathogens ( Zhu and Paul, 2010 ). Impaired formation of Tfh and Th1 cells results in impaired cellular and humoral immunity to foreign antigens in CD28-deficient mice ( Shahinian et al., 1993; Green et al., 1994; Ferguson et al., 1996; King et al., 1996; Mittrucker et al., 1996; Walunas et al., 1996; Walker et al., 1999; Bertram et al., 2002 ). From this extensive body of literature, it is clear that CD28 signaling plays an essential role in CD4+ T cell priming and the formation of effector T cell subsets, but this has made it difficult to determine whether CD28 signaling also contributes to the ongoing immune response, as downstream phenotypes may be due to defective initial activation of CD28-deficient T cells

. The results presented here demonstrate that continued CD28 signaling is required following T cell activation for an effective primary CD4+ T cell response to infection. In addition, there is evidence that CD28 is required for the initiation of CD4+ T cell memory responses. Recent work from Ndlovu et al. ( 2014 ) used an inducible deletion system to remove CD28 prior to secondary infection with Nippostronglus brasiliensis, a nematode that induces a Th2-skewed response. The authors show that deletion of CD28, after clearance of the first infection and prior to re-infection, resulted in fewer Th2 cells and Tfh cells forming in response to secondary infection. This demonstrates that CD28 signaling is required for the initiation of the CD4+ memory T cell response, in addition to being required throughout the primary immune response to infection. CD28 signaling is essential for the formation of regulatory T cells and for their suppressive function in the periphery ( Zhang et al., 2013 ). We have shown here that CD28 is also required for the presence of the Tfr and Tbet+ Treg subsets. The lack of Tbet+ Treg and Tfr cells in Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ mice suggests that the germinal center and the Th1 response are not under the normal Treg-mediated control ( Koch et al., 2009; Chung et al., 2011; Linterman et al., 2011 ), and this would likely result in a relative expansion of these cells. Mixed bone marrow chimera experiments, in which wild-type Tregs are present from control bone marrow show Tfh and Th1 from Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ are almost absent. This may suggest that, in the presence of an intact Treg compartment, effector Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ T cells are less likely to expand. This is consistent with the idea that CD28 is required for Treg suppressive function in the periphery ( Zhang et al,2013 ), as Treg cells from Cd28flox/flox Oxcre mice have reduced suppressive function in vitro.
Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative bacterium, colonizes the stomach and causes stomach ulcers and gastric cancers. Its helical shape is necessary for efficient colonization. To investigate how H. pylori achieves helical shape while maintaining sidewall curvature, researchers employed metabolic probes to investigate PG patterning in H. pyl. Using super-resolution microscopy and 3D image analysis, they show synthesis is enhanced at negative curvature as well as a range of positive curvatures. They investigate localization of cytoskeletal proteins Mre and C. Demonstrate, in straight-rod E. coli, M is enriched at negative curvature, while C is at window of positive curv where synthesis observed. They propose both M and C help PG activity locally and patterning is one mechanism for helical shape maintenance.

Cm variants show altered polymer structures and fail to localize in vivo. Results are consistent with model where straight-rod is default for H. pyl cells and helical facilitated by major area synthesis via C to straightrod patter. Enrichment new wall to negative, expected for straight, and major axis indicates one mechanism achieving helical, but not sufficient hel maintenance. Difference between D-Al- and Murc suggests spatially-coordinated wall occurs. Curvature differences crosslink alter wall properties and density; PG at side may be less, requiring synthesis growth. Labeling allowed determine curvature insertion but spatial-regulated turnover may contribute wall homeostasis. Computational tools demonstrate H. pyl leverages C, which localizes to major axis, promotes positive curv on sidew and supplements M-associated synthesis at negative curv.

To probe wall patterns in H. pyl, metabolic probes label sugar (Murc) and peptide (Da) portions. Both indicate synthesis major and minor helical relative rest, but differences in enrichment magnitudes between Murc and Da. Da likely reports D-transpeid activity. H does not have functional D-transptases and detectable 3-crosslinks, complicating interpretation. Only Da incorporation at penta position. H has pentape-rich wall and unclear if regulates trimming. Protein C/H has weak carype activity in vitro.

    Title: Cdc48 regulates a deubiquitylase cascade critical for mitochondrial fusion
    Abstract: Cdc48/p97, a ubiquitin-selective chaperone, orchestrates the function of E3 ligases and deubiquitylases ( DUBs ). Here, we identify a new function of Cdc48 in ubiquitin-dependent regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. The DUBs Ubp12 and Ubp2 exert opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion and cleave different ubiquitin chains on the mitofusin Fzo1. We demonstrate that Cdc48 integrates the activities of these two DUBs, which are themselves ubiquitylated. First, Cdc48 promotes proteolysis of Ubp12, stabilizing pro-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1. Second, loss of Ubp12 stabilizes Ubp2 and thereby facilitates removal of ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 inhibiting fusion. Thus, Cdc48 synergistically regulates the ubiquitylation status of Fzo1, allowing to control the balance between activation or repression of mitochondrial fusion. In conclusion, we unravel a new cascade of ubiquitylation events, comprising Cdc48 and two DUBs, fine-tuning the fusogenic activity of Fzo1.

    Supporting Text:
    Cdc48 promotes degradation of Ubp12, controlling Fzo1 ubiquitylation. Ubp12 prevents mitochondrial fusion by two means. On the one hand, it removes the ubiquitylation on Fzo1 that is required for fusion. On the other hand, it promotes degradation of Ubp2. This leaves the anti-fusion ubiquitylation of Fzo1 unopposed, resulting in Fzo1 degradation. Therefore, by supporting turnover of Ubp12, Cdc48 dually preserves mitochondrial fusion events. In contrast, when only a non-functional variant of the protein is present, as is the case in cdc48-2 cells, Cdc48 cannot protect the pro-fusion ubiquitylation of Fzo1. In this case, the cascade will synergistically converge in degradation of Fzo1 and thus inhibition of mitochondrial fusion will occur. The interdependence between these two pathways contributes to a coordinated cellular decision by Cdc48 to either fuse mitochondria or instead prevent it by degrading Fzo1. Moreover, the Cdc48-Ubp12-Ubp2 cascade allows fine-tuning of substrate ubiquitylation and modulation of the biological processes thereof, as exemplified for Fzo1 and mitochondrial fusion ( Figure 9 ). Cdc48/p97 extracts ubiquitylated substrates from membranes, thus allowing their recognition and degradation by the proteasome ( Franz et al., 2014; Rape et al., 2001 ). This is exemplified with the ER protein Ubc6, and was also shown for mitochondrial OM proteins ( Neutzner et al., 2007 ), including mitofusins under damaging conditions ( Tanaka et al., 2010 ). Therefore, Cdc48/p97 and ubiquitin regulate mitochondrial fusion in both yeast and mammals. Moreover, eukaryotes present a similar ubiquitin pattern of mitofusins, suggesting that the new function of Cdc48 presented here could be conserved in mammals under non-damaging conditions

. Mitochondrial fusion is a complex multistep process dependent on sequential events involving GTP binding and hydrolysis by Fzo1, Fzo1 oligomerization and finally ubiquitylation of Fzo1 ( Anton et al., 2011; Brandt et al., 2016; Cohen et al., 2011; Ishihara et al., 2004 ). Although it is clear that ubiquitin critically determines mitochondrial fusion events, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown ( Anton et al., 2013 ). The DUBs Ubp12 and Ubp2 cleave different ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1 that either promote or repress mitochondrial fusion, respectively ( Anton et al., 2013 ). Here, given that Ubp12 regulates Ubp2, we show that these two ubiquitylation pathways are connected. Consistently, on Fzo1, Ubp12-specific ubiquitylation also precedes Ubp2-specific ubiquitylation. In fact, unopposed anti-fusion ubiquitylation, as it is the case in Δubp2 cells, disrupts mitochondrial tubulation. This renders the role of Ubp2 in mitochondrial dynamics quite clear, namely protecting mitochondrial fusion. In contrast, the need for a dedicated DUB that removes the pro-fusion ubiquitylation forms, i. e. the need for Ubp12, remained unclear. Now, the Ubp12-Ubp2 cascade allows to understand the purpose of Ubp12, solving the paradox of why inhibition of the pro-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1 is required: in fact, too much pro-fusion ubiquitylation also means too much anti-fusion ubiquitylation, a problem counteracted by the deubiquitylation activity of Ubp12 on Fzo1. We conclude that this cascade ensures a tight control of Fzo1 ubiquitylation at levels sufficient to allow mitochondrial fusion but preventing unnecessary ubiquitylation that instead targets Fzo1 for proteasomal turnover. The cascade between Ubp12 and Ubp2 also allows revising recent results linking Ubp2 and Mdm30 ( Cavellini et al., 2017 ). Mdm30 catalyzes the formation of the pro-fusion ubiquitin forms on Fzo1 ( Cohen et al., 2008 )

. Here, we identify a role of Cdc48 in mitochondrial fusion, as part of a novel enzymatic cascade consisting of Cdc48, Ubp12 and Ubp2. Cdc48 negatively regulates Ubp12, which negatively regulates Ubp2, explaining why these two DUBs exert opposite effects on their targets and on ubiquitin homeostasis.

. Second, deletion of UBP12 in cdc48-2 cells did not restore the steady state levels of Fzo1 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2E ). Notably, this is consistent with our previous observation that mitochondrial fusion depends on ubiquitylated rather than on the steady state levels of Fzo1 ( Anton et al., 2013 ). We noticed that increased levels of Fzo1, present in ∆ubp12 cells, specifically depended on Ubp2 ( Figure 5A ). Therefore, Ubp12 and Ubp2, which affect the stability of Fzo1 in opposite manners, are also interdependent. Next, we analyzed if Ubp2 and Ubp12 also presented other opposing and interdependent phenotypes related to ubiquitin. First, we analyzed cellular growth of cells lacking UBP2, UBP12 or both, in the presence of sub-lethal doses of CHX, a phenotype commonly tested to monitor imbalances in ubiquitin homeostasis ( Gerlinger et al., 1997; Hanna et al., 2003; Rumpf and Jentsch, 2006 ). Second, we directly quantified the levels of free ubiquitin vs. substrate-conjugated ubiquitin in the same strains. We observed that indeed Ubp2 and Ubp12 had opposite phenotypes ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ). In addition, the consistent interdependence of these two enzymes suggested a DUB hierarchy, which prompted us to test a possible regulation of the Ubp2 protein by Ubp12. We tested if Ubp2 is an unstable protein and whether Ubp12 is involved in its degradation, after inhibition of protein synthesis with CHX. The levels of genomically tagged Ubp2 decreased over time and Ubp2-turnover was regulated by Ubp12 ( Figure 5B ) and by the proteasome ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2A ). Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Ubp2 interacted with Ubp12, suggesting a direct regulation between both DUBs ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2B ). We therefore investigated if Ubp2 could be ubiquitylated, in a Ubp12-dependent manner. After immunoprecipitation of Ubp2-Flag, and consistent with recent observations ( Cavellini et al

., 2008 ). The pro-fusion forms are bound and cleaved by Ubp12, depend on lysine 464 of Fzo1, and are essential for mitochondrial fusion ( Anton et al., 2013 ). As to the anti-fusion ubiquitin forms on Fzo1, two types could now be observed: low molecular weight, K464-independent, anti-fusion ubiquitylation ( as seen in Figure 7A, lane 4 ), consistent with previous results ( Anton et al., 2013 ), but mostly high molecular weight anti-fusion ubiquitylation, instead K464-dependent ( as seen in Figure 7A, lane 3 ). This shows that the anti-fusion ubiquitin forms on Fzo1 largely depend on its pro-fusion forms. Therefore, it is not surprising that anti-fusion, Ubp2-specific, ubiquitylation on Fzo1 also largely depends on Mdm30. Nevertheless, future studies are required to clarify if Mdm30 itself catalyzes the formation of this high molecular weight fraction of the anti-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1. Moreover, it is clear that Mdm30 is not the ligase responsible for the anti-fusion low molecular weight ubiqulation of F1, as seen in Figure 7A, lane 4.

    Title: Categorical representation from sound and sight in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex of sighted and blind
    Abstract: Is vision necessary for the development of the categorical organization of the Ventral Occipito-Temporal Cortex ( VOTC )? We used fMRI to characterize VOTC responses to eight categories presented acoustically in sighted and early blind individuals, and visually in a separate sighted group. We observed that VOTC reliably encodes sound categories in sighted and blind people using a representational structure and connectivity partially similar to the one found in vision. Sound categories were, however, more reliably encoded in the blind than the sighted group, using a representational format closer to the one found in vision. Crucially, VOTC in blind represents the categorical membership of sounds rather than their acoustic features. Our results suggest that sounds trigger categorical responses in the VOTC of congenitally blind and sighted people that partially match the topography and functional profile of the visual response, despite qualitative nuances in the categorical organization of VOTC between modalities and groups.

    Supporting Text:
   . With these unsolved questions in mind, we relied on a series of complementary multivariate analyses in order to carry out a comprehensive mapping of the representational geometry underlying low-level ( acoustic or visual features mapping ) and categorical responses to images and sounds in the VOTC of sighted and early blind people. All together our results demonstrate that early visual deprivation triggers an extension of the intrinsic, partially non-visual, categorical organization of VOTC, potentially supported by a connectivity bias of portions of VOTC with specific large-scale functional brain networks. However, the categorical representation of the auditory stimuli in VOTC of both blind and sighted individuals exhibits different qualitative nuances compared to the categorical organization generated by visual stimuli in sighted people.

., 2004 ). A recent study demonstrated that the response patterns elicited by sounds of four different categories in the VOTC of blind people could successfully predict the categorical response to images of the same categories in the VOTC of sighted controls, suggesting overlapping distributed categorical responses in sighted for vision and in blind for sounds ( van den Hurk et al., 2017 ). All together, these studies suggest that there is more to the development of the categorical response of VOTC than meets the eye ( Collignon et al., 2012 ). However, these researches leave several important questions unanswered. If a spatial overlap exists between the sighted processing visual inputs and the blind processing non-visual material, whether VOTC represents similar informational content in both groups remains unknown. It is possible, for instance, that the overlap in categorical responses between groups comes from the fact that VOTC represents visual attributes in the sighted ( Arcaro and Livingstone, 2017; Gomez et al., 2019 ) and acoustic attributes in the blind due to crossmodal plasticity ( Bavelier and Neville, 2002 ). Indeed, several studies involving congenitally blind have shown that their occipital cortex may represent acoustic features – for instance frequencies ( Huber et al., 2019; Watkins et al., 2013 ) – which form the basis of the development of categorical selectivity in the auditory cortex ( Moerel et al., 2012 ). Such preferential responses for visual or acoustic features in the sighted and blind, respectively, may lead to overlapping patterns of activity for similar categories while implementing separate computations on the sensory inputs. Alternatively, it is possible that the VOTC of both groups code for higher-order categorical membership of stimuli presented in vision in sighted and audition in the blind, at least partial independently from low-level features of the stimuli

. All together, these results not only demonstrate that a categorical organization similar to the one found in vision could emerge in VOTC in absence of visual experience, but also that such categorical response to sounds is actually enhanced and more stable in congenitally blind people. Several studies have shown that in absence of vision, the occipital cortex enhances its response to non-visual information processing ( Collignon et al., 2012; Collignon et al., 2011; Sadato et al., 1998 ). However, people debate on the mechanistic principles guiding the expression of this crossmodal plasticity. For instance, it was suggested that early visual deprivation changes the computational nature of the occipital cortex which would reorganize itself for higher-level functions, distant from the ones typically implemented for visual stimuli in the same region ( Bedny, 2017 ). In contrast with this view, our results demonstrate that the expression of crossmodal plasticity, at least in VOTC ( see differences in EVC below ), is constrained by the inherent categorical structure endowed in this region. First, we highlighted remarkably similar functional profile of VOTC for visual and auditory stimuli in sighted and in early blind individuals ( Figure 4B ). In addition, we showed that VOTC is encoding a similar categorical dimension of the stimuli across different inputs of presentation and different visual experiences ( Figure 6B ). In support of such idea, we recently demonstrated that the involvement of right dorsal occipital region for arithmetic processing in blind people actually relates to the intrinsic ‘spatial’ nature of these regions, a process involved in specific arithmetic computation ( e. g. subtraction but not multiplication ) ( Crollen et al., 2019 ). Similarly, the involvement of VOTC during ‘language’ as observed in previous studies ( Bedny et al., 2011; Burton et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2017; Lane et al., 2015; Röder et al

. Our study goes beyond previous results in at least six significant ways. First, our results demonstrate that VOTC shows categorical responses to sounds in the sighted and the blind in a representational format partially similar to the one elicited by images of the same categories in sighted people ( see Figure 1B ). Observation of a similar categorical representational structure in VOTC for sounds and images in sighted people is crucial to support the idea that the intrinsic categorical organization of VOTC might be partially independent from vision even in sighted and that such intrinsic multisensory functional scaffolding may constrain the way crossmodal plasticity expresses in early blind people. Second, we observed that blind people show higher decoding accuracies and higher inter-subject consistency in the representation of auditory categories, and that the representational structure of visual categories in sighted was significantly closer to the structure of the auditory categories in blind than in sighted group ( see Figure 1B, Figure 3, Figure 4B, Figure 7 ). This points to the idea that in absence of feed-forward visual input, VOTC increases its intrinsic representation of non-visual information. Third, VOTC shows similar large-scale representational connectivity profiles when processing images in sighted and sounds in sighted and blind people ( see Figure 8 ). This result provides strong support to the general hypothesis that the functional tuning of a region is determined by large-scale connectivity patterns with regions involved in similar coding strategies ( Behrens and Sporns, 2012; Mahon and Caramazza, 2011; Passingham et al., 2002 ). Fourth, our design allowed us to investigate which dimension of our stimuli, either categorical membership or acoustic properties, may determine the response properties of VOTC to sounds

In our study, we demonstrate that VOTC reliably encodes the categorical membership of sounds from eight different categories in sighted and blind people, using a topography ( Figure 1B ), representational format ( Figure 4 ) and a representational connectivity profile ( Figure 8 ) partially similar to the one observed in response to images of similar categories in vision. Previous studies using linguistic stimuli had already suggested that VOTC may actually represent categorical information in a more abstracted fashion than previously thought ( Handjaras et al., 2016; Borghesani et al., 2016; Striem-Amit et al., 2018b; Peelen and Downing, 2017 ). However, even if the use of words is very useful in the investigation of pre-existing representation of concepts ( Martin et al., 2017 ), it prevents the investigation of a bottom-up perceptual processing. By contrast, in our study we used sensory-related non-linguistic stimuli ( i. e. sounds ) in order to investigate both the sensory ( acoustic ) and categorical nature of the representation implemented in VOTC. To the limit of our knowledge, only one recent study investigated the macroscopic functional organization of VOTC during categorical processing of auditory and visual stimuli in sighted and in blind individuals ( van den Hurk et al., 2017 ). They found that it is possible to predict the global large-scale distributed pattern of activity generated by different categories presented visually in sighted using the pattern of activity generated by the same categories presented acoustically in early blind. Relying on a different analytical stream, focusing on representational matrices extracted from pairwise decoding of our eight categories, our study confirms and extends those findings by showing that VOTC reliably encodes sound categories in blind people using a representational structure relatively similar to the one found in vision

The study investigated the representation of sound and sight in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOT) of sighted and congenitally blind individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results showed that VOT reliably encodes categories in both groups using a representational structure and connectivity similar to the one found in vision. However, sound categories were more reliably encoded in the blind group using a representational format closer to the one in vision. Crucially, VOT in the blind represents categorical membership of sounds rather than their acoustic features. The study suggests that sounds trigger categorical responses in VOT of congenally and sight people that match the topography and functional profile of the response despite nuances in the categorical organization of VOT between modalities.

The study used a series of multivariate analyses to map the representational geometry of low-level acoustic or visual features and categorical responses to images and sounds in VOT of sight and blind individuals. The results demonstrate that visual deprivation extends the intrinsic non-visual organization of VOT, supported by connectivity of V with large-scale brain networks. However, the representation of auditory in VOT of blind and sight individuals exhibits different nuances compared to the organization of visual in sight people.

The study found that VOT shows similar functional profiles for visual and auditory stimuli in sight and blind, and encodes categorical dimension of stimuli across inputs and experiences. The involvement of right occipital region for processing in blind relates to intrinsic spatial nature of regions involved in computation. The study goes beyond previous results by showing VOT categorical responses to sounds in sight and blind in representational format similar to images in sight people, and that blind show higher accuracies and inter-subject consistency in representation of auditory categories. The represent structure of visual in sight was closer to auditory in blind than sight group. VOT shows large-scale connectivity profiles processing images and sounds in sight and blind.

The study demonstrates that VOT encodes categorical membership of sounds in sight and blind using topography, represent format, and connectivity similar to images in vision. Previous studies suggested V may represent information in abstract fashion. The study used non-linguistic stimuli to investigate sensory and categorical nature of representation in VOT. The macro functional organization of VOT during auditory and visual in sight and blind was investigated. The study confirms findings by showing VOT encodes categories in blind using represent structure similar to vision.

    Title: Robust manipulation of the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster by a fungal pathogen in the laboratory
    Abstract: Many microbes induce striking behavioral changes in their animal hosts, but how they achieve this is poorly understood, especially at the molecular level. Mechanistic understanding has been largely constrained by the lack of an experimental system amenable to molecular manipulation. We recently discovered a strain of the behavior-manipulating fungal pathogen Entomophthora muscae infecting wild Drosophila, and established methods to infect D. melanogaster in the lab. Lab-infected flies manifest the moribund behaviors characteristic of E. muscae infection: hours before death, they climb upward, extend their proboscides, affixing in place, then raise their wings, clearing a path for infectious spores to launch from their abdomens. We found that E. muscae invades the nervous system, suggesting a direct means by which the fungus could induce behavioral changes. Given the vast molecular toolkit available for D. melanogaster, we believe this new system will enable rapid progress in understanding how E. muscae manipulates host behavior.

   . g. Figure 3E ). Our measurements are most similar to primary conidia from E. muscae sensu strictu rather than other members of the E. muscae species complex ( Supplementary file 2 ). E. muscae sensu strictu isolates have often been observed to infect house flies ( Musca domestica ) ( MacLeod et al., 1976; Keller, 2007 ). To gauge if E. muscae ‘Berkeley’ is capable of causing patent infection in hosts outside of Drosophilidae, we exposed house flies to E. muscae ‘Berkeley’-infected D. melanogaster using a modified version of our propagation protocol. We observed flies that died and subsequently sporulated, indicating that they had been killed by the fungus ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). To gain a first comprehensive look into how E. muscae 'Berkeley' infection progresses in D. melanogaster at the molecular level, we next measured how transcription changes in both host and fungus at 24 hr time points over 5 days. We knew that in any given exposure vial there are a mix of infected and uninfected animals and faced the complication that, early on, infected flies are phenotypically indistinguishable from uninfected animals. However, we felt confident that we would be able to distinguish infected from uninfected exposed based on the presence of E. muscae 'Berkeley' reads in the sample. We collected six E. muscae 'Berkeley' exposed CantonS females at each 24, 48 and 72 hr, three exposed flies at 96 hr, and six fresh cadavers, three at each 96 and 120 hr. In parallel, we collected three CantonS females at each time point from a ‘mock’ exposure ( housed under identical conditions but in the absence of cadavers ). We prepared and sequenced mRNA libraries from each individual sampled. We sought to estimate both the fraction of reads from D. melanogaster and E. muscae in each sample, as a proxy for the presence of an infection and its progression, and relative levels of D. melanogaster and E. muscae transcripts in each sample

., 1987; Klingen et al., 2000 ). However, recent molecular evidence suggests that there may be additional host specialization within some E. muscae complex species ( Gryganskyi et al., 2013; Jensen et al., 2009 ). In the laboratory, a range of fly species can be infected and killed by E. muscae, though not all infected hosts manifest the stereotypical end-of-life behaviors, and susceptibility has not been found to track with host phylogeny ( Steinkraus and Kramer, 1987; Kramer and Steinkraus, 1981 ). E. muscae has almost exclusively been observed and studied in muscoid flies ( especially the house fly, Musca domestica ), organisms for which very few experimental tools exist ( Keller, 2007 ). Thus, despite inspiring curiosity and intrigue for over a century, how E. muscae achieves control of its host remains poorly understood, with essentially no information as to what is occurring at the molecular level in either fungus or host. Although there have been only a few reports of E. muscae infection in wild Drosophila ( Keller, 2002; Turian and Wuest, 1969; Goldstein, 1927 ), we observed several wild Drosophila in separate sites in Northern California with the characteristic death pose and fungal banding of E. muscae infections, and saw an opportunity to study a behavior-changing fungus in the laboratory species, Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we describe the isolation and subsequent characterization of this E. muscae strain and its impact on D. melanogaster behavior in the laboratory, and present the E. muscae-D. melanogaster system as a model for developing a mechanistic understanding of parasitic manipulation of host behavior.

. Consistent with our histological experiments, our transcriptomic data showed that E. muscae 'Berkeley' is present in the brain and that, taking E. muscae 'Berkeley' reads as a proxy, fungal titer increases with the progression of infection ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 ). The past decade has seen an explosion of tools for characterizing and manipulating the nervous system of D. melanogaster, including a catalog of the types and corresponding expression patterns of its approximately 100, 000 neurons, a complete map of connections in the brain, reagents for conditionally activating or inactivating specific sets of neurons as well as purifying these cells, and methods for automatically tracking and classifying behaviors in populations. Our development of a robust system of microbially induced behavior manipulation in D. melanogaster will allow us, and we hope many others, to leverage the powerful molecular and neurobiological toolkit of D. melanogaster to explore the molecular basis of this fascinating but still mysterious biological phenomenon.

., 2014 ). Transcriptomic measurements of the heads of infected ants during and after behavior manipulation revealed changes in the expression of fungal genes responsible for secreted factors and enterotoxins, while changes in ant gene expression indicate a dampened immune response during biting ( de Bekker et al., 2015 ). Most recently, microscopy data has shown that O. unilateralis does not invade host neural tissue and instead, forms complex fungal networks around host mandibular muscle, which could reflect intercellular communication within the fungus inside the ant body cavity ( Fredericksen et al., 2017 ). While this work has helped elucidate the molecular basis of behavioral manipulation, further progress with limited by the lack of established genetic tools in either the fungus or the host and neurobiological tools in the host. Intriguingly, a similar suite of behaviors are induced in dipterans by the distantly related Zygomycete fungi within the Entomophthora muscae species complex ( Keller, 1984; MacLeod et al., 1976 ). E. muscae, whose genus name Entomophthora comes from the Greek ‘entomo’ for insect and ‘phthora’ for destroyer, was first described in house flies ( Musca domestica ) in 1855 ( Cohn, 1855 ). A fly infected with E. muscae exhibits a characteristic set of fungus-induced behaviors: shortly before sunset on its final day of life, the fly climbs to a high location ( a behavior known as ‘summiting’ ), extends its proboscis and becomes affixed to the surface via fungal holdfasts, hyphal growths that emerge through the mouthparts ( Roy et al., 2006; Balazy, 1984; Krasnoff et al., 1995 ). The fly’s wings then lift up and away from its dorsal abdomen, striking a final death pose that is thought to be ideal for fungal dispersal ( Krasnoff et al., 1995 ). Over the course of the next few hours, the fungus differentiates into structures called conidiophores within the dead fly

. muscae isolate to infect a variety of host taxa ( Steinkraus and Kramer, 1987 ). Our understanding of strain diversity and host specificity would greatly benefit from the collection of more molecular and ecological data for E. musace complex species and infected hosts. Taken together, our RNAseq and histology time course data describe the typical progression of E. muscae infection in lab-reared D. melanogaster. At 24 hr after exposure, flies show a robust antifungal immune response, though the fungus is nearly undetectable within the fly by histology, indicating that it is at low titer. At 48 hr, the fungus has begun to adopt the morphology which it will assume until killing the host. Fungus is observable within the host brain and VNC, though overall fungal titer is still quite low. As the abdomen is the most likely point of initial entry for the fungus ( it is the biggest target for the fungus to hit ), we suspect that the fungus has travelled from the point of entry to the CNS, indicating tropism for neural tissue early in the infection. Elements of the host’s immune response are still activated. At 72 hr, fungus was apparent throughout the body cavity, in the brain and VNC, and the host’s immune response has begun to wane. By 96 hr, the fungus has differentiated into conidiophores and the host’s immune response is largely suppressed. By 120 hr, the host is dead and the fungus has sporulated. Our data indicate that E mus ‘Ber’Berkeley is a member of the E mus sensu strictu subgroup of the Entomthora mus species complex ( Figure 3 ). E mus sensu sensu stricto isolates have been observed to infect house flies ( Musca domestica Mac et al.,1976; Keller,2007 ) To gauge if E mus ‘Berkeley is capable of causing infection in hosts outside Drosidae, we exposed house flies to E musBer- infected D melanaster using a modified version of our protocol. We observed that flies died and sporulated, indicating they had been killed by the fungus ( Figure 3— supplement 1 ).
Researchers have generated transcriptome-wide binding profiles of 30 RNA degradation factors in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using photoactivatable ribonucleide-enhanced crosslink and immunoprecipitation (PARCLIP). The profiles reveal the distribution of degradation factors between different RNA classes and are consistent with canonical degradation pathways for closed-loop forming mRNAs after deadenylation. Modeling of mRNA half-lives suggests most degradation factors bind intact mRNAs, whereas decapping factors are recruited for mRNA degradation, consistent with decapping being a rate-limiting step. Decapping factors preferentially bind mRNAs with non-optimal codons, consistent with degradation of inefficiently translated mRNAs. Global analysis suggests the surveillance machinery, including complexes N1/N3 and TR4, targets aberrant nuclear RNAs and snoRNAs.

The study measured transcript-wide locations of 30 degradation factors involved in deadenylation, decapping, exosome degradation, and RNA pathways including nuclear surveillance and cytoplasmic nonsense decay (NMD). High reproducibility of PARCL experiments was revealed by comparison of two biological replicates with Spearman correlations 0.87-1.00 (mean 0.94). Tens of thousands of factor-RNA cross sites were obtained with p-values ≤ 0.005. Transcript maps represent an extensive dataset of in vivo-binding sites for factors in RNA degradation. Most PARCL reads fall into mRNA class, with many factors showing considerable reads in ncRN, particularly rRN.

Comparisons alongside published profiles of other RNA-binding factors revealed clusters of factors co-occupying RN or localizing RN. Data are consistent with published results and extend to global scale. Results revealed several novel findings, including that Pan/Pan deadlation complex subunits C4/Not bound preferentially pA site, reflecting function in poly tail shortening early degradation. C/Not subunit C4 bound strongly 5 region, reflecting differences C4 and Pop during deadlation or additional function C in elongation. C/ subunits show variations in RNA specificities, suggesting isoforms varying composition or conformation rearrangements. Decapping factors show cross-link near RNA, consistent proposed near p site.

The study provides a resource for future studies of eukotic RNA pathways, mechanisms, and integration metabolism. TR4 adds poly tail aberrant RN, triggering nuclear exosome degradation. N1 and Tr4 interact, coupling surveillance termination degradation. Co-occupancy and localization of factors were analyzed, relating to published profiles. Co-occup and localization plots can be found. Two-dimensional embedding cooccup profiles all processing factors represents similarities.

    Title: A novel bivalent chromatin associates with rapid induction of camalexin biosynthesis genes in response to a pathogen signal in Arabidopsis
    Abstract: Temporal dynamics of gene expression underpin responses to internal and environmental stimuli. In eukaryotes, regulation of gene induction includes changing chromatin states at target genes and recruiting the transcriptional machinery that includes transcription factors. As one of the most potent defense compounds in Arabidopsis thaliana, camalexin can be rapidly induced by bacterial and fungal infections. Though several transcription factors controlling camalexin biosynthesis genes have been characterized, how the rapid activation of genes in this pathway upon a pathogen signal is enabled remains unknown. By combining publicly available epigenomic data with in vivo chromatin modification mapping, we found that camalexin biosynthesis genes are marked with two epigenetic modifications with opposite effects on gene expression, trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 ( H3K27me3 ) ( repression ) and acetylation of lysine 18 of histone 3 ( H3K18ac ) ( activation ), to form a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin. Mutants with reduced H3K27me3 or H3K18ac suggested that both modifications were required to determine the timing of gene expression and metabolite accumulation at an early stage of the stress response. Our study indicates that the H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin, which we name as kairostat, plays an important role in controlling the timely induction of gene expression upon stress stimuli in plants.

    Plant specialized metabolites are integral for plant-environmental interactions and defense against herbivores and pathogens. Camalexin is a prominent phytoalexin in Arabidopsis and genes associated with its biosynthesis are induced rapidly upon pathogen signals such as FLG22 ( Denoux et al., 2008; Stahl et al., 2016; Zipfel et al., 2004 ). In this study, we found that H3K27me3 and H3K18ac co-localized on camalexin biosynthesis genes forming a previously uncharacterized form of bivalent chromatin. We examined the role of H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin on the induction of camalexin biosynthesis genes by combining publicly available epigenomics data with genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry. In wild-type ( Col-0 ) plants, camalexin biosynthesis genes were activated at 30 min to 1 hr of FLG22 treatment and continued to increase their expression at later time points of the treatment. This is consistent with the previous study on induction kinetics of defense pathways, including camalexin, under FLG22 treatment ( Denoux et al., 2008 ). In mutants with defective deposition of H3K27me3 or H3K18ac, the induction kinetics of camalexin biosynthesis genes and metabolite accumulation was accelerated or delayed, respectively. Our results provide new evidence for how chemical defense mediated by camalexin may be regulated at the epigenetic level. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other known mechanisms regulating camalexin genes may also affect transcriptional kinetics and metabolite accumulation. For example, H3K27me3 affects gene expression by altering chromatin accessibility to transcription factors ( Aranda et al., 2015 ). Removing this repression mark may create a permissive environment and facilitate transcription factors, such as WRKY33, to bind to promoters of camalexin genes

. Focusing on the camalexin biosynthesis pathway in this study, sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation ( SeqChIP ) -PCR confirmed that these two marks were co-localized in vivo and formed a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin. Mutants defective in H3K27m3 and H3K18ac suggested that both modifications were required to determine the timely induction of camalexin biosynthetic gene expression and camalexin accumulation under FLG22 treatment. This study revealed a new type of bivalent chromatin whose function may be to determine the timely induction of defense-compound biosynthesis in response to a pathogen signal.

. In summary, the transcriptional kinetics analysis suggests that H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin might control the timing of camalexin production in response to FLG22, which is partially corroborated with metabolite accumulation patterns. We next asked whether FLG22 treatment changed the relative amount of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac marks on the camalexin biosynthetic genes. To address this question, we quantified the abundance of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac on the camalexin biosynthetic genes with or without FLG22 treatment using ChIP-qPCR. For each gene tested, primers were designed to cover a genomic region that included 1 kb upstream and the entire transcribed region ( Supplementary file 2 ). In plants treated with FLG22, the abundance of H3K18ac was significantly higher in the gene regions of CYP71A13, CYP79B2, and PAD3 compared to the mock-treated plants ( Figure 3E ). Moreover, the abundance of H3K27me3 modification was significantly lower in the regions of these genes in response to FLG22 ( Figure 3F ). These results suggest that the FLG22-induced changes of camalexin biosynthetic gene expression involve remodeling of the H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin. Taken together, this study demonstrates that a novel bivalent chromatin formed by H3K27me3 and H3K18ac controls the timing of induction of camalexin biosynthesis genes upon stress, with H3K18ac expediting and H3K27me3 attenuating expression to hit the presumed ‘sweet spot’ ( Figure 3G ). We have named this type of bivalent chromatin regulator a kairostat, inspired by the ancient Greek word ‘kairos’ meaning the right moment and ‘stat’ meaning regulating device.

Camalexin biosynthesis pathway is one of the best characterized pathways associated with specialized metabolism in Arabidopsis ( Stotz et al., 2011; Frerigmann et al., 2016 ). We identified epigenetic marks enriched in the camalexin biosynthesis pathway using an omics data-driven approach by integrating 16 publicly available epigenomic profiles with Arabidopsis genome-scale metabolic network annotation. High-resolution epigenomic profiles including histone variants, DNA methylation and histone modifications were obtained from seedlings grown under similar conditions ( Wang et al., 2015; Luo et al., 2013; Roudier et al., 2011 ). To map these epigenetic marks on metabolic domains, pathways, and genes, we used genome-wide functional annotations of metabolism ( Schläpfer et al., 2017 ). Enrichment analysis at the metabolic domain level revealed distinct patterns, including specialized metabolism being enriched with both a repression mark H3K27me3 and an activation mark H3K18ac ( Figure 1A ). Correlation of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac marks on the Arabidopsis genome had been reported previously ( Luo et al., 2013 ), which we also observed using total metabolic genes ( Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0. 36, t-test p-value 4. 6E-11 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ). To determine if specialized metabolic genes drove the correlation of these two marks on metabolic genes, we removed specialized metabolic genes from the total metabolic genes and reanalyzed the correlation patterns. We observed decreased correlation between H3K27me3 and H3K18ac, indicating that specialized metabolic genes substantially contributed to the correlation of these two marks on metabolic genes ( Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0. 11, t-test p-value 3. 5E-02 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ). To determine how prevalent the H3K27me3-H3K18ac association was for specialized metabolic genes, we counted the number of genes marked by both modifications

Plants produce many metabolites that are essential for responding to environmental cues, the expression of which requires tight temporal control ( Barco and Clay, 2019; Grotewold, 2005; Martin et al., 2010 ). One of the most prominent defense metabolites from Arabidopsis thaliana is camalexin. Camalexin is an indole alkaloid derived from tryptophan and can be induced rapidly by various biotic and abiotic stimuli in Arabidopsis ( Stotz et al., 2011 ). Essential biosynthetic enzymes belong to the cytochrome P450 family, including CYP79B2/3, CYP71A12/13, and PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 3 ( PAD3 ) ( Klein et al., 2013; Schuhegger et al., 2006 ). The expression of these enzymatic genes can be rapidly induced by various abiotic and biotic stresses, and pathogen-derived substances such as flagellin 22 ( FLG22 ) and oligogalacturonides ( Denoux et al., 2008 ). Previous studies revealed complex transcriptional regulation of camin biosynthetic genes, including WRKY transcription factors ( Stahl et al,2016 ). However, how camin biosynthetic genes are rapidly activated upon pathogen signal remains unclear. We found that camin biosynthetic genes are marked by two epigenetic modifications H3me and H3ac, forming a previously uncharacter bivalent chromatin. Mutants with reduced H3me or Hac showed that both modifications were required for timely expression and metabol accumulation of camin at early stage of stress response. Our study indicates that Hme-Hac bivalent chromatin, which we named kstat, plays a role in controlling timely expression of genes upon stress in plants.

    Title: Distinct and separable roles for EZH2 in neurogenic astroglia
    Abstract: The epigenetic mechanisms that enable specialized astrocytes to retain neurogenic competence throughout adult life are still poorly understood. Here we show that astrocytes that serve as neural stem cells ( NSCs ) in the adult mouse subventricular zone ( SVZ ) express the histone methyltransferase EZH2. This Polycomb repressive factor is required for neurogenesis independent of its role in SVZ NSC proliferation, as Ink4a/Arf-deficiency in Ezh2-deleted SVZ NSCs rescues cell proliferation, but neurogenesis remains defective. Olig2 is a direct target of EZH2, and repression of this bHLH transcription factor is critical for neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, Ezh2 prevents the inappropriate activation of genes associated with non-SVZ neuronal subtypes. In the human brain, SVZ cells including local astroglia also express EZH2, correlating with postnatal neurogenesis. Thus, EZH2 is an epigenetic regulator that distinguishes neurogenic SVZ astrocytes, orchestrating distinct and separable aspects of adult stem cell biology, which has important implications for regenerative medicine and oncogenesis.

   ., 2003 ). Given our current understanding of Polycomb-mediated gene repression ( Margueron and Reinberg, 2011 ), these data suggest that Ink4a repression in SVZ astrocytes requires EZH2 for the local H3K27me3 enrichment, and that BMI1 is required for the subsequent transcriptional repression mediated by PRC1. While these data clearly indicated that EZH2 is required for proper SVZ NSC proliferation, the expression of EZH2 in type C and A cells suggested that EZH2 also plays a role in neuronal lineage specification. By deleting Ezh2 in Ink4a/Arf−/− SVZ NSCs, we were able to evaluate the Ink4a/Arf-independent roles of Ezh2 in neurogenesis. This genetic strategy enabled the identification of Olig2 as a key direct target of EZH2-mediated repression. OLIG2 is expressed in a subset of both type B1 and type C cells, but not in migratory neuroblasts ( Hack et al., 2005; Menn et al., 2006 ), suggesting that OLIG2 is expressed only at early stages of the SVZ neurogenic lineage. However, the epigenetic mechanisms required to repress Olig2 during neurogenesis were not known. Our results demonstrate that EZH2 is critical for Olig2 repression, which we found to be a key aspect of SVZ neurogenesis. While EZH2 is well recognized for its role in maintaining stem cells in an undifferentiated state, the EZH2-dependent downregulation of Olig2 illustrates a critical function for EZH2 in cell lineage specification. How EZH2-mediated repression is targeted to specific loci is still not well understood. In a subpopulation of SVZ cells, EZH2 was co-expressed with OLIG2 ( Figure 1E ), suggesting that while EZH2 is present in these cells, its repressive activities have not been localized to the Olig2 locus. Future work may reveal how other factors, possibly including long non-coding RNAs ( Simon and Kingston, 2013 ), serve to dynamically target EZH2 to specific loci at different states of the neurogenic lineage

. Taken together, our studies establish EZH2 as a distinguishing feature of astroglial cells in the postnatal neurogenic SVZ of both the mouse and human brain. Furthermore, we identify distinct and separable roles for EZH2 in the production of new neurons from a multipotent stem cell population. These results provide novel insights into the complex role that this Polycomb repressive factor plays in normal development and gliomagenesis.

. Thus, we performed microarray and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq analysis to identify specific transcriptional modules that required EZH2 for proper transcriptional repression ( Figure 4—figure supplements 3 and 4 ). Interestingly, many of the genes that exhibited Ezh2-dependent transcriptional repression encode for homeodomain transcription factors involved in the production of neuronal subtypes that are temporally and spatially distinct from OB interneurons ( Figure 4—figure supplement 5 ). Taken together, these data indicate that SVZ NSCs require EZH2 for the repression of specific sets of genes including Olig2 for proper neuronal lineage specification. Astrocytes isolated from the adult human SVZ can serve as NSCs in vitro ( Sanai et al., 2004 ), and adult human SVZ neurogenesis has been described in vivo ( Sanai et al., 2004; Quinones-Hinojosa et al., 2006; Curtis et al., 2007 ). While the infant human SVZ has large numbers of DCX+ neuroblasts, this neurogenesis declines sharply during the first 18 months of life ( Sanai et al., 2011 ). To investigate whether EZH2 expression correlates with this early postnatal human neurogenesis, we analyzed human brain sections containing the lateral ventricle SVZ ( Figure 5A, B ) at increasing ages of development. 10. 7554/eLife. 02439. 017Figure 5.

Despite many immunohistological, ultrastructural, and electrophysiological similarities between SVZ astrocytes and those in non-neurogenic brain regions, it is clear that astrocytes in the SVZ are distinct in their ability to produce neurons for all of adult life. Our data indicate that EZH2 is a distinguishing feature of SVZ astrocytes and in part underlies the epigenetic basis of this unique form of astrocyte heterogeneity ( Figure 6 ). Below, we discuss our results in the broader contexts of neural development, brain tumor malignancy, and postnatal neurogenesis of the human brain. 10. 7554/eLife. 02439. 018Figure 6. Model of EZH2 function in maintaining the neurogenic potential of SVZ astroglia. EZH2 represses multiple targets to promote distinct and separable aspects of adult SVZ neurogenesis. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02439. 018 Astrocytes throughout the brain arise from radial glia, the primary multipotent neural precursor cells population of the developing brain ( Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009 ). While most astrocytes do not generate neurons in the early postnatal brain, SVZ astrocytes retain the ability to produce neurons and glia throughout life. Thus, conceptually, SVZ astrocytes appear to have ‘preserved’ the multi-lineage developmental potential of their radial glial cell origin, whereas non-neurogenic astrocytes apparently ‘lose’ this stem cell characteristic ( Gonzales-Roybal and Lim, 2013 ). The expression of EZH2 strongly correlated with the neurogenic potential of glial cells along this developmental continuum. EZH2 is expressed in embryonic radial glia and is required for proper cortical neuron differentiation ( Hirabayashi et al., 2009; Pereira et al., 2010 ). We detected EZH2 expression in early postnatal radial glia, including those that give rise to the SVZ astrocytes

., 2010 ) ; in contrast, deletion of Ezh2 a few days later during corticogenesis causes an increase in the duration of neurogenesis and a delay in astrocyte differentiation ( Hirabayashi et al., 2009 ). Thus, EZH2, in concert with other PcG members, appears to orchestrate the temporal alterations in embryonic NSC behavior. In contrast to the dynamic and transient nature of embryonic NSCs, adult NSCs are relatively stable in their differentiation potential and are maintained for all of adult life. Postnatal NSCs lacking PRC1 component BMI1 are defective for self-renewal, in part due to the derepression of cell cycle inhibitors encoded by the Ink4a/Arf locus ( also known as Cdkn2a ) ( Molofsky et al., 2003 ). Whether PcG factors are required for other aspects of adult neurogenesis such as lineage specification is not known. In this study, we found EZH2 expression to be a distinguishing feature of neurogenic astrocytes in the adult mouse brain. Ezh2 in SVZ NSCs was required for distinct functions, regulating both cell proliferation and neuronal lineage specification. To enable SVZ NSC self-renewal, EZH2 directly repressed the Ink4a/Ar locus. EZ2 was also required for the repression of Olig, a transcription factor expressed in early SV neuroblasts but not in migratory neuroblasts. Our data indicate that EZ2 plays a separable roles in SV neurogenesis, both in proliferation and lineage specification. EZ2 is well known for its role in maintaining stem cells in an undifferentiated state, but the repression of Olig illustrates a critical function in cell specification. EZ2-mediated repression is targeted to specific loci is not well understood. A subpopulation of SV cells co-expressed EZ2 and Olig, suggesting that EZ repressive activities have not localized to O2 locus. Future work may reveal other factors, including non-coding RNAs ( Simon and Kingston,2013 ) that target EZ2 to specific loci at neurogenic states.

    Title: Ecology and evolution of viruses infecting uncultivated SUP05 bacteria as revealed by single-cell- and meta-genomics
    Abstract: Viruses modulate microbial communities and alter ecosystem functions. However, due to cultivation bottlenecks, specific virus–host interaction dynamics remain cryptic. In this study, we examined 127 single-cell amplified genomes ( SAGs ) from uncultivated SUP05 bacteria isolated from a model marine oxygen minimum zone ( OMZ ) to identify 69 viral contigs representing five new genera within dsDNA Caudovirales and ssDNA Microviridae. Infection frequencies suggest that ∼1/3 of SUP05 bacteria is viral-infected, with higher infection frequency where oxygen-deficiency was most severe. Observed Microviridae clonality suggests recovery of bloom-terminating viruses, while systematic co-infection between dsDNA and ssDNA viruses posits previously unrecognized cooperation modes. Analyses of 186 microbial and viral metagenomes revealed that SUP05 viruses persisted for years, but remained endemic to the OMZ. Finally, identification of virus-encoded dissimilatory sulfite reductase suggests SUP05 viruses reprogram their host's energy metabolism. Together, these results demonstrate closely coupled SUP05 virus–host co-evolutionary dynamics with the potential to modulate biogeochemical cycling in climate-critical and expanding OMZs.

   ., 2014 ), we posit that this viral gene is functional in SUP05 sulfur cycling. Future functional characterization of viral DsrC is needed to constrain viral roles in modulating SUP05 electron transfer reactions during viral infection in the environment. While new methods and model systems for identifying virus–host interactions continue to emerge ( Tadmor et al., 2011; Allers et al., 2013; Mizuno et al., 2013; Deng et al., 2014 ), viral ecology remains predominantly community focused in nature. This is because most hosts are uncultivated ( Rappé and Giovannoni, 2003 ), and culture-independent viral metagenomes are dominated by ‘unknown’ sequences ( Hurwitz and Sullivan, 2013 ), which inhibits developing a mechanism- and population-based viral ecology. Here, we use single-cell genomics to directly link SUP05 viruses and their hosts across defined gradients of oxygen and sulfide over a 3-year-time interval in a model OMZ ecosystem. This spatiotemporal resolution revealed endemic patterns of co-infection between ssDNA and dsDNA viruses and the occurrence of AMGs with the potential to modulate electron transfer reactions essential to SUP05 energy metabolism. Together, these findings offer novel perspectives on the ecology and evolution of viruses infecting uncultivated bacterial populations. While the capacity to formulate such linkages between cultured virus–host systems in nature is recognized ( e. g., cyanophages and pelagiphages ), the use of single-cell genomics to explore such linkages in uncultivated microbial communities represents a watershed moment in illuminating viral dark matter and its role in modulating microbial interaction networks in natural and engineered ecosystems.

., 2011 ). Alternatively, single-cell amplified genome ( SAG ) sequencing is emerging as a more direct method to chart metabolic potential of individual cells within microbial communities with special emphasis on candidate phyla that have no cultured representatives ( Yoon et al., 2011; Martinez-Garcia et al., 2012; Rinke et al., 2013; Swan et al., 2013 ). Here, we combine metagenomic and single-cell genomic sequencing to explore virus–host interactions within uncultivated bacteria inhabiting a marine oxygen minimum zone ( OMZ ). Marine OMZs, defined by dissolved oxygen concentrations <20 μmol kg−1, are oceanographic features that arise from elevated demand for respiratory oxygen in poorly ventilated, highly stratified waters. OMZs are crucial for biogeochemical cycles in the global ocean, as they represent hotspots for microbial-driven carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur transformations ( Ulloa et al., 2012; Wright et al., 2012 ) and play a disproportionate role in nitrogen loss processes and greenhouse gas cycling ( Lam et al., 2009; Ward et al., 2009 ). Moreover, these zones are expanding due to changing ocean water temperatures and circulation patterns ( Stramma et al., 2008; Whitney et al., 2007 ). Given these changing physical and chemical conditions and the importance of OMZs to ocean-atmosphere functioning, a clearer understanding of biological responses is critical to develop a much-needed predictive modeling capacity for OMZs. In OMZs, microbial communities drive matter and energy transformations and are typically dominated by sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria related to the chemoautotrophic gill symbionts of deep-sea clams and mussels ( Stewart et al., 2012; Wright et al., 2012 )

. Hence, the relative abundance of microbial and viral genome is indicated as number of metagenomic bases recruited by contig ( s ) base pairs ( bp ) by megabase ( Mb ) of metagenome. Upper and lower ‘hinges’ of the relative abundance distribution correspond to the first and third quartiles ( the 25th and 75th percentiles ), while outliers are displayed as points ( values beyond 1. 5 * Inter-Quartile Range of the hinge ). A virus-to-host ratio was then calculated for each SAG ( i. e., each virus-host pair ) as the ratio of relative abundance of viral contigs to the relative abundance of microbial contigs from the same SAG. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 03125. 017 To determine SUP05 viral biogeography, we interrogated 74 viromes and 112 microbial metagenomes sourced from Pacific Ocean waters ( Supplementary file 5 ). Despite consistently recovering SUP05 viral sequences in Saanich Inlet, these sequences were extremely uncommon in other locales ( 22 instances out of 803 possibilities; Figure 3—figure supplements 2 and 3 ), even when proximal to Saanich Inlet ( e. g., northeastern subarctic Pacific [NESAP] coastal and open ocean waters along the LineP transect ) or when sourced from similar water column conditions ( e. g., Eastern Tropical South Pacific OMZ, ETSP ). Of the 22 SUP05-related viruses detected, all but two were recovered below 500 meters in NESAP OMZ samples, in which SUP05 bacteria were also detected with similar abundance as in Saanich Inlet samples. The remaining two detections derived from an ETSP OMZ virome and a hydrothermal vent plume microbial metagenome from the Guaymas basin. Taken together, these observations point to endemic SUP05 viral populations with the potential to modulate SUP05-mediated biogeochemical cycling via lysis or metabolic reprogramming. Recent studies have highlighted the role of viruses in metabolic reprogramming, from global photosynthesis ( Mann et al., 2003; Lindell et al

., 2003; Lindell et al., 2005; Clokie et al., 2006; Sullivan et al., 2006; Sharon et al., 2009 ) to central carbon metabolism ( Sharon et al., 2011; Thompson et al., 2011; Hurwitz et al., 2013 ) via auxiliary metabolism genes ( AMGs ). Additionally, viruses assembled from microbial metagenomes from SUP05 dominated hydrothermal vent samples contain sulfur cycling genes ( Anantharaman et al., 2014 ). Therefore, we looked for AMGs encoded on SUP05 viral contigs in the Saanich Inlet water column. Four putative AMGs were detected in 12 of the 69 viral contigs, predominantly from SUP05_01 SAGs recovered from 150 meters ( Supplementary file 6 ). One AMG identified on a bona fide viral contig, phosphate-related phoH, is common among marine phages, but remains functionally uncharacterized ( Sullivan et al., 2010; Goldsmith et al., 2011 ). The remaining 3 AMGs including 2-oxoglutarate ( 2OG ) and Fe ( II ) -dependent oxygenase superfamily ( 2OG-FeII oxygenase ), tripartite tricarboxylate transporter ( tctA, protein domain hit only ), and dissimilatory sulfite reductase subunit C ( dsrC ) were encoded on contigs identified by non-reference-based methods. In marine cyanophages, 2OG-FeII oxygenase-encoding genes are common where they are thought to modulate host nitrogen metabolism during infection ( Sullivan et al., 2010 ). However, the precise metabolic role of tctA and dsrC-like genes during viral infection remains unknown. Given that dsrC was found on 7 SUP05_01 viral contigs ( Supplementary file 7 ) and DsrC is critical in SUP05 energy metabolism ( Walsh et al., 2009 ), we focused on this gene. Although dsrC genes were only present on contigs identified by non-reference-based methods they were closely related to dsrC-like genes encoded on the hydrothermal vent plume phages ( Anantharaman et al. 2014 ) and cyanophages ( Sullivan et al. 2010 ).

    Title: TTC26/DYF13 is an intraflagellar transport protein required for transport of motility-related proteins into flagella
    Abstract: Cilia/flagella are assembled and maintained by the process of intraflagellar transport ( IFT ), a highly conserved mechanism involving more than 20 IFT proteins. However, the functions of individual IFT proteins are mostly unclear. To help address this issue, we focused on a putative IFT protein TTC26/DYF13. Using live imaging and biochemical approaches we show that TTC26/DYF13 is an IFT complex B protein in mammalian cells and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Knockdown of TTC26/DYF13 in zebrafish embryos or mutation of TTC26/DYF13 in C. reinhardtii, produced short cilia with abnormal motility. Surprisingly, IFT particle assembly and speed were normal in dyf13 mutant flagella, unlike in other IFT complex B mutants. Proteomic and biochemical analyses indicated a particular set of proteins involved in motility was specifically depleted in the dyf13 mutant. These results support the concept that different IFT proteins are responsible for different cargo subsets, providing a possible explanation for the complexity of the IFT machinery.

    Supporting Text:
   . Similar phenotypes were observed in zebrafish cilia when ttc26 was depleted. Although IFT particle movement seems normal in dyf13 mutant flagella, specific inner dynein arm components were reduced in flagella of dyf13 mutants, indicating a specific role for TTC26/DYF13 in transport of a subset of ciliary proteins. Comparative proteomic analysis of the flagellar proteins in the dyf13 mutant supports a specific function for TTC26/DYF13 in transporting a subset of cargo proteins involved in the machinery of flagellar motility. Therefore, unlike many other IFT proteins, TTC26/DYF13 is not required for ciliogenesis nor for assembly or movement of the IFT particle per se, but rather plays a specialized role in transporting a specific set of motility-related ciliary proteins into cilia/flagella.

., 2007; Lucker et al., 2010 ). The only exception is IFT25 which is not required for assembly of cilia/flagella ( Keady et al., 2012 ). Because IFT25 is not conserved in C. elegans and D. melanogaster, it might be reasonable that IFT25 is not required for assembly of cilia and IFT complex. In contrast, because IFT56 is conserved in most ciliated organisms ( Figure 1A ) like other IFT proteins, IFT56 should have a conserved role in cilia/flagella or IFT. Further analysis is necessary to clarify the role of IFT56/TTC26/DYF13 in determining the length of cilia and flagella. Knockdown of IFT56 in zebrafish embryos and C. reinhardtii dyf13 mutant cells showed motility defects of cilia/flagella. These motility defects are caused by lack of inner dynein arm components in cilia/flagella. IFT56 is not important to assemble IFT complexes but is important to transport inner dynein arms into cilia/flagella. Analysis of a suppressor mutant of ift46 has revealed that IFT46 is required for transport of outer dynein arms into flagella ( Hou et al., 2007; Ahmed et al., 2008 ). Some cilia/flagella proteins are known to be pre-assembled before entering the cilia/flagella ( Qin et al., 2004 ), including dynein arms, whose pre-assembly requires HSP90-interacting PIH proteins ( Omran et al., 2008; Yamamoto et al., 2010 ). In C. reinhardtii, three PIH proteins, PF13/KTU, MOT48, and TWI1, were identified ( Yamamoto et al., 2010 ). PF13/KTU is required for pre-assembly of outer dynein arms ( Omran et al., 2008 ) and MOT48 is important to pre-assemble inner-arm dyneins b, c, d, and e ( Yamamoto et al., 2010 ). TWI1 might be important to pre-assemble the other dynein arms, inner dynein species a, f, and g. Because dyf13 mutant cells partially lack inner dynein arms a, f, and g from their flagella, we speculate that IFT56 might play a role in recruiting TWI1 with these inner dynein arms to the IFT complex

. 10. 7554/eLife. 01566. 022Figure 7. DYF13 does not influence localizations and amounts of other IFT proteins. ( A ) Immunofluorescence images of wild-type and dyf13 mutant cells. The cells were stained with antibodies to acetylated tubulin ( red ) and IFT46, IFT70, and IFT122 ( green ). Bar: 10 μm. ( B ) Western blotting images of IFT proteins in wild-type and dyf13 mutant flagella. Relative amounts of IFT proteins did not change between wild-type and dyf13 mutant flagella. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01566. 022 Taken together, these results indicate that DYF13 does not significantly influence the IFT particle assembly or movement. Defects of DYF13 did not change IFT speed or frequency even though DYF13 is an IFT protein. However, C. reinhardtii dyf13 mutant cells clearly showed the flagella motility defects. These results raised the possibility that the DYF13 protein might be important for transporting specific cargo into the flagellum that is required for normal flagellar motility. Because the motility of flagella is mainly produced by the two types of dynein arms, inner and outer ( King and Kamiya, 2009; Wirschell et al., 2011 ), we examined components of axonemal dyneins in dyf13 mutant flagella. The outer dynein components from isolated axonemes of wild-type and dyf13 mutant were purified and quantified by SDS-PAGE. Components of outer dynein arms were present at normal levels in dyf13 mutant flagella ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1A, B ). To analyze the inner dynein arm components, the dyf13 mutant was crossed with the oda1 mutant, which are missing outer dynein arms ( Kamiya, 1988 ). Inner-arm dyneins were purified from the high salt extract of oda1dyf13 double mutant flagella by ion-exchange column chromatography on a Mono Q column. The elution pattern of the oda1dyf13 axonemal extract indicated a reduction in the amounts of specific inner-arm dyneins ( Figure 8A )

. Knockdown of twister, the zebrafish homologue of TWI1, results in pronephric cysts ( Sun et al., 2004 ), similar to the phenotypes of IFT56/TTC26/DYF13 knockdown zebrafish ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). We also note the depletion of inner dynein arm components is consistent with the fact that IFT is necessary for incorporation of inner dynein arms but not outer dynein arms in Chlamydomonas ( Piperno and Mead, 1997 ). IFT56 is also important for transporting other flagella proteins into flagella ( Figure 8C; Supplementary file 1B ) and most of these appear to be related to flagella motility. FAP59 is a homologue of CCDC39 that is required for assembly of inner dynein and dynein regulatory complexes ( Merveille et al., 2011 ). Tektin ( Tanaka et al., 2004; Yanagisawa and Kamiya, 2004 ) and centrin ( Piperno et al., 1990, 1992; Kagami and Kamiya, 1992 ) are both involved in inner dynein arm function and assembly, whereas PF2 ( also known as DRC4 ) is a component of the dynein regulatory complex that regulates inner dynein arm activity ( Rupp and Porter, 2003 ). Enolase, a component of the glycolytic pathway, is present in motile flagella as part of the CPC1 central pair complex and a mutant with reduced enolase in flagella causes reduced flagella beat frequency ( Mitchell et al., 2005 ). Thus, these proteins depleted from flagella in the dyf13 mutant are all connected to flagellar motility, rather than flagellar assembly, suggesting a primary role for IFT56/TTC26/DYF13 in carrying motility-related cargoes. Consistent with this picture, IFT56 is not conserved in Thalassiosira pseudonana or Physcomitrella patens, which lack putative inner dynein and outer dynein homologues, respectively ( Wickstead and Gull, 2011 ). A subset of proteins was identified as potential cargos of TTC/DY13 by proteomic analysis of dy13 flagella ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2 ).

    Title: Lymphatic endothelium stimulates melanoma metastasis and invasion via MMP14-dependent Notch3 and β1-integrin activation
    Abstract: Lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastasis correlate with poor clinical outcome in melanoma. However, the mechanisms of lymphatic dissemination in distant metastasis remain incompletely understood. We show here that exposure of expansively growing human WM852 melanoma cells, but not singly invasive Bowes cells, to lymphatic endothelial cells ( LEC ) in 3D co-culture facilitates melanoma distant organ metastasis in mice. To dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms, we established LEC co-cultures with different melanoma cells originating from primary tumors or metastases. Notably, the expansively growing metastatic melanoma cells adopted an invasively sprouting phenotype in 3D matrix that was dependent on MMP14, Notch3 and β1-integrin. Unexpectedly, MMP14 was necessary for LEC-induced Notch3 induction and coincident β1-integrin activation. Moreover, MMP14 and Notch3 were required for LEC-mediated metastasis of zebrafish xenografts. This study uncovers a unique mechanism whereby LEC contact promotes melanoma metastasis by inducing a reversible switch from 3D growth to invasively sprouting cell phenotype.

    Supporting Text:
    Melanoma cells have been shown to be in close contact with the lymphatic vessels in human specimens and often metastasize via the lymphatic system, ( Niakosari et al., 2008 ), implying that the melanoma cell-LEC interactions are common events in human melanomas. In addition, clinical data correlating metastatic spread with lymphatic infiltration suggest that melanoma-LEC interactions could contribute to the tumor progression and metastasis. Here we investigated the consequences of such interactions by coupling unique 2D and 3D LEC-melanoma co-culture models to in vivo mouse tumor model, transcriptome profiling, in vitro functional studies and a zebrafish xenograft/metastasis assay. In the xenograft mouse model, dissemination of the metastatic WM852 cell line to distant organs was increased by LEC priming. Furthermore, in vitro molecular and functional studies revealed that the direct contact of LECs with metastatic melanoma cell lines triggered changes particularly in the localization of MMP14, an important protease for cancer-cell invasion ( Tatti et al., 2015; Turunen et al., 2017 ), which in turn induced expression and activation of Notch3 and activation of β1-integrin leading to a significant change in the 3D growth phenotype of the melanoma cells. The interaction with LECs did not, however, induce metastasis or change the 3D growth phenotype of non-metastatic Bowes cells. Although Bowes have active MMP14 and an invasive, single cell 3D sprouting phenotype in vitro ( Tatti et al., 2011 ), these intrinsic properties were not sufficient to support distant organ metastatic colonization in vivo. Moreover, ectopic expression of MMP14 or NICD3 did not induce any change in their 3D growth phenotype. Similar to Bowes, LEC priming did not markedly alter the 3D phenotype of another non-metastatic melanoma cell line WM793, that, despite of MMP14 expression ( Tatti et al

., 2010 ). However, as our transcriptomic data of the LEC-primed melanoma cells did not reveal changes in ICAP-1 expression upon LEC-priming it probably does not play a significant role in the Notch3-dependent invasive sprouting of metastatic melanoma cells. Furthermore, our results indicate that β1-integrin functions downstream of Notch3 in the LEC-primed melanomas. Although melanoma cells at the primary tumor site predominantly disseminate through the lymphatic vascular route, the distant organ metastasis requires cells entering blood circulation and colonization in the distant organ tissue. MMP14, Notch3 and β1-integrin are all proteins linked to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in carcinoma cell metastasis ( Cao et al., 2008; Kato et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2014 ), supporting the idea that the metastatic WM852* and WM165* melanoma cells have also undergone a transient transition into a more mesenchymally invasive state that can promote hematogenous dissemination. However, since the Bowes cells with high MMP14 levels did not metastasize, MMP14 activity by itself is apparently not enough for efficient distant organ metastasis. In the absence of strong cancer cell-cell interactions, constitutively high MMP14 activity can facilitate single cell invasion, thereby compromising the adhesive and expansive growth potential essential for efficient tissue colonization of the tumor cells. We therefore propose that the capacity for transiently induced 3D invasive sprouting coupled to expansive growth behavior are required for the most aggressive melanoma cells to enter and survive in the blood circulation, as well as to efficiently colonize the distant organs. Melanoma progression is suggested to be driven by reversible and functional reprogramming of different signaling routes, known as reversible phenotypic plasticity of cell ( Vandamme and Berx, 2014 )

. For example, chemokine receptor-ligand interactions between melanoma and LECs drive chemotaxis of tumor cells towards the lymphatics ( Cabioglu et al., 2005; Das et al., 2013; Shields et al., 2007 ). Alternatively, tumor cells secrete factors like lipoxygenase, which can induce downregulation of the endothelial surface molecules and loosening of the LEC junctions in vitro ( Kerjaschki et al., 2011 ). In this study, we set to investigate how the LECs in the tumor microenvironment affect the metastatic melanoma cell phenotype. To this end, we implemented 2D- and 3D melanoma-LEC co-culture models, which enable a systematic analysis of the molecular crosstalk between the tumor cells and the lymphatic endothelium. We found that the interaction of melanoma cells with LECs induced matrix-metalloproteinase-14 ( MMP14, also known as MT1-MMP ) -dependent Notch3 and β1-integrin activation in the expansively growing metastatic melanoma cells, leading to invasive sprouting of cells in 3D matrices. Importantly, the interaction of these melanoma cells with LECs led to significantly increased metastasis of melanoma xenografts in vivo, which was dependent on MMP14 and Notch3. Thus, the crosstalk with LECs promotes melanoma metastasis by inducing a reversible switch to invasively sprouting melanoma cells.

. To study the co-regulation further, we treated the co-cultures of LEC and WM852 with a MMP14 specific inhibitor ( NSC 405020 ), after which the WM852 cells were separated for further analysis. NSC 405020 treatment reduced expression of the full length and active cleaved Notch3 ( NICD3 ) by 42% in the WM852* cells ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2d–e ). These data further support that MMP14 positively regulates Notch3 expression and activation, thereby contributing to the change in the 3D growth phenotype of the LEC primed WM852. Our trancriptomic analysis revealed changes in pathways involved in cancer invasion and metastasis including several cell adhesion pathways ( Figure 2a–b and Supplemental file 2 ). We therefore decided to address the role of integrins, one of the major cell-matrix adhesion molecule families, in the LEC induced changes in metastatic melanoma cells. Since several reports support association of β1-integrin expression with melanoma progression and metastasis ( Danen et al., 1994; Kato et al., 2012; Natali et al., 1993 ), we investigated the expression and activation state of β1-integrin in the ±LEC co-cultured WM852, WM165, WM793, and Bowes cell lines using antibodies for the total and active β1-integrin ( 12G10 ). Interestingly, WM852* showed a higher signal for the active β1-integrin ( Figure 5a and Figure 5—figure supplement 1a ), which was further confirmed by staining with another antibody against active β1-integrin, 9EG7 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1b ). We also attempted to confirm the integrin activation in WM852* by FACS analysis using antibodies against active β1-integrin ( 12G10 and 9EG7 ). However, we did not detect the increase in active β1-integrin levels in the FACS of WM852* ( data not shown ) perhaps because the activation may either require the constant contact of melanoma cells to LECs or to 3D fibrin, and be sensitive to the cell detachment process

. Taken together, these experiments show that constitutive activation of Notch3 by NICD3, but not β1-integrin activation alone, can switch the phenotype of WM793 from a sphere-like to a invasively sprouting growth. Moreover, once Notch3 is constitutively activated, MMP14 inhibition has no additional effect on the sprouting, thus confirming the previous data that Notch is upstream of MMP14 in the LEC-primed melanoma cells. We conclude that the interaction of melanoma cells with Ls induces Notch activation and β-integrin activation in expansively metastatic melanoma cells, leading to invasive sprouting in 3D matrices and increased metastasis in xenografts.

    Title: MicroRNA-9 controls dendritic development by targeting REST
    Abstract: MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are conserved noncoding RNAs that function as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. miR-9 is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the brain. Although the function of miR-9 has been well characterized in neural progenitors, its role in dendritic and synaptic development remains largely unknown. In order to target miR-9 in vivo, we developed a transgenic miRNA sponge mouse line allowing conditional inactivation of the miR-9 family in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. Using this novel approach, we found that miR-9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-9-mediated downregulation of the transcriptional repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth.

    Supporting Text:
    The results of this study define a key role for miR-9 during postmitotic differentiation of neurons. We present a new double reporter mouse line that helped to characterize the activity pattern of miR-9 in different cell types in the brain. The analysis of the miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mouse line showed that inhibition of miR-9 results in aberrant dendritic growth in vivo, accompanied by a concomitant impairment in synaptic transmission. Experiments using primary neurons and in utero gene transfer approaches indicate that the observed dendritic changes are cell-autonomous. Importantly, we described an essential function of miR-9 in dendritic growth as a regulator of the expression of the transcriptional repressor REST. The widespread involvement of miRNAs in both the regulation of developmental and physiological processes and disease is well established ( Bushati and Cohen, 2007; Bartel, 2009; Han et al., 2013 ). However, uncovering the function of specific microRNA families has been limited by the lack of technologies for in vivo analysis. Much of our current knowledge regarding the role of microRNAs in neuronal biology stems from overexpression-based studies. However, overexpression approaches may lead to silencing of genes that normally escape regulation resulting in artificial, neomorphic phenotypes. Therefore, loss-of-function strategies are required to validate physiological miRNA functions. The generation of KO mice has several limitations in this context: ( i ) requires the ablation of the multiple gene copies of miRNAs belonging to the same family, often placed at distant genomic loci and ( ii ) miRNAs genes are frequently encoded in clusters together with other miRNAs from different families or directly overlapping other protein-coding or lncRNA genes

. In this study, we focused in the postmitotic stages of neuronal differentiation and demonstrated a critical role for miR-9 in the control of dendritic development in vivo. Other miRNAs have also been shown to influence dendritic growth ( Wayman et al., 2008; Fiore et al., 2009; Parrish et al., 2009; Magill et al., 2010; Pathania et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013b ) suggesting that the expression of genes orchestrating this process is under a complex post-transcriptional regulation. Our studies in cultured primary neurons associated to the morphological analysis performed in miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mice suggests that neuronal miR-9 mainly acts in a cell-intrinsic manner controlling dendritic differentiation genetic programs. However, dendritic growth and branching in vivo are influenced by synaptic activity ( Rajan and Cline, 1998; Wong and Ghosh, 2002 ) or by a multiplicity of extrinsic factors either present in or secreted by neighbor neurons or glial cells, such as neurotrophins, semaphorins, or Slits ( Polleux et al., 2000; Horch and Katz, 2002; Whitford et al., 2002; Yamamoto et al., 2006 ). The results obtained in our in utero gene transfer studies targeting CA1 hippocampal neurons, which develop later among a vast majority of non-transfected wild-type neurons and glial cells, are comparable to the dendritic phenotype observed in miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mice. This indicates that effects found in miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mice are essentially cell-intrinsic and that miR-9 exerts its proactive function in modeling dendritic arbors as a key player of neuronal genetic programs controlling dendrite development. Furthermore, we found that basal synaptic transmission was impaired in miR-9 sponge expressing mice. Since the morphology and density of dendritic spines were not affected, the reduced postsynaptic responses are most likely due to a reduction in the total number of synapses as expected from less-arborized dendrites ( Kawabe et al

., 2010 ), as those found in miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mice. Additionally, we showed that inhibiting miR-9 affects neuronal excitability by shifting the AP threshold to more positive potentials. Since Map1b has already been described to be a miR-9 target critical for terminal axonal arborization ( Dajas-Bailador et al., 2012 ), a potential contribution of the tandem miR-9/Map1b to the electrophysiological phenotype cannot be discarded. Intrinsic proteins controlling the establishment of neuronal dendritic fields include several transcription factors, Rho and Ras family GTPases, kinases, and adaptors involved in Ca2+-mediated signal transduction cascades ( Hand et al., 2005; Takemoto-Kimura et al., 2007; Simo and Cooper, 2012 ). MiR-9 downregulation would lead to the increase in transcriptional rates of direct miR-9 targets. This suggests that the factor/s mediating the effects of miR-9 inhibition in miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mice would fit best with targets negatively influencing cellular processes potentially involved in dendritic maturation. We found that the zinc-finger transcriptional repressor REST ( also known as NRSF ), an experimentally validated target of miR-9 ( Packer et al., 2008 ), is upregulated in miR-9 sponge expressing neurons. Along this line, the fact that REST is a transcriptional repressor made this factor a specially attractive candidate to explain the effects observed in miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mice. REST is essential for repressing neuronal genes in neural progenitors ( Ooi and Wood, 2007 ). A prevailing view is that downregulation of REST during neuronal differentiation favors the acquisition and maintenance of the neuronal phenotype ( Ballas et al., 2005 ). REST binds the RE1 consensus element of target genes and recruits corepressors including mSin3, CoREST, and methyl CpG binding protein 2 ( MeCP2 ), inducing silencing by epigenetic remodeling ( Andres et al., 1999 )

. To gain further insight into the mechanisms by which miR-9 affects dendritic growth, we used quantitative PCR to determine the expression levels of several predicted miR-9 neuronal targets ( Supplementary file 1 ). To avoid contaminations by other cell types, we analyzed DIV3 primary hippocampal neurons derived from miR-9-SpNestin-Cre and littermate control embryos. We found that 13 out of 26 miR-9 predicted targets were upregulated in miR-9-SpNestin-Cre neurons ( Figure 5A ). Interestingly, one of the upregulated mRNAs encodes the global transcriptional repressor element 1 ( RE-1 ) silencing transcription factor ( REST/NRSF ). We speculated that REST is an interesting candidate, which could explain the effects triggered by GFP-FC-miR-9 sponge considering that REST ( i ) is actively repressing a large array of neuron-specific genes ( Ballas and Mandel, 2005 ), ( ii ) is strongly downregulated during neuronal development ( Schoenherr and Anderson, 1995; Ballas et al., 2005 ), and ( iii ) has been experimentally validated as a bona fide target of miR-9 ( Packer et al., 2008 ). Importantly, we also found elevated REST protein levels in sponge expressing neurons ( Figure 5B ). As expected, increased REST activity resulted in the downregulation of several REST-target genes ( Figure 5C ). Moreover, miR-9 sponges reversed the miR-9-induced downregulation of REST in HEK-293 cells ( Figure 5D ) further demonstrating the regulatory effect of miR-9 on REST levels. 10. 7554/eLife. 02755. 015Figure 5.

    Title: Default mode-visual network hypoconnectivity in an autism subtype with pronounced social visual engagement difficulties
    Abstract: Social visual engagement difficulties are hallmark early signs of autism ( ASD ) and are easily quantified using eye tracking methods. However, it is unclear how these difficulties are linked to atypical early functional brain organization in ASD. With resting state fMRI data in a large sample of ASD toddlers and other non-ASD comparison groups, we find ASD-related functional hypoconnnectivity between ‘social brain’ circuitry such as the default mode network ( DMN ) and visual and attention networks. An eye tracking-identified ASD subtype with pronounced early social visual engagement difficulties ( GeoPref ASD ) is characterized by marked DMN-occipito-temporal cortex ( OTC ) hypoconnectivity. Increased DMN-OTC hypoconnectivity is also related to increased severity of social-communication difficulties, but only in GeoPref ASD. Early and pronounced social-visual circuit hypoconnectivity is a key underlying neurobiological feature describing GeoPref ASD and may be critical for future social-communicative development and represent new treatment targets for early intervention in these individuals.

   ., 2015; Margulies et al., 2016 ). These effects along with DMN-dorsal attention network ( DAN ) hypoconnectivity show evidence for a case-control difference compared to TD and other non-ASD comparison toddler age groups, and these effects are prominent across both ASD cohorts with and without eye tracking data. This finding suggests that in ASD within the first 4 years of life the developing ‘social brain’ default mode network is on-average functionally disconnected from visual cortices and the dorsal attention network. This finding is important with respect to why social engagement difficulties are a hallmark symptom in early ASD development and shared across most ASD toddlers. In contrast to generalized case-control differences, we also observed key evidence that early heterogeneity in social visual engagement is important for explaining functional hypoconnectivity between DMN and OTC. The GeoPref ASD subtype is a primary factor behind DMN-OTC functional hypoconnectivity in ASD and this subtype distinction is a better explanatory model than a traditional case-control model or other transdiagnostic models. While GeoPref ASD is behaviorally more severe on a range of different domains, this functional connectivity difference is specific to GeoPref ASD. Other non-ASD toddlers with general developmental or language delay do not show such effects. Furthermore, the magnitude of DMN-OTC functional hypoconnectivity specific to GeoPref ASD was strongly associated with individual-level variability in social-communication difficulties measured on an ASD ‘gold standard’ diagnostic instrument ( i. e. ADOS ). While DMN-PVC and DMN-DAN connectivity reductions are also prominent in GeoPref ASD toddlers, it could be DMN-OTC connectivity that has the largest implications for the different clinical presentation specific to this subtype

. This test picks up about 20% of all early diagnosed ASD individuals as within this subtype. It could be that integration of a larger battery of eye tracking measures and tests may help enhance sensitivity and detect a larger percentage of individuals that may be part of this subtype ( Moore et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, use of eye tracking measures that go beyond static stimuli and use interaction-based paradigms ( Redcay and Schilbach, 2019; Schilbach et al., 2013 ) may further enhance sensitivity. All of these refinements could potentially aid in the identification of early biological bases behind different ASD subtypes. In conclusion, we identified that functional hypoconnectivity between ‘social brain’ circuitry, the DMN, and low-level visual networks is highly important in the early development of ASD. While DMN-PVC functional connectivity is reduced on-average across ASD toddlers, DMN-OTC functional connectivity is heavily reduced in the GeoPref ASD subtype. Individual-level variation in DMN-OTC functional hypoconnectivity is associated with the degree of social-communication difficulties, but only within the GeoPref ASD subtype. This subtype can be identified with high levels of precision via a simple eye tracking test of social or non-social visual preferences in very early development ( Pierce et al., 2011a ). Early social-visual functional hypoconnectivity is a key underlying neurobiological feature describing GeoPref ASD and may be critical for future social-communicative development. Thus, we theorize that a neurobiologically driven bias ( particularly from prenatal development ) leading towards neglect for the social world in early development, if left untreated, would significantly diminish opportunities for social learning and for bootstrapping experience-dependent change within developing neural circuits

. 63; ΔAIC = 13. 09; DMN-DAN: subtype AIC = 20. 29, transdiagnostic AIC = 25. 42; ΔAIC = 5. 13 ) ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). These results generally suggest that heterogeneity in early social engagement is important for some, but not all, functional connectivity differences present in early ASD toddlers. This evidence supports the idea that in toddlerhood, ASD is characterized by functional hypoconnectivity between the DMN and visual circuits in PVC and OTC as well as attention circuitry ( DAN ). However, for the subtype of individuals with the most pronounced social engagement difficulties ( GeoPref ASD ), it is DMN-OTC connectivity that may be most important in distinguishing them from their other ASD counterparts. We next tested whether the two ASD subtypes would differ in the relationship between functional connectivity and social-communication difficulties. This test is critical for examining the question of whether the two ASD subtypes should indeed be considered as discrete types of ASD with different underlying neurobiological mechanisms relevant for the behavioral phenotype. Here we find evidence for subtype-specific associations for DMN-OTC connectivity. A strong negative correlation between DMN-OTC connectivity and ADOS social affect total is present in the GeoPref ASD subtype ( r = −0. 78, p=0. 001, 95% CI = [−0. 99, –0. 35] ), indicating that reductions in DMN-OTC connectivity are associated with more enhanced social-communication difficulties. No such relationship exists for nonGeo ASD ( r = 0. 06, p=0. 64, 95% CI = [−0. 20, 0. 33] ) ( Figure 3 ). Correlation strength also significantly differed between the subtypes ( z = 3. 71, p=0. 0001 ). In contrast, DMN-PVC showed no evidence of relationships in either subtype ( GeoPref ASD r = 0. 04, p=0. 88, 95% CI = [−0. 81, 0. 75]; nonGeo ASD r = 0. 22, p=0. 12, 95% CI = [−0. 10, 0

Although social visual engagement difficulties are central early developmental features of ASD with high clinical and translational relevance, the neural bases behind these features are not well understood. Here we find robust evidence in early ASD development for atypical intrinsic functional brain organization involving circuitry relevant to social visual engagement. Central to our findings is the importance of early developing social brain circuitry, the default mode network ( DMN ) ( Lombardo et al., 2010a; Kennedy and Adolphs, 2012; Kennedy and Courchesne, 2008a; Kennedy et al., 2006; Padmanabhan et al., 2017; Lombardo et al., 2011; Lombardo et al., 2010b ), and its interactions with more basic neural circuitry involved in visual or attention processes. The DMN has been extensively studied in older ASD patients and has been found to be atypical in multiple studies using resting state and task-based social paradigms ( Padmanabhan et al., 2017; Lombardo et al., 2010b; Di Martino et al., 2014; Kennedy and Courchesne, 2008b; Hong et al., 2019; Lai et al., 2019; Holiga et al., 2019 ). However, a novel addition to this literature is our work here showing that in very early development there is functional hypoconnectivity between DMN and primary visual cortex ( PVC ) as well as visual association circuitry in occipito-temporal cortex ( OTC ). Here we find that at this point in early development normative groups ( e. g., TD ) show robust non-zero DMN-OTC connectivity. In contrast, in older typically-developing samples, similar types of robust functional connectivity relationships between these networks are not extensively reported in literature, as DMN is typically highly segregated and embedded at an opposite pole within functional connectivity gradients from sensory cortices ( Smith et al., 2015; Margulies et al., 2016 )

Social visual engagement difficulties, defined as lack of preference for social stimuli often combined with a strong preference for and attention towards non-social stimuli ( Dawson et al., 1998; Dawson et al., 2004; Klin et al., 2015; Chawarska et al., 2013; Falck-Ytter et al., 2013; Klin et al., 2009; Nakano et al., 2010; Pierce et al, 2011b; Pierce et al,2011a ), are a hallmark of early ASD and are quantified using eye-tracking methods ( Pierce et al,2011a ). However, it is unclear how these difficulties are linked to atypical functional brain organization in ASD. With resting state fMRI in a large sample of ASD and non-ASD comparison groups, we find ASD-related hypoconnectivity between ‘social’ brain circuitry such as DM and visual networks. Eye-tracking identified ASD with pronounced social visual difficulties (Geo ASD ) is characterized by DM-OTC hypoconnectivity. Increased DM-OT hypoconnect is related to severity of social-communication, but only Geo ASD. Early social-visual circuit hypoconnect is a key neurobiological feature describing Geo ASD and may be critical for future-communic development and new targets for intervention in these individuals.

    Title: Drosophila sessile hemocyte clusters are true hematopoietic tissues that regulate larval blood cell differentiation
    Abstract: Virtually all species of coelomate animals contain blood cells that display a division of labor necessary for homeostasis. This functional partition depends upon the balance between proliferation and differentiation mostly accomplished in the hematopoietic organs. In Drosophila melanogaster, the lymph gland produces plasmatocytes and crystal cells that are not released until pupariation. Yet, throughout larval development, both hemocyte types increase in numbers. Mature plasmatocytes can proliferate but it is not known if crystal cell numbers increase by self-renewal or by de novo differentiation. We show that new crystal cells in third instar larvae originate through a Notch-dependent process of plasmatocyte transdifferentiation. This process occurs in the sessile clusters and is contingent upon the integrity of these structures. The existence of this hematopoietic tissue, relying on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis, creates a new paradigm for addressing outstanding questions in Drosophila hematopoiesis and establishing further parallels with vertebrate systems.

   ., 2013 ). Similarly, here we show that in Drosophila larvae the microenvironment provided by hemocyte clusters is necessary to induce crystal cell differentiation from plasmatocytes, namely through a cell-contact mechanism involving Notch-Serrate. A putative important difference between hemocyte clusters and the lymph gland concerns the mechanisms in control of cell proliferation and differentiation. In support of this notion, misexpression of some genes in hemocytes can disrupt hemocyte clusters without affecting lymph gland morphology ( Stofanko et al., 2008 ). Tightly linked to this question is one other fundamental aspect that remains unaddressed: the control of proportions between different cell types. Throughout homeostatic development, it is commonly observed, both in vertebrates ( Almeida et al., 2005 ) and invertebrates ( Rizki, 1957 ), that blood cell types respect fixed relative numbers. Also, it is now evident that plasmatocytes are very plastic cells and may represent a rare case of functionally mature cells transdifferentiating into other cell types: lamellocytes ( Honti et al., 2010 ) and crystal cells. Transdifferentiation, the process where a cell changes its cell fate without passing through a less differentiated state, is used recurrently in cell culture assays but rarely seen in vivo ( Jopling et al., 2011 ). How recurrent this mechanism may be in animal development presents itself as one important question for the future. We consider that acknowledging this novel hematopoietic organ, dynamically attached to the circulating hemocyte population and relying on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis, brings us a step closer to addressing these outstanding fundamental questions of Drosophila hematopoiesis.

In insects, the functions of hemocytes ( blood cells ) are very diverse and include phagocytosis, extracellular matrix deposition, AMP production, encapsulation, and melanization. Similarly to what happens in vertebrates, the different functions performed by insect hemocytes are, to some degree, compartmentalized into different cell types ( Honti et al., 2014 ). Some mature blood cells retain the ability to divide when in circulation, but the majority of blood cell proliferation and differentiation occurs in the hematopoietic organs ( Grigorian and Hartenstein, 2013 ). These organs provide the correct cellular and molecular environment for the control of cell proliferation and differentiation, namely in the so-called stem cell niches ( Koch and Radtke, 2007; Martinez-Agosto et al., 2007 ). Thus, the study of hematopoietic organs structure and function is essential to understand how different mature blood cells arise and how their absolute and relative numbers are controlled. In Drosophila melanogaster, embryonic hematopoiesis produces two different types of mature hemocytes: plasmatocytes and crystal cells. Plasmatocytes are phagocytic cells often functionally compared to vertebrate macrophages ( Evans et al., 2003 ). Crystal cells are non-phagocytic cells known to produce prophenoloxidase, an essential component of the melanization cascade ( Binggeli et al., 2014 ). Both plasmatocytes and crystal cells generated during embryogenesis persist into larval stages. Hemocytes in the larva can be found in circulation but the majority of them are attached to the cuticular epidermis as sessile cells ( Lanot et al., 2001; Kurucz et al., 2007b; Makhijani et al., 2011 ). Hemocytes attached to the epidermis are not randomly dispersed but form stereotypical clusters of cells in every segment of the larva ( Zettervall et al., 2004; Makhijani et al., 2011 ) indicating that some signal must direct hemocytes to these locations

. When the same technique is used in cluster-disrupted larvae, there is no detectable lymph gland-derived hemocytes in circulation ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ). Thus, the integrity of the cluster is necessary for crystal cell differentiation. Strikingly, in agreement with our observations, recent work shows that in Eater mutants that do not form hemocyte clusters, sessile crystal cells are absent ( Bretscher et al., 2015 ). Altogether these results support that Notch signaling is necessary for crystal cell differentiation and depends on cluster structure. It is important to note, though, that hemocytes form clusters of different sizes and at different locations along the larval body ( Kurucz et al., 2007; Makhijani et al., 2011 ). Our cluster disruption procedure affects sessile hemocytes indiscriminately such that we cannot determine the relative importance of these cluster features on crystal cell differentiation.

Our motivation to carry out this work was to explain the increase of circulating and sessile crystal cell numbers during Drosophila larval development. This phenomenon is lined with an apparent paradox: no mature crystal cell has been seen dividing during larval stages ( Rizki, 1957; Lanot et al., 2001; Krzemien et al., 2010 ) and crystal cells in the lymph gland do not enter circulation in homeostatic conditions ( Holz et al., 2003 ). Crystal cell number increase may rely upon a population of pro-crystal cells that proliferates in the larva before cell maturation or that that exists in sufficient numbers at the beginning of development to mature into crystal cells throughout development. The first known upregulated gene diagnostic of crystal cell development is the transcription factor lozenge ( Lz ) ( Lebestky et al., 2000 ). That is, a cell will be Lz+ before it matures into crystal cell and maintains this expression upon differentiation ( Lebestky et al., 2000 ). We have shown that throughout third instar development, the number of Lz+ cells in the sessile population increases. This observation excludes the possibility that a population of Lz+ cells exists in fixed number and matures into crystal cell. Lz+ cells have been reported to proliferate during embryogenesis ( Lebestky et al., 2000 ). Surprisingly, we do not see Lz+ cell division in our video analysis. Although, with our results, we cannot exclude that a small proportion of Lz+ cells proliferate during larval stages, we can show that lozenge induction in Hml+Lz− is sufficient to explain the increase in Hml+ Lz+ cells during third instar larva. The activation of lozenge in hemocytes is Notch-dependent with Serrate acting as the ligand ( Duvic et al., 2002; Lebestky et al., 2003 )

. In fact, it has been recently shown that peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) neurons attract hemocytes and provide unknown trophic molecules for their survival ( Makhijani et al., 2011 ). The larva also possesses a hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, where plasmatocytes and crystal cells differentiate from prohemocytes ( Crozatier and Meister, 2007 ). Prohemocytes residing in the medullary zone of the lymph gland are instructed by cells from the posterior signaling center ( PSC ) to maintain their quiescent state or to differentiate into mature plasmatocytes or crystal cells ( Crozatier et al., 2004; Mandal et al., 2007 ). During the differentiation process, it has been suggested that cells migrate and occupy the most cortical zone of the lymph gland ( Jung et al., 2005; Krzemien et al., 2010b ). An essential aspect of the Drosophila larval hematopoiesis is that hemocytes produced in the lymph gland do not disperse from the organ until pupariation or upon injury such as parasitoid wasp egg infection ( Holz et al., 2003; Honti et al., 2010 ). Hence, in homeostatic conditions, differentiated hemocytes in the lymph gland do not contribute to the circulating and sessile hemocyte population. Nonetheless, the hemocyte population found in circulation and attached to the cuticular epidermis increases during larval development. We have shown that crystal cells in third instar larvae originate from plasocyte transdifferentiation through a Notch-dependent process contingent on the integrity of the sessile clusters. The existence of this hematopoiet tissue relying on structure-dependent signaling to promote homeostasis creates a new paradigm for addressing outstanding questions in Dophila hematopoies and establishing parallels with vertebrate systems.

    Title: Dosage compensation can buffer copy-number variation in wild yeast
    Abstract: Aneuploidy is linked to myriad diseases but also facilitates organismal evolution. It remains unclear how cells overcome the deleterious effects of aneuploidy until new phenotypes evolve. Although laboratory strains are extremely sensitive to aneuploidy, we show here that aneuploidy is common in wild yeast isolates, which show lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes. We generated diploid strain panels in which cells carried two, three, or four copies of the affected chromosomes, to show that gene-dosage compensation functions at 10–30% of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher expression constraint in wild populations—but they show elevated rates of gene amplification, suggesting that copy-number variation is buffered at these genes. We find that aneuploidy provides a clear ecological advantage to oak strain YPS1009, by amplifying a causal gene that escapes dosage compensation. Our work presents a model in which dosage compensation buffers gene amplification through aneuploidy to provide a natural, but likely transient, route to rapid phenotypic evolution.

   . We devised a CNV-buffering score, Bv, for each gene as the phylogeny-weighted sum of gene copy number across strains divided by Vg/Vm measured for that gene ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ) —genes with the strongest buffering capacity will therefore have the largest scores. Genes subject to dosage compensation show significantly higher Bv scores compared to all genes and compared to amplified genes with proportionately higher expression ( p = 1. 7e-4 ). Amplified genes with heritably reduced expression also showed higher buffering scores albeit lower than dosage-compensated genes ( see ‘Discussion’ ). Together, these results show that genes subject to dosage-compensated expression can be buffered against CNV in S. cerevisiae populations. The ability to buffer the toxicity of gene amplification could facilitate rapid evolution through aneuploidy. Aneuploidy in laboratory strains can be advantageous under adverse conditions, when non-dosage compensated defense genes are amplified in expression ( Hughes et al., 2000; Dunham et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2012; Yona et al., 2012 ) ; but the extent to which this occurs in nature is not known. We and others have previously shown that strains of S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus from wintry climates have undergone selection to maintain freeze-thaw ( FT ) tolerance ( Will et al., 2010; Leducq et al., 2014 ). We noted that the AQY2 water-transporter gene underlying FT tolerance ( Will et al., 2010 ) resides on Chr 12, which is amplified in New Jersey-oak strain YPS1009_Chr12-3n. AQY2 escapes dosage compensation, resulting in higher AQY2 expression across the strain panel ( Figure 10A ). Indeed, we found that FT resistance improves with increasing Chr 12 copy number in YPS1009 ( Figure 10B ). The strong signatures of selection that we previously observed at the AQY2 gene ( Will et al

. Genes with lower-than-expected expression are plotted in blue and genes with higher-than-expected expression are plotted in magenta ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ). The expected relationship representing proportionate increases in expression ( slope of 1. 0, intercept of 0 ) is shown in each panel. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 05462. 006 Two models could explain the reduced expression from amplified genes. New mutations, through adaptation or drift, could heritably reduce expression at toxic amplified genes. Alternatively, wild strains may actively down-regulate expression in proportion to gene dose, known as dosage compensation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we generated isogenic aneuploid–euploid strain pairs for three wild strains. We isolated euploid derivatives of strain T73_Chr8-4n ( denoting four copies of Chr 8 in the diploid strain ) and YJM428_Chr16-4n by serial passaging for many generations. We also used drug-based selection to isolate a mutant of naturally euploid oak-soil strain YPS163 in which Chr 8 was amplified ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ). We then conducted duplicate RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) analysis in the isogenic aneuploid–euploid pairs and identified genes on Chr 8 or Chr 16 with lower-than-expected expression, as above. Because the strains are nominally isogenic ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ), most expression differences between the strain pairs are an active response to the aneuploidy. Recapitulating the results shown above, roughly 11–36% of amplified genes, depending on the strain, showed lower-than-expected expression ( Figure 4B, blue points ), while 2–4% showed higher-than-expected expression ( Figure 4B, magenta points ). Few of these genes participate in the common response to chromosome amplification, suggesting a mechanism of dosage compensation

. Laboratory strains with forced aneuploidy are extremely slow growing, regardless of the chromosome amplified ( Torres et al., 2007; Pavelka et al., 2010 ). Transcriptomic and proteomic studies in these strains reported proportionately higher expression from virtually all amplified genes ( Torres et al., 2007; Pavelka et al., 2010; Torres et al., 2010; Sheltzer et al., 2012 ), with a handful of exceptions recently identified at the protein level ( Dephoure et al., 2014 ). The apparent lack of dosage compensation is consistent with another study by Springer et al. ( 2010 ), which found that expression at hemizygous genes is not up-regulated to compensate for reduced gene copy. While these studies have generated important results on aneuploidy intolerance in these particular strains, one caveat is that they were all done in laboratory strains, which have lost many features inherent in wild strains ( Kvitek et al., 2008; Lewis et al., 2010; Lewis and Gasch, 2012 ). A remaining question is the extent to which aneuploidy occurs in nature and contributes to phenotypic variation in the wild. Here, we report that chromosomal amplification is common in non-laboratory yeast strains, which are inherently tolerant of aneuploidy and display an active mode of gene-dosage compensation at the transcript level, for specific classes of amplified genes. Strikingly, genes subject to dosage compensation are buffered against copy-number variation ( CNV ) and thus show elevated rates of gene amplification in natural isolates. Our results raise new implications for the role of aneuploidy in phenotypic evolution and the mechanisms cells use to tolerate it.

. A substantial fraction of the genes scored in the forced YPS163 aneuploid displayed reduced expression, even though this strain had little time to adapt to the aneuploidy. Thus, dosage compensation is likely an inherent trait in S. cerevisiae that functions at a subset of yeast genes. To more accurately define genes subject to dosage compensation vs heritable polymorphisms, we next generated isogenic strain panels for oak strain YPS1009 and West African strain NCYC110, in which isogenic diploids carry two, three, or four copies of Chr 12 or Chr 8, respectively ( Figure 5A ). Expression in each strain within the YPS1009_Chr12 or NCYC110_Chr8 panels was normalized to a closely related euploid reference, YPS163 or NCYC3290, respectively. Comparing expression within the isogenic strain panel allows us to identify genes whose expression does not increase linearly as gene copy increases; comparing expression in the panel strains to the closely related euploid reference identifies heritable expression differences in the two strain backgrounds. A comparable panel was developed for laboratory strain W303 aneuploid for Chr 12. As expected, there was little growth difference across the wild-strain panels but a major defect as aneuploidy increased in the W303 laboratory strain ( Figure 5B ). 10. 7554/eLife. 05462. 007Figure 5.

. We investigated transcript abundance relative to DNA copy for amplified genes, interrogating 2204 genes spanning eight amplified chromosomes across the six aneuploids. Across all strains, nearly 40% of amplified genes showed lower expression per gene copy compared to the paired euploid ( Figure 4A, blue points, see ‘Materials and methods’ ). These were enriched for genes encoding ribosomal subunits, tRNA synthetases, and histones ( Figure 4B ). Conversely, 2% of amplified genes showed higher-than-expected expression ( Figure 4, magenta, see ‘Materials and methods’ ), including the AQ2 gene on Chr 12 in YPS9 ( Figure 4A ). The AQ2 gene encodes a water-transporter involved in freeze-tolerance ( Will et al, 2010 ). We found that AQ2 expression increases with Chr 12 copy number in YPS9 ( Figure 4B ) and that resistance to FT improves with increasing Chr 12 copy in Y9 ( Figure 4 ). The AQ2 gene is not subject to dosage compensation in Y9 ( Figure 4A ), suggesting that anupidy provides a selective advantage by amplifying AQ2 in this strain. Our results show that anupidy is common in wild isolates, which display lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes. We generated diploid strain panels which carried two, three, or four of the affected chromosomes to show that dosage functions at 10–30 of amplified. Genes subject to dosage are higher constraint in wild populations but show elevated rates of amplification suggesting that copy variation is buffered at these genes. We find anupidy provides a clear advantage to strain Y100 by amplifying a gene that escapes compensation. Our work presents a model in which compensation buffers amplification through anup to provide a natural but transient route to rapid evolution.

    Title: Extraocular, rod-like photoreceptors in a flatworm express xenopsin photopigment
    Abstract: Animals detect light using opsin photopigments. Xenopsin, a recently classified subtype of opsin, challenges our views on opsin and photoreceptor evolution. Originally thought to belong to the Gαi-coupled ciliary opsins, xenopsins are now understood to have diverged from ciliary opsins in pre-bilaterian times, but little is known about the cells that deploy these proteins, or if they form a photopigment and drive phototransduction. We characterized xenopsin in a flatworm, Maritigrella crozieri, and found it expressed in ciliary cells of eyes in the larva, and in extraocular cells around the brain in the adult. These extraocular cells house hundreds of cilia in an intra-cellular vacuole ( phaosome ). Functional assays in human cells show Maritigrella xenopsin drives phototransduction primarily by coupling to Gαi. These findings highlight similarities between xenopsin and c-opsin and reveal a novel type of opsin-expressing cell that, like jawed vertebrate rods, encloses the ciliary membrane within their own plasma membrane.

   . Our findings show that xenopsin is localized in different types of cillary cell, with different functions ( ocular and extraocular ) at different points in development, highlighting the importance of including developmental data into evolutionary scenarios on photoreceptor evolution. In fact, xenopsin in the extra-ocular ciliary phaosomes of adult Maritigrella is yet another similarity with ciliary opsin ( which is expressed in extra-ocular CPRs of annelids and arthropods ) and is consistent with the invertebrate trend of extra-ocular ciliary photoreceptors. In Maritigrella, it is puzzling that the ciliary phaosomes in the epidermis of the larva do not express xenopsin, whilst the ciliary phaosomes in the adult do. Ultrastructurally, these cells look similar in both stages, so it is possible that the larval cells migrate sub-epidermally over ontogeny. Perhaps in the larval stage they are not fully developed, or they express another type of opsin. Marine animals such as Maritigrella crozieri could use light in many ways. In addition to light as a visual stimulus, light intensity and wavelength can provide clues as to the time of day, the season, the state of the tide and water depth. Light will also be used differently by a minute swimming larva and a large crawling adult worm. We have characterized a new type of opsin-expressing cell in a flatworm and demonstrated that a recently classified opsin is capable of photosensitivity and phototransduction. This adds to the increasing diversity of animal photoreceptors and phototransduction pathways being discovered as more species are studied.

. The need for caution is reinforced by the observation that removing the smaller opsin clades from our dataset ( chaopsins, bathyopsins, ctenophore and anthozoan opsins ), changes the topology of the deeper nodes of our trees ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). The flatworm xenopsin protein sequences possess seven transmembrane domains ( characteristic of all G protein-coupled receptors ) as well as a conserved lysine in transmembrane domain VII, which is specific to opsins and which forms a Schiff base with the retinal chromophore to form a photopigment ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ). Mc xenopsin also possesses a tripeptide motif, NxQ, at positions 310–312, which is reported in other xenopsins ( Passamaneck et al., 2011; Vöcking et al., 2017 ) and in ciliary opsins where it is known to be crucial for G-protein activation ( Marin et al., 2000; Gühmann et al., 2015 ). We have found that a second amino acid signature, VxPx, found in vertebrate ciliary opsins at positions 423–426 is also present in xenopsins as well as in ciliary opsin sequences from non-vertebrate chordates ( tunicate and lamprey ), annelid c-opsins and cnidarian cnidopsins ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ). In c-opsins this motif directly binds the small GTPase Arf4 to direct vertebrate rhodopsin ( a ciliary opsin ) to the primary cilia ( Deretic et al., 2005 ). The presence of this motif in some ciliary opsins, xenopsins and cnidopsins suggests that Arf4 may be a shared mechanism for the active delivery of these opsins to the cilia in CPRs. A 422 amino acid gene product related to rhabdomeric opsin was also predicted from a Maritigrella crozieri transcriptome contig. Nine more flatworm rhabdomeric-like opsins were predicted from both free-living and parasitic species. They possess a tripeptide motif ( HP[K|R] ) ( supplementary figure 3 ) following the transmembrane helix VII, which is critical for G-protein binding in r-opsins ( Plachetzki and Oakley, 2007 )

., 2016; Bok et al., 2017; Vöcking et al., 2017 ), and the ability to localize the mRNA transcripts and proteins of opsins in a diversity of animals has uncovered many new and morphologically divergent photosensitive cell types, both ocular and extraocular ( Vöcking et al., 2017; Bok et al., 2017 ). The recent identification of one novel group of opsins – the xenopsins ( Ramirez et al., 2016 ) – is leading to a reevaluation of eye and photoreceptor cell type evolution ( Vöcking et al., 2017 ). Xenopsins have been found in several lophotrochozoan phyla: molluscs, rotifers, brachiopods, flatworms and an annelid ( Ramirez et al., 2016; Vöcking et al., 2017 ). They share with some ciliary opsins a characteristic c-terminal sequence motif ( NVQ ) and were originally classified as part of the c-opsins ( Passamaneck et al., 2011; Albertin et al., 2015; Yoshida et al., 2015 ). All recent opsin phylogenies have, however, shown xenopsins to be phylogenetically distinct from c-opsins ( Ramirez et al., 2016; Bok et al., 2017; Vöcking et al., 2017; Quiroga Artigas et al., 2018 ) and gene structure analysis supports this distinction ( Vöcking et al., 2017 ). The relationship between xenopsins ( lophotrochozoan protostome specific ) and c-opsins ( which are found in protostomes and deuterostomes ) suggests that both opsins were present in the last common ancestor of Bilateria, and that xenopsins were subsequently lost in deuterostomes and ecdysozoan protostomes ( Vöcking et al., 2017 ). Existing data on the expression of xenopsins are limited to the larval stages of a chiton and a brachiopod. In the brachiopod, xenopsin is expressed in cells with elaborated cilia and shading pigment that is pigmented eyespots ( Passamaneck et al., 2011 ), whereas, unusually, in the chiton larva it is co-expressed with r-opsin in cells containing both cilia and microvilli

. If Mc xenopsin in its native cell shows the same sustained response that we show here in mammalian cells, then perhaps these cells function to detect and amplify low levels of light, like vertebrate rods, and could be involved in detecting moonlight. The adult xenopsin+ ciliary phaosomes of Maritigrella are extraocular like the CPRs of the marine annelid Platynereis. In the annelid these are located in the brain and express a UV-sensitive ciliary opsin ( Arendt et al., 2004; Tsukamoto et al., 2017 ). These cells control circadian behaviors via melatonin production ( Tosches et al., 2014 ) and mediate downward swimming in response to non-directional UV light in the larval stage ( Verasztó et al., 2018 ). The Platynereis c-opsin binds to exogenous all-trans-retinal, which is particularly important for opsins expressed outside of the eyes ( Tsukamoto et al., 2017 ) where sophisticated multi-enzyme systems producing a thermally unstable 11-cis-retinal isomer probably don’t exist ( Yau and Hardie, 2009 ). Although Mc xenopsin was able form a photopigment with 9-cis-retinal it would be interesting to examine retinal isomerase activity in Maritrella.

    Title: Neuroblast-specific open chromatin allows the temporal transcription factor, Hunchback, to bind neuroblast-specific loci
    Abstract: Spatial and temporal cues are required to specify neuronal diversity, but how these cues are integrated in neural progenitors remains unknown. Drosophila progenitors ( neuroblasts ) are a good model: they are individually identifiable with relevant spatial and temporal transcription factors known. Here we test whether spatial/temporal factors act independently or sequentially in neuroblasts. We used Targeted DamID to identify genomic binding sites of the Hunchback temporal factor in two neuroblasts ( NB5-6 and NB7-4 ) that make different progeny. Hunchback targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent specification model. Moreover, each neuroblast had distinct open chromatin domains, which correlated with differential Hb-bound loci in each neuroblast. Importantly, the Gsb/Pax3 spatial factor, expressed in NB5-6 but not NB7-4, had genomic binding sites correlated with open chromatin in NB5-6, but not NB7-4. Our data support a model in which early-acting spatial factors like Gsb establish neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, leading to neuroblast-specific temporal factor binding and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage.

    Supporting Text:
   . Apart from the commonly regulated loci, we identified over 100 loci that are differentially bound by Hb in NB5-6 or NB7-4. These are excellent candidates for lineage-specific neuronal specification. Our study, coming almost two decades after the first descriptions of spatial and temporal patterning in Drosophila neural stem cells ( Isshiki et al., 2001 ), has for the first time explored the mechanism by which spatial and temporal factors could be integrated to generate neuroblast-specific neuronal progeny. Only recently has it been possible to probe TTF DNA-binding and chromatin landscapes within two distinct neuroblast lineages – due to the parallel advances in genetic tools, functional genomics, and our ability to manipulate the genome. Given the conservation of mechanisms in generating neural diversity in vertebrates and invertebrates, and exquisite ways in which the genome can now be manipulated in different organisms, it is now possible to determine if similar mechanisms generate diversity during vertebrate neurogenesis.

. Importantly, Hb can induce early-born neuronal identity throughout a ‘competence window’ of ~5 neuroblast divisions ( from embryonic stage 9–12 ). The length of the competence window is defined by expression of Distal antenna ( Dan ), a nuclear Pipsqueak domain protein present in all neuroblast nuclei until stage 12 ( about five divisions for most neuroblasts ) ; Dan is downregulated in all neuroblasts at the end of stage 12, and this closes the Hb competence window ( Kohwi et al., 2013 ). Hb can induce first-born neuronal identity at any point during this competence window, showing that Hb binding sites are accessible throughout the competence window; this is important to consider for the experiments described here, where we have restricted our Hb binding and chromatin accessibility profiling experiments to the stage 9–12 competence window in individual neuroblast lineages ( see below ). It is clear that spatial and temporal cues are integrated to generate lineage-specific neuronal diversity, both in Drosophila embryonic neuroblasts and optic lobe neuroblasts ( Erclik et al., 2017 ), and likely in mammalian progenitor lineages. Yet in no case, mammals or Drosophila, is it known how spatial and TTFs are integrated. Here we hypothesise two mechanisms by which this integration could occur. ( 1 ) Independent specification ( Figure 1B ). In this scenario, spatial and temporal transcription factors bind their genomic targets independently, and the combinatorial actions of these factors and their downstream gene regulatory networks results in unique gene expression and therefore unique neural identities. ( 2 ) Sequential specification ( Figure 1C ). In this scenario, early expression of STFs in the neuroectoderm ( where they are known to act ) biases the subsequent DNA-binding profile of the later expressed TTFs

. This could happen via STFs generating different chromatin landscapes in each neuroblast, or via STFs promoting the persistent expression of TTF cofactors that result in neuroblast-specific TTF DNA-binding. While both scenarios would result in the specification of distinct neural identities in spatially distinct NBs, in the independent specification model, TTF binding will be identical in all neuroblasts whereas in the sequential specification model, TTF binding will occur at different loci in each neuroblast. To discriminate between these models, we sought to determine Hb genomic targets in NB5-6 versus NB7-4. If independent specification is used, we expect to find similar Hb occupancy in each neuroblast ( Figure 1B ), whereas if sequential specification is used, we expect to find different Hb genomic binding in each neuroblast ( Figure 1C ). Our goal was to identify Hb occupancy within the early NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages during the Hb competence window, when Hb retains the ability to generate ectopic early-born neuronal identities, and thus presumably can still bind its normal genomic targets. To identify Hb occupancy in these two neuroblast lineages, we adapted the previously described Targeted DamID ( TaDa ) method ( Southall et al., 2013; Marshall et al., 2016 ). TaDa relies on an attenuated expression of the DNA adenosine methyltransferase ( Dam ) enzyme ( Figure 1D ), which binds genomic DNA and methylates adenosine at GATC sites. This covalent DNA mark can be used to determine Dam binding sites, due to the very low level of endogenous DNA methylation in Drosophila. Expression of Dam alone can be used to detect open chromatin ( Aughey et al., 2018 ) ( Figure 1E ) or Dam can be fused to a transcription factor such as Hb, which provides a read-out of Hb genomic occupancy ( Figure 1F ). Here we characterize two Gal4 lines that are specific for NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages in the embryo

The generation of neuronal diversity in mammals and Drosophila is a multi-step process. The initial step is the production of the neuroectoderm ( ventral in Drosophila, dorsal in mammals ) that gives rise to neural progenitors. In both systems, the neuroectoderm and neural progenitor population acquire regional differences due to the action of Hox genes and spatial patterning genes ( Jessell, 2000 ). Although spatial patterning generates diversity within the neural progenitor population, it is insufficient to account for the neuronal diversity in the mature nervous system. Expanding neural diversity requires a second step called temporal patterning, where individual neural progenitors produce a sequence of distinct neurons and glia ( Doe, 2017 ). In both Drosophila and mammals, this process appears to be regulated, in part, by temporal transcription factors ( TTFs ) that are sequentially expressed within individual neural progenitors ( Kohwi and Doe, 2013 ). Although a great deal is known about how spatial factors generate regional diversity, and much has recently been learned about temporal patterning mechanisms, virtually nothing is known about how spatial factors and TTFs are integrated to specify distinct neuronal identities in spatially distinct progenitor populations. Drosophila is an excellent model system to investigate how spatial and temporal factors are integrated during neurogenesis, due to a deep understanding of neural progenitor ( neuroblast ) lineages, and the molecular mechanisms involved in both spatial and temporal patterning during neurogenesis. The Drosophila neuroectoderm produces a bilateral array of 30 neuroblasts in each segment, named according to their row and columnar position within the two dimensional neuroblast array ( Figure 1A, left ). Each neuroblast has a unique identity based on its distinct molecular profile and each neuroblast produces a unique and stereotyped family of neurons

. The genes closest to the top five differentially occupied loci in each neuroblast are marked in this plot, and shown in Figure 4E, F. Based on these results, we conclude that Dam:Hb binds different loci in different neuroblasts. This clearly rules out the independent specification model where Hb has identical binding sites in different neuroblasts. We next wanted to understand how STFs might influence TTF genomic binding. Given the order of their action – STFs acting early in the neuroectoderm, and TTFs acting later in the delaminated NB – one possibility is that STFs generate different open/closed chromatin landscapes in each neuroblast such that TTFs have access to different loci in each neuroblast. This would predict that spatially distinct NBs would have different open/closed chromatin landscapes. To determine if this were indeed true, we performed chromatin accessibility profiling by Dam only ( CaTaDa ), which exploits the ability of the Dam protein to bind open chromatin domains ( Aughey et al., 2018 ). We first expressed Dam in all cells throughout embryogenesis using Da-Gal4 and observed excellent reproducibility between biological replicates both qualitatively and quantitatively ( Figure 5A, red tracks in C ). We next wanted to confirm that Dam only binding in the embryo correlates with open chromatin domains. To do this, we used Dam-Gal in NB-6 and NB-7 lineages and observed that Dam binding in both lineages correlated with open chrom domains ( Figure 5B, red in C ). This shows that Dam can be used as a proxy for open/closed chromatin. We then used Dam-Gal in NB-6 and NB-7 lineages and observed that Dam binding in both lineages correlated with open domains ( Figure 5, red in C ) This shows that Dam can be used as proxy for open/closed chrom. We used Dam-G in NB-6 and NB-7 line and observed that binding in both line correlated with domains ( Figure 5, red C ) This shows Dam can be used as proxy for open/closed. We used Dam in NB-6 and NB-7 and observed that binding in both correlated with ( Figure 5, C ) This shows Dam can be as proxy for open/closed We used Dam in NB-6 and NB-7 and observed that in both correlated ( Figure 5, C ) shows Dam can be as for open/closed We Dam in NB- and NB observed that in both ( Figure 5, C ) shows can be as open/closed Dam in NB- and observed that in ( Figure 5, C ) can be open/closed Dam in and observed that ( Figure 5, C ) can be/closed Dam and that ( Figure 5, C ) can/closed Dam that Figure 5 C shows that Dam binding in both lineages correlates with open/closed chromatin. We then used Dam-G in NB- and observed that binding in correlated with open/closed ( Figure 5, C ) This shows Dam can be used as proxy for open/closed We used Dam in NB and observed that binding in correlated with open/closed ( Figure 5, C ) This Dam can be used as for open/closed We used Dam and observed that binding in correlated with open/closed (5, C ) Dam can be as open/closed We Dam observed that in and binding correlated with open/closed (5, C ) can be/closed Dam in and observed that (5, C ) can/closed Dam that (5, C )/closed Dam Figure 5 shows that Dam binding in both line correlates with open/closed We used Dam-G in and observed that binding correlated with open/closed (5, C ) This Dam can be as open/closed We used Dam and observed that in correlated with open/closed (5, C ) can/closed Dam in observed (5, ) can/closed Dam that (5 )/closed Dam Figure 5 shows that Dam in both line correlates with open/c We used Dam and observed that in with open/closed (5, ) can/closed Dam (5 )/closed Dam Figure 5 shows Dam in both line with open/c We used Dam and that in open/closed (5 ) can/closed Dam ( )/closed Dam 5 shows Dam in line with open/c We used Dam that in/closed (5 ) can/closed Dam ( )/closed Dam 5 shows Dam both with open/c We Dam that in/closed ( ) can/closed Dam ( )/closed Dam 5 shows Dam in open/c We that/closed Dam ( )/closed Dam 5 shows Dam with/c that/closed ( )/ Dam 5 shows Dam in/closed that ( )/ Dam 5 shows that Dam/closed ( )/ Dam 5 shows that/closed )

    Title: Photo-switchable tweezers illuminate pore-opening motions of an ATP-gated P2X ion channel
    Abstract: P2X receptors function by opening a transmembrane pore in response to extracellular ATP. Recent crystal structures solved in apo and ATP-bound states revealed molecular motions of the extracellular domain following agonist binding. However, the mechanism of pore opening still remains controversial. Here we use photo-switchable cross-linkers as ‘molecular tweezers’ to monitor a series of inter-residue distances in the transmembrane domain of the P2X2 receptor during activation. These experimentally based structural constraints combined with computational studies provide high-resolution models of the channel in the open and closed states. We show that the extent of the outer pore expansion is significantly reduced compared to the ATP-bound structure. Our data further reveal that the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining helices come closer during opening, likely through a hinge-bending motion. These results provide new insight into the gating mechanism of P2X receptors and establish a versatile strategy applicable to other membrane proteins.

    Supporting Text:
    In this study, we report on the use of molecular photo-switchable tweezers in conjunction with MD simulations to explore the function of a trimeric ion channel. We show that a vertical decrease of the distance separating the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining TM2 helices, likely through bending at a critical ‘gating hinge’, is essential for activation of the P2X2 receptor. Tethered molecular photo-switches have been already employed for the optical control of many receptors and ion channels ( Volgraf et al., 2006; Fehrentz et al., 2011; Tochitsky et al., 2012; Levitz et al., 2013 ), including the trimeric acid-sensing ion channels ( ASICs ) ( Browne et al., 2014 ) and ATP-gated P2X receptors ( Lemoine et al., 2013; Browne et al., 2014 ), mainly to achieve an optogenetic mimicry of neuronal signaling. They were also developed as biophysical tools to control conformational changes of peptides, proteins, or other biomolecules ( Beharry and Woolley, 2011; Szymanski et al., 2013 ), but probing ion-channel activation or desensitization processes using such photo-switches still remains very limited ( Browne et al., 2014; Reiner and Isacoff, 2014 ). Therefore, the photo-switchable tweezers strategy presented here is distinct from the optogating approach described previously ( Lemoine et al., 2013 ), and provides distance restraints related to gating at physiological conditions. Introducing them as input in MD studies of P2X receptors allowed us to stabilize the open-channel state for the first time in simulation. Interestingly, the resulting model differs substantially from the X-ray structure of the ATP-bound state of zfP2X4, particularly in the TMD. There are at least three major issues that may arise from the photo-switchable tweezers strategy

. Whether or not the disagreement between our new model of the open state and the inter-subunit Cd2+ binding site would be sufficient to disprove its structural details is questionable and further ( crosslinking ) experiments are required. Depending on the cross-linking location, MAM is able to trap ( at least ) two distinct open-channel conformations, as evidenced by differences in desensitization kinetics and NMDG permeability. Although NMDG permeability was insignificant in one case ( horizontal cross-linking ) and partial in the other ( vertical cross-linking ), our data support the idea that the P2X pore fluctuates between distinct open conformations, and that these photo-switchable tweezers may be useful to investigate the controversial molecular mechanism of pore dilation. Finally, we found that the vertical rearrangement of two TM2-TM2 interfaces is sufficient to drive channel gating, which is fully consistent with the recent finding that binding of two ATP molecules is sufficient to open the channel ( Stelmashenko et al., 2012; Keceli and Kubo, 2014 ). However, the situation is different for the lateral separation of the outer ends of TM2 helices, for which we ( present study ) and others ( Browne et al., 2014 ) have shown that breaking of one TM2-TM2 interface is sufficient for gating. As there is no evidence that this movement alters the sensitivity for ATP, the light-induced outward expansion of a single TM2-TM2 interface is likely a local rearrangement of the TMD. In conclusion, this study provides the first application of photo-switchable derivatives to investigate the mechanism of pore gating in P2X receptors. By incorporating photo-switchable tweezers at engineered sites at the outer ends ( horizontal cross-linking ) or between the inner and outer ends ( vertical cross-linking ) of adjacent TM2 helices, we demonstrate that these tools can be used as molecular rulers to probe structural changes involved in activation

. The first one is related to the flexibility of the photo-linker ( Beharry and Woolley, 2011 ), as we showed that free MAM in solution is not completely rigid, in particular the cis isomer, whose end-to-end distance distribution spans from 4 to 22 Å. However, when cross-linked to the TMD of the receptor, we provide evidence that the end-to-end distance distribution shrinks considerably due to the steric constraints imposed by the surrounding protein and membrane. Thus, cross-linked MAM can be considered as a photo-switchable molecular ruler. The second point is the physiological relevance of the light-gated motions. We show here that light-gated channels exhibit biophysical features of the WT receptor activated by ATP, suggesting that the discrete conformational states elicited by light closely resemble those populated by ATP. Most importantly, we found that light-induced motions of the TMD positively modulate ATP function, thus indicating an efficient crosstalk between the ion pore and the distant neurotransmitter-binding sites, a mechanism that is reminiscent of the action of positive allosteric modulators. It remains to be determined, however, whether or not pathways elicited by light that lead to channel opening and closing are similar to those triggered by ATP. The third potential shortcoming is the uncertainties of the extent of ‘mixed channels’ formed from a heterogeneous population of cross-linked subunits. Although we cannot formerly rule out this possibility, experiments with concatemers rather suggest that mixed channels, if present, occur insignificantly

The family of P2X receptors encompasses seven subtypes in mammals ( termed P2X1-7 ) that are widely expressed in many cells, including neurons ( Khakh and North, 2006 ). These receptors are trimeric ion channels that switch rapidly between closed and opened conformations in response to extracellular ATP ( Browne et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2013 ). Once opened, a flow of ions ( sodium, potassium and calcium ) transit through the transmembrane ( TM ) pore and initiates signal transduction. Depending on the P2X subtype, gating is followed by desensitization, a temporary inactivation that terminates the ion flow. ATP-gated P2X receptors are also involved in a wide range of pathological disorders, including chronic and inflammatory pain ( Khakh and North, 2006; Abbracchio et al., 2009 ). A detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the gating process is thus of fundamental importance and may open new therapeutic avenues. Recent X-ray structures of the zebrafish P2X4 ( zfP2X4 ) receptor in its apo and ATP-bound states have provided a molecular understanding of how ATP binding triggers channel opening ( Kawate et al., 2009; Hattori and Gouaux, 2012 ). There are three interfacial ATP-binding pockets in the extracellular domain ( ECD ) that protrude ~40 Å outside of the membrane. The transmembrane domain ( TMD ) comprises six TM spanning α-helices, two from each subunit termed TM1 and TM2, which are arranged around the threefold axis of symmetry, with TM1 positioned peripheral to TM2. The pore-lining TM2 helices are steeply angled nearly 45° from the membrane plane and they form, in the apo state, a gate in the middle of the membrane that is thought to control the flux of ions. For this reason, the apo form is believed to represent a resting, closed state of the receptor ( Kawate et al., 2009 )

. Although a similar kink has been previously described in X-ray structures ( Hattori and Gouaux, 2012 ) in proximity of a highly conserved glycine residue ( zfP2X4 G350; rP2X2 G342 ), its functional role in channel opening remains unclear ( Li et al., 2004; Khakh and North, 2012 ). We hypothesized that bending of TM2 helices around this glycine would facilitate the inner and outer ends of adjacent TM2 helices to come closer together in the open state. To test this assumption, we mutated this residue into proline ( G342P ), which is known to facilitate bending of α-helices, and found a dramatic 25-fold increase in ATP sensitivity compared to the WT P2X2 ( Figure 1A ). This result supports the idea that bending of TM2 helices is essential for channel opening. However, the mechanism of pore opening remains controversial, particularly the extent of outer expansion of the pore in the open state compared to the ATP-bound structure and the motion of the inner and outer ends of adjacent TM helices.

    Title: Cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms promote cell-type-specific cytokinetic diversity
    Abstract: Cytokinesis, the physical division of one cell into two, is powered by constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring. It has long been assumed that all animal cells divide by a similar molecular mechanism, but growing evidence suggests that cytokinetic regulation in individual cell types has more variation than previously realized. In the four-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, each blastomere has a distinct cell fate, specified by conserved pathways. Using fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute drug treatment, we identified cell-type-specific variation in the cytokinetic requirement for a robust forminCYK-1-dependent filamentous-actin ( F-actin ) cytoskeleton. In one cell ( P2 ), this cytokinetic variation is cell-intrinsically regulated, whereas in another cell ( EMS ) this variation is cell-extrinsically regulated, dependent on both SrcSRC-1 signaling and direct contact with its neighbor cell, P2. Thus, both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms control cytokinetic variation in individual cell types and can protect against division failure when the contractile ring is weakened.

    Supporting Text:
    Here, we used thermogenetics, drug treatment, and embryo microdissection to probe the mechanisms of cell-type-based variation in the regulation of cytokinesis among individual blastomeres within the four-cell C. elegans embryo. We found cell-type-specific differences in both the functional levels and temporal window of activity required for forminCYK-1 activity, but not myosin-IINMY-2 activity, during cytokinesis. We found that, similar to in the one-cell embryo ( Davies et al., 2014 ), forminCYK-1 inhibition resulted in cytokinesis failure in ABa and ABp blastomeres. In contrast to the one-cell embryo and ABa/ABp cells, both EMS and P2 blastomeres were protected against cytokinesis failure and divided successfully with consistent frequency upon inhibition of forminCYK-1 and in the absence of a robust F-actin contractile ring. This is not likely due to an F-actin-independent role for forminCYK-1, as we found cytokinesis in EMS and P2 was also more resistant to LatA, a pharmaceutical inhibitor of F-actin polymerization, than cytokinesis in ABa/ABp. Cell isolation and blastomere pairing experiments revealed that P2 is protected against cytokinesis failure due to cell-intrinsic regulation and independent of contact with other blastomeres. In contrast, we found that EMS is protected against cytokinesis failure by extrinsic regulation due to direct cell-cell contact with P2 and SrcSRC-1 mediated cell-fate signaling. This work establishes the early C. elegans four-cell embryo as a system to study cytokinetic diversity and suggests that, at least in the early C. elegans embryo, both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms contribute to cell-type-specific cytokinetic diversity

. To study the mechanisms of cytokinetic variation, we combined thermogenetics with cell type-specific in vivo and ex vivo analysis of cytokinesis in each blastomere of the four-cell C. elegans embryo. We used fast-acting temperature-sensitive ( ts ) alleles to inactivate two cytokinesis proteins essential for contractile ring constriction in the one-cell embryo ( Davies et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2010 ) : the motor myosin-II ( NMY-2 in C. elegans, hereafter myosin-IINMY-2 ) and the diaphanous formin CYK-1 ( hereafter forminCYK-1 ). We identified cell-type-specific variation in four-cell embryos in the molecular requirement for forminCYK-1, but not myosin-IINMY-2. Specifically, we found that while cytokinesis in two blastomeres, ABa and ABp, is sensitive to reduced forminCYK-1 activity, cytokinesis in the other two blastomeres, EMS and P2, is resistant to defects in forminCYK-1-mediated F-actin assembly. Likewise, cytokinesis in ABa and ABp cells is sensitive to treatment with low doses of LatrunculinA ( LatA ), a drug that block F-actin polymerization, whereas cytokinesis in EMS and P2 cells is resistant to LatA. We further found that EMS and P2 cells have greatly reduced F-actin levels at the division plane upon forminCYK-1 disruption, despite considerable and often successful equatorial constriction during cytokinesis, suggesting that cytokinesis in these cells is less dependent on F-actin in the contractile ring. To determine if EMS- and P2-specific variation in cytokinesis regulation is due to cell-intrinsic or -extrinsic regulation, we isolated individual blastomeres by embryo microdissection and examined the effect on cytokinesis when kept in isolation or when sister blastomeres were paired

We first sought to identify variation in the regulation of cytokinesis in individual blastomeres within the four-cell C. elegans embryo ( Figure 1A ). To do this, we took a thermogenetic approach and used fast-acting ts alleles to weaken the contractile ring, while monitoring differences in cytokinesis between ABa, ABp, EMS, and P2 at increasing temperatures by spinning disc confocal microscopy. We used ts alleles of two contractile ring proteins known to be essential for cell division in most animal cell types ( Davies et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2010; Severson et al., 2002; Castrillon and Wasserman, 1994; Afshar et al., 2000; Bohnert et al., 2013; Moseley and Goode, 2005; Chang et al., 1997; Kiehart et al., 1982 ) : the motor myosin-IINMY-2 ( nmy-2 ( ne3409ts ), hereafter myosin-IInmy-2 ( ts ) ) and the diaphanous forminCYK-1 ( cyk-1 ( or596ts ), hereafter formincyk-1 ( ts ) ). The myosin-IInmy-2 ( ts ) mutant has a point mutation in the myosin neck ( S2 ) domain, required for dimerization and head coupling ( Liu et al., 2010; Tama et al., 2005 ). The formincyk-1 ( ts ) mutant has a point mutation in the post-region ( FH2 domain ) required for dimerization and processive F-actin polymerization ( Pruyne et al., 2002 ), including at the division plane ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) ( Davies et al., 2014 ). Both mutations completely block cytokinesis in the C. elegans one-cell embryo and have a null-like phenotype at restrictive temperature ( 26°C ), with no contractile ring constriction ( Davies et al., 2014 ). These ts mutants are functionally tunable with temperature, having higher activity at lower temperatures and lower activity at higher temperatures ( Davies et al., 2017 ). We used this property of thermal tunability to determine if the requirement for myosin-IINMY-2 or forminCYK-1 varies between the four different blastomeres

. For example, in embryos treated with 80 nM LatA, 100% of ABa ( n = 13 ) and ABp ( n = 13 ) cells failed in cytokinesis, while EMS and P2 cells divided ~25% of the time ( EMS: 26%, n = 19; P2: 28%, n = 18 ). These LatA results phenocopy the cell-type-specific requirement for forminCYK-1 activity and again suggest that EMS and P2 are protected against cytokinesis failure when the F-actin cytoskeleton is weakened. We next investigated whether protection from cytokinesis failure in EMS and P2 is due to cell-intrinsic or -extrinsic regulatory mechanisms. We first eliminated the potential for cell-extrinsic regulation by isolating each individual blastomere from embryos by manual microdissection ( Figure 6A ). After removing the eggshell, individual blastomeres were separated at the two-cell stage and allowed to divide again at permissive temperature, followed by another round of sister cell separation, resulting in an isolated ABa/ABp, EMS, and P2 cell from each embryo ( Figure 6A ). Upon isolation, the ABa and ABp cells cannot be distinguished from each other, as they are identical in size and fate in the absence of cell-contact-mediated extrinsic signaling from P2 to ABp ( Mickey et al., 1996; Bowerman et al., 1992; Mango et al., 1994; Moskowitz et al., 1994; Shelton and Bowerman, 1996 ) ; hence, we refer to these isolated blastomeres as AB daughters ( ABd ) ( Figure 6A, B ). EMS and P2 can easily be distinguished from each other and the ABd by their unique sizes, which do not change upon isolation ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ). Isolated blastomeres were then treated with 80M LatA and monitored for cytokinesis by spinning confocal microscopy. We found that isolated ABd cells failed cytokinesis 100% of the time ( n = 13 ) while EMSd and Pd divided ~25% of the time ( EMSd:26%, n= =19; Pd:28, = 18 ). This shows that EMS and P are protected against cytokinesis failure due to cell-intrinsic regulation, independent of contact with other blastomeres. We next tested the role of cell-extrinsic regulation by pairing isolated blastom with each other ( Figure 7 ). We paired EMS with ABd and P with ABd and monitored cytokinesis by spinning confocal microscopy. We found that EMSd paired with ABd failed cytokinesis 100% of the time ( n=13 ) while Pd paired with ABd divided ~25% of the time ( Pd26%, n=19 ). This shows that EMS is protected against cytokinesis by extrinsic due to direct cell contact with P and Src-1 mediated cellate signaling.

    Title: A model symbiosis reveals a role for sheathed-flagellum rotation in the release of immunogenic lipopolysaccharide
    Abstract: Bacterial flagella mediate host–microbe interactions through tissue tropism during colonization, as well as by activating immune responses. The flagellar shaft of some bacteria, including several human pathogens, is encased in a membranous sheath of unknown function. While it has been hypothesized that the sheath may allow these bacteria to evade host responses to the immunogenic flagellin subunit, this unusual structural feature has remained an enigma. Here we demonstrate that the rotation of the sheathed flagellum in both the mutualist Vibrio fischeri and the pathogen Vibrio cholerae promotes release of a potent bacteria-derived immunogen, lipopolysaccharide, found in the flagellar sheath. We further present a new role for the flagellar sheath in triggering, rather than circumventing, host immune responses in the model squid-vibrio symbiosis. Such an observation not only has implications for the study of bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella, but also raises important biophysical questions of sheathed-flagellum function.

    Using the model squid-vibrio symbiosis as a tool to probe the effect of the enigmatic flagellar sheath on host recognition, we uncover a previously unrecognized role for the rotation of sheathed flagella in mediating the release of the immunogenic molecule LPS in both V. fischeri and its pathogenic congener V. cholerae. The flagellar sheath has proved problematic to study; indeed, to our knowledge, there are no mutations that result in the loss of a sheath in otherwise sheathed flagella. Intriguingly, a few Vibrio species, including the human pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus, encode two independent flagellar structures: one set producing sheathed, the other unsheathed flagella ( McCarter, 1999 ). However, pleiotropic effects of mutations in these distinct pathways as well as other technical limitations make a direct comparison of unsheathed and sheathed flagella within this species difficult to interpret ( L McCarter, personal communication ). Thus, the functional role of the sheath, even as it relates to bacterial motility, remains poorly characterized, and observation of this new phenomenon for the flagellar sheath furthers our understanding of this enigmatic structure and its contribution to bacterial virulence. As this behavior is difficult to probe experimentally, novel approaches, such as the modeling of the biophysical properties underlying lipid-membrane behavior at a sub-micron scale, are needed to inform our understanding of the interactions between the sheath and filament along the length of the flagellum, as well as the physical forces at play between a rotating flagellar sheath and the contiguous, but static, cellular outer membrane. While vesicle-like structures have only been reported at the flagellar tip of V. fischeri ( Millikan and Ruby, 2004 ), another possible region from which LPS may be shed during rotation is the base of the flagellum where the basal body perturbs the outer membrane

Bacterial flagella are important virulence factors that facilitate tissue tropism in host–microbe interactions. Besides mediating such migration, flagella serve additional functions, such as adherence to or invasion of host cells ( Young et al., 2000; Hayashi et al., 2001; Giron et al., 2002 ). However, in most vertebrate models of pathogenesis, it has been difficult to separate the distinct contribution of flagellar motility in bacterial migration from its other roles, such as immune-system activation ( Feuillet et al., 2006; Andersen-Nissen et al., 2007 ). Bacterial flagella are highly conserved on a molecular level, but display diversity in morphology, number and subcellular localization between species. One such variation is the presence of an outer membrane-derived sheath ( Fuerst and Perry, 1988; Geis et al., 1993; Ferooz and Letesson, 2010 ). While the flagella of most bacteria are unsheathed, such a structure surrounds the filament of several polarly flagellated bacteria, including several with a host-associated lifestyle. The biological function ( s ) of the sheath remains unknown, but it has been posited to allow these bacteria to evade innate immune recognition of the enclosed flagellins ( Gewirtz et al., 2004; Yoon and Mekalanos, 2008 ). This hypothesized role for the flagellar sheath presents a conundrum: what is the effect of coating a rapidly spinning structure with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ), another potent immunostimulatory molecule? As the tools with which to study the flagellar sheath are limited, we sought to use the model symbiosis between Vibrio fischeri and the Hawaiian bobtail squid, in which the events of initial colonization can be observed in real-time, to probe whether the sheathed flagellum plays a role in inducing a symbiont-specific host response. V

. In this symbiosis, the LPS is produced by a few non-growing bacterial cells at a tissue interface, in high flow-field conditions that further confound quantification. Finally, if LPS is shed from the flagellar tip as vesicles, other molecules such as flagellin might be enclosed, and these components may act synergistically to induce host responses ( although flagellin has not yet been characterized as a morphogen in this association ). Alternatively, LPS released from either the tip or base of the flagellum might form vesicles with a smaller diameter than the cell-derived OMVs, thereby enabling tighter interaction with the host-cell surfaces. Further work will build upon these discoveries and clarify the mechanisms underlying signaling during initiation of the squid-vibrio symbiosis; such work includes characterizing the composition of LPS released by V. fischeri during flagellar rotation, identifying the squid receptors that recognize V. fischeri LPS ( Goodson et al., 2005; Krasity et al., 2011 ), and determining any role flagellin may have in activating host responses. While thus far demonstrated only in V. fischeri and V. cholerae, the phenomenon of flagellar-mediated LPS release may be conserved across other animal-associated bacteria with sheathed flagella. The human pathogens Brucella melitensis and Helicobacter pylori, whose sheathed flagellum and/or flagellar motility serve as important virulence factors ( Ottemann and Lowenthal, 2002; Petersen et al., 2011 ), may similarly release the immunogenic molecule LPS during flagellar rotation and, thereby, regulate immune recognition during infection. However, the complexity of mammalian models of host–microbe interactions can limit efforts to separate the various contributions of flagellar motility, and highlights the role of invertebrate model systems in revealing the underlying principles that govern shared mechanisms of host–microbe interactions.

. Interestingly, cryotomographic imaging has revealed unusual features in the Vibrio flagellar basal body that may help stabilize this interaction ( Chen et al., 2011 ). Additionally, our results show that flagellar rotation in V. fischeri promotes release of the immunogenic molecule LPS that, during initiation of symbiosis, is required for normal induction of apoptotic tissue development ( Foster et al., 2000 ). Further, by activating the squid’s developmental program in response to symbiont exposure, the flagellar sheath may serve to promote recognition by the host immune system, suggesting the context-dependent nature ( mutualism or pathogenesis ) of this behavior. Perhaps masking one immunostimulatory molecule ( e. g., flagellin ) with another ( e. g., LPS ) can serve to modulate, rather than simply avoid ( Gewirtz et al., 2004; Yoon and Mekalanos, 2008 ), detection by the host immune system. Surprisingly, although both the flrA and motB1 mutants still release LPS in culture, albeit at a reduced level, we observed complete attenuation of apoptotic induction, suggesting that ( i ) the threshold of LPS sensed by host cells is exquisitely calibrated to the amount of LPS shed by V. fischeri; ( ii ) because V. fischeri cells are not dividing during symbiotic initiation, flagellar-mediated LPS release is the predominant source of LPS to which host cells are exposed; and/or ( iii ) the LPS released by wild-type V. fischeri is somehow presented in a more immunogenically active form than that released by either the flrA or motB1 mutant. This last point emphasizes the microheterogeneous chemical structures of LPS made by bacteria like V. fischeri ( Phillips et al., 2011 ). This heterogeneity, as well as LPS’s insolubility in aqueous solution and the toxicity of spent medium to juvenile squid, makes directly comparing the chemical concentration or specific activity of LPS between culture and symbiotic settings problematic

. Such images are indicative of weaknesses between the flagellar sheath and shaft, which may be analogous to the foci of disassociation between the outer membrane and peptidoglycan required for the formation of cell-derived outer-membrane vesicles ( OMVs ) ( McBroom et al. 2010 ). The flagellar sheath may also be involved in the release of LPS from the base of the flagellum where the basal body perturbs the outer membrane, as has been observed in V. fischer ( Millikan and Ruby,2004 ). The flagellar sheath’s role in the release of LPS at the base of the flagellum is supported by the observation that LPS is found in the flagellar sheath of V. fischer and V. cholera, but not in the flagellum of V. parahaemolyticus, which has unshe flagella ( McCarter 199 ). The flagellar sheath’s role in the release of LPS at the base of the flagell is also supported by the observation that LPS is found in flagellar sheath of V. fischer and V cholera but not in flagellum of V parahaolytic which has unshe flag ( McCarter 199 ) The flagellar she’s role in the release of L at the base of the flagum is supported by the observation that LPS is found in the flagellar sheath of V fischer and cholera but not in the flagum of parahaolytic which has unshe ( McCarter 199 ) The flagellar she’s role in the release of L at the base of the flag is supported by the observation that L is in the flagellar she of fischer and cholera but not the flag of parahaoly which has uns ( McC 199 ) The flagellar’s role in the release of L at the base the flag is supported by the observation that is in the flag she of fischer and cholera but the flag of paraha which uns ( McC 199 The flag’s role in release at the base the flag is supported by observation that in the she fischer and cholera but flag paraha uns ( McC 199 The flag’s in release at the base the flag is supported by observation in she fischer and cholera paraha ( McC 199 The flag in the release at the flag is supported by observation fischer and chol paraha ( McC 199 The in the release at flag is supported fischer paraha ( 199 The release at flag supported fischer (199 The flag supported fischer (199
Researchers have identified a phenomenon of catastrophic chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination in Arabidopsis plants, a process resulting from hybridization of plants expressing different centromere histone H3. Shattered chromosomes are formed from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single lard compartmentalized within a micronucle. Analysis of breakpoint junctions implicates breaks followed by non-homous end joining (NHE) or stalled repair. Furthermore, mutation of NHE factor Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery. Heritability and stability of rearranged chromosome suggest potential for enduring novelty. These findings provide a tractable system towards investigating causes and mechanisms of genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with human disorders.

The study demonstrates occurrence of chromosome restructuring when diver individuals hybridize, identifying centrom-based mechanism for instability. This phenomenon depends on chimer CEN3, but similar effect observed when haploid strain expresses CEN of close species, indicating effectiveness of natural and artificial variation. Genesis and fate of restructured chromosomes difficult to study in humans, their formation, effects, and transmission in Arabid are experimental, demonstrated by enhancing NHE mutants on haploid. Range of phenotypes, formation copy variants of chimer genes junctions, and occasional meiotic transmission suggest catastrophic restructuring contribute heritable variation.

    Title: Epstein-Barr virus ensures B cell survival by uniquely modulating apoptosis at early and late times after infection
    Abstract: Latent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection is causally linked to several human cancers. EBV expresses viral oncogenes that promote cell growth and inhibit the apoptotic response to uncontrolled proliferation. The EBV oncoprotein LMP1 constitutively activates NFκB and is critical for survival of EBV-immortalized B cells. However, during early infection EBV induces rapid B cell proliferation with low levels of LMP1 and little apoptosis. Therefore, we sought to define the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP1/NFκB early after infection. We used BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis and defined a transition from uninfected B cells ( BCL-2 ) to early-infected ( MCL-1/BCL-2 ) and immortalized cells ( BFL-1 ). This dynamic change in B cell survival mechanisms is unique to virus-infected cells and relies on regulation of MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription by the viral EBNA3A protein. This study defines a new role for EBNA3A in the suppression of apoptosis with implications for EBV lymphomagenesis.

    Supporting Text:
   . The importance of EBNA3A in B cell transformation and survival was previously recognized, but our studies now define the molecular basis for the inhibition of apoptosis. While both EBNA3A and EBNA3C suppress the pro-apoptotic protein Bim ( Paschos et al., 2009 ), only EBNA3A was required to mitigate resistance to a BCL2 antagonist through outgrowth. EBNA3A regulated the BH3 profile of EBV-infected cells and suppressed apoptosis by promoting MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and increasing BFL-1 mRNA transcription. Transcription of BFL-1 was previously shown to be regulated by the EBV transcription factor EBNA2 ( Pegman et al., 2006 ) as well as LMP1-induced NFκB ( Pratt et al., 2012 ). Our work now indicates that EBNA3A coordinates a chromatin architecture through an EBV super enhancer that facilitates NFκB-mediated activation of BFL-1 transcription. Therefore, our studies highlight a new cooperative role among EBNA3A, EBNA2, and LMP1 in transcriptional activation important for EBV-immortalized cell survival. The importance of MCL-1 in early EBV-infected human B cells coupled with the critical role of MCL-1 in germinal center ( GC ) formation and memory B cell survival in the mouse ( Vikstrom et al., 2010 ) is consistent with the GC model of EBV infection. The GC model posits that EBV infection of naïve B cells promotes B cell maturation mimicking the GC reaction to access the long-lived memory B cell compartment and thus persisting for the lifetime of the host ( Burns et al., 2015; Roughan and Thorley-Lawson, 2009 ). Our data support this model in that early infection of B cells by EBV promotes MCL-1 as a critical apoptotic regulator similar that observed for GC B cells in the mouse ( Vikstrom et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, MCL-1 copy number gains and mutations are often found in B cell lymphomas ( Wenzel et al., 2013 )

Suppression of apoptosis by EBV is essential for establishment of latent infection in the immune-competent host and promotes tumorigenesis in the immune suppressed host. While EBV encodes two putative BCL-2 homologues, these proteins are not required for survival after the first 24 hr following B cell infection ( Altmann and Hammerschmidt, 2005 ). Rather, constitutive NFκB signaling from the viral oncoprotein LMP1, a TNFR homologue, is thought to be responsible for apoptotic suppression in latently infected, proliferating cells ( Cahir-McFarland et al., 2000; Pratt et al., 2012 ). However, the initial burst of B cell proliferation induced by EBV is driven by expression of the viral EBNA transcription factors ( EBNA1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, and LP ) in the absence of appreciable LMP1 or NFκB activity ( Price et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, this early period of hyper-proliferation activates a growth-suppressive DNA damage response, which would be expected to promote apoptosis ( Nikitin et al., 2010 ). We, therefore, sought to identify the mechanism of survival during early infection by using BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial control of apoptosis prior to and through latent EBV infection and outgrowth of primary human B cells into LCLs. While BH3 profiling has been previously performed on virus-infected cells ( Cojohari et al., 2015 ), this study focused on HCMV and was limited to a single EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cell line, Akata, which expresses only the viral EBNA1 protein. In our BH3 profiling study, we found that mature human peripheral blood B cells depend solely on BCL-2 for survival while EBV latent infection further suppressed apoptotic priming during outgrowth by initially upregulating MCL-1, followed by BFL-1. Mechanistically, we identified a new and unique role for the viral latent protein EBNA3A in apoptosis resistance during both early and late EBV-induced B cell proliferation

., 1993; Zimber-Strobl et al., 1996 ). LMP1 mimics a pro-survival TNF receptor that signals constitutively through the NFκB pathway to promote proliferation and suppress apoptosis in transformed cells ( Cahir-McFarland et al., 2000; Okan et al., 1995; Pratt et al., 2012 ). In fact, inhibition of the NFκB pathway activated downstream of LMP1 leads to apoptosis in LCLs. However, recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated that, early after infection, B cells rapidly proliferate despite low levels of LMP1 expression and NFκB activation ( Nikitin et al., 2010; Price et al., 2012 ). Surprisingly, these early-infected cells also show no overt signs of apoptosis despite strong activation of the cellular DNA damage response ( Nikitin et al., 2014 ). This suggests that in early-infected cells, there is a viral-mediated mechanism independent of LMP1 signaling that promotes survival. Several LMP1-independent mechanisms to subvert apoptosis have been described. For example, the viral BCL-2 homologue BHRF1 confers chemoresistance in a mouse model of Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) ( Kvansakul et al., 2010 ). Similarly, the viral BHRF1 and BALF1 proteins exert non-redundant roles in protecting initially infected cells from apoptosis ( Altmann and Hammerschmidt, 2005 ). In addition, expression of the EBNA3 proteins induces resistance to apoptosis in BL cells and primary B cells by downregulating Bim expression ( Paschos et al., 2009; Skalska et al., 2013 ), thereby making infected cells less ‘primed’ for apoptosis. The EBNA3 family is also known to epigenetically downregulate additional human genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis ( Allday, 2013; Harth-Hertle et al., 2013; Hertle et al., 2009; Paschos et al., 2012; Skalska et al., 2013 )

., 2013 ). Therefore, the mechanism by which EBNA3A enhances MCL-1 function at the mitochondria may provide broad insight into apoptotic regulation during B-cell maturation and lymphomagenesis. The early phase of EBV infection where EBNAs are expressed with little or no expression of LMPs is known as latency IIb ( Price and Luftig, 2015 ). The latency IIb expression pattern has also been observed by immuno-histochemical analysis in EBV-positive HIV-associated lymphomas, post-transplant lymphomas, in acute infectious mononucleosis, and in tumors of humanized mouse models of EBV infection ( Price and Luftig, 2015 ). Indeed, a recent study found that an EBV recombinant lacking LMP1 was capable of forming B cell tumors in a humanized mouse model ( Ma et al., 2015 ). The survival of these cells as well as those in other latency IIb expressing tissues likely depends on EBNA3A and MCL-1, while latency III cells expressing LMP proteins and high level NFκB signaling are likely to be less primed and to rely on BFL-1. As BH3 profiling has been a powerful predictive tool for chemotherapeutic responses in leukemias ( Montero et al., 2015 ), our new findings suggest that such an approach could allow for better treatment decisions for EBV-associated malignancies.

., 2012; Skalska et al., 2013 ). It has been shown that the EBNA3 proteins mediate these epigenetic changes by binding to chromatin and recruiting histone-modifying enzymes ( Har-Hert et al. 2013; Hle et al. 2009; Pas et al. 2012; Skka et al. 2013 ). EBNA3 has been shown to epigenetically downregulate the pro-apoptotic protein Bim ( Pas et al. 2009; Skka et al 2013 ) and upregulate the anti-apoptotic MCL-1 (this study ). The EBNA proteins also epigenetically regulate other genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis ( Alay 2013; Har-Hert et al 2013; Hle et 2009 Pas et 201; Skka 201 ).

    Title: Genetic variation, environment and demography intersect to shape Arabidopsis defense metabolite variation across Europe
    Abstract: Plants produce diverse metabolites to cope with the challenges presented by complex and ever-changing environments. These challenges drive the diversification of specialized metabolites within and between plant species. However, we are just beginning to understand how frequently new alleles arise controlling specialized metabolite diversity and how the geographic distribution of these alleles may be structured by ecological and demographic pressures. Here, we measure the variation in specialized metabolites across a population of 797 natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. We show that a combination of geography, environmental parameters, demography and different genetic processes all combine to influence the specific chemotypes and their distribution. This showed that causal loci in specialized metabolism contain frequent independently generated alleles with patterns suggesting potential within-species convergence. This provides a new perspective about the complexity of the selective forces and mechanisms that shape the generation and distribution of allelic variation that may influence local adaptation.

    Supporting Text:
   . In parallel evolution, the lineages begin from the same state and in parallel evolve to the same new state, while in convergent evolution the lineages start at different states and independently converge on the same new state ( Figure 1 ). In this context, we are focusing the analogy on the fact that the two processes differ where they begin, same or different state. This raises the possibility for chemical variation within a species to exhibit parallel evolution, wherein independent new haplotypes with identical metabolic consequences arise multiple times from single-core haplotype. Equally it may be possible to find within-species convergent evolution, where genotypes with the same metabolic profile actually contain completely different haplotypes that themselves arose from distinct haplotypic lineages. These genetic processes and interplay between genetics and selection overlap with neutral demographic processes like gene flow. Thus, it is necessary to understand how the intersection of environmental pressure, demography and genomic complexity gives rise to the pattern of metabolic variation across a plant species. To better understand how genomic variation, demography and environmental pressure shape the variation of specialized metabolism within a species, we used the Arabidopsis glucosinolate ( GSL ) pathway as a model. GSLs are a diverse class of specialized metabolites that display extensive variation across the order Brassicales, which includes the model plant Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) ( Bakker et al., 2008; Benderoth et al., 2006; Brachi et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2010; Daxenbichler et al., 1991; Halkier and Gershenzon, 2006; Kerwin et al., 2015; Kliebenstein et al., 2001a; Kliebenstein et al., 2001b; Kliebenstein et al., 2001c; Rodman et al., 1981; Rodman, 1980; Sønderby et al., 2010; Wright et al., 2002 )

., 2001b; Petersen et al., 2002 ). Thus, in most cases the chemotype of the seeds is the same as the leaves. The seeds have the highest level of GSLs in Arabidopsis and are stable at room temperature until germination, which makes the seeds a perfect tissue to survey variation. Further, GSLs are known to be important for seed defenses against herbivores and pathogens ( Raybould and Moyes, 2001 ). By combining GSL seed measurements with prior whole-genome sequencing in a European collection of accessions, we show that all three major causal loci controlling GSL metabolic diversity contain multiple independently derived alleles that recreate the same phenotypes using a combination of single nucleotide polimorphism ( SNPs ) and structural variation. Using these causal genotypes and chemotypes in combination with their geographic distribution provided evidence that the distribution of GSL metabolic diversity across Europe is influenced by a combination of demography and ecological factors. The ecological relationships to chemotype suggested a potential for variation in selective processes across the geographic regions studied. Future work will be needed to identify the specific biotic and/or abiotic factors shaping this distribution.

. A common finding of these studies is that the metabolic variation within and between species is the result of structural variation at the enzymes responsible for the chemical structures, or variation at the expression levels of these enzymes, which contributes to the quantitative variation in specialized metabolism ( Chan et al., 2011; Chan et al., 2010; Fan et al., 2019; Kroymann et al., 2003; Moore et al., 2019; Schilmiller et al., 2012 ). These structural and regulatory variants and the resulting chemical variation strongly influence plant fitness in response to a broad range of biotic interactions including herbivores and other plant species ( Bednarek and Osbourn, 2009; Brachi et al., 2015; Kerwin et al., 2017; Kerwin et al., 2015; Lankau and Kliebenstein, 2009; Lankau and Strauss, 2007; Lankau, 2007 ). The potential for these genetic variants influencing plant chemical variation is derived from the enhanced proportion of gene duplication in enzyme encoding genes for specialized metabolism, both at the local and whole genome level ( Kliebenstein et al., 2001c; Moghe and Last, 2015 ). Many mechanistic studies of natural variation in specialized metabolism have focused on biallelic phenotypic variation linked to loss-of-function variants. However, it is not clear if biallelic phenotypic variation is created by biallelic genetic causation when investigating a large collection of individuals from wide-ranging populations within a species. If selective pressures are sufficiently non-linear, it is possible to have repeated and independent generation of structural variants creating the same metabolic variation in processes that are akin to parallel and convergent evolution are used to describe interspecific variation. Specifically, parallel and convergent evolution describe independent evolution of the same trait that differs depending on the beginning state of the organisms

Continuous and dynamic change in a plant’s habitat/environment creates a complex system to which a plant must adapt. Central to this adaptation are the production and accumulation of different metabolites ranging from signaling hormones, primary metabolites to a wide array of multi-functional specialized metabolites ( Erb and Kliebenstein, 2020; Hanower and Brzozowska, 1975; Hayat et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2012; Kliebenstein, 2004; Malcolm, 1994; Thakur and Rai, 1982; Wolters and Jürgens, 2009; Yang et al., 2000 ). The complete blend, chemotype, of these metabolites helps to determine the plants’ survival and development, but the creation of any blend is complicated by the fact that individual specialized metabolites can have contrasting effects on the plant. For example, individual specialized metabolites can defend the plant against some stressors while simultaneously making the plant more sensitive to other biotic or abiotic stresses ( Agrawal, 2000; Bialy et al., 1990; Erb and Kliebenstein, 2020; Futuyma and Agrawal, 2009; Hu et al., 2018; Lankau, 2007; Opitz and Müller, 2009; Uremıs et al., 2009; Züst and Agrawal, 2017 ). These opposing effects create offsetting ecological benefits and costs for individual metabolites. Integrating these offsetting effects across dynamic environments involves multiple selective pressures that might contribute to shaping the genetic and metabolic variation within a species ( Fan et al., 2019; Kerwin et al., 2015; Malcolm, 1994; Sønderby et al., 2010; Szakiel et al., 2011; Wentzell and Kliebenstein, 2008; Züst et al., 2012 ). Significant advances have been made in recent decades to identify genetic sources contributing to metabolic variation

., 2010; Wright et al., 2002 ). GSLs consist of a common core structure with a diverse side chain that determines biological activity in defense, growth, development and abiotic stress resistance ( Beekwilder et al., 2008; Hansen et al., 2008; Hasegawa et al., 2000; Katz et al., 2020; Katz et al., 2015; Malinovsky et al., 2017; Salehin et al., 2019; Yamada et al., 2003 ). The Arabidopsis-GSL system is an optimal model to study the species-wide processes driving specialized metabolite variation because the identity of the whole biosynthetic pathway is known, including the major causal loci for natural variation ( Benderoth et al., 2006; Brachi et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2011; Chan et al., 2010; Hansen et al., 2007; Kliebenstein et al., 2001a; Kliebenstein et al., 2002b; Kliebenstein et al. 200c; Rod et al,1981; Rod,198; Søby et al,2010; Wright et al,2002 ),200b; Petersen et al,200 ). The Arabidopsis-GSL pathway is also a good model to study because GSLs are important for seed defense against herbivores and pathogens ( Rayb and Moy,2001 ) and the seeds have the highest level of GSLs in Arabidopsis, which are stable at room temperature until germination, making them a perfect tissue to survey. By combining seed GSL measurements with whole-genome sequencing in European accessions, we show that three major loci controlling GSL diversity contain multiple derived alleles that recreate same phenotypes using SNPs and structural variation. Using causal genotypes and chemotypes in combination with geographic distribution provided evidence that GSL diversity across Europe is influenced by demography and ecological factors. The relationships chemotype suggested potential variation in selective processes across regions. Future work needed to identify biotic and abiotic factors shaping distribution.

    Title: Tumor-promoting function of apoptotic caspases by an amplification loop involving ROS, macrophages and JNK in Drosophila
    Abstract: Apoptosis and its molecular mediators, the caspases, have long been regarded as tumor suppressors and one hallmark of cancer is ‘Evading Apoptosis’. However, recent work has suggested that apoptotic caspases can also promote proliferation and tumor growth under certain conditions. How caspases promote proliferation and how cells are protected from the potentially harmful action of apoptotic caspases is largely unknown. Here, we show that although caspases are activated in a well-studied neoplastic tumor model in Drosophila, oncogenic mutations of the proto-oncogene Ras ( RasV12 ) maintain tumorous cells in an ‘undead’-like condition and transform caspases from tumor suppressors into tumor promotors. Instead of killing cells, caspases now promote the generation of intra- and extracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ). One function of the ROS is the recruitment and activation of macrophage-like immune cells which in turn signal back to tumorous epithelial cells to activate oncogenic JNK signaling. JNK further promotes and amplifies caspase activity, thereby constituting a feedback amplification loop. Interfering with the amplification loop strongly reduces the neoplastic behavior of these cells and significantly improves organismal survival. In conclusion, RasV12-modified caspases initiate a feedback amplification loop involving tumorous epithelial cells and macrophage-like immune cells that is necessary for uncontrolled tumor growth and invasive behavior.

   . These similarities prompted us to investigate the role of ROS and caspases for tumor growth of scrib−/− RasV12 clones in Drosophila. We report that oncogenic Ras switches the pro-apoptotic activity of caspases into a tumor-promoting one and thereby maintains scrib−/− RasV12 cells in an ‘undead’-like state. Consistently, inhibition of caspases blocks tumor growth and tissue invasion. The tumor-promoting function of apoptotic caspases is dependent on the generation of intra- and extracellular ROS which are required for neoplastic behavior of scrib−/− RasV12 clones. Furthermore, caspase-induced ROS are essential for the recruitment and activation of hemocytes at scrib−/− RasV12 mosaic discs. Hemocytes signal back to tumorous epithelial cells to stimulate JNK signaling which further promotes caspase activity. Thus, these events constitute a feedback amplification loop which is necessary for neoplastic activity of scrib−/− RasV12 cells. This work extends previous models about the conversion of Eiger and JNK signaling from anti-tumor to pro-tumor roles by oncogenic Ras and identifies caspases as essential components of this switch. In conclusion, although apoptotic caspases are usually considered to be tumor suppressors, under certain conditions, for example in the presence of oncogenic RasV12 in scrib mutant cells, they can also adopt a tumor-promoting role.

. Similar amplification loops have been described in apoptotic and ‘undead’ cells ( Wells et al., 2006; Shlevkov and Morata, 2012; Fogarty et al., 2016 ). This amplification loop ensures persistent oncogenic signaling in scrib−/− RasV12 cells. This is in striking contrast to scrib−/− mutant cells alone in which JNK signaling triggers linear caspase activation and apoptosis ( Brumby and Richardson, 2003; Igaki et al., 2006; Igaki et al., 2009; Uhlirova et al., 2005 ). In later stages of tumorigenesis, the amplification loop may have reached full strength and promotes malignant growth and invasion of scrib−/− RasV12 cells ( Figure 6 ). Amplification loops have also been observed in other neoplastic tumor models in Drosophila. For example, intestinal stem cell tumors form in response to an amplification loop ( Chen et al., 2016 ). In a glycolytic tumor model, ROS are also part of a amplification loop that facilitates metabolic reprogramming ( Wang et al., 2016 ). Thus, it is possible that tumorigenesis in general depends on amplification loops to sustain oncogenic signaling. There are similarities and differences in the amplification loops of the ‘undead’ hyperplastic AiP model and the neoplastic scrib−/− RasV12 tumor model. In both models, caspases, ROS, hemocytes and JNK are required for growth. However, regarding caspases, the ‘undead’ AiP model only involves the initiator caspase Dronc for growth ( in fact, effector caspases are inhibited by P35 in this model ) ( Fan et al., 2014; Huh et al., 2004; Pérez-Garijo et al., 2004; Pérez-Garijo et al., 2009; Ryoo et al., 2004 ). In contrast, the neoplastic scrib−/− RasV12 model requires both initiator ( Dronc ) and effector ( DrICE ) caspases. Inhibition of either suppresses malignant growth and invasion. Another interesting difference is the differential involvement of ROS

. A known target of survival signaling by RasV12 is the pro-apoptotic gene Hid which acts upstream of caspase activation ( Bergmann et al., 1998; Kurada and White, 1998 ). Because Eiger and JNK can induce expression of hid ( Moreno et al., 2002 ), it is possible that Hid activity is inhibited by oncogenic Ras. However, while we do not exclude this possibility, it alone may not be sufficient to explain the altered caspase activity because inhibition of hid would result in loss of caspase activity. However, caspases are still active in scrib−/− RasV12 mutant cells ( Figure 3B, D ) and they are also able to induce apoptosis at least in a small amount of mutant cells ( Figure 3E, F ). Therefore, it is possible that RasV12 modifies caspase activity in a different manner – directly or indirectly – for non-apoptotic ROS generation. Oncogenic Ras is mediating many steps in the tumorigenic process of scrib−/− RasV12 tissue. It changes the transcriptome of these cells and modifies the downstream activities of JNK ( Atkins et al., 2016; Külshammer et al., 2015 ). However, as shown in this work, a critical step mediated by RasV12 is the modification of caspase activity – directly or indirectly – in the early stage of tumorigenesis in a way that the cells survive. At present it is unclear if the caspase-modulating activity of RasV12 is dependent on transcription. There may not be enough time for a transcriptional response by the cell to escape the apoptotic activity of caspases. Consistently, work by others has suggested that changes in the transcriptome alone does not fully explain the neoplastic phenotype of scrib−/− RasV12 cells and that other potentially non-transcriptional processes are involved ( Atkins et al., 2016 ). Modification of caspase activity may be one of these non-transcriptional processes. Non-apoptotic functions of caspases have been reported ( Shalini et al

. Caspases are Cys-proteases that mediate the mechanistic events of apoptotic cell death ( Shalini et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2009; Fuchs and Steller, 2011; Salvesen et al., 2016 ). They are synthesized as zymogens and depending on the length of their prodomains can be classified into initiator and effector caspases. Initiator caspases such as mammalian Caspase-9 or its Drosophila ortholog Dronc are controlled by upstream signaling events and when activated initiate apoptosis by activating effector caspases such as mammalian Caspase-3 or its Drosophila ortholog DrICE ( Fuchs and Steller, 2011; Shalini et al., 2015; Salvesen et al., 2016 ). Caspases induce apoptosis of many cells to maintain homeostatic conditions, and are also thought to be critical for tumor suppression by eliminating malignant cells. However, caspases can also have tumor-promoting roles, for example through apoptosis-induced proliferation ( AiP ), a caspase-driven process by which apoptotic cells produce mitogenic signals for proliferation of neighboring surviving cells ( Mollereau et al., 2013 ) ( reviewed in [Fogarty and Bergmann, 2017; Ryoo and Bergmann, 2012] ). There are two types of AiP. During ‘genuine’ AiP, apoptotic cells release mitogenic factors before completing the apoptotic program. This type of AiP has been described for regeneration and wound healing both in vertebrates and invertebrates ( Tseng et al., 2007; Fan and Bergmann, 2008; Chera et al., 2011 ). ‘Induced’ Ai occurs when apoptotic cells produce mitogenic signals during the apoptotic process. This type of Ai has been observed in neoplastic tissues in Dophila and vertebrates ( Mollau et al. 2013; Moll et al. 2014; Moll et al 2015; Moll et al 2016; Moll et al 2017; Moll et al 2018; Moll et al 2019; Moll et al 2020; Moll et al 2021; Moll et 202; Moll et 202; Moll et 202; Moll et 202; Moll et 202; Moll 202; Moll et 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202; Moll 202 M

    Title: Perception of social interaction compresses subjective duration in an oxytocin-dependent manner
    Abstract: Communication through body gestures permeates our daily life. Efficient perception of the message therein reflects one’s social cognitive competency. Here we report that such competency is manifested temporally as shortened subjective duration of social interactions: motion sequences showing agents acting communicatively are perceived to be significantly shorter in duration as compared with those acting noncommunicatively. The strength of this effect is negatively correlated with one’s autistic-like tendency. Critically, intranasal oxytocin administration restores the temporal compression effect in socially less proficient individuals, whereas the administration of atosiban, a competitive antagonist of oxytocin, diminishes the effect in socially proficient individuals. These findings indicate that perceived time, rather than being a faithful representation of physical time, is highly idiosyncratic and ingrained with one’s personality trait. Moreover, they suggest that oxytocin is involved in mediating time perception of social interaction, further supporting the role of oxytocin in human social cognition.

    As one of many social species, humans seek out companionship and social interactions. The current study demonstrates that such a motive is weaved in our mental representation of time: Motion sequences depicting agents engaging in social interactions tend to be perceived as shorter in duration than those showing agents acting noncommunicatively. This temporal compression effect is independent of the basic visual features or the non-biological properties of the agents ( Experiment 1 ), or the spatial-temporal correlations in between ( Experiments 2 and 3 ), and cannot be explained by the inference of causality or the contingency between two entities’ movements ( Supplementary Experiment ). Rather, it relies on the observer’s intrinsic autistic-like tendency, such that socially less proficient individuals are less susceptible to the effect than socially proficient ones ( Experiment 4 ). The mechanism underlying this phenomenon critically involves oxytocin. In socially less proficient individuals that overall have lower levels of endogenous oxytocin ( Andari et al., 2014; Modahl et al., 1998; Parker et al., 2014 ), oxytocin administration promotes the social interaction induced temporal compression effect ( Experiment 5 ). By contrast, in socially proficient individuals with overall higher levels of endogenous oxytocin, the very effect is diminished following the application of an oxytocin antagonist named atosiban ( Experiment 6 ). Whereas distortion of time perception has been widely associated with properties of the stimuli ( Eagleman, 2008 ) and the context ( Shi et al., 2013 ), these findings provide, to our best knowledge, the first empirical evidence that links the subjective time of an event with a personality trait, namely social proficiency. In doing so, they open up a new avenue to probe automatic processing of complex social interplays at the individual level

. 53, p=0. 60 ) ( Figure 3C ). These results, while reaffirming the influence of perceived social interactions on subjective duration, highlighted the idiosyncrasy of subjective time for social interactions, and tied it to a stable personality trait –– social proficiency. Autistic traits have been widely associated with reduced levels of oxytocin ( Clark et al., 2013; Green et al., 2001; Modahl et al., 1998; Parker et al., 2014 ), and can be ameliorated with intranasal oxytocin administration ( Anagnostou et al., 2012; Gordon et al., 2013; Guastella et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2015; Yatawara et al., 2016 ). The link between autistic-like tendency and subjective duration of social interactions thus raises the intriguing question of whether oxytocin plays a role therein. Experiment 5 probed this question by testing if the application of oxytocin would promote the social interaction-induced temporal compression effect in socially less proficient individuals. The same task as in Experiment 4 was employed. Eighty males with AQ scores larger than or equal to 20 ( range: 20–36, same cutoff value as in Experiment 4 ) completed the duration judgment task twice, once before and once 40 min after the nasal administration of either oxytocin ( for 40 observers ) or atosiban ( for the other 40 observers ). Atosiban is a desamino-oxytocin analogue and a competitive oxytocin receptor antagonist ( Sanu and Lamont, 2010 ), and has been shown to be centrally available when administered intranasally ( Lamont and Kam, 2008; Lundin et al., 1986 ). We used it as a comparison treatment and hypothesized that its influence on subjective duration of social interactions, if any, would be in the opposite direction of oxytocin. The results were consistent with our hypotheses. In those treated with oxytocin, the mean PSE significantly increased by 36. 9 ms ( t39 = 3. 68, p=0. 001, Cohen’s d = 0. 58 ), from 13

. It is plausible that communicative motion sequences are processed with increased efficiency in TPJ and dmPFC relative to motion sequences without a recognizable communicative intention, thus leading to lowered metabolic cost ( Gutnisky and Dragoi, 2008; Laughlin, 2001 ) and shortened subjective duration, particularly in socially proficient individuals. Of note here is that this temporal compression effect can hardly be accounted for by the operation of a dedicated neural module specialized for representing the temporal relationships between events ( Ivry and Schlerf, 2008 ), since it is specific to the perception of social interactions. Oxytocin partially drives social motivation ( Dölen et al., 2013 ) and has increasingly been identified as an important modulator of social behaviors ( Carter, 2014; Donaldson and Young, 2008 ) ranging from social recognition ( Oettl et al., 2016 ) to consolation ( Burkett et al., 2016 ) and ethnocentrism ( De Dreu et al., 2011 ). It has also been linked to repetitive behaviors –– a core feature of autism ( Hollander et al., 2003; Insel et al., 1999 ). Results from human brain imaging studies indicate that the application of oxytocin modulates responses in the STS, TPJ and the prefrontal cortex, among others, in various social cognitive tasks ( Zink and Meyer-Lindenberg, 2012 ). Such alterations of neural activities presumably facilitate social processing in socially less proficient individuals, where exogenous oxytocin has been shown to exert a more definitive prosocial effect ( Bartz et al., 2010; Bartz et al., 2011 ), thereby giving rise to their shortened subjective duration of social interactions following oxytocin administration. In socially proficient individuals, the influence of exogenous oxytocin is more complicated, even hard to predict and interpret ( Bartz, 2016; Bartz et al., 2010; Bartz et al., 2011; Olff et al., 2013 )

. Temporally adjacent actions generally tend to be inferred as a causal sequence and hence communicative ( Lagnado and Sloman, 2006 ). But ultimately that social ‘meaning’ is derived from the observer’s interpretations of the agents’ actions and the relationship in between, and is, to a certain degree, subjective in nature. The present study aimed to address the effect of perceived social interaction on subjective time and its relationship with one’s intrinsic social proficiency. In a series of experiments, we carefully manipulated point-light displays of acting agents to dissociate the perception of social interaction and that of biological motion. We assessed temporal perception of such displays in individuals varying in social proficiency, and critically examined the role of oxytocin in this process. Given the aforementioned relationships among social proficiency, oxytocin and neural processing of social stimuli, our hypothesis was that both social proficiency, which reflects endogenous oxytocin level, and exogenous manipulations of oxytocin level would influence the neural efficacy in processing social interactions, and thereby modulate the subjective time of perceived social interactions.

., 2008 ) ; and the perception of biological motion engages a specific network of distributed neural areas, particularly the superior temporal sulcus ( STS ) ( Grossman et al., 2005; Grossman and Blake, 2002; Vaina et al., 2001 ) that plays an important role in social perception in both monkeys and humans ( Allison et al., 2000 ). Meanwhile, inter-individual variation is noteworthy. People with autism characterized by impaired social interaction and communication show both a deficit of biological motion perception ( Blake et al., 2003; Klin et al., 2009 ) and abnormalities in the STS ( Zilbovicius et al., 2006 ). Social proficiency varies widely even among neurotypical individuals, and is manifested behaviorally as a stable personality trait ( Digman, 1990 ). This inter-individual variance has been associated with plasma concentrations of oxytocin, a well-documented prosocial neuropeptide, as well as polymorphisms of its receptor gene OXTR ( Andari et al., 2014; Donaldson and Young, 2008; Modahl et al., 1998; Parker et al,2014 ).

    Title: Effects of common mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD and its ligand, the human ACE2 receptor on binding affinity and kinetics
    Abstract: The interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 virus Spike protein receptor binding domain ( RBD ) and the ACE2 cell surface protein is required for viral infection of cells. Mutations in the RBD are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that have emerged independently worldwide. For example, the B. 1. 1. 7 lineage has a mutation ( N501Y ) in its Spike RBD that enhances binding to ACE2. There are also ACE2 alleles in humans with mutations in the RBD binding site. Here we perform a detailed affinity and kinetics analysis of the effect of five common RBD mutations ( K417N, K417T, N501Y, E484K, and S477N ) and two common ACE2 mutations ( S19P and K26R ) on the RBD/ACE2 interaction. We analysed the effects of individual RBD mutations and combinations found in new SARS-CoV-2 Alpha ( B. 1. 1. 7 ), Beta ( B. 1. 351 ), and Gamma ( P1 ) variants. Most of these mutations increased the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction. The exceptions were mutations K417N/T, which decreased the affinity. Taken together with other studies, our results suggest that the N501Y and S477N mutations enhance transmission primarily by enhancing binding, the K417N/T mutations facilitate immune escape, and the E484K mutation enhances binding and immune escape.

   ., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021 ), such fits were not shown in all studies, one of which reported more than 20-fold slower kinetics than reported here ( Lei et al., 2020; Supasa et al., 2021 ). The RBD mutations that we selected for analysis have all emerged independently and became dominant in a region at least once in different lineages, suggesting that they provide a selective advantage. Our finding that the N501Y, E484K, and S477N all increase the binding affinity of RBD for ACE2 raises the question as to whether this contributed to their selection. Several lines of evidence suggest that enhancing the Spike/ACE2 interaction would be advantageous for the virus. First, the virus has spread only very recently to humans from another mammalian host, providing insufficient time for optimisation of the affinity. Second, epidemiological studies have suggested that the Alpha variant, which has the N501Y mutation, has enhanced transmissibility ( Volz et al., 2021a; Washington et al., 2021 ). Finally, a SARS-CoV-2 variant with the Spike mutation D614G, which increases its activity by stabilising it following furin cleavage ( Zhang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020 ), rapidly became dominant globally after it emerged ( Korber et al., 2020; Volz et al., 2021b ). Taken together, these findings suggest that the WT Spike/ACE2 interaction is limiting for transmission and that mutations that enhance it, including the N501Y, E484K, and S477N mutations, could provide a selective advantage by increasing transmissibility. This raises two questions. First, will other RBD mutations appear in SARS-CoV-2 which further enhance transmission? This seems likely, given that a large number of RBD mutations have been identified that increase the RBD/ACE2 affinity ( Starr et al., 2020; Zahradník et al., 2021 )

., 2021b; Washington et al., 2021 ). One that emerged early in Europe, D614G, and quickly became dominant globally ( Korber et al., 2020 ), increases the density of intact Spike trimer on the virus surface by preventing premature dissociation of S1 from S2 following cleavage ( Zhang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020 ). A later mutation, N501Y, which has appeared in multiple lineages, lies within the RBD, and increases its affinity for ACE2 ( Starr et al., 2020; Supasa et al., 2021 ). These findings suggest that mutations that directly or indirectly enhance Spike binding to ACE2 may increase transmissibility. Prior infection by SARS-CoV-2 and current vaccines induce antibody responses to the Spike protein, and most neutralising antibodies appear to bind to the Spike RBD ( Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021; Greaney et al., 2021a; Rogers et al., 2020 ). Some variants of concern have mutations in their RBD that confer resistance to neutralising antibodies ( Darby and Hiscox, 2021; Dejnirattisai et al., 2021; Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021; Madhi et al., 2021a; Madhi et al., 2021b; Mahase, 2021 ). What is less clear is the precise effect of these mutations on the affinity and kinetics of the binding of RBD to ACE2. Previous studies of the interaction between the Spike RBD and ACE2 have produced a wide range of affinity and kinetic estimates under conditions ( e. g. temperature ) that are not always well defined ( Lei et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Supasa et al., 2021; Wrapp et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020 ). Precise information is needed to assess the extent to which RBD mutations have been selected because they enhance ACE2 binding or facilitate immune evasion. In this study, we undertook a detailed affinity and kinetic analysis of the interaction between Spike RBD and ACE2 at a physiological temperature ( 37°C ), taking care to avoid common pitfalls

The focus of this study was to analyse common and therefore important variants of RBD and ACE2. Henceforth, we will refer to the common ACE2 allele and RBD of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain sequenced in Wuhan as wild type ( WT ). We chose mutations of RBD within the ACE2 binding site that have appeared independently in multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages/clades ( Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 1; Hodcroft, 2021; Rambaut et al., 2020 ), suggesting that they confer a selective advantage, rather than emerged by chance, such as through a founder effect. The N501Y mutation has appeared in the Alpha ( B. 1. 1. 7; 20I/501Y. V1 ), Beta ( B. 1. 351; 20 H/501Y. V2 ), and Gamma ( P. 1; 20 J/501Y. V3 ) variants, which were first identified in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil, respectively. The E484K mutation is present in the Beta and Gamma variants and has appeared independently in many other lineages, including Zeta ( P. 2; 20B/S. 484K ), B. 1. 1. 318, Eta ( B. 1. 525; 20A/S:484 K ), and Iota ( B. 1. 526; 20 C/S. 484K ). E484K has also appeared in VOC-202102–02, a subset of the Alpha variant identified in the UK ( SARS-CoV-2 Variants of concern and variants under investigation - GOV. UK, 2021 ). The S477N mutation became dominant for periods in Australia ( clade 20 F ) and parts of Europe ( 20A. EU2 ) and then appeared in New York in the Iota or B. 1. 526 lineage ( Zhou et al., 2021a ). Mutations of K417 have appeared independently in the Beta and Gamma variants. Interestingly, N501Y, E484K, and S477N were the main mutations that appeared following random RBD mutagenesis and in vitro selection of mutants with enhanced ACE2 binding ( Zahradník et al., 2021 ). We selected for analysis the two most common mutations of ACE2 within the RBD binding site, K26R and S19P ( Figure 1C ). They are present in 0. 4% and 0. 03%, respectively, of all samples in the gnomAD database ( Karczewski et al

. We used this optimised approach to analyse the effect of important common mutations identified in variants of RBD and ACE2. Both mutations of ACE2 ( S19P, K26R ) and most of the mutations of RBD ( N501Y, E484K, and S477N ) enhanced the interaction, with one RBD mutation ( N501Y ) increasing the affinity by ~10-fold. Increased binding was the result of decreases in dissociation rate constants ( N501Y, S477N ) and/or increases in association rate constants ( N501Y, E484K ). Although the K417T mutation decreased the affinity of R/ACE interaction, the effect was smaller than that of the mutations that increased it. The combination of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Alpha ( B.1.1.7 ), Beta ( B.1.351 ) and Gamma ( P ) variants increased the affinity of the R/ACE interaction compared to the WT ( Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). Our results suggest that the N501, E484 and S477 mutations enhance transmission by increasing the affinity of the R/ACE interaction, the K417 mutations facilitate immune escape and the E484 enhance both binding and immune escape.
Researchers have developed a method to map directional genetic interactions in metazoan cells by combining combinatorial RNA interference and single-cell phenotyping. They generated a large interaction map for 21 phenotypic features of Drosophila cells and devised a method that combines interactions on multiple phenotypes to reveal relationships. The network reconstructed sequence of protein activities in mitosis and revealed the Ras pathway interacts with the SW/SNF chromatin-remelling complex, an interaction conserved in human cancer. The study presents a powerful approach for reconstructing regulatory networks and provides a resource for interpreting functional consequences of genetic alterations. The method directly captures epist relationships from multivariate phenotypes after-gen perturbations, often effects that cannot be constructed from single-gene perturb or single phenotypes. The interaction map comprises 136 Doph genes in cellular processes including signalling, chromatin and cycle regulation, and quantitatively scored 21 phenotypes in cells using automated imaging. Gene functions were inferred based on statistical interactions, protein complexes clustered by similarity, and multivariate phenotypes computed directional interactions, revealing logical and temporal dependencies between modules. The temporal order of protein complexes during mitosis was reconstructed, and an epist relationship between Ras/MK signalling and SW/S regulators chrom remodelling was confirmed in vivo. The approach can be extended to detect mixed relationships and combined with Bayesian modelling to improve inference networks. Recurrently mutated genes in cancer were predicted to modify each other's phenotypes.

    Title: Presence versus absence of CYP734A50 underlies the style-length dimorphism in primroses
    Abstract: Heterostyly is a wide-spread floral adaptation to promote outbreeding, yet its genetic basis and evolutionary origin remain poorly understood. In Primula ( primroses ), heterostyly is controlled by the S-locus supergene that determines the reciprocal arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between the two morphs. However, the identities of the component genes remain unknown. Here, we identify the Primula CYP734A50 gene, encoding a putative brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme, as the G locus that determines the style-length dimorphism. CYP734A50 is only present on the short-styled S-morph haplotype, it is specifically expressed in S-morph styles, and its loss or inactivation leads to long styles. The gene arose by a duplication specific to the Primulaceae lineage and shows an accelerated rate of molecular evolution. Thus, our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the Primula style-length dimorphism and begin to shed light on the evolution of the S-locus as a prime model for a complex plant supergene.

    Heterostyly is a prominent, wide-spread adaptation to promote outbreeding ( Barrett, 2002, 1992 ). Individuals of heterostylous species belong to two or three morphs with reciprocal reproductive-organ arrangement and intra-morph incompatibility ( Barrett, 2002 ). Since Darwin’s seminal book on The different forms of flowers on plants of the same species ( Darwin, 1877 ), Primula ( primroses ) has been the prime model for studying heterostyly ( Barrett, 1992; Gilmartin, 2015; Weller, 2009 ). Heterostyly in Primula is controlled by the S-locus supergene that likely comprises five tightly linked genes, determining style length ( the so-called G locus ), anther height, pollen size and male and female intra-morph incompatibility ( Figure 1A; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) ( Ernst, 1936; Lewis and Jones, 1992 ). The S-morph haplotype carries dominant alleles at all loci, resulting in short styles due to reduced cell elongation ( Webster and Gilmartin, 2006 ) and anthers at the mouth of the flower; the L-morph haplotype carries the recessive alleles, causing long styles and low anthers. S-morphs are heterozygous for the two haplotypes, and L-morphs homozygous recessive; the absence of homozygotes for the S-morph haplotype likely results from a recessive lethal mutation on this haplotype ( Kurian and Richards, 1997 ). Efficient fertilization is only possible in inter-morph crosses. A candidate for a causal distyly gene has been described from Fagopyrum ( Yasui et al., 2012 ) ; also, S-locus linked sequences have been identified from Primula and Turnera ( Labonne and Shore, 2011; Labonne et al., 2009; Li et al., 2007, 2015; Nowak et al., 2015 ). However, in Primula no causal distyly gene has been isolated, and no plausible mechanistic explanation for style length dimorphism is available in any species, hampering progress in understanding the evolution of the S-locus supergene. 10. 7554/eLife. 17956. 003Figure 1

. First, loss of CYP734A50 activity should lengthen styles; second, S-morph styles should contain lower amounts of active brassinosteroids than L-morph styles; third, cell expansion of S-morph styles should be rescued by brassinosteroid treatment. We assayed the CYP734A50 genotype in seven derived long homostyles with independent evolutionary origins ( Mast et al., 2006 ). Classic models predict that long homostyles originate via recombination in the S locus affecting both the G and the linked female-compatibility locus, hence they are self-compatible ( Barrett, 1992; Lewis and Jones, 1992 ) ; by contrast, in self-incompatible long homostyles only the G locus should be affected by mutation or recombination ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). Indeed, in Primula sect. Aleuritia ( Mast et al., 2001; Richards, 2003 ), CYP734A50 was present in all tested S-, but none of the L-morphs of the heterostylous P. frondosa ( n = 5 each ) and P. farinosa ( n = 5 each ), and in none of the long-homostylous P. scotica ( n = 8 ) and P. halleri ( n = 9 ) ( Figure 2F; Figure 2—figure supplement 2; Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ). Similarly in Primula sect. Primula, CYP734A50 was present in all S-, but none of the L-morphs of the heterostylous P. elatior ( n = 15 each ) and P. juliae ( n = 2 each ), nor in the homostylous P. grandis ( n = 11 ) ( Figure 2E; Figure 2—figure supplement 2; Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ). Our P. forbesii population included self-compatible long homostyles; as expected, none of these ( n = 6 ) contained the CYP734A50 locus ( Figure 2C; Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). Natural P. vulgaris populations including long-homostyles occur in two regions in southern England ( Crosby, 1940, 1949 ) ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ). Unexpectedly, the CYP734A50 locus was present in all tested long homostyles and in the S-morphs, but in none of the L-morphs from both regions ( Figure 2B )

. Together with the VIGS results, this strongly supports the conclusion that CYP734A50 is the G locus of the Primula heterostyly supergene that determines the style-length polymorphism. 10. 7554/eLife. 17956. 016Figure 3.

    Title: High-frequency stimulation-induced peptide release synchronizes arcuate kisspeptin neurons and excites GnRH neurons
    Abstract: Kisspeptin ( Kiss1 ) and neurokinin B ( NKB ) neurocircuits are essential for pubertal development and fertility. Kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus ( Kiss1ARH ) co-express Kiss1, NKB, dynorphin and glutamate and are postulated to provide an episodic, excitatory drive to gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 ( GnRH ) neurons, the synaptic mechanisms of which are unknown. We characterized the cellular basis for synchronized Kiss1ARH neuronal activity using optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, molecular pharmacology and single cell RT-PCR in mice. High-frequency photostimulation of Kiss1ARH neurons evoked local release of excitatory ( NKB ) and inhibitory ( dynorphin ) neuropeptides, which were found to synchronize the Kiss1ARH neuronal firing. The light-evoked synchronous activity caused robust excitation of GnRH neurons by a synaptic mechanism that also involved glutamatergic input to preoptic Kiss1 neurons from Kiss1ARH neurons. We propose that Kiss1ARH neurons play a dual role of driving episodic secretion of GnRH through the differential release of peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function.

   . 10. 7554/eLife. 16246. 014Figure 12. Proposed model by which activation of Kiss1 neurons governs GnRH neuronal excitability. High-frequency photostimulation of Kiss1 neurons in the ARH releases NKB that depolarizes and recruits other Kiss1ARH neurons. Dynorphin is co-released and acts presynaptically to modulate ( inhibit ) the release of NKB. Together the two peptides govern the synchronous activity of Kiss1ARH neurons and promote kisspeptin release that stimulates GnRH release in the median eminence ( ME ). Kiss1ARH neurons also communicate with the Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons via the fast neurotransmitter glutamate, which stimulates burst-firing of Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons. Activation of these rostral Kiss1 neurons releases kisspeptin to robustly excite GnRH neurons via activation of the GPR54 signaling cascade, thereby stimulating the release of GnRH at the time of the preovulatory surge. Kisspeptin, GPR54, NKB, Tacr3 and GnRH are all required for normal fertility. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 16246. 014

. Senktide induced robust firing in GnRH neurons in horizontal slices that included the Kiss1ARH neurons, but not in coronal slices excluding these neurons. These physiological findings support previous neuroanatomical tract tracing/immunocytochemical studies in mice showing that Kiss1ARH neurons project to AVPV/PeN ( Kiss1 ) neurons but not to GnRH somata in the preoptic area ( Yip et al., 2015 ). In addition, photoactivation of Kiss1ARH neurons excited Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons via glutamate, which we have shown generates burst firing in these neurons ( Zhang et al., 2013 ), and transsynaptically depolarized and excited GnRH neurons via kisspeptin activation of GPR54 and the opening of TRPC channels in a horizontal slice preparation that preserved all of the interconnections. These results are summarized in Figure 12. Therefore, our findings provide the first evidence that Kiss1ARH neurons can synchronize via NKB/Dyn auto-excitation/inhibition to provide an excitatory drive ( via Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons ) to GnRH neurons for stimulating GnRH neuronal activity and subsequent GnRH release. This does not preclude the fact that Kiss1ARH neurons also project to the median eminence ( True et al., 2010 ) and may stimulate pulsatile release of GnRH in the ovariectomized state ( Yip et al., 2015 ). Hence, Kiss1ARH neurons probably play a dual role of driving pulsatile ( episodic ) secretion of GnRH through kisspeptin release into the external zone of the median eminence, but also excite Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons via glutamate release to help generate the preovulatory surge of GnRH through a robust di-synaptic pathway ( Figure 12 ). What is intriguing is the possibility that the differential release of amino acid and peptide neurotransmitters ( segregated co-transmission ) ( Vaaga et al., 2014 ) occurs at these different release sites ( ARH, median eminence, and AVPV/PeN ) to coordinate reproductive function. 10. 7554/eLife. 16246. 014Figure 12

. The combination of synchronization and unified excitation of Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons resulted in robust excitation of GnRH neurons.

. Importantly, there were no fast EPSCs detected in GnRH neurons with photostimulation of Kiss1ARH ChR2- expressing neurons ( Figure 9H ). Given that Tacr3 is essentially not expressed in GnRH or in Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons, and Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons do not respond to kisspeptin ( Navarro et al., 2015; Ducret et al., 2010 ), the question became how does activation of Kiss1ARH neurons excite GnRH neurons? A recent study has shown that mouse Kiss1ARH neurons project to Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons ( Yip et al., 2015 ). Indeed, we recorded light-evoked EPSCs in Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons ( 33. 2 ± 9. 7 pA, n = 5 ) following photostimulation of fibers from ChR2-mCherry or from ChR2-YFP expressing Kiss1ARH neurons ( Figure 10A–D ). The fast EPSC was blocked with CNQX ( 10 μM ) and D-AP5 ( 50 μM ), documenting a glutamatergic input from Kiss1ARH neurons to Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons ( Figure 10D ). Furthermore, we bilaterally injected ChR2:mCherry-expressing viral vector into the AVPV/PeN of Kiss1-Cre::GnRH-EGFP female mice. The anterograde transport revealed close contacts with GnRH cell bodies in the mPOA ( Figure 11A, B1–3 ). Viral-labeled Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons also revealed projections caudally to the ARH ( Figure 11B4 ). High-frequency photostimulation of the Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons evoked a slow EPSP in GnRH neurons in both parahorizontal ( 8. 0 ± 2. 9 mV, n = 4 ) ( Figure 11C–E ) and coronal slices ( 15. 6 ± 4. 8 mV, n = 4 ) ( Figure 11F–H ). The slow EPSP was mediated by the kisspeptin release from Kiss1AVPV/PeNneurons based on the double rectifying, dual reversal potential I/V ( Figure 11E ) ( Zhang et al., 2008 ) and occlusion of the response by the partial agonist peptide 234 ( Liu et al., 2011 ), which blocked the evoked kisspeptin response by 85% ( from 15. 6 ± 4. 8 mV to 2. 4 ± 0. 9 mV, n = 4 ) in coronal slices ( Figure 11H ). Finally, we harvested Kiss1 AVPV/PeN neurons and measured Slc17a6 ( vGluT2 ) mRNA expression using scRT-PCR

. Schöne et al. ( 2014 ) evoked a slow EPSC in tuberomammillary histamine neurons following high-frequency ( ≥20 Hz ) photostimulation of ChR2-expressing orexin neurons that was abrogated by a selective orexin receptor two antagonist. Therefore, in both kisspeptin and histamine neurons there is glutamate-dependent ( low-frequency ) and peptide-dependent ( high-frequency ) release that transmit distinct postsynaptic excitatory effects; but in the case of Kiss1ARH neurons, it is a recurrent auto-excitation that allows recruitment of neighboring Kiss1ARH neurons for synchronizing firing. Also unique to Kiss1ARH neurons is that high-frequency stimulation co-released dynorphin, which modulated the NKB-Tacr3 response. Dynorphin is co-localized in the vast majority of Kiss1ARH neurons ( Navarro et al., 2009; Lehman et al., 2010a ), and loose-cell attached recordings have shown that dynorphin and κ-opioid receptor agonist U69, 593 inhibit the activity of spontaneously firing Kiss1ARH neurons, although it has not been established whether this was a postsynaptic or presynaptic action on excitatory input to Kiss1ARH neurons ( de Cro et al. 2010 ). We found that high-frequency photostimulation of KissAR neurons evoked release of dynorph that acted presynaptically to inhibit the release of NKB ( Figure 7 ). The dynorph release was blocked by the κ-opioid receptor antagonist norbinaltorphine ( 10μM ) but not the μ-opioid antagonist naloxone ( 10μM ) indicating a κ-opi receptor mediated action. The dynorph inhibition of NKB release was blocked by the κ-opi receptor antagonist norinalphine ( 10M ) but not the μ-opi antagonist naloxone (10M ) indicating a κ-op receptor mediated action. The dynorph inhibition of N release was blocked by the κ-op receptor antagonist norinalph (10M but the μ antagonist nalox (10M ) indicating κ receptor action. The dynorph inhibition of N release was blocked by the κ antagonist norph (10 but the μ nalox (10 ) indicating κ action. The dynorph inhibition of N was blocked by the antagonist norph ( but the nalox ( indicating κ action. The dyn inhibition of N was blocked by norph but nalox indicating κ. The inhibition was blocked by nor but nal κ. The was blocked by nor nal κ. was blocked by nor.

    Title: Bone morphogenic protein signalling suppresses differentiation of pluripotent cells by maintaining expression of E-Cadherin
    Abstract: Bone morphogenic protein ( BMP ) signalling contributes towards maintenance of pluripotency and favours mesodermal over neural fates upon differentiation, but the mechanisms by which BMP controls differentiation are not well understood. We report that BMP regulates differentiation by blocking downregulation of Cdh1, an event that accompanies the earliest stages of neural and mesodermal differentiation. We find that loss of Cdh1 is a limiting requirement for differentiation of pluripotent cells, and that experimental suppression of Cdh1 activity rescues the BMP-imposed block to differentiation. We further show that BMP acts prior to and independently of Cdh1 to prime pluripotent cells for mesoderm differentiation, thus helping to reinforce the block to neural differentiation. We conclude that differentiation depends not only on exposure to appropriate extrinsic cues but also on morphogenetic events that control receptivity to those differentiation cues, and we explain how a key pluripotency signal, BMP, feeds into this control mechanism.

    Supporting Text:
    The events that drive the transition from pluripotency to lineage commitment remain poorly understood. It has been known for many years that BMP signalling protects pluripotency and suppresses neural specification ( Ying et al., 2003a; Stern, 2006; Di-Gregorio et al., 2007 ), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. BMP signalling is also required for the formation of mesoderm in vivo ( Mishina et al., 1995; Winnier et al., 1995; Lawson et al., 1999; Beppu et al., 2000; Davis et al., 2004 ), and BMP is commonly used to induce mesoderm from embryonic stem ( ES ) cells ( Murry and Keller, 2008 ). However, it is not clear how the effects of BMP on mesoderm differentiation relate to its pro-pluripotency and anti-neural effects: are these separable independent events or do they represent the outcomes of one common mechanism? This question underlines our poor understanding of the mechanisms by which BMP influences neural and mesodermal specification. BMP acts through transcriptional upregulation of Inhibitor of Differentiation ( Id ) factors ( Ying et al., 2003a; Zhang et al., 2010 ) in order to prevent neural differentiation. Id factors generally act as dominant negative inhibitors of the bHLH family of transcription factors ( Norton, 2000 ), but the mechanism by which Id proteins block neural induction is not known. Furthermore, it is not clear to what extent the pro-mesoderm effect of BMP within the epiblast is mediated by Id or by other BMP target genes: redundancy between the four Id family members may mask gastrulation phenotypes in Id mutants. We set out to examine more closely the effects of BMP and Id1 on neural and mesoderm differentiation by taking advantage of an ES cell differentiation system, which allows differentiation to be carefully monitored in a well-defined environment ( Ying and Smith, 2003 ), and by using a reporter strategy to ask which cells usually express Id1 during early development

., 2012 ). We conclude that the direct BMP target gene Id1 is expressed in a subpopulation of Nanog+ epiblast cells prior to overt mesoderm differentiation, in addition to its previously described expression in migrating mesoderm ( Jen et al., 1997 ). We next asked what events are regulated by BMP/Id1 during differentiation of pluripotent cells ( Figure 2A ). We examined the effect of BMP4 on cells cultured in serum-free conditions in the absence of any other exogenous growth factors. This system allows us to monitor the kinetics as well as the direction of differentiation. 10. 7554/eLife. 01197. 005Figure 2. BMP signalling maintains Cdh1 expression during differentiation of pluripotent cells. ( A ) BMP blocks neural differentiation, maintains pluripotency and has both positive and negative effects on mesoderm differentiation, but the mechanisms by which BMP acts in each case are not well understood.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01197. 005 We used Sox1-GFP reporter ES cells ( Ying et al

., 2009 ). Our work also has implications for controlling uniform differentiation of mouse ES cells. It has been known for some time that a subpopulation of ES cells tends to resist neural differentiation, but the reasons for this are not clear. We propose that this subpopulation of cells fail to respond appropriately to a neural-inducing environment because they are unable to downregulate Cdh1. We demonstrate this directly by showing that experimental suppression of Cdh1 activity can rescue neural differentiation capacity in this recalcitrant subpopulation resulting in a more homogenous differentiation response. Importantly, this can be achieved by non-genetic means, such as function-blocking E-Cadherin antibodies, providing a convenient and readily applicable means to improve our control over pluripotent cells. In summary, we have identified the loss of Cdh1 activity as a limiting event for the earliest stages of neural differentiation and we propose that BMP controls differentiation in part by maintaining Cdh1 expression. The strategy of coupling changes in cell adhesion to transcriptional control of cell fate specification is used several times during development as a way of coordinating tissue morphogenesis ( Owens et al., 2000; Martínez-Estrada et al., 2010; Watt and Fujiwara, 2011 ), and it will be interesting to investigate the implications of our findings for germ-layer formation in the early embryo.

. We find an unanticipated ability of BMP/Id to block differentiation by maintaining the expression of the cell adhesion molecule E-Cadherin ( Cdh1 ). We find that loss of Cdh1 is tightly associated with neural as well as mesodermal differentiation and that this change in Cdh1 is a limiting requirement for neural differentiation. A number of recent reports ( Chou et al., 2008; Soncin et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010; Redmer et al., 2011; del Valle et al., 2013; Faunes et al., 2013 ) suggest that Cdh1 helps protect pluripotency. Despite this emerging appreciation of Cdh1 as a regulator of the pluripotent state, the upstream regulators of Cdh1 in pluripotent cells have not been reported. BMP favours mesenchymal to epithelial transitions in other contexts ( Kondo et al., 2004; Samavarchi-Tehrani et al., 2010 ), but its ability to control Cdh1 activity during early fate specification has not previously been appreciated. We also find that BMP acts through Id1 to impose a proximal posterior identity on epiblast cells, priming them for mesodermal fates whilst transiently restraining them from overt mesoderm differentiation. Id1 may therefore play an early role in anterior-posterior ( AP ) patterning and mesoderm priming, independent from any effect on overt mesoderm differentiation. This helps to reconcile why BMP is required both for mesoderm differentiation and for the maintenance of pluripotency. Taken together, our data help to unify the distinct effects of BMP signalling during differentiation of pluripotent cells. BMP maintains high levels of Cdh1, which help to protect the pluripotent state, whilst imposing a posterior identity that ultimately favours mesodermal over neural differentiation.

. Id1-overexpressing cells eventually differentiate predominantly into mesoderm rather than neurectoderm or endoderm, even under neural differentiation conditions ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ). In this regard, exogenous Id1 does not recapitulate the effect of exogenous BMP4 described in Figure 2. The ability of Id1-overexpressing cells to generate mesoderm at later time points under these conditions may reflect the progressive downregulation of the Id1 transgene ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ), or it may reflect an Id1-independent effect of BMP4 on the later stages of differentiation. Taken together, these data suggest that the BMP target gene Id1 does not drive overt mesoderm differentiation but rather maintains Cdh1 and helps to maintain a primed pluripotent state similar to that of the post-implantation epiblast, whilst imposing a proximal posterior ( T+ Nanog+ ) identity that favours mesermal over neural differentiation.

    Title: A novel Cep120-dependent mechanism inhibits centriole maturation in quiescent cells
    Abstract: The two centrioles of the centrosome in quiescent cells are inherently asymmetric structures that differ in age, morphology and function. How these asymmetric properties are established and maintained during quiescence remains unknown. Here, we show that a daughter centriole-associated ciliopathy protein, Cep120, plays a critical inhibitory role at daughter centrioles. Depletion of Cep120 in quiescent mouse and human cells causes accumulation of pericentriolar material ( PCM ) components including pericentrin, Cdk5Rap2, ninein and Cep170. The elevated PCM levels result in increased microtubule-nucleation activity at the centrosome. Consequently, loss of Cep120 leads to aberrant dynein-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins, dispersal of centriolar satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling. Our results indicate that Cep120 helps to maintain centrosome homeostasis by inhibiting untimely maturation of the daughter centriole, and defines a potentially new molecular defect underlying the pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy and Joubert syndrome.

   ., 2014 ), suggesting that cells may have evolved an alternative pathway by which they can regulate centriole maturation during quiescence, controlled by protein ( s ) that localize to the daughter centriole. Depletion of Cep120 resulted in preferential accumulation of PCM components on the daughter centriole. However some PCM proteins, such as ninein and Cep170, showed higher levels of accumulation on the mother centriole. This indicates that the small pool of Cep120 that remains associated with the mother centriole also contains some inhibitory function, and suggests that the levels of certain PCM proteins on the mother centriole are also ‘fine-tuned’ during quiescence. One intriguing reason for this type of control may be to ensure that the mother centriole ( and the centrosome in general ) assembles a microtubule network that specifically helps target ciliary proteins to the mother centriole ( Figure 7H ). Indeed, we found that the elevated PCM negatively impacts centrosome homeostasis by disrupting the nucleation and organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, potentially causing a ‘traffic jam’ that interrupts dynein-dependent movement of CS complexes. It is well established that the organization, localization and trafficking functions of CS are particularly sensitive to defects in the microtubule cytoskeleton ( Hori and Toda, 2017 ). These changes in turn disrupted ciliary assembly and signaling, a process that requires CS-dependent delivery of essential factors to the centrosome. How does Cep120 regulate the asymmetric distribution of PCM proteins at the centrosome? Using immuno-electron microscopy, we previously showed that Cep120 resides on the outer wall of the centriolar microtubules ( Mahjoub et al., 2010 ). Subsequent studies using superresolution microscopy also positioned Cep120 near the centriolar microtubules, placing it in a layer proximal to the centriole wall and surrounded by the PCM proteins ( Lawo et al

In this study, we have demonstrated that Cep120 plays an important inhibitory role at the centrosome, by regulating PCM levels during quiescence. Loss of Cep120 initiates a series of changes in protein localization and abundance that ultimately result in defective ciliary assembly and function ( Figure 7H ). The first step involves changes in the maturation state of the daughter centriole, on which Cep120 is preferentially enriched. Centriole maturation is a multi-step process that includes accumulation of PCM material, assembly of appendage structures, recruitment of proteins essential for ciliary assembly, and elimination of inhibitory/licensing factors ( such as CP110 ) of ciliogenesis. Although most of these components are asymmetrically localized on mother versus daughter centrioles, our results show that Cep120 mainly controls the PCM stage of the maturation process. Removal of Cep120 did not result in complete maturation of the daughter centriole, nor enhance its ability to build a primary cilium. This suggests that the centriole maturation pathway regulated by Cep120 during quiescence is different than the one controlled by Plk1, a kinase that triggers centrosome maturation as cells enter mitosis ( Mahen and Venkitaraman, 2012 ). Indeed, over-expression of Plk1 in G1 can fully induce daughter centriole maturation independently of Cep120 loss, resulting in the assembly of appendages and the formation of a secondary primary cilium ( Kong et al., 2014 ). An alternative possibility is that Cep120 may be one of many targets of Plk1 and thus its depletion would not be expected to phenocopy Plk1 overexpression. However, inducing expression of Plk1 in G1 did not cause removal of Cep120 from the maturing daughter centriole ( Kong et al

., 2011]; Figure 7G ). Cep120-depleted cells showed a decrease in the number of Ofd1 foci at centrioles, indicating a defect in centriolar targeting of the protein ( Figure 7G ). Together, these results show that loss of Cep120 during quiescence is detrimental to ciliary assembly and function, likely due to aberrant CS-dependent trafficking of proteins to the centrosome.

., 2012; Mennella et al., 2014 ). Moreover, Cep120 contains an N-terminal microtubule-binding domain that was shown to be essential for directly binding microtubules in vitro ( Lin et al., 2013 ). Intriguingly, mutations in this microtubule-binding domain are pathogenic, and cause ciliopathies such as Jeune and Joubert syndrome ( Roosing et al., 2016; Shaheen et al., 2015 ). Thus, one interesting possibility is that Cep120 binds to and occupies sites on the surface of the centriolar microtubule wall, which could inhibit the association of PCM proteins in those locations. The loss of Cep120 from the daughter centriole at G1/S could potentially ‘free’ these sites and permit the accumulation of PCM proteins. The mechanism ( s ) that establish the asymmetric localization of Cep120 on mother and daughter centrioles remain unknown, and will be the focus of our future studies. In sum, our results highlight a new function for daughter centriole-associated proteins that is independent of their role in centriole duplication and assembly. Furthermore, these data illuminate the potential role ( s ) of other daughter centriole-enriched proteins, such as centrobin and Neurl4 ( Li et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2005 ), in quiescent cells. Finally, our findings establish the important and exquisitely sensitive control of centrosome PCM homeostasis and its relationship to primary cilium assembly and signaling, and uncover a potentially new type of molecular defect that may underlie the pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune and Joubert syndrome.

., 2013; Lin et al., 2013 ), and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain required for directing localization to centrosomes ( Mahjoub et al., 2010 ) ( Figure 4C ). Using a series of deletion constructs that we previously established ( Mahjoub et al., 2010 ), we over-expressed truncated versions of the protein and assessed the levels of PCM at the centrosome. Loss of the C-terminal coiled-coil domain failed to inhibit pericentrin levels at the centrosome ( Figure 4C–D ), indicating that localization to centrosomes is important for limiting PCM accumulation. Similarly, deletion of the microtubule-binding domain abrogated Cep120 inhibitory function ( Figure 4C–D ). Collectively, these results indicate that Cep120 limits the levels of PCM proteins at the centrosome ( with relatively higher inhibitory activity at the DC ), and that both microtubule-binding and coiled-coiled domains are essential for this function. To test whether loss of Cep120 affected other asymmetrically associated-centriolar proteins, we analyzed the distribution of distal appendage ( DAP ) and subdistal appendage ( sDAP ) proteins, which are only found on the MC during quiescence ( Garcia and Reiter, 2016 ). Cep164 and Fbf-1 are two core components of the DAP ( Graser et al., 2007; Mazo et al., 2016 ), and play a critical role in facilitating the attachment of the MC to ciliary vesicles or the plasma membrane, an essential step in cilia formation. There was no difference in Cep164 or Fbf-1 localization between control and Cep120-depleted cells ( Figure 5A–B ). Odf-2 localizes to the sDAP of the MC and is critical for their formation and function ( Ishikawa et al., 2005; Mazo et al., 2016 ). We found no difference in Odf-1 localization between control and C120-depleted cells ( Figure 5–B ), indicating that loss of C120 does not affect DAP or sAP proteins. However, we did find that C120-depleted cells showed a decrease in the number Of1 foci at centri, indicating a defect in centri targeting of the protein ( Figure 5–B ). Together, these results show that loss of C120 during qucence is detrimental to ciliary assembly and likely due to aberrant CS-dependent trafficking of proteins to the centome.
This study investigated neuron-glia signaling in the developing retina, focusing on the role of neurotransmitters in mediating communication between neurons and Müller glial cells (MCs). The researchers found that retinal waves induce calcium transients in MCs, which were blocked by muscarinic acetylcholine antagonists during cholinergic waves and ionotropic glutamate antagonists during glutamaterg waves, indicating MC responsiveness to neurotransmitters match retinal waves. Using an optical glutamate sensor, the decline in MC transients was caused by a reduction in glutamate reaching MCs. The study elucidated spatio-temporal and molecular pathways of neuron-MC communication in the retina, demonstrating spontaneous activity encompasses both neuronal and glial networks at this age. Physiological results indicate MC express multiple neurotransmitter types, allowing control of MC activity to be sustained as neuronal shifts dependent on cholinergic to glutamg signaling. The proportion of MC responding to waves decreased from P9 to P11, despite retinal waves, due to an increase in glutamate expression restricting glut spillo from nearby synapses. Data indicate MCs in the retina use multiple pathways to participate in correlated activity with neurons during retinal development.

    Title: A microbial clock provides an accurate estimate of the postmortem interval in a mouse model system
    Abstract: Establishing the time since death is critical in every death investigation, yet existing techniques are susceptible to a range of errors and biases. For example, forensic entomology is widely used to assess the postmortem interval ( PMI ), but errors can range from days to months. Microbes may provide a novel method for estimating PMI that avoids many of these limitations. Here we show that postmortem microbial community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable in a mouse model system, allowing PMI to be estimated within approximately 3 days over 48 days. Our results provide a detailed understanding of bacterial and microbial eukaryotic ecology within a decomposing corpse system and suggest that microbial community data can be developed into a forensic tool for estimating PMI.

   . The microbiology of corpse decomposition can now be investigated in detail by utilizing sequencing advances that enable entire communities to be characterized across the timeline of decomposition. These data will not only allow us to understand the underlying microbial ecology of corpse decomposition, but also the feasibility of using microbes as evidence. We must rigorously test whether microbial community change is sufficiently measurable and directional during decomposition to allow accurate estimates of past events such as the PMI. Recently, Pechal et al. ( 2013 ) demonstrated that skin and mouth bacterial communities followed a consistent trajectory of change during decomposition of three swine corpses over 5 days. Here, we expand upon these initial promising results by characterizing microbial community change in three external sites and one invasively sampled internal site in 40 destructively sampled mouse corpses over 48 days. In addition to characterizing bacterial community change of skin samples, we provide the first high-throughput sequencing characterization of microbial communities in the abdominal cavity and corpse-associated soils. Furthermore, we present the first high-throughput sequencing characterization of microbial eukaryotic community change ( e. g., fungi, nematodes, and amoeba ) associated with skin sites, the abdominal cavity and corpse-associated soils. We conducted a laboratory experiment to characterize temporal changes in microbial communities associated with mouse corpses as they decomposed on soil under controlled conditions for 48 days. We characterized bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes using a combination of culture-independent, high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches for each sample. To characterize the composition and diversity of bacterial and archaeal communities, we extracted DNA and sequenced partial 16S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) genes for each sample

We sampled the microbial communities from the mouse corpse abdominal cavity and skin ( head and torso ), as well as from the associated gravesoil from five replicate corpses over eight time points that spanned 48 days ( Table 1, Supplementary file 1A ). By using a mouse model, we were able to perform a highly replicated experiment with destructive sampling that enabled us to sample both the surface and interior of each corpse at each sampling time point. Importantly, this approach facilitated access to the abdominal cavity prior to natural corpse rupture, and thus our data addresses forensic hypotheses that the abdominal microbes play a key role in corpse decomposition ( Evans, 1963 ). This approach contrasts with typical forensic studies of decomposition where one to three donated corpses of human or swine ( used as a human model ) are used for experiments where only externally accessible body sites are sampled ( e. g., Pechal et al., 2013 ). A further advantage of using a mouse model system is that the large number of samples allowed us to assess to what extent the intra-individual variation of microbiota that we know is present in living humans and other mammals ( Costello et al., 2009 ) extends to microbial community change during decomposition. 10. 7554/eLife. 01104. 003Table 1.

., 2007; Parkinson et al., 2009 ). Biotic signatures associated with these stages of decomposition, such as the development rate of blow fly larvae ( Amendt et al., 2007 ), succession of insects ( Horenstein et al., 2010 ), and changes in the biochemistry of corpse-associated ‘gravesoil’ ( Tullis and Goff, 1987; Vass et al., 1992; Benninger et al., 2008; Carter et al., 2008; Horenstein et al., 2010 ), can be used to estimate PMI. However, no method is successful in every scenario ( Tibbett and Carter, 2008 ). For example, limitations of forensic entomology include uncertainty in the interval between death and egg deposition ( Tomberlin et al., 2011 ), lack of insects during particular weather events or seasons ( Archer and Elgar, 2003 ), and region-specific blowfly larval growth curves and insect communities ( Gallagher et al., 2010 ). Using microbial community change to track the progression of decomposition may circumvent many of these limitations because microbes are ubiquitous in the environment, located on humans before death, and can be reliably quantified using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Microbes play an important role in decomposition ( Vass, 2001; Hopkins, 2008; Mondor et al., 2012 ). For example, from the Fresh stage to the Bloat stage, enteric microbes likely contribute to putrefaction by digesting the corpse macromolecules, which in turn generates metabolic byproducts that cause the corpse to bloat ( Mondor et al., 2012 ). Evans proposed that a major shift in microbial communities occurs at the end of bloat when the body cavity ruptures ( Evans, 1963 ), as this key event likely shifts the abdominal cavity from anaerobic to aerobic. Additionally at the Rupture stage, nutrient rich body fluids are released into the environment often increasing pH ( Carter et al., 2010 ) likely altering endogenous microbial communities

. Future studies involving varied habitat conditions, soil types, etc are needed to identify the most general subset of predictive taxa. In all regression analyses, we directly evaluated the predictive strength of the fitted models by holding out one sample, fitting a regression using the remaining n–1 samples, and then using the fitted model to predict PMI for the held out sample. This is a more rigorous inference task than simply fitting a regression to all points jointly; it directly assesses the ability of the model to generalize to data it has not seen before. This distinguishes our approach from prior work in which regression models were evaluated by their ability to explain variation in all data points, after being fit to all data points ( Pechal et al., 2013 ). We have provided a proof-of-principle demonstration that microbial community ecology of decomposing corpses has potential to be developed into a complementary forensics tool for estimation of PMI. Additionally, we have provided the first bacterial high-throughput sequence time-series dataset for the abdominal cavity and gravesoil as well as the first microbial eukaryotic high-throughput sequence time-series dataset for the abdominal cavity, gravesoil, and skin sites of a decomposing animal. We also demonstrated that combining complementary sequencing technologies yields high-resolution taxonomic data. Furthermore, the approach described here has several advantages that make widespread adoption of these techniques likely in the future, including continued rapid decline in the cost of DNA sequencing and the ease and familiarity of swab-based sampling at potential crime scenes to law enforcement officers. Given the accuracy of our estimates of PMI, our work suggests a potentially expanded role for microbiological forensic indicators within the criminal justice system

. However, the degree to which microbial community changes are sensitive to factors including environmental and edaphic conditions, variation in the human microbiome, and differences among host species, remain to be established in future work. It is promising that Pechal et al. ( 2013 ) recently discovered a similar consistent change of skin bacterial communities on three decomposing swine in an outdoor setting. Future studies are crucial because previous forensic investigations using traditional indicators has shown that environmental parameters such as temperature, moisture, soil type, and soil texture can affect the rate at which decomposition occurs and the ability of decomposer organisms to function ( Carter et al., 2008, 2010 ). It is likely that these parameters will affect postmortem microbial communities. Consequently, the relationship between these parameters, decomposition, and postmortem microbial communities must be understood to develop a method to estimate PMI that is admissible as physical evidence within the criminal justice system. However, the present work strongly indicates that decomposition is sufficiently reproducible as an indicator of PMI to motivate these additional studies.

    Researchers have developed a novel method to estimate the postmortem interval (PM) in a mouse model system using microbial changes in the decomposing body. The method is based on the idea that microbes play a crucial role in decomposition and can be quantified using high-throughput DNA sequencing. The study characterized microbial communities in three sites on the body and in the abdominal cavity over 48 days and found that changes are measurable and repeatable. The results suggest that microbial data can be used to estimate PM with an accuracy of approximately 3 days over 48. The study provides the first high-throughput characterization of microbial communities in the abdominal cavity and corpse soils as well as the first eukaryotic high-through sequence dataset for skin, abdominal, and corpse soils. The approach has several advantages over existing methods, including the ability to sample the interior of the body before natural rupture and the use of a large number of samples to assess intra-individual variation in microbiota. The study demonstrates the potential of microbial ecology of decomposition as a forensic tool for estimating PM and suggests a role in the criminal justice system. However, future work is needed to understand the impact of environmental and edaphic conditions, human microbiome variation, and host differences among species on microbial change.

    Title: Molecular insights into the origin of the Hox-TALE patterning system
    Abstract: Despite tremendous body form diversity in nature, bilaterian animals share common sets of developmental genes that display conserved expression patterns in the embryo. Among them are the Hox genes, which define different identities along the anterior–posterior axis. Hox proteins exert their function by interaction with TALE transcription factors. Hox and TALE members are also present in some but not all non-bilaterian phyla, raising the question of how Hox–TALE interactions evolved to provide positional information. By using proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages, we showed that these networks emerged from an ancestral generic motif present in Hox and other related protein families. Interestingly, Hox-TALE networks experienced additional and extensive molecular innovations that were likely crucial for differentiating Hox functions along body plans. Together our results highlight how homeobox gene families evolved during eukaryote evolution to eventually constitute a major patterning system in Eumetazoans.

    ‘What is an animal? ’ In 1993, Slack et al. proposed to define an animal by the zootype ( Slack et al., 1993 ), a concept illustrating the strong conservation of embryonic expression profiles of developmental genes observed in different bilaterian phyla at that time. Since then, it was found that developmental genes could also display highly dissimilar expression patterns or even be absent in non-bilaterian lineages, showing that the genetic mechanisms underlying embryonic development are not universal. One major class of developmental genes that was historically considered as highly conserved in the animal kingdom is the Hox genes. Hox genes are expressed along the anteroposterior axis of all bilaterian animals, providing positional information during embryogenesis. Given their important patterning roles, Hox genes are thought to have strongly contributed to morphological diversification of bilaterian organisms during evolution. Accordingly, numerous examples have shown that modifications in Hox genes number, expression, and/or activity could correlate to morphological variations across bilaterian lineages ( Heffer and Pick, 2013 ). The role of Hox genes suffers more ambiguity outside Bilateria, and in particular in the sister Cnidaria group. Cnidarians do contain Hox genes and have undergone a wide range of morphological radiation during evolution. However, Hox genes have neither a clear collinear nor conserved expression profile along the primary ( oral–aboral ) axis of the planula larva among different cnidarian lineages ( Finnerty et al., 2004; Kamm et al., 2006 ), which renders their orthology status difficult to assign ( specially for posterior/non-anterior cnidarian Hox genes )

. Alternatively, it was recently proposed that Hox/ParaHox, NK and extended-Hox evolved before the origin of poriferans ( Mendivil Ramos et al., 2012 ), being already present in the last common ancestor of animals ( Urmetazoa ). In this scenario, we do not favour the hypothesis of independent acquisitions of the HX in the three homeobox gene families. Indeed, although the HX is a short motif, it is always located upstream and at a reasonable distance of the HD. This invariant position is probably critical to ensure interactions with PBC proteins. Moreover, the distance between the HX and the HD could have played important roles for the acquisition of new functions, as noticed in certain bilaterian Hox proteins ( Prince et al., 2008; Saadaoui et al., 2011 ). Thus, the HX could already have been present in the ProtoANTP protein of the Urmetazoa ancestor, being secondarily lost in Porifera, Ctenophora and Placozoa during evolution ( Figure 11B ). 10. 7554/eLife. 01939. 027Figure 11. Evolution of molecular signatures underlying interaction networks with TALE proteins. ( A ) Model for the apparition of the HX in ANTP members of Cnidaria and Bilateria. In this scenario, the HX appeared in a duplicated NK protein that gave rise to other HX-containing ANTP members in the common ancestor of Bilateria and Cnidaria. Duplications in other lineages occurred without the apparition of the HX. ( B ) Second model for the apparition of the HX in ANTP members of Cnidaria and Bilateria. This model is based on a recent work postulating the existence of Hox/ParaHox, NK, and extended-Hox clusters in the common ancestor of animals ( Mendivil Ramos et al., 2012 ). In this scenario, it is unlikely that the HX appeared after duplications of the ProtoANTP ancestor independently and at the same place in the ProtoHox, ProtoNK and ProtoExtended ( e ) Hox families. Thus, the HX motif was probably already present in the ProtoANTP ancestor

We have shown that identical molecular rules and conserved functions characterize Hox-TALE interaction networks in Cnidaria and Bilateria. The presence of the HX motif in several NvHox members and its requirement for generic Hox/TALE functions strongly suggest that this motif had a pivotal role for the evolution of an active Hox-TALE system in early metazoan lineages. In addition, the observation that a number of cnidarian Hox proteins do not have any HX ( Figure 10, Figure 10—figure supplement 1 ) highlights that the ancestral molecular properties and hence functions of the Hox-TALE network could have considerably diverged among different cnidarian lineages. 10. 7554/eLife. 01939. 025Figure 10. Phylogeny of the HX in Hox proteins of main cnidarian lineages. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01939. 02510. 7554/eLife. 01939. 026Figure 10—figure supplement 1.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01939. 026 To date, no HX motif can be found in any member of the ANTP class in Porifera, Ctenophora, or Placozoa group. This motif is present in different ANTP subclasses, including NK, Hox/ParaHox and extended-Hox, specifically in Bilateria and Cnidaria. Different scenarios can be proposed for explaining the evolutionary history of the HX among different ANTP members. These scenarios are hypothetical and diverge according to the putative evolutionary history of the ANTP class homeobox genes. In one scenario, HX-containing NK, Hox and extended-Hox members could have emerged from a common HX-containing NK protein, which itself appeared from duplications of an ancestral HX-deficient NK cluster, at the basis of Eumetazoa ( Bilateria+Cnidaria, Figure 11A )

. A role of Hox genes in axis patterning was proposed in the hydrozoan Eleutheria dichotoma ( Jakob and Schierwater, 2007 ), but these results are limited by the fact that functional analyses were performed in medusa, a particular developmental stage that is not shared by all cnidarian species. The role of cnidarian Hox genes during early larval stages is, however, currently unclear. Interestingly, Cnidaria is the only non-bilaterian phylum, which has a bona fide Hox repertoire, whereas others, including ctenophores, sponges, and placozoans, lack Hox genes ( Figure 1 ). This raises the important question of how the Hox gene family acquired its crucial axial patterning functions during metazoan evolution. In Bilateria, Hox patterning functions rely on the presence of the PBC and Meis proteins, which are also present in non-bilaterian phyla ( Figure 1 ). We thus assessed whether a Hox/PBC/Meis network could exist outside Bilateria, and if so whether or not it would rely on identical molecular rules as observed in Bilateria. 10. 7554/eLife. 01939. 003Figure 1.

Protein motifs required for Hox/PBC/Meis network are indicated when present: homeodomain ( HD ), hexapeptide ( HX ), PBC-A, and MEIS-A. Absence of the member in a given group is considered as resulting from a secondary loss ( sl ), when the ortholog is present more ancestrally.

We found that H/PBC/Me networks are conserved in Cnidaria and Bilateria, but not in other non-bilater phyla ( Figure 2 ). The H/P/BCMe network in Cnid and Bil relies on the same molecular rules as in Bil ( Figure 3 ), including the presence of HD, H, P-A, and ME-A motifs.

    Title: Super-resolution imaging of synaptic and Extra-synaptic AMPA receptors with different-sized fluorescent probes
    Abstract: Previous studies tracking AMPA receptor ( AMPAR ) diffusion at synapses observed a large mobile extrasynaptic AMPAR pool. Using super-resolution microscopy, we examined how fluorophore size and photostability affected AMPAR trafficking outside of, and within, post-synaptic densities ( PSDs ) from rats. Organic fluorescent dyes ( ≈4 nm ), quantum dots, either small ( ≈10 nm diameter; sQDs ) or big ( >20 nm; bQDs ), were coupled to AMPARs via different-sized linkers. We find that >90% of AMPARs labeled with fluorescent dyes or sQDs were diffusing in confined nanodomains in PSDs, which were stable for 15 min or longer. Less than 10% of sQD-AMPARs were extrasynaptic and highly mobile. In contrast, 5–10% of bQD-AMPARs were in PSDs and 90–95% were extrasynaptic as previously observed. Contrary to the hypothesis that AMPAR entry is limited by the occupancy of open PSD ‘slots’, our findings suggest that AMPARs rapidly enter stable ‘nanodomains’ in PSDs with lifetime >15 min, and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes.

   . Only the bQD-tagged AMPARs, which are virtually all extrasynaptic, are significantly affected by ECM. These results provide an explanation for the changes that occur in the diffusion and trajectories of the bQD-tagged AMPARs going from DIV 14 to 16 in Figure 3a and b. As the neurons develop in culture, progressively more ECM is deposited on the neuronal membrane going from DIV 14 to 16 thereby reducing AMPAR diffusion and trajectories. We find that AMPARs labeled with sQDs differ from AMPARs labeled with bQDs in being able to consistently enter synaptic clefts and nanodomains within PSDs. We observe the same behavior with AMPARs labeled with organic fluorophores. The feature that distinguishes sQDs from organic fluorophores is the significantly longer photostability of the sQDs compared to the ≈ 1 min lifetime with the organic fluorophores. Using AMPARs labeled with sQDs we examined the stability of AMPAR nanodomains in PSDs over 15 min, exciting the sQDs for 30 s at a time, every 5 min. A previous study observed that most nanodomains were stable for up to one hour, but some nanodomains were dynamic, appearing and disappearing within minutes ( Nair et al., 2013 ). This other study, however, used AMPARs labeled with either organic fluorophores or recombinant fluorescent proteins, which limited the imaging to the ensemble average of AMPAR in PSDs. They were therefore unable to observe the dynamics of single receptors except for much shorter times ( <<minute ), corresponding to the photobleaching time of organic fluorophores. Here we used sQDs to study the dynamics of the nanodomains of the same AMPAR in synapses for long periods ( from 15 min repeatedly, and up to 60 min occasionally ) of time. A total of 126 synapses were observed. As shown in Figure 7, we first located AMPARs for 30 s, immediately followed by PSD imaging using Homer 1 c super-resolution

., 2006 ). Determining whether AMPARs or other neurotransmitter receptors are synaptic ( outside PSDs ) or extrasynaptic ( inside PSDs ) has been difficult because of four factors: ( 1 ) Synapses are nanometer in scale below the diffraction limit of visible microscopy; ( 2 ) Most microscopy has been limited to two-dimensions, where in reality, the dimensions are three-dimensional; ( 3 ) Recombinantly tagged imaging probes cannot readily distinguish intracellular vs. cell-surface receptors; ( 4 ) Probe photostability limits the localization precision and the length of image acquisition, particularly for single-molecule studies. Here we use 3-dimensional super-resolution microscopy on cell-surface AMPARs labeled with different-sized fluorescent probes—bQDs ( >20 nm ), small quantum dots ( sQD ≈10 nm ) ( Cai et al., 2014 ) or organic fluorophore ( ≈ 4 nm ) in cultured neurons. These probes are highly fluorescent; bQDs are nearly infinitely photostable; sQDs are photostable for several minutes; and selected organic fluorophores can be photostable for ~1 min. We analyzed the diffusion constants, trajectories, distances from the center of PSDs, changes that occurred over time after transfection, and the role of the extracellular matrix in regulating diffusion. To better resolve PSD dimensions, we used 3-D super-resolution imaging of a PSD protein, Homer1c. We find that > 90% of AMPARs labeled with organic fluorescent dyes or sQDs are found in PSDs. Less than 10% of these labeled AMPARs are highly mobile and extrasynaptic. However, when AMPARs are labeled with bQDs, virtually all AMPARs ( 90–95% ) are highly mobile and extrasynaptic, presumably because bQDs are sterically hindered from entry into synaptic clefts. We conclude that mobile AMPARs enter PSDs and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes as previously observed in studies using the AMPARs labeled with bQDs

. The AMPARs therefore do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes as previously inferred in studies using AMPARs labeled with bQDs. In previous studies, the findings that AMPARs accumulate in a highly mobile pool of AMPARs in extra-synaptic dendritic membranes suggested that this AMPAR pool existed because of limits in the numbers of AMPARs that are stabilized within PSDs ( Opazo et al., 2012 ). According to Opazo et al., AMPARs are not stabilized within PSDs until ‘slots’, defined as PSD place-holders for AMPARs become free inside the PSD. Consequently, in this model, AMPARs build up outside of PSDs. We do not observe the highly mobile AMPAR pool when bQDs are replaced by a variety of smaller ( organic and sQDs ) fluorophores and linkers indicating that the highly mobile pool is an artifact of using bQDs attached to the AMPARs. Thus, the number of synaptic AMPARs does not appear to be limited by whether PSD slots are already occupied. The picture that emerges from our data is that after entry into PSDs, AMPARs are mobile but constrained within confined sub-synaptic nanodomains that are surprisingly stable, lasting for more than 15 min. It is likely that the AMPAR entry into PSDs is more rapid than the membrane diffusion rate to the PSDs. If this were not case, there would be accumulation of a mobile extra-synaptic pool, similar to what is observed when bQDs are attached to the AMPARs. The positioning of these nanodomains is likely critical for the AMPARs to receive glutamate from the presynaptic release sites ( Tang et al., 2016; Jeyifous et al., 2016 ). Our conclusion that the number of synaptic AMPARs is not limited by whether PSD slots are occupied suggests that other factors regulate AMPAR numbers in PSDs

., 2015; Henley et al., 2011 ). This suggests that different endo- and exocytosis sites may exist under constitutive conditions versus synaptic plasticity. In the last decade, advanced fluorescence microscopic techniques have pioneered work on iGluR dynamics ( Heine et al., 2008; Groc et al., 2007; Nair et al., 2013; MacGillavry et al., 2013; Kneussel and Hausrat, 2016 ). Commercial or ‘big’ quantum dots ( bQDs ) with a diameter >20 nm were observed ( at least occasionally ) within synaptic clefts of inhibitory synapses by electron microscopy ( Dahan et al., 2003 ). bQDs are extremely bright, photostable and their position can be localized to within ~10 nm in the millisecond time-scale ( Pinaud et al., 2010 ). Studies of AMPARs tagged with bQDs led to the conclusion that 50–80% of AMPARs are extrasynaptic and highly mobile ( Groc et al., 2007; Opazo et al., 2010 ). This significant highly mobile pool of extrasynaptic AMPARs has been proposed to exist because of the slow rate that extrasynaptic AMPARs enter PSDs. This slow rate of motion and accumulation of extra-synaptic AMPARs is thought to occur because of the limited availability of ‘slots’ in PSDs ( See Figure 1a, route 3 ) ( Shi et al., 2001; Opazo et al., 2012 ). Slots are defined as placeholders for AMPARs in PSDs ( Malinow et al., 2000 ). Once in PSD slots, AMPARs are generally assumed to be immobilized, although Nair et al. observed that AMPs in nanodomains are dynamic (2013 ). However, AMPs labeled with bDs were used in these studies, which are photobleach in <1 min, limiting the ability to observe nanodom dynamics. In contrast, we used sDs which are photostable for several minutes, allowing us to observe AMP nanodom for 15 min or more. We find that AMPs labeled withDs are confined to nanodom in PSDs for 15 min or longer than AMPs labeled with bDs, which are highly extrasyn and mobile. Our results suggest that AMPs enter PSD rapidly and do not accumulate in extrasyn membranes as previously observed with AMPs labeled bDs. We conclude that the number of AMPs in PSD is not limited by the occupancy of slots in PSD, but other factors regulate the number of AMPs in PSD.

    Title: SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels mediates the early response to acute hypoxia in central neurons
    Abstract: The mechanism for the earliest response of central neurons to hypoxia—an increase in voltage-gated sodium current ( INa ) —has been unknown. Here, we show that hypoxia activates the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier ( SUMO ) pathway in rat cerebellar granule neurons ( CGN ) and that SUMOylation of NaV1. 2 channels increases INa. The time-course for SUMOylation of single NaV1. 2 channels at the cell surface and changes in INa coincide, and both are prevented by mutation of NaV1. 2-Lys38 or application of a deSUMOylating enzyme. Within 40 s, hypoxia-induced linkage of SUMO1 to the channels is complete, shifting the voltage-dependence of channel activation so that depolarizing steps evoke larger sodium currents. Given the recognized role of INa in hypoxic brain damage, the SUMO pathway and NaV1. 2 are identified as potential targets for neuroprotective interventions.

    Here, we show that SUMOylation of NaV1. 2 channels at the plasma membrane underlies the immediate increase in INa in response to acute hypoxia in cultured neurons and CHO cells. Previously, we demonstrated that SUMOylation increases excitability by suppressing the activity of background K+ channels ( Rajan et al., 2005; Plant et al., 2010, 2012 ) and voltage-gated K+ channels ( Plant et al., 2011 ) that stabilize cells below firing threshold and restore cells to baseline after excitatory events, respectively. Now, we report that SUMOylation augments the activity of voltage-gated NaV channels that initiate and propagate action potentials, expanding the known targets through which the SUMO pathway can regulate neuronal activity. In addition, while chronic stressors, including low tissue oxygenation, have been associated with global changes in SUMOylation, this is the first report, to our knowledge, to demonstrate rapid modulation of the SUMO pathway over just 10’s of s. Hypoxia increases the SUMOylated fraction of NaV1. 2 channels at the cell surface in both CGN and CHO cells ~4-fold ( Figures 2 and 8 ). Further, hypoxia or SUMO in the pipette shift the V½ of channel activation and SSI leftward, increasing Na+ current in response to depolarization by ~70% in both cell types ( Figures 1 and 5, Table 1 ). Consistent with tonic regulation by the SUMO pathway of both CGN INa and NaV1. 2 in CHO cells, V½ in ambient O2 rests midway between the SUMOylating and deSUMOylating experimental conditions; the full excursion in V½ between the two conditions was ~27 mV in both cell types; and SENP1 decreased Na+ current from baseline by ~75% in both cases ( Figures 1 and 5, Table 1 ). Also concordant are the rapid rates of hypoxia-induced increase of CGN INa and NaV1. 2 current in CHO cells ( Figures 1 and 8 ). Together, the following observations support the notion that hypoxia acts directly via SUMOylation of NaV1

. 2 Lys38: modification of Lys38 is demonstrated directly by FRET and MS ( Figures 4 and 6 ) ; hypoxia does not alter the current passed by NaV1. 2-Lys38Gln channels nor INa in neurons pretreated with SUMO1 ( Figures 1 and 5 ) ; hypoxia cannot overcome suppression of INa by SENP1 ( Figures 1 and 5 ) ; and, the time-course of SUMOylation of Lys38 matches the increase in NaV1. 2 currents observed when CHO cells are subjected to hypoxia ( Figure 8 ). That hypoxia-mediated SUMOylation of NaV1. 2 is observed in the presence of TTX shows that Na+ flux is not a prerequisite for channel SUMOylation. These findings offer a molecular rationale for acute, hypoxia-induced increases in the activity of neuronal NaV channels ( Boening et al., 1989; Horn and Waldrop, 2000; Raley-Susman et al., 2001; Hammarström and Gage, 2000 ), a well-known trigger for the subsequent cascade of pathological events leading to cellular injury ( Banasiak et al., 2004; Fung and Haddad, 1997 ). Even short periods of hypoxia can diminish neuronal viability and perturb physiology. Thus, in perinatal rodents, brain hypoxia leads to cerebellar abnormalities, including a decrease in the number of Purkinje cells and interneurons and the thickness of the molecular and granule cell layers ( Biran et al., 2011 ). Because inhibition of INa by TTX reduces hypoxia-induced death in neuronal cultures ( Boening et al., 1989; Stys et al., 1992; Weber and Taylor, 1994; Xie et al., 1994; Taylor et al., 1995; Fung et al., 1999; Horn and Waldrop, 2000; Raley-Susman et al., 2001; Banasiak et al., 2004 ), the response we study here — acute hypoxic recruitment of SUMO to NaV1. 2 channels leading to increased CGN INa— might be expected to be deleterious. However, neuronal pathology depends on the etiology, severity, and duration of the insult ( Puyal et al., 2013 )

. Our earlier work on IKso in rat CGN carried by channels with K2P1 subunits showed SUMOylation to decrease that background K+ conductance that stabilizes cells below firing threshold ( Plant et al., 2012 ). So, too, we found SUMOylation to suppress the voltage-gated, delayed-rectifier K+ current IDR in rat hippocampal neurons that speeds recovery after excitatory events, due to a rightward shift in the G-V relationship for activation of KV2. 1 channels ( Plant et al., 2011 ). Of note, we found that SUMO did not regulate hippocampal pyramidal cell INa, a current carried predominantly NaV1. 1 and NaV1. 6 ( Gong et al., 1999; Vacher et al., 2008 ). This suggests that SUMO regulation of NaV channels may be isoform-specific, a notion supported by the failure of the small amount of INa in rat CGN that was not carried by NaV1. 2 to respond to hypoxia, SUMO1 or SENP1, a current we attribute primarily to NaV1. 6 based on its pharmacology. Here, we observe that NaV1. 2 current remains elevated due to SUMOylation for at least 10–20 min following return to ambient O2 in both CGN and CHO cells ( Figures 1 and 5 ). In contrast, an acute hypoxic challenge to hypothalamic neurons induced an increase in NaV current that recovered when the cells were returned to normoxia ( Horn and Waldrop, 2000 ). While different targets have been reported to be SUMOylated in a stable ( Bernier-Villamor et al., 2002 ) or labile ( Lang, 2015 ) fashion, it is not necessarily the case that the response in hypothalamic neurons is mediated by the SUMO pathway and, thus, those findings may represent the operation of other NaV channel subtypes, differential effects of cellular history and environment, or variations in experimental strategies. Indeed, the cellular effects of hypoxia on neurons are numerous and those with significant influence should be expected to vary acutely and over time as well as by cell type

. Of the ten genes for α-subunits in mammals, four are predominant in the central nervous system including SCN2a, which encodes NaV1. 2, an α-subunit that is widely distributed in the brain. SCN2a mutations are associated with epilepsy and febrile seizures ( Shi et al., 2012 ). SUMOylation is the enzyme-mediated, post-translational linkage of one of three SUMO isoforms to the ε-amino group of specific Lys residues on a target protein ( Henley et al., 2014 ). Present in all eukaryotic cells, the SUMO pathway was recognized to regulate the trafficking and activity of nuclear transcription factors when we discovered it to operate as well at the plasma membrane to regulate neuronal excitability via direct SUMOylation of K+ channel α-subunits ( Rajan et al., 2005; Plant et al., 2010, 2011, 2012 ). Here, seeking to determine if the SUMO pathway also regulated sodium channels, we documented SUMOylation of NaV1. 2 channels in CGN and then recognized it to be the basis for acute, hypoxic augmentation of INa. To establish the mechanism, we studied rat CGN using SUMylating and deSUMylating enzymes and Na1. 2 channels with Lys38 mutation. We found that hypia SUMylation of Na1. 2 channels at the plasma membrane underlies the increase in IN in response to acute hypia in cultured neurons and CHO cells. The time-course of SUMylation of Na1.2 channels at the surface and IN coincide and are prevented by mutation of Na1. 2-Lys or application of deSUMyl enzyme. Within 40 s hypia linkage of SUM1 to channels is complete, shifting the voltage dependence of channel so that depolarizing steps evoke larger sodium currents. Given the role of IN in hypoxic brain damage, the SUM pathway and Na1 2 are identified as potential targets for neuroprotective interventions.
Researchers have developed a mechanistic model for the thermal response of Ross River virus (RRV), a mosquito-borne pathogen found in Australia and potentially emerging worldwide. The model predicts that transmission peaks at moderate temperatures (26.4°C) and declines to zero at thermal limits (17.0 and 31.5°C). This results in year-round endemic transmission in the tropics but seasonal in temperate areas, leading to a nationwide peak in human cases. Climate warming is expected to increase transmission in temperate areas where most Australians live, but decrease in tropical areas where temperatures are near the thermal optimum. The model illustrates the importance of nonlinear models in inferring the role of temperature in disease and predicting climate change.

The study parameterized a temperature-dependent model for RRV with data from two vector species (C. annirostris and Ae. vigil). The optimal temperature for transmission is moderate (26-27°C), determined by the thermal response of mosquito lifespan. Low and high temperatures limit transmission due to low fecundity and survival at all stages, often ignored in models. Temperature explains the geography of year-round versus seasonal disease and predicts seasonality of human cases at the national scale. The model provides a mechanistic link between geographic and seasonal variation in temperature and broad patterns of disease.

The thermal response of RRV matches other mosquito-borne pathogens, but with some differences. The optimal temperature for R (26-27) fits the range of thermal found for other diseases using the same methods: malaria by Anophe spp. The strongest signal of temperature on disease is in temperate regions where temperature varies along the rising portion of the R curve (20-25). Mean temperatures above and below the optimum may mask effects in linear models. Nonlinear model is critical for estimating temperature on transmission as a few degrees can have positive, negligible, or negative on different parts of the curve.

Field evidence for unodal responses in vectororne is rare, but some constraining R transmission: outbreaks were less with days above 35 in Queensland and populations peaked at 25 declined 32 in Victoria. Statistical of R cases may benefit using nonlinear for R as predictor instead of raw temperature. Breeding availability drives mosquito and disease: rainfall linked to abundance R species and cases.
Researchers investigated the relationship between beta oscillations in the motor cortex and movement onset by recording neural activity from macaques performing a novel neurofeedback task. The task involved bringing beta power to an instructed state and then executing an arm reach. Results showed that reaches preceded by a reduction in beta power had faster onset times than those preceded by an increase in power. Additionally, population activity shifted from a movement state during beta oscillations that were neurofeedback or naturally occurring during reaching. This establishes a population basis for slowed onset following beta activity. Beta oscillations have been linked to various aspects of motor behavior, including movement onset, reaction time, angle, and speed. This study ties together behavioral correlates with hypotheses of motor encoding through population-level activity. The presence of beta was tested on unprepared movements, but evidence suggests it may reflect neural states preparing for cues. Results show beta frequencies are a marker of slowed onset, with underlying activity shifting from a threshold when subjects produce or naturally produce them. Mechanisms of beta were discussed to reconcile discrepancies in reported correlates. Shifting activity of motor neurons by beta generation reduces probability of movement for encoding specific plans. To explore beta and spiking, maca were trained on a center-out and neuro-reaching task. Movement-aligned spectrograms showed clearest desynchronization in the 25-40 band, consistent with reports in motor cortex. Beta limits for neurofeedback were set at 25-40. Simultaneously recorded units showed different activity during neuro-induced beta compared to natural oscillations. Population analyses showed beta promotes a movement-slow state in both tasks, matching behavior.

    Title: TRAF2 regulates TNF and NF-κB signalling to suppress apoptosis and skin inflammation independently of Sphingosine kinase 1
    Abstract: TRAF2 is a component of TNF superfamily signalling complexes and plays an essential role in the regulation and homeostasis of immune cells. TRAF2 deficient mice die around birth, therefore its role in adult tissues is not well-explored. Furthermore, the role of the TRAF2 RING is controversial. It has been claimed that the atypical TRAF2 RING cannot function as a ubiquitin E3 ligase but counterclaimed that TRAF2 RING requires a co-factor, sphingosine-1-phosphate, that is generated by the enzyme sphingosine kinase 1, to function as an E3 ligase. Keratinocyte-specific deletion of Traf2, but not Sphk1 deficiency, disrupted TNF mediated NF-κB and MAP kinase signalling and caused epidermal hyperplasia and psoriatic skin inflammation. This inflammation was driven by TNF, cell death, non-canonical NF-κB and the adaptive immune system, and might therefore represent a clinically relevant model of psoriasis. TRAF2 therefore has essential tissue specific functions that do not overlap with those of Sphk1.

    Supporting Text:
   . We were able to reverse this inflammatory phenotype by simultaneously deleting both Tnf and Nfkb2 genes. Our results highlight the important role TRAF2 plays to protect keratinocytes from cell death and to down-regulate inflammatory responses and support the idea that intrinsic defects in keratinocytes can initiate psoriasis-like skin inflammation.

. ( C ) Concomitant deletion of Tnf in mice with Traf2-deficient keratinocytes breaks this vicious cycle and prevents apoptosis of keratinocytes and early onset of the psoriasis-like phenotype. ( D ) In the absence of TNF, Traf2-deficient keratinocytes still produce inflammatory cytokines via the non-canonical NF-κB pathway that ultimately generate the same psoriasis-like phenotype in mice but with slower onset. These cytokines recruit inflammatory immune cells to the skin, including neutrophils and IFNγ+ T cells. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 10592. 015

. Importantly, we have shown that non-canonical NF-κB signalling can be the driver of inflammation in epithelial cells. This observation might be relevant to human psoriasis because it has been reported that the levels of TWEAK and its receptor Fn-14 are elevated in human psoriatic lesions ( Cheng et al., 2015 ), and it is well established that TWEAK/Fn14 signalling induces degradation of TRAF2 and activation of non-canonical NF-κB signalling ( Saitoh et al., 2003; Vince et al., 2008 ). Thus, our results suggest that inhibition of non-canonical NF-κB signalling might be beneficial in chronic inflammatory disease together with TNF inhibitors. 10. 7554/eLife. 10592. 015Figure 11. Proposed mechanisms by which loss of TRAF2 in keratinocytes causes a psoriasis-like skin inflammation. ( A ) In normal wild-type skin TNF signalling might be activated by local penetration of bacteria into the epidermis. This will induce TNF, presumably by keratinocytes themselves or other resident cells such as Langerhans cells, and promotes canonical NF-κB signalling, inflammatory cytokine production and expression of prosurvival genes. If this response nullifies the threat, TNF signalling is turned off and homeostasis of the skin is maintained. ( B ) In the absence of TRAF2 in keratinocytes, TNF production can induce apoptotic cell death. This cell death, possibly because of the release of DAMPs, recruits neutrophils and other inflammatory cells to the skin and causes epidermal hyperplasia. Loss of TRAF2 also causes constitutive non-canonical NF-κB activation in viable keratinocytes, which increases the production and release of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF. Thus, TRAF2-deficient keratinocytes do not need to be stimulated by bacteria to produce TNF, and TNF-induced death sets up a potentially vicious cycle of inflammation

. Deletion of one allele of NIK prevents lethality of Traf2 knock-out ( Lin et al., 2011; Vallabhapurapu et al., 2008 ). Together with the observation that TRAF2 knock-out keratinocytes also have high levels of NIK and the active form of NFκB2 ( p52 ), we hypothesised that inhibiting non-canonical NF-κB signalling might prevent the inflammation in Traf2EKO mice. To test this, we crossed Traf2EKO with either Map3k14 ( Nik ) aly/aly mice, that bear an inactive point mutant of NIK, or Nfkb2 ( p100 ) -/- mice. Contrary to our hypothesis, deficiency in Map3k14 or Nfkb2 did not prevent the psoriasis-like skin disease in Traf2EKO mice ( Figure 9 and 10 ). Not only did Traf2EKOMap3k14aly/+ and Traf2EKOMap3k14aly/aly mice develop skin inflammation, the onset of disease in Traf2EKOMap3k14aly/aly mice was earlier than in Traf2EKO or Traf2EKOMap3k14aly/+ mice ( Figure 9 ). Traf2EKONfkb2-/- mice developed epidermal hyperplasia and skin inflammation in the same time frame as Traf2EKO animals ( Figure 10 ). Furthermore, the location of skin disease in both Traf2EKOMap3k14aly/aly and Traf2EKONfkb2-/- was different to that in Traf2EKO animals ( Figures 9A and 10C ). Loss of Traf2 usually caused lesions in the submental and forehead area, while lesions in Traf2EKOMap3k14aly/aly and Traf2EKONfkb2-/- mice appeared around the legs and sometimes spread over the whole ventral area ( Figures 9A, 10A, C ). We were unable to examine Traf2EKOTnf-/-Map3k14aly/aly mice because Tnf-/-Map3k14aly/aly mice were highly susceptible to infections and difficult to breed ( Data not shown ). However, depletion of both TNF and NF-κB2 completely prevent the psoriasis-like inflammation in the Traf2EKO mice ( Figure 10 ). Three out of thirteen of the Traf2EKOTnf-/-Nfkb2-/- mice developed skin lesions at an early age around the mouth and anus ( Figure 10C, D )

., 2015 ). However, it is not entirely clear whether these defects are due to the loss of TRAF2 in epithelial cells or hematopoietic cells. Therefore, we specifically targeted Traf2 in keratinocytes and investigated the role of TRAF2 in the epidermis. Keratinocyte-specific Traf2 knock-out mice developed epidermal hyperplasia and severe skin inflammation, leading to noticeable lesions around head and submental area by 6 weeks of age. However, consistent with previous reports ( Allende et al., 2004; Xiong et al., 2013 ), no sign of inflammation was detected in the skin of Sphk1f/fSphk2-/-Rosa-Cre-ERT2 mice following activation of Cre-mediated gene deletion with Tamoxifen ( Data not shown ). Thus, total lack of SPHK isoenzymes did not phenocopy the skin defects seen in the absence of TRAF2, again arguing against an essential role for S1P in TRAF2's function. Several mouse models of skin inflammation have been rescued by depletion of TNF ( Gerlach et al., 2011; Nenci et al., 2006; Pasparakis et al., 2002 ). While TNF is a major inflammatory mediator and directly drives production of a host of inflammatory cytokines through TNFR1 signalling, it has been proposed that TNF-induced cell death, specifically necroptosis, might also generate Damage Associated Molecular Patterns ( DAMPs ) that could activate Toll Like Receptors, or other analogous receptors to indirectly promote inflammatory cytokine production ( Gerlach et al., 2011; Pasparakis and Vandenabeele, 2015 ). The relative contribution of these two pathways to inflammation in vivo, and particularly in human pathology, is still unclear. Keratinocyte hyperplasia in Sharpincpdm/cpdm mice can be driven by TNF-induced apoptotic death, because deletion of just one allele of Casp8 or epidermal Fadd deletion markedly ameliorated or prevented the TNFR1-dependent inflammatory phenotype ( Kumari et al., 2014; Rickard et al., 2014a )

    Keep the response strictly to the summary. The output should begin with a clear and concise statement of the research question addressed by the study. 
    The study investigated the role of TRAF2 in the regulation of TNF and NF-κ signalling in keratinocytes and its impact on skin homeostasis and inflammation. TR2 is a component of TN superfamily signalling and plays a crucial role in the regulation of homeostasis of immune cells. TR2 deficient mice die at birth, therefore its role in adult tissues is not well-explored. The study found that TR2 deficient keratinocytes develop epidermal hyperasia and psoriatic skin inflammation driven by TN, cell death non-canonical NFκ and adaptive immune system. This represents a clinically relevant model of psoriasis. TR2 has essential tissue specific functions that do not overlap with those of Sph1. 
    Keratin-specific deletion of T2 but not Sph1 deficiency disrupted TN mediated NFκ and MAP signalling and caused epider hyperplasia and psatic skin inflammation. This was driven by TN, death non-canonical NFκ and adaptive system and might represent a model of psoriasis. The inflammation was reversed by simultaneous deletion of TN and NF2 genes. The study highlights the role of TR2 in protecting keratin from death and downregulating inflammatory responses and supports the idea that intrinsic defects in keratin can initiate psoriasis-like inflammation. 
    TR2 deficient keratinocytes produce inflammatory cytokines via non-canonical NF pathway that generate ps-like phenotype in mice with slower onset. These cytokines recruit immune cells to skin including neutrophils and IFγ T. Non-canonical NF signalling is a driver of inflammation in epithelial cells and might be relevant to human psoriasis as TWE and Fn14 are elevated in psatic lesions. Inhibition of non-can NF signalling might be beneficial in chronic disease with TN inhibitors.

    Title: A dynamin 1-, dynamin 3- and clathrin-independent pathway of synaptic vesicle recycling mediated by bulk endocytosis
    Abstract: The exocytosis of synaptic vesicles ( SVs ) elicited by potent stimulation is rapidly compensated by bulk endocytosis of SV membranes leading to large endocytic vacuoles ( ‘bulk’ endosomes ). Subsequently, these vacuoles disappear in parallel with the reappearance of new SVs. We have used synapses of dynamin 1 and 3 double knock-out neurons, where clathrin-mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is dramatically impaired, to gain insight into the poorly understood mechanisms underlying this process. Massive formation of bulk endosomes was not defective, but rather enhanced, in the absence of dynamin 1 and 3. The subsequent conversion of bulk endosomes into SVs was not accompanied by the accumulation of clathrin coated buds on their surface and this process proceeded even after further clathrin knock-down, suggesting its independence of clathrin. These findings support the existence of a pathway for SV reformation that bypasses the requirement for clathrin and dynamin 1/3 and that operates during intense synaptic activity.

    Supporting Text:
    While the revision of this manuscript was being finalized, a paper by Kononenko et al. ( 2014 ) reported that bulk endocytosis in response to a strong stimulus is dynamin 1/3 dependent ( based on RNA interference ) and proposed an important role for clathrin in SV budding from endosomes. Our results, which are based on studies of dynamin 1/3 double KO synapses and on the ultrastructrual analysis of the time course of SV recovery from bulk endosomes in the presence or near depletion of clathrin lead to different conclusions.

Synaptic vesicles ( SVs ) are the specialized organelles that store and secrete non-peptide neurotransmitters at synapses. Following exocytosis, their membranes are rapidly recaptured by endocytosis and recycled for the generation of new fusion-competent SVs ( Ceccarelli et al., 1973; Heuser and Reese, 1973; Betz and Bewick, 1992 ). Strong evidence indicates that clathrin-mediated endocytosis ( CME ) plays a key role in this endocytic traffic ( Heuser and Reese, 1973; Maycox et al., 1992; Granseth et al., 2006; Heerssen et al., 2008; Kasprowicz et al., 2008; Saheki and De Camilli, 2012 ). Endocytic vesicles generated by CME have a small homogenous size, in the same range of SVs ( Shupliakov et al., 1997; Raimondi et al., 2011 ). While it had been originally hypothesized that such vesicles transit through an endosomal station ( Heuser and Reese, 1973 ), subsequent studies have suggested that they may mature directly into SVs, a possibility consistent with their size ( Takei et al., 1996 ). However, CME does not account for all SV recycling and the mechanisms of alternative pathways have been the object of intense debate. One proposed alternative recycling mechanism is so-called ‘kiss-and-run’, a process whereby SVs fuse only very transiently with the plasma membrane without collapsing into it, so that the SVs reform directly by the immediate closure of the fusion pore ( Fesce et al., 1994; Alabi and Tsien, 2013 ). Yet another mechanism is bulk endocytosis, a high capacity pathway of plasma membrane internalization involving patches of membrane larger than the membrane of individual SVs. This mechanism predominates under intense neuronal activity ( Miller and Heuser, 1984; Holt et al., 2003; Wu and Wu, 2007; Hayashi et al., 2008; Cousin, 2009; Wenzel et al., 2012; Kittelmann et al., 2013 )

., 1999; Höning et al., 2005; Zoncu et al., 2007; Idevall-Hagren et al., 2012 ) challenged these results as PI ( 4, 5 ) P2, which is selectively concentrated at the plasma membrane, is generally rapidly depleted from endocytic membranes and is thus not expected to be concentrated on bulk endosomes ( Cremona et al., 1999; Chang-Ileto et al., 2011; Milosevic et al., 2011 ). The goal of this study was to gain new information into the recycling of SV membranes via bulk endocytosis. To this aim we examined the impact of manipulations that affect dynamin-dependent endocytosis on this process using electron microscopy ( EM ) in combination with endocytic tracers. We demonstrate that the rapid, bulk endocytic recapture of SV membranes induced by a strong stimulus, either KCl or high frequency stimulation, is not impaired at synapses lacking both of the two predominant neuronal dynamins, dynamin 1 and dynamin 3, that is synapses where CME is severely perturbed ( Ferguson et al., 2007; Raimondi et al., 2011; Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012 ). Conversion of bulk endosomes into new SVs does occur in these synapses, although less efficiently than in wild-type ( WT ) synapses. The partial impairment of this conversion is not further aggravated by the additional knock-down ( KD ) of clathrin, indicating the clathrin-independence of this process. These observations provide evidence for a pathway of SV reformation that predominates after strong stimulation and does not require clathrin mediated budding or dynamin 1 and 3.

. As the pie chart of Figure 6C shows ( labeling of the sectors is the same as in Figure 2I ), the strongest defects observed at Dyn1/3 DKO synapses relative to controls concern the reformation of SVs during the stimulus ( black sector ) and the recovery of SVs from CTX-HRP labeled bulk endosomes generated during the stimulus ( sector with black stripes ). Given evidence for a robust contribution of bulk endosomes to the reformation of SVs, the potential role of clathrin to the budding of new SVs from such organelles during recovery from an acute stimulation was explored. CCPs were nearly absent before stimulation in synapses of all genotypes, including Dyn1 KO and Dyn1/3 DKO synapses ( Figure 7A–D ), as spontaneous network activity prior to the stimulation had been silenced by an overnight treatment with TTX. 10. 7554/eLife. 01621. 009Figure 7. CCP number following stimulation is drastically elevated at dynamin mutant synapses, but in both WT and KO synapses they are selectively localized in the plasma membrane.

DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 01621. 014 To test the contribution of clathrin to the recovery of SVs from bulk endosomes, CHC depleted Dyn1/3 DKO neurons ( and Dyn1/3 DKO neurons as controls ) were exposed to the same protocol used for Figures 3 and 4 ( overnight silencing with TTX, 90 s stimulation in HRP containing high K+ buffer and finally recovery in HRP-free resting medium ) with analysis by EM. Prior to stimulation, only occasional CCPs were observed at synapses of both genotypes [overnight silencing of electrical activity nearly abolished CCPs, even in neurons not exposed to CHC KD ( Raimondi et al., 2011 ) ]. As expected, the increase in CCP number produced by the 90 s high K+ stimulation in Dyn1/3 DKO neurons was not observed in cells that had also been depleted of CHC ( Figure 8A and B ). However, in Dyn1/ DKO synapses exposed to CH KD, the increase in CCP was still observed ( Figure 8C and D ) indicating that clrin is not required for the formation of new SVs from endosomes during the recovery phase of intense stimulation. The increase in CCP in Dyn1/3 DKO synapses exposed to CH KD was not significantly different from that in Dyn1/ D syn ( Figure 8E ) suggesting that clrin is not required for the formation of new SVs from endosomes during the recovery phase of intense stimulation. The increase in CCP in Dyn1/ D syn exposed to CH was not significantly different from that in Dyn1/ D syn ( Figure 8 ) suggesting that clrin is not required for the formation of new SV from endosomes during the recovery of intense stimulation. The increase in CCP in Dyn/ D syn exposed CH was not significantly different from that in Dyn/ syn ( Figure 8 ) suggesting that clrin is not required for the formation of SV from endosomes during the recovery of intense stimulation. The increase in CCP in Dyn syn exposed CH was not different from that in Dyn ( Figure 8 ) suggesting that clrin is not required for the formation of SV from endosomes during the recovery of stimulation. The increase in CCP in syn exposed CH was not different from that in ( Figure 8 ) that clrin is not required for the formation of SV from endosomes during the recovery stimulation. The increase in CCP syn CH was not different from ( Figure 8 ) that clrin is not required for the formation of SV endosomes during the stimulation. The increase in CCP CH was not different from ( Figure 8 ) thatrin is not required for the formation of endosomes during the stimulation.

    Title: Identification of human glucocorticoid response markers using integrated multi-omic analysis from a randomized crossover trial
    Abstract: Glucocorticoids are among the most commonly prescribed drugs, but there is no biomarker that can quantify their action. The aim of the study was to identify and validate circulating biomarkers of glucocorticoid action. In a randomized, crossover, single-blind, discovery study, 10 subjects with primary adrenal insufficiency ( and no other endocrinopathies ) were admitted at the in-patient clinic and studied during physiological glucocorticoid exposure and withdrawal. A randomization plan before the first intervention was used. Besides mild physical and/or mental fatigue and salt craving, no serious adverse events were observed. The transcriptome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue, plasma miRNAomic, and serum metabolomics were compared between the interventions using integrated multi-omic analysis. We identified a transcriptomic profile derived from two tissues and a multi-omic cluster, both predictive of glucocorticoid exposure. A microRNA ( miR-122-5p ) that was correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by glucocorticoid exposure was identified ( p=0. 009 ) and replicated in independent studies with varying glucocorticoid exposure ( 0. 01 ≤ p≤0. 05 ). We have generated results that construct the basis for successful discovery of biomarker ( s ) to measure effects of glucocorticoids, allowing strategies to individualize and optimize glucocorticoid therapy, and shedding light on disease etiology related to unphysiological glucocorticoid exposure, such as in cardiovascular disease and obesity.

    In a clinical experimental study designed to identify biomarkers of GC action, we succeeded in generating two profoundly different states of GC exposure within the physiological range in the same individual. The novelty of this study is the identification of pathways related to GC response and putative biomarkers of GC action in gene expression, metabolome, and miRNAs derived from integrated multi-omic analysis in two independent tissues. We identified a transcriptomic profile that was under similar GC regulation in both PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes, which was then validated by comparison to a range of previously published data by other research groups from cellular assays. We also identified a circulating miRNA, miR-122-5p, which was correlated with the circulating transcriptome and metabolome findings, suggesting for the first time a functional role in GC action. Moreover, the association between the expression of miR-122-5p and GC exposure was replicated in three independent study groups. In order to identify putative biomarkers of GC action in humans, a clinical study was considered to be the most appropriate experimental setting. Addison’s disease or primary adrenal insufficiency is a rare disorder, but a unique clinical model for GC biomarker discovery due to absent or very low endogenous GC production ( Gan et al., 2014; Sævik et al., 2020 ). Subjects with Addison’s disease were studied in a random order during physiological GC exposure and GC withdrawal. During GC exposure, infusion of HC delivered in isotonic saline via an infusion pump using a circadian pattern and saline alone ( using the same volume and infusion pattern as during HC infusion ) was administered during the GC withdrawal in order to prevent a state of sodium and fluid deficiency. This study design therefore allowed a within-individual comparison accounting for circadian rhythm and food intake

. Targeted replication of the plasma miR-122-5p fold change from the experimental study in subjects with Addison’s disease using an independent RNA separation procedure showed a marked down-regulation of miR-122-5p by increased GC exposure ( p=0. 009 ) ( Figure 6 ). Two subjects did not show this miR-122-5p response, one man ( disease duration 2 years, body mass index [BMI] 23. 8 kg/m2; hydrocortisone 20 mg daily, fludrocortisone 0. 1 mg daily ) and one woman ( disease duration 23 years; BMI 28. 1 kg/m2; hydrocortisone 30 mg daily, fludrocortisone 0. 2 mg daily ) who both experienced mild mental fatigue during GC withdrawal. Based on ( i ) the functional association of a circulating miRNA with gene expression and metabolomics, and ( ii ) the correlation between the PBMC transcriptome and plasma miRNAome ( Figure 3D ), a targeted replication of the plasma miRNA findings was conducted using an independent RNA separation procedure. Twelve miRNAs were re-analyzed in the current study and in three other independent studies including subjects with different GC exposures: ( i ) in 60 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis with and without tertiary adrenal insufficiency after a short-term stop in their GC treatment ( low vs. physiological GC exposure, respectively ) ( Borresen et al., 2017 ) ; ( ii ) in 20 subjects with Addison’s disease receiving HC replacement therapy and in 20 matched healthy control subjects ( low vs. physiological GC exposure, respectively ) ( Bergthorsdottir et al., 2017 ) ; and ( iii ) acute low, medium, and excessive GC exposure in 20 healthy subjects ( Stimson et al., 2017 ). From this analysis, miR-122-5p was significantly associated with different GC exposure in all studies ( Figure 7A– D )

. One exception was when short-term excessively high GC exposure was studied in afternoon samples in 20 subjects. There is no clear explanation for this, except the possibility that high non-physiological GC exposure has other secondary effects that may affect the levels of miR-122-5p. The network analysis also identified putative metabolomic markers of GC action. GCs have a key role in metabolic regulation of stress by mobilizing energy through glucose, protein, and lipid metabolism. Previous studies have found an association between different GC doses and levels of branched-chain amino acids, fatty acids, some acyl carnitines, and tryptophan and its metabolites ( Alwashih et al., 2017a; Sorgdrager et al., 2018 ). In our study, the amino acid tyrosine and the pyrimidine base uracil had a central position in the hypernetwork, which defined a group of highly connected multi-omic relationships within physiological GC exposure. Some of the other metabolomic data from our study was also in line with previous metabolomic studies in patients with adrenal insufficiency ( Alwashih et al., 2017b; Sorgdrager et al., 2018 ). Excessive exposure to GCs in healthy subjects has, on the other hand, shown a strong, immediately and long-lasting impact on numerous biological pathways in the metabolome that may be either direct or indirect through the metabolic and cardiovascular action of pharmacological doses of GCs ( Bordag et al., 2015 ). There are some study limitations that need to be acknowledged. The low number of subjects included in the clinical experimental study could have reduced the power to detect a putative marker in individual ‘omic data sets, but this limitation was compensated for by the crossover study design and the integration of multi-omic layers. Another limitation is that we have only studied markers collected in the morning during physiologically peak cortisol exposure

. The marked difference in serum and urinary cortisol and cortisone, and the similar serum electrolytes, glucose, body weight, and blood pressure between the two interventions support the experimental success of the study design and strongly indicate that confounders related to metabolic changes or other secondary events related to the GC exposure or GC withdrawal were not influencing the output of the study. The measurable but very low concentrations of serum cortisol and cortisone throughout the GC withdrawal may be explained by a residual adrenal steroid secretion in some subjects ( Gan et al., 2014; Sævik et al., 2020 ) and/or due to conversion of cortisone to cortisol in the liver and adipose tissue ( Stimson et al., 2014 ). Network models of ‘omic data can be used as a framework to assess the potential utility of biomarkers ( Stevens et al., 2014 ). In this study, we have used a hypernetwork model of GC action based on differential gene expression in PBMCs as a basis to integrate adipose tissue transcriptome, plasma miRNA, and serum metabolomic data. Hypernetwork analysis leverages the power inherent in large data sets to assess interactions between ‘omic elements in a manner that is robust to false positives ( Battiston et al., 2020 ). The associated interactome network derived from the PBMC transcriptome was shown to contain a number of genes with previously known GC-dependent binding of NR3C1 ( the GC receptor ) to regulatory elements, evidence that supports the specificity of the study design ( Davis et al., 2018; Casper et al., 2018 ). Gene ontology analysis of the PB transcriptome showed enrichment in biological processes related to stress response, immune response, and metabolism, which is in line with previous studies of GC effects on PBMCs ( Alwash et al. 2017a; Sdrager et al 2018 ). The PB transcriptome of adipose tissue was also enriched in biological processes related to stress, immune response, and metabolism which is in line with previous studies of GC effects on adipose tissue ( Alwash et al 2017b; Sdr et al 2018 ) The PB transcriptome of adipose was enriched in biological processes related to stress, immune response, and metabolism which is in line with previous studies of GC on adipose ( Al et al 2017; Sdr 2018 ) The PB transcript of adipose was enriched in biological processes related stress, immune, and metabolism which is in line with studies of GC on adip ( et 2017; 2018 ) The transcript of adipose was enriched biological processes related stress, immune, and metabolism which in line with studies of GC on adip (201;2018 ) The transcript adipose was enriched biological processes related stress, immune, and metabolism in line with studies of GC on (201;201 ) The transcript adip was enriched biological processes stress, immune, and metabolism in line with studies GC on (201 ) The transcript was enriched biological stress, immune, and metabolism in line with studies on (201 ) The transcript was biological stress, immune and metabolism in line with on (201 The transcript was biological stress, immune and in line on ( The transcript was biological immune and in on The transcript was biological in on The transcript was in The transcript was in The transcript in The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The transcript The

    Title: Dynamics of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids
    Abstract: Amino acids are essential activators of mTORC1 via a complex containing RAG GTPases, RAGULATOR and the vacuolar ATPase. Sensing of amino acids causes translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomes, an obligate step for activation. To examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of this translocation, we used live imaging of the mTORC1 component RAPTOR and a cell permeant fluorescent analogue of di-leucine methyl ester. Translocation to lysosomes is a transient event, occurring within 2 min of aa addition and peaking within 5 min. It is temporally coupled with fluorescent leucine appearance in lysosomes and is sustained in comparison to aa stimulation. Sestrin2 and the vacuolar ATPase are negative and positive regulators of mTORC1 activity in our experimental system. Of note, phosphorylation of canonical mTORC1 targets is delayed compared to lysosomal translocation suggesting a dynamic and transient passage of mTORC1 from the lysosomal surface before targetting its substrates elsewhere.

   . It will be important to understand the dynamics of this step, especially in view of the fast kinetics reported here. The data with the fluorescent analogue and with the di-leucine methyl ester argue that all of these steps can be bypassed completely as long as the activating moiety is delivered to functional lysosomes, in agreement with previous work ( Zoncu et al., 2011 ). For both the methyl ester and the fluorescent analogue we have looked but did not see any macropinocytosis activation ( our unpublished data ). Our work also revealed an apparent uncoupling between the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomes and the kinetics of mTORC1 target phosphorylation. In both HAP-1 cells edited to express endogenous RAPTOR-GFP and in HEK-293 cells stained for endogenous mTOR, phosphorylation of S6K and ULK1, major and direct mTORC1 targets, persisted long after translocation to the lysosomes had peaked and had returned to levels approaching the base line. This result implies that activated mTORC1 may exist in the cytosol, and not exclusively on the lysosomal surface. In line with this, a direct target of mTORC1 in this pathway, the protein 4EBP-1, was never detected to accumulate on lysosomes ( Figure 1; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). We have also provided data showing that RHEB, an essential protein for mTORC1 activation, was not concentrated on lysosomes under any conditions in these cells, being partially localised to the ER/Golgi endomembrane system ( Figure 1; Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). Even when the Golgi localization of RHEB was disrupted with BFA ( a treatment that had a very modest effect on mTORC1 activity ), very little of the protein co-localized with RAGC, a major mTORC1 regulator residing on lysosomes ( Figure 1; Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B )

We examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of mTOR activation and its kinetic dependence on amino acid presence. Pioneering work from several laboratories had already provided strong evidence that mTOR itself translocates to lysosomes during amino acid re-stimulation ( Sancak et al., 2008, 2010; Zoncu et al., 2011 ), but this work had relied exclusively on a single antibody that can stain the endogenous protein and it did not provide any information on the dynamics of the process. The RAPTOR-GFP edited cells that we used here provide a unique tool to address this question in a near-physiological setting. Although they are slightly less responsive to stimuli than the parental cells and require a more carefully assembled mixture of activators, they nevertheless show absolute reliance on amino acids for mTORC1 activation and RAPTOR translocation to lysosomes. Our work shows that translocation is a very fast and relatively transient event that peaks early and then returns to base line, whereas phosphorylation of substrates under identical conditions and measured in parallel continues for some time thereafter. We have also demonstrated for the first time that the presence of an amino acid analogue in the lysosomal lumen is sufficient to induce the translocation of RAPTOR-GFP there. This analogue, a methyl ester of di-leucine with a fluorescent moiety attached, produces a sustained translocation of the complex presumably owing to its property to continuously accumulate within the lysosomal lumen. All of these data provide for the first time a dynamic view of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids. Despite tremendous progress, the exact mechanism by which mTORC1 senses amino acids appears very complex and incomplete at present ( reviewed and commented on in: Goberdham et al, 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Shimobayashi and Hall, 2016 ). Clearly, several different sensors are involved ( sometimes for the same amino acid, e. g

. We did not observe binding under our conditions of RHEB, ULK1 and ATG13, the latter two being autophagy proteins downstream of mTORC1 signalling. In contrast, we saw differential binding of RAGA to the complex: the protein was present in fed conditions, greatly reduced in starved cells and then binding was again evident until 20 of re-stimulation only to drop again afterwards. This was seen very reproducibly and with two independent conditions of lysis ( Figure 5G, panels labelled RAGA and RAGA* ) and it provides further evidence that when mTORC1 activity is still very strong ( for example at 30 min of re-stimulation, see Figure 5A, C ) the interaction of mTOR with its known regulators is diminished. We also addressed directly the temporal aspect of RAPTOR-GFP translocation in response to amino acid stimulation. Among amino acids, leucine has a prominent role in mTORC1 activation, and it has also been reported that a leucine methyl ester that enters cells and accumulates in lysosomes can activate mTORC1 on its own ( Zoncu et al., 2011 ). Prompted by this, we tested a series of leucine analogues for mTORC1 activation ( Figure 6; Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B ). In our hands, a di-leucine methyl ester was a potent activator of mTORC1, much stronger that the single leucine methyl ester which was in turn much stronger than leucine itself ( Figure 6; Figure 6—figure supplement 1C ). Interestingly, a methyl ester of L-L-G was also a very strong activator of mTORC1 ( Figure 6; Figure 6—figure supplement 1C ). On this basis we synthesised a compound consisting of a double leucine followed by the Mant fluorophore, one of the smallest fluorescent molecules ( Figure 1; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, fluorescent analogue )

. All of this data in combination re-emphasise the importance of the lysosome as a key organelle involved in mTORC1 signalling but they provide some important modifications to the existing model. According to the current view lysosomes serve as platforms for the interaction between the mTORC1 complex ( translocated there via its interaction with the RAGs and the Ragulator ) and RHEB, leading to mTORC1 activation in situ. However, an alternative possibility is also worth considering in our view. It is possible that mTOR requires translocation to the lysosomal surface as part of the amino acid sensing function, but, subsequent to that, the complex comes off the membrane rapidly in order to phosphorylate its substrates. According to this model, the lysosomal surface may not be a terminal destination where activated mTOR resides but rather a platform that casts activated mTORC1 into the cytosol ( Figure 5; Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ). Having the activated complex free to move in the cytosol would be consistent with the fact that the known mTORC1 substrates, which number in the thousands, range from cytosolic to membrane-bound proteins, and to some with nuclear localization ( Hsu et al., 2011 ). This idea would also be consistent with the fact that very little visible RHEB resides on the lysosomes under any condition, and that the TSC2 localization on and off lysosomes is cell-type dependent and not always able to explain the dynamics of mTORC1 inactivation on the basis of TSC2 lysosomal localization ( Demetriades et al 2014; Menon et al, 2014; Fawal et al, 2015 )

. Interestingly, whereas lysotracker staining of lysosomes was completely eliminated by GPN in both cell types ( Figure 7D and F, top panels ) the fluorescent analogue still accumulated ( Figure 7D and F, bottom panels ). Of note, activation of mTORC1 in response to the fluorescent analogue was also sensitive to vacuolar ATPase inhibitors for HEK-293 cells ( Figure 6; Figure 6—figure supplement 1D ) and for HAP-1 RAPTOR-GFP cells ( Figure 7; Figure 7figure supplement 1 ) but not in HAP-1 cells ( Figure 7; 7figure 1 ).

    Title: Glycan modification of antigen alters its intracellular routing in dendritic cells, promoting priming of T cells
    Abstract: Antigen uptake by dendritic cells and intracellular routing of antigens to specific compartments is regulated by C-type lectin receptors that recognize glycan structures. We show that the modification of Ovalbumin ( OVA ) with the glycan-structure LewisX ( LeX ) re-directs OVA to the C-type lectin receptor MGL1. LeX-modification of OVA favored Th1 skewing of CD4+ T cells and enhanced cross-priming of CD8+ T cells. While cross-presentation of native OVA requires high antigen dose and TLR stimuli, LeX modification reduces the required amount 100-fold and obviates its dependence on TLR signaling. The OVA-LeX-induced enhancement of T cell cross-priming is MGL1-dependent as shown by reduced CD8+ effector T cell frequencies in MGL1-deficient mice. Moreover, MGL1-mediated cross-presentation of OVA-LeX neither required TAP-transporters nor Cathepsin-S and was still observed after prolonged intracellular storage of antigen in Rab11+LAMP1+ compartments. We conclude that controlled neo-glycosylation of antigens can crucially influence intracellular routing of antigens, the nature and strength of immune responses and should be considered for optimizing current vaccination strategies.

    We here demonstrate that the glycosylation-profile of antigens has a major influence on antigen uptake and intracellular compartmentalization, thereby affecting both antigen presentation and the type and strength of the induced immune response. Modification of the model-antigen OVA with LeX glycans directs OVA towards MGL1, skewing naive CD4+ T cell differentiation towards IFNγ-producing Th1 cells. Moreover, targeting OVA to MGL1 through the conjugation of LeX, substantially enhanced cross-presentation as revealed by the increased frequency of OVA-specific CD8+ effector T cells in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, MGL1-dependent cross-presentation occurred at low antigen dose and independently of TLR-signaling. Moreover, this cross-presentation pathway did not involve TAP-transporters and Cathepsin-S. MGL1 targeting involved antigen routing to a Rab11+LAMP1+ compartment in which antigen was present for prolonged periods. Previous studies on CLR-mediated antigen uptake and cross-presentation, in particular by the MR, demonstrated a clear requirement for a TLR ligand ( Kovacsovics-Bankowski and Rock, 1995; Burgdorf et al., 2008; Sancho et al., 2008; Segura et al., 2009 ). A common denominator in some of these studies is that the use of antibody–antigen conjugates could potentially induce a different signal than the natural ligand, due to binding to different part of the receptor or through co-engagement of Fc-receptors. The fact that the addition of LeX glycans to OVA obviates the need for TLR signals for the induction of cross-presentation and Th1 priming in vitro, may indicate that MGL1 signaling is involved in these processes. Some CLR, like DC-SIGN, Clec9A and Dectin-1 are known to induce signaling after triggering by their natural ligands ( Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis, 2009; Sancho et al., 2009 ). Till now, no signaling pathway has been described for MGL1

. DCs pulsed with a low dose of OVA-LeX ( 7. 5 μg/ml ) induced significant CD8+ T cell proliferation, whereas the same concentration of native OVA was hardly cross-presented ( Figure 4 ). Others have demonstrated that native OVA can only be cross-presented when a high dose was used ( 0. 5–1. 0 mg/ml ) and when accompanied with TLR-triggering ( Burgdorf et al., 2008; Segura et al., 2009 ). Although the glycan-modification was associated with increased antigen uptake and enhanced cross-presentation, it did not result in enhanced presentation of antigen on MHC-class II indicating that increased uptake of antigen is not per se a requirement to facilitate MHC class I and II presentation. Therefore, it is most likely that the CLR ( and thus the glycosylation of the antigen ) dictates how efficiently an antigen is cross-presented. Based on our study, MGL1 cross-presents antigen much more efficiently than the MR. The activity of the glycosylation machinery is subjected to subtle regulation and depends on the cell-type or activation status of the cell. Upon malignant transformation glycan profiles may change dramatically. LeX carbohydrate structures are described to be expressed in the brain ( Lieberoth et al., 2009 ), and can be de novo expressed on cancer stem cells ( Read et al., 2009 ) or pathogens, and the glycosylation pattern of in vivo accumulating antigens, being brain tissue, tumor tissue or pathogen structure, is crucial for directing specific CLR antigen uptake and cross-presentation ( Hittelet et al., 2003; Ohana-Malka et al., 2003 ). Although in our studies only two LeX glycans were conjugated to each OVA molecule, it cannot be ruled out that multivalent presentation of LeX, such as often observed on tumors or pathogens ( Bergman et al., 2004; Saeland and van, 2011 ), may alter avidity-induced MGL-1 signaling and antigen presentation, and induce an anti-inflammatory immune repertoire

. At this stage, we do not know whether high glycan valency further enhances or inhibits the MGL1-mediated ( cross- ) priming. The fact that pulsing of DCs with OVA-LeX resulted in improved cross-priming and Th1-skewing indicates that conjugation of these carbohydrates to tumor-antigens could be beneficial for the induction of potent anti-tumor responses. Therefore, the use of glycans for targeting CLR for anti-cancer immunotherapy could have several advantages. First, they mimic natural function of the receptors, inducing ‘natural’ signaling cascades in DCs. Furthermore, they are very small molecules, easy to use and relatively cheap to produce. Importantly, many glycans may be considered self-antigens, in contrast to recombinant antibodies that are often not completely of human origin. These properties make it possible to decorate any antigen of choice with glycans to target specific receptors. In conclusion, our studies indicate that the glycan composition of protein antigens is of fundamental importance in dictating the intracellular routing and Th-skewing, and should be considered as a major determinant in the design of therapeutic vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases.

. In conclusion, through glycan profiling we identified 23% mannose-rich glycans on native OVA that may facilitate MR binding. Addition of the glycan LeX, next to these mannose glycans, on cysteine residues ( two LeX moieties per molecule ), conveyed MGL1 specificity to OVA. We explored the potency of OVA-LeX to enhance T cell priming in vivo. Since DC are crucial for priming of naive T cells, we first established the presence of MGL on both splenic and bone marrow-derived DC ( spDCs and BM-DCs ) of C57BL/6 mice by staining with the anti-MGL antibody ER-MP23 ( Figure 2A ). Since the ER-MP23 antibody does not discriminate between the two murine MGL homologues MGL1 and MGL2, MGL1 expression in wild type ( WT ) CD11c+ DCs was confirmed using qRT-PCR ( Figure 2B ). Immunization of mice with OVA-LeX mixed with agonistic anti-CD40 antibodies resulted in the enhanced priming of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells as revealed from both higher numbers of OVA/H-2Kb tetramer binding CD8+ T cells and OVA-specific IFN-γ and TNF-producing CD8+ T cells than obtained with native OVA ( Figure 2C, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). Using MGL1KO mice, that lack MGL1 expression on DC ( Figure 2B ), we ascertained that MGL1 is the prime lectin involved in boosting the generation of antigen-specific effector T cells as upon immunization of these mice with LeX-conjugated OVA no enhanced frequencies of OVA-specific IFN-γ and TNFα-double-producing T cells were detected ( Figure 2D, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). In fact, the OVA-LeX immunized MGL1 KO mice displayed comparable numbers of effector T cells as WT mice immunized with native OVA. Together, these data show that the conjugation of two LeX glycans on OVA re-directs OVA to the CLR MGL1 and thereby enhances CD8+ T cell priming in vivo. 10. 7554/eLife. 11765. 005Figure 2.

    Title: Quorum sensing control of Type VI secretion factors restricts the proliferation of quorum-sensing mutants
    Abstract: Burkholderia thailandensis uses acyl-homoserine lactone-mediated quorum sensing systems to regulate hundreds of genes. Here we show that cell-cell contact-dependent type VI secretion ( T6S ) toxin-immunity systems are among those activated by quorum sensing in B. thailandensis. We also demonstrate that T6S is required to constrain proliferation of quorum sensing mutants in colony cocultures of a BtaR1 quorum-sensing signal receptor mutant and its parent. However, the BtaR1 mutant is not constrained by and outcompetes its parent in broth coculture, presumably because no cell contact occurs and there is a metabolic cost associated with quorum sensing gene activation. The increased fitness of the wild type over the BtaR1 mutant during agar surface growth is dependent on an intact T6SS-1 apparatus. Thus, quorum sensing activates B. thailandensis T6SS-1 growth inhibition and this control serves to police and constrain quorum-sensing mutants. This work defines a novel role for T6SSs in intraspecies mutant control.

   . Furthermore, we note that other types of toxin-antitoxin systems have been reported to be under control of other non-AHL-mediated quorum sensing systems, for example the E. coli mazEF encoded toxin-antitoxin genes are controlled by a linear pentapeptide quorum sensing signal ( Kolodkin-Gal et al., 2007 ). Under the conditions of our experiments the BtaR1-BtaI1 QS system carries with it a metabolic cost, which is evident in broth culture competition experiments and to a lesser extent in pure broth culture grow curves. The BtaR2-BtaI2 and BtaR3-BtaI3 QS systems do not appear to carry this large cost. We describe a mechanism by which wild-type populations can mitigate the cost of BtaR1-BtaI1 gene regulation by hindering the growth of QS mutants via regulation of cell-contact-dependent toxin and immunity proteins. This is a form of microbial policing; QS-proficient bacteria are outcompeted in populations of signal blind non-cooperators in the absence of the T6S cell-contact growth inhibition system. It is interesting that BtaR1 also promotes aggregation of cells under some conditions ( Chandler et al., 2009 ). One can imagine that this system brings cells into close proximity where they can resist infiltration by other strains and species while at the same time protect themselves against social deviant BtaR1 mutant bacteria ( Figure 4 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 14712. 008Figure 4. A policing model where QS control of T6S contact-dependent killing ( effector and immunity proteins ) enforces cooperation. ( A ) The bacterium on the left depicts a situation where QS co-regulates a public good with the T6SS-1 effector and immunity factors. Under these conditions, QS-proficient bacteria ( cooperators, shown as white cells ) limit the proliferation of a QS mutant ( potential cheater, black cell ) in a population. ( B ) In this situation, QS no longer co-regulates public good production with the T6SS-1 killing mechanism

We present evidence that QS control of T6SS-1-mediated toxicity and immunity genes allows QS competent members of B. thailandensis colonies to police against BtaR1- QS mutants. During planktonic growth in broth where T6SS-1 does not function due to limited cell contact, BtaR1- mutants have a substantial fitness advantage over wild-type cells, presumably because of the cost associated with BtaR1-dependent activities. Policing of social deviants in Myxococcus xanthus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported previously ( Manhes and Velicer, 2011; Sandoz et al., 2007 ). Here we describe a novel mechanism, for limiting quorum sensing mutant growth in bacterial groups. Several functions have been ascribed to T6S. B. thailandensis T6S-mediated killing is active against Proteobacteria species other than B. thailandensis and is thought to be important for interspecies competition ( Schwarz et al., 2010 ). T6Ss occur in many species of Proteobacteria where they can provide an advantage over competing species ( see Russell et al., 2014 for review ). We note that in other organisms including, Pectobacterium atrosepticum ( Liu et al., 2008 ), P. aeruginosa ( Lesic et al., 2009 ), Aeromonas hydrophila ( Khajanchi et al., 2009 ), Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ( Zhang et al., 2011 ), Chromobacterium violaceum ( Stauff and Bassler, 2011 ), Vibrio cholerae ( Zheng et al., 2010 ), Vibrio alginolyticus, ( Sheng et al., 2012 ), and Vibrio parahaemolyticus ( Wang et al., 2013 ), QS regulates genes for the T6S apparatus ( not the effector and immunity factors as we describe for B. thailandensis ). We suspect QS regulation of the T6S apparatus might play a role in policing QS mutants during polymicrobial competitions or in other scenarios where T6S might benefit the producing cell

. Expression of a toxin and its antitoxin results in a toxin-resistant producer cell, which can deliver toxins via the secretion apparatus via cell-cell contact to a sensitive cell thereby inhibiting growth of the sensitive cell ( Russell et al., 2014 ). We show that T6S provides wild-type B. thailandensis with an ability to constrain BtaR1 mutants in a contact-dependent manner. This supports the hypothesis that QS activation of toxin-immunity systems can serve as a policing mechanism to control QS mutants growing among QS competent wild-type cells. Our findings also reveal yet another role for T6S in bacteria. T6S has been shown to provide a competitive interspecies or interstrain advantage, and some T6Ss have been shown to play a role in bacterial virulence ( Schwarz et al., 2010; 2014 ). Here we describe intraspecific control of QS mutants. This provides a rationale for why T6S toxin and immunity genes might be under QS control.

Bacterial quorum sensing ( QS ) often controls factors that benefit cells in groups; it controls cooperative activities. A well-studied type of QS common to a number of Proteobacteria species is mediated by acyl-homoserine lactone ( AHL ) signals. AHLs are made by members of the LuxI family of signal synthases. The AHLs can diffuse in and out of cells. At sufficient cell densities, the AHLs accumulate to concentrations needed for expression of specific genes by binding signal receptors of the LuxR family of transcriptional regulators ( for reviews of QS see ( Fuqua et al., 1996 ) ). In some bacterial species, QS controls just a few genes and in others it controls hundreds of genes. Genes for production of secreted or excreted products are overrepresented in AHL quorum sensing regulons. These extracellular products have at least in some cases been shown to serve as public goods. Any member of a group can benefit from the public good regardless of whether that individual has contributed its share of the good ( West et al., 2006 ). There is a metabolic cost associated with QS and QS-activation of gene expression. QS control of public goods has been studied in some detail in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Because QS activates production of extracellular proteases, QS signal receptor mutants have a fitness advantage over the wild type when growth is on milk protein as the sole carbon and energy source ( Diggle et al., 2007; Sandoz et al., 2007 ). The receptor mutant fitness advantage presents a conundrum; how is QS-mediated cooperation preserved? QS itself can be considered a cooperative trait, the QS signal is a public good, and QS is susceptible to exploitation by QS mutant social cheats. In P. aeruginosa, three mechanisms of QS cheater restraint have been demonstrated. The first is a direct benefit-based strategy called metabolic constraint ( Schuster et al., 2013; Dandekar et al

To assess the fitness of the B. thailandensis QS mutants in competition with their parent, we cocultured the wild type with signal blind QS mutants. We used signal-blind mutants BtaR1-, BtaR2- or BtaR3- ( which each have mutations in the LuxR homolog genes btaR1, btaR2, or btaR3 ) because they cannot respond to signals made by QS-proficient bacteria in coculture. The starting inoculum was 99% wild type and 1% signal-blind mutant. Cocultures were transferred to fresh medium at 24 hr intervals as described in the Materials and methods ( there were about 12 doublings per day ), and at each interval the relative abundance of parent and mutant was determined. After 3 days in broth, the BtaR1- mutant showed an increase from 1% of the total population to 50% ( Figure 1A ). The BtaR2 and Bta3 mutants did not show such an increase. The Bta1 mutant did not outcompete the wild-type in broth culture ( Figure 1B ). In contrast, the Bta1 outcompeted the wild-type in agar culture ( Figure 1C ). The Bta2 and B3 mutants did not outcomp the wild in agar ( Figure 1 ). The Bta1 mutant did not outcomp the wild in agar ( Figure 1 ). The B2 and B3 mutants did not outcomp the wild in agar ( Figure 1 ). The B1 did not outcomp the wild in agar ( Figure 1 ).

    Title: Glutamatergic drive along the septo-temporal axis of hippocampus boosts prelimbic oscillations in the neonatal mouse
    Abstract: The long-range coupling within prefrontal-hippocampal networks that account for cognitive performance emerges early in life. The discontinuous hippocampal theta bursts have been proposed to drive the generation of neonatal prefrontal oscillations, yet the cellular substrate of these early interactions is still unresolved. Here, we selectively target optogenetic manipulation of glutamatergic projection neurons in the CA1 area of either dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus at neonatal age to elucidate their contribution to the emergence of prefrontal oscillatory entrainment. We show that despite stronger theta and ripples power in dorsal hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex is mainly coupled with intermediate/ventral hippocampus by phase-locking of neuronal firing via dense direct axonal projections. Theta band-confined activation by light of pyramidal neurons in intermediate/ventral but not dorsal CA1 that were transfected by in utero electroporation with high-efficiency channelrhodopsin boosts prefrontal oscillations. Our data causally elucidate the cellular origin of the long-range coupling in the developing brain.

   . We previously proposed that the hippocampal CA1 area drives the oscillatory entrainment of PFC at neonatal age ( Brockmann et al., 2011 ). Here, we developed a methodological approach to optically manipulate the neonatal HP along its septo-temporal axis. We provide causal evidence that theta frequency-specific activation of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of intermediate and ventral ( i/vHP ), but not of dorsal HP ( dHP ) elicits broad band oscillations in the PFC of neonatal mice via dense axonal projections.

., 2010; Sigurdsson et al., 2010; Eichenbaum, 2017 ). Depending on the phase of memory processing, the prefrontal-hippocampal coupling via oscillatory synchrony has been found to be either unidirectional from the HP to PFC or bidirectional ( Siapas et al., 2005; Hallock et al., 2016; Place et al., 2016 ). Both theta and gamma network oscillations contribute to the functional long-range coupling. The model of prefrontal-hippocampal communication has been initially built based on experimental evidence correlating the temporal organization of neuronal and network activity in the two brain areas. The time delay between spike trains and oscillatory phase or between oscillations enabled to propose that the information flows in one direction or the other via mono- or polysynaptic axonal projections. More recently, a direct causal assessment of the coupling became possible through optogenetic interrogation of neural circuits. In a seminal study, Spellman and colleagues used light-driven inhibition of axonal terminals for dissecting the directionality of interactions between PFC and HP during different phases of memory retrieval ( Spellman et al., 2015 ). We previously showed that at neonatal age, long before full maturation of memory and attentional abilities, discontinuous theta bursts in i/vHP are temporally correlated to the network oscillations in the PFC and time the prefrontal firing ( Brockmann et al., 2011; Hartung et al., 2016 ). Moreover, the temporal delay of 10–20 ms between prefrontal and hippocampal spike trains as well as the estimated directionality of information flow between the two areas suggested that hippocampal theta drives the oscillatory entrainment of the local circuits in the PFC. The present data directly prove this hypothesis, taking advantage of the recently developed protocol for optogenetic manipulation of neuronal networks at neonatal age ( Bitzenhofer et al., 2017a, 2017b )

., 2011; Khazipov et al., 2013 ). In limbic systems dedicated to mnemonic and executive abilities, the knowledge on the relevance of early network oscillations is even sparser. Few lesion studies, yet without selectivity for specific activity patterns, suggested that prefrontal-hippocampal communication during development might be necessary for the maturation of episodic memory ( Krüger et al., 2012 ). Temporal associations between the firing and synaptic discharges of individual neurons and network oscillations in different frequency bands gave first insights into the cellular substrate of coordinated activity in neonates. Whereas in sensory systems, endogenous activation of sensory periphery drives entrainment of local circuitry through gap junction coupling as well as glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission ( Dupont et al., 2006; Hanganu et al., 2006; Minlebaev et al., 2009 ), in developing prefrontal-hippocampal networks, the excitatory drive from the HP has been proposed to activate a complex layer- and frequency-specific interplay in the PFC ( Brockmann et al., 2011; Bitzenhofer and Hanganu-Opatz, 2014; Bitzenhofer et al., 2015 ). While most of this correlative evidence put forward the relevance of early oscillations beyond a simple epiphenomenal signature of developing networks, direct evidence for their causal contribution to circuit maturation is still missing. This is mainly due to the absence of a causal interrogation of developing networks, similarly to the investigations done in adult ones. Only recently the methodological difficulties related to area-, layer- and cell type-specific manipulations at neonatal age have been overcome ( Bitzenhofer et al., 2017a; Bitzenhofer et al., 2017b ). By these means, the local neuronal interplay generating beta-gamma oscillations in the PFC has been elucidated. However, the long-range coupling causing the activation of local prefrontal circuits is still unresolved

. The maturation of cognitive abilities is a process even more protracted than sensory development and starts during second-third postnatal week ( Hanganu-Opatz, 2010; Cirelli and Tononi, 2015 ). Some of these abilities, such as recognition memory, can be easily monitored at early age and seems to critically rely on structurally and functionally intact prefrontal-hippocampal networks ( Krüger et al., 2012 ). Direct assessment of the role of neonatal communication for memory performance as performed for adult circuits is impossible due to the temporal delay of the two processes. The alternative is to manipulate the activity of either PFC, HP or the connectivity between them during defined developmental time windows and monitor the juvenile and adult consequences at structural, functional and behavioral levels. The present data and optogenetic protocol represent the pre-requisite of this investigation, opening new perspectives for assessing the adult behavioral readout of long-range communication in the developing brain. One question that remains to be addressed is how the hippocampal theta drive shapes the maturation of prefrontal-hippocampal networks. Following the general rules of activity-dependent plasticity ( Hubel et al., 1977; Huberman et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2011; Yasuda et al., 2011 ), the precisely timed excitatory inputs from the i/vHP to the PL might facilitate the wiring of local prefrontal circuitry and enable the refinement of behaviorally relevant communication scaffold between the two regions. By these means, the prefrontal activity driven by projection neurons in the HP act as a template, having a pre-adaptive function that facilitates the tuning of circuits with regard to future conditions. This instructive role of theta activity for the prefrontal circuits needs to be proven by manipulation of temporal structure of the hippocampal drive without affecting the overall level of activity

. These findings give insights into the mechanisms underlying the early generation of activity patterns. It has been proposed that the differences in theta dynamics along the septo-temporal axis result from distinct innervation, on the one hand, and from specific intrinsic properties of hippocampal neurons, on the other hand. Cholinergic projections of different origin in the dHP and i/vHP ( Stewart and Fox, 1990; Amaral et al., 2007 ) as well as maturational differences in the intrinsic resonant properties of hippocampal neurons and notable gradients of parvalbumin immunoreactivity along the septo-temporal axis ( Honeycutt et al., 2016 ) may contribute to the observed differences. Quantification along the septo-temporal axis revealed that, similar to adults, the occurrence of SPWs was higher in the i/vHP and their amplitude was larger in the neonatal dHP ( Patel et al., 2013 ). It is still an issue of debate when exactly ripples emerge in the developing hippocampus, although it is obvious that they appear later than theta bursts and SPWs, most likely towards the end of the first and during second postnatal week ( Buhl and Buzsáki, 2005; Brockmann et al., 2011 ). Their underlying mechanisms at neonatal age remain also largely unknown and need to be related to age-dependent changes in gap junctional coupling and GABA switch ( Ben-Ari et al., 1989; Zhang et al., 1990; Yuste et al., 1995 ) as well as changes in glutamaterg and GABAergic transmission ( Dupont et al,2006; Hangan et al,2006; Minbaev et al,2009 ). In the present study, we selectively optogenetic manipulation of glutamaterg neurons in the CA1 area of either dHP or iHP at neonatal to elucidate their contribution to the emergence of prefront oscillations. We show that despite stronger theta and ripples in dHP the prefront is mainly coupled with iHP by phase-locking of neuronal firing via dense axonal projections. Theta-confined activation of pyramidal neurons in iHP but not dHP transfected with high-efficiency channelrhopsin boosts prefront oscillations Our data causally elucidate the origin of long-range coupling in the developing brain

The main findings of this study are as follows:

1. Optogenetic manipulation of glutamateric neurons in the CA1 area of either dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus at neonatal age elucidated their contribution to the emergence of prefrontal oscillations.
2. Despite stronger theta and ripples in dorsal hippocampus, prefrontal is mainly coupled with intermediate/ventral hippocampus by phase-lock of neuronal firing via dense axonal.

    Title: Methylation of RNA polymerase II non-consensus Lysine residues marks early transcription in mammalian cells
    Abstract: Dynamic post-translational modification of RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) coordinates the co-transcriptional recruitment of enzymatic complexes that regulate chromatin states and processing of nascent RNA. Extensive phosphorylation of serine residues at the largest RNAPII subunit occurs at its structurally-disordered C-terminal domain ( CTD ), which is composed of multiple heptapeptide repeats with consensus sequence Y1-S2-P3-T4-S5-P6-S7. Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation mark transcription initiation, whereas Serine-2 phosphorylation coincides with productive elongation. In vertebrates, the CTD has eight non-canonical substitutions of Serine-7 into Lysine-7, which can be acetylated ( K7ac ). Here, we describe mono- and di-methylation of CTD Lysine-7 residues ( K7me1 and K7me2 ). K7me1 and K7me2 are observed during the earliest transcription stages and precede or accompany Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation. In contrast, K7ac is associated with RNAPII elongation, Serine-2 phosphorylation and mRNA expression. We identify an unexpected balance between RNAPII K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters, which fine-tunes gene expression levels.

    Transcription of protein-coding genes is a complex process involving a sequence of RNA processing events that occur at different stages of the transcription cycle. Co-transcriptional recruitment of chromatin modifiers and RNA processing machinery is modulated through a complex array of post-translational modifications at the C-terminal domain ( CTD ) of RPB1, the largest subunit of RNAPII. This unique domain constitutes a docking platform for protein complexes that cap, splice and polyadenylate newly-made RNAs ( Bentley, 2014; Buratowski, 2009; Egloff et al., 2012; Eick and Geyer, 2013; Hsin and Manley, 2012 ). The CTD also integrates signaling cascades that, for example, coordinate the DNA damage response and chromatin remodeling with gene expression ( Munoz et al., 2009; Winsor et al., 2013 ). The CTD is a large, structurally disordered domain composed of a tandem heptapeptide repeat structure with the canonical sequence Y1-S2-P3-T4-S5-P6-S7. Extensive remodeling of the CTD occurs during distinct steps of the transcription cycle ( Buratowski, 2003, 2009 ). RNAPII binds to promoter regions in a hypophosphorylated state, before the CTD becomes phosphorylated at Serine-5 ( S5p ) and Serine-7 ( S7p ), marking the earliest stages of transcription ( Akhtar et al., 2009; Chapman et al., 2007; Tietjen et al., 2010 ). Productive elongation is characterized by an increase in phosphorylation of Serine-2 ( S2p ) throughout gene bodies, with the highest levels found around transcription end sites ( TES ). S5p is important for recruitment of the capping machinery, while S2p is involved in the recruitment of splicing and polyadenylation factors ( Corden, 2013; Ghosh et al., 2011; Gu et al., 2013; Lunde et al., 2010 )

The expansion of the RPB1 CTD in repeat number and amino acid diversity has been associated with increased complexity in specific groups of organisms, including vertebrates and plants ( Corden, 2013; Yang and Stiller, 2014 ). Larger CTDs are thought to accommodate larger protein complexes. Non-canonical CTD repeats have the potential to expand the diversity of post-translational modifications, resulting in more complex signaling through the CTD. Although there is increasing recognition that complex CTDs may have specific roles in the regulation of more complex developmental programs, gene structures or gene organization ( Litingtung et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2010; Simonti et al., 2015 ), our understanding of CTD signaling remains extremely limited, particularly as we have not yet identified all CTD modifications. A small number of modifications to non-canonical residues have been identified, and their importance for the expression of specific subgroups of genes revealed. In mammalian cells, methylation of a single CTD-R7 is involved in expression of snRNAs and snoRNAs ( Sims et al., 2011 ). Acetylation of CTD-K7 residues, the most common non-canonical substitution, has been associated with inducible gene expression of EGF-regulated genes ( Schroeder et al., 2013 ). In the present study, we show that CTD-K7 residues are mono- and di-methylated in mouse and human cells, and in the invertebrates C. elegans and D. melanogaster. Using murine cell lines with K7-to-S7 substitutions, we show that several CTD-K7 residues are simultaneously mono- and di-methylated, including a single K7 residue at repeat 35 of the murine CTD. Conservation of CTD-K7 methylation, and expansion of the number of methylated CTD-K7 residues from invertebrates to mammals, suggests functional relevance of this modification across taxa. Model systems characterized by K7 expansion ( e. g. Plasmodium parasites; Kishore et al

. To examine the effect of K7-to-S7 mutation on the subcellular localization of RPB1, we used confocal microscopy and YFP fluorescence to detect YFP-RPB1 fusion proteins and found that the typical RNAPII nucleoplasmic distribution is unaffected by K7-to-S7 mutations ( Figure 2c; e. g. Xie et al., 2006 ). Immunofluorescence using S5p antibodies also shows similar distribution and levels of S5p in 8K and 0K cells ( Figure 2c ). These observations show that mutation of CTD-K7 residues is compatible with viability of mouse fibroblasts, and suggest that global serine phosphorylation and RNAPII localization are independent of the presence or absence of K7 residues. Acetylation of CTD-K7 residues was recently identified and found associated with inducible gene expression ( Schroeder et al., 2013 ). Lysine acetylation has been extensively studied in the context of histone proteins, where it is often counter-balanced by methylation, with clear roles in regulation of gene expression and repression ( Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011; Wozniak and Strahl, 2014 ). To investigate whether K7 methylation could counteract K7 acetylation of RNAPII, we developed specific monoclonal antibodies using CTD peptides methylated on K7. With the aim of raising antibodies that could potentially detect methylation in several or all of the K7-containing CTD repeats, we chose the peptide sequence centered on the K7 residue in repeat 35 of the CTD ( Figure 3a ). This heptad has the most represented K7-repeat sequence ( YSPTSPK ), and is the K7 residue with most conserved distance to the C-terminal end of RPB1 in vertebrates and invertebrates ( Figure 1b ). Peptides modified by mono-, di- and tri-methylation of K7 residues were used for immunization. The supernatants of hybridoma clones were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) to test for specificity to CTD-K7 methylation ( Figure 3b )

. The vast majority of these genes are ( i ) positive for all three marks ( n = 6398; Figure 5b ), ( ii ) also marked by S5p, S7p, S2p and 8WG16 ( Figure 5c ), and ( iii ) transcriptionally active at the messenger RNA ( mRNA ) level ( Figure 5d ). As a further test of the specificity of K7me1 and K7me2 presence at productive RNAPII complexes, we evaluated their presence at polycomb repressed ( PRCr ) genes. This group of genes is associated with poised RNAPII complexes in mouse ES cells, which are characterized by an unusual CTD state phosphorylated at S5 but not at S7 or S2, and that does not lead to mRNA expression ( Brookes et al., 2012; Stock et al., 2007; Tee et al., 2014 ). Consistent with the specificity of K7me1 and K7me2 to expressed genes, we found that K7me1 and K7me2 do not mark poised RNAPII at PRCr genes marked by H3K27me3 and H2Aub1 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2a and 2b ) and that they are associated with promoters marked by H3K4me3 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2c ). To ascertain the distribution of the different CTD marks at promoters, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) with antibodies to S5, S7, S2, K7me1, Kme and Kac ( Figure 5— supplement 3 and 4 ). We found that K7me and Kme are associated with promoters of expressed genes, while S5 and S7 are associated with both expressed and unexpressed genes ( Figure 5— supplement 3 and 4 ). Kac is associated with expressed genes that are also marked by S2 ( Figure 5— supplement 3 and 4 ). These results indicate that K7 methylation and acetylation are mutually exclusive at promoters, with Kme and Kme associated with expressed genes and Kac with genes that are also marked by S2. The balance between K7 methylation and acetylation at promoters fine-tunes gene expression levels ( Figure 5— supplement 3 and 4 ).

    Title: Post-transcriptional regulation of satellite cell quiescence by TTP-mediated mRNA decay
    Abstract: Skeletal muscle satellite cells in their niche are quiescent and upon muscle injury, exit quiescence, proliferate to repair muscle tissue, and self-renew to replenish the satellite cell population. To understand the mechanisms involved in maintaining satellite cell quiescence, we identified gene transcripts that were differentially expressed during satellite cell activation following muscle injury. Transcripts encoding RNA binding proteins were among the most significantly changed and included the mRNA decay factor Tristetraprolin. Tristetraprolin promotes the decay of MyoD mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment, via binding to the MyoD mRNA 3′ untranslated region. Upon satellite cell activation, p38α/β MAPK phosphorylates MAPKAP2 and inactivates Tristetraprolin, stabilizing MyoD mRNA. Satellite cell specific knockdown of Tristetraprolin precociously activates satellite cells in vivo, enabling MyoD accumulation, differentiation and cell fusion into myofibers. Regulation of mRNAs by Tristetraprolin appears to function as one of several critical post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling satellite cell homeostasis.

   . Since MyoD up-regulates its own transcription, muscle injury would trigger a rapid feed-forward loop resulting in MyoD expression driving SCs to commit to myoblasts. Additionally, we propose that TTP may be involved in down regulation of MyoD mRNA and other TTP-target transcripts expressed by myoblasts, during the initial formation of a quiescent SC population or in reacquisition of quiescence following an injury. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 03390. 015 Gene chip analysis of SCs isolated from uninjured and injured skeletal muscle and gene chip analysis of quiescent SCs isolated following injection of p38α/β MAPK inhibitors, identified a cohort of transcripts rapidly down-regulated upon SC activation, prior to cell cycle entry ( Farina et al., 2012 ). Transcripts encoding proteins that directly regulate mRNAs, including mRNA binding proteins involved in skeletal muscle diseases were highly represented, supporting a critical role for post-transcriptional regulation of RNA in skeletal muscle homeostasis ( Farina et al., 2012 ). The involvement of p38α/β MAPK signaling in SC activation ( Jones et al., 2005 ), asymmetric SC division ( Troy et al., 2012 ) and loss of SC function during aging ( Bernet et al., 2014 ) identifies p38α/β MAPK targets as likely mediators of these cellular processes. Therefore, we focused on TTP, which is a p38α/β MAPK signaling target ( Stumpo et al., 2010 ) and was down-regulated to the greatest extent during SC activation. The Tis11/Zfp36 gene family is comprised of TTP and three related genes, of which TTP is the best characterized, containing a tandem zinc finger domain that binds AU rich sequences in the 3′ UTR of mRNAs and targets the mRNAs for sequestration or decay ( Brooks and Blackshear, 2013 ). Potential TTP mRNA targets in SCs would most likely include positive regulators of myogenic commitment

Skeletal muscle satellite cells ( SCs ) are maintained as a quiescent stem cell population ( Schultz, 1976 ) possessing minimal cytoplasm, condensed chromatin, and few ribosomes ( Wakayama et al., 1979 ). Upon muscle injury, SCs activate and then enter S-phase to generate a proliferating myoblast population that differentiates, repairs skeletal muscle tissue, and self-renews to replenish the stem cell pool ( Cornelison et al., 2001 ). Induction of MyoD, a myogenic regulatory transcription factor, is a critical component of this activation cascade. Prior to MyoD induction, and immediately upon satellite cell activation, the p38α/β MAPK pathway is activated, serving as a molecular switch ( Jones et al., 2005 ). In a subset of SCs, p38α/β is asymmetrically activated during cell division to promote SC self-renewal and re-acquisition of quiescence ( Troy et al., 2012 ). Moreover, aged SCs exhibit an intrinsic self-renewal deficit that arises in part from a failure to asymmetrically activate p38α/β MAPK ( Bernet et al., 2014 ). Importantly, post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms, including translational repression, contribute to SC activation and play a key role in the maintenance of the quiescent SC state ( Crist et al., 2012 ). TTP ( Tristetraprolin ), a target of the p38α/β MAPK pathway, binds to AU-rich elements within the 3′ untranslated region ( 3′ UTR ) of target transcripts and recruits deadenylases, initiating mRNA decay ( Lai et al., 2000 ). Rates of mRNA decay, which fluctuate depending on cellular conditions, are controlled by specialized mRNA binding proteins ( RBPs ) that bind target mRNAs and activate cellular mRNA decay enzymes ( Parker and Song, 2004 ). TTP is the best studied of the four member Tis11 gene family, which is comprised of the genes: Zfp36 ( TTP ), Zfp36l1, Zfp36l2 and Zfp36l3

SC homeostasis, the maintenance of quiescence and re-acquisition of quiescence following asymmetric or symmetric cell division is not fully understood. Relatively constant SC numbers are maintained in healthy adult mice prior to and following single or multiple induced muscle injuries ( Cornelison et al., 2004; Pisconti et al., 2010 ). Elegant experiments have established roles for maintenance of quiescence by microRNAs, where miR-489 represses Dek expression to maintain quiescence, miR-31 represses Myf-5 translation to maintain quiescence, and alternative polyadenylation regulates Pax3 ( Boutet et al., 2012; Cheung et al., 2012; Crist et al., 2012 ). Here, we propose that SC quiescence is actively maintained by mRNA decay, an additional post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism, via the Tis11 family of RNA binding proteins ( Figure 6 ). Together, these studies suggest that a host of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms maintain the quiescent state of skeletal muscle stem cells and represent an efficient and rapid method for tissue-specific stem cell responses. 10. 7554/eLife. 03390. 015Figure 6. Inhibition of TTP by p38α/β MAPK initiates a feed-forward circuit that commits SCs to the myogenic lineage. Muscle regeneration requires SCs to rapidly exit from quiescence but to also renew the quiescent SC population upon completion of regeneration. We propose that TTP suppresses transcripts for SC activation as a mechanism for immediate exit from quiescence. Upon muscle injury, p38α/β MAPK is rapidly activated resulting in phosphorylation of TTP. Phospho-TTP no longer suppresses activation-associated transcripts resulting in rapid induction and SC activation. One such activation-associated transcript targeted by TTP is MyoD, which is rapidly induced due to inactivation of TTP by p38α/β MAPK concurrent with increased MyoD mRNA stability mediated by HuR and transcriptional upregulation of the MyoD gene locus

. We observed concurrent downregulation of MyoD in the MK2i treated SCs, suggesting that TTP may play a role in p38α/β MAPK-mediated MyoD regulation. The rapid p38α/β MAPK-dependent phosphorylation ( inactivation ) of TTP upon SC activation suggests that TTP plays a role in maintaining SC quiescence. Furthermore, TTP inactivation preceding MyoD up-regulation is consistent with the hypothesis that TTP actively suppresses pro-myogenic mRNA targets. We therefore transfected myofiber-associated SCs with a constitutively active TTP mutant, TTPS52AS178A ( TTP-AA-myc ), to determine if direct manipulation of TTP influenced MyoD protein levels. TTP-AA-myc is unresponsive to p38α/β MAPK signaling, binds target transcripts, recruits mRNA decay factors, and reduces target mRNA stability ( Stoecklin et al., 2004 ). Myofiber-associated SCs transfected with either a control ( pcDNA3. 1 ) or a TTP-AA-myc expression plasmid immediately following explant were fixed and scored for Syndecan-4 and MyoD immunoreactivity after 30 hr in culture. The majority ( 70% ) of control transfected cells were MyoD immunoreactive ( Figure 3F, H ), while only 30% of the TTP-AA-myc transfected cells were MyoD immunoreactive ( Figure 3G, H ), demonstrating that TTP reduces myogenic commitment. Importantly, 15% of SCs were MyoD immunoreactive on a subset of myofibers removed immediately following transfection with T-AAyc ( Figure 3, I ), indicating that TTP suppresses myogenic commitment in myofibers.

    Title: Macrophage dysfunction initiates colitis during weaning of infant mice lacking the interleukin-10 receptor
    Abstract: Infants with defects in the interleukin 10 receptor ( IL10R ) develop very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. Whether IL10R regulates lamina propria macrophage function during infant development in mice and whether macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling is required to prevent colitis in infancy is unknown. Here we show that although signs of colitis are absent in IL10R-deficient mice during the first two weeks of life, intestinal inflammation and macrophage dysfunction begin during the third week of life, concomitant with weaning and accompanying diversification of the intestinal microbiota. However, IL10R did not directly regulate the microbial ecology during infant development. Interestingly, macrophage depletion with clodronate inhibited the development of colitis, while the absence of IL10R specifically on macrophages sensitized infant mice to the development of colitis. These results indicate that IL10R-mediated regulation of macrophage function during the early postnatal period is indispensable for preventing the development of murine colitis.

   . While the studies outlined above demonstrate the critical role of IL10R signaling within MΦs in preventing inflammatory responses in the large intestine, the colitis that develops spontaneously in mice that are completely-deficient in IL10R or that specifically lack IL10R within CX3CR1+ MΦs manifest with a prolonged latency of several weeks, and is strain- and microbiota-dependent ( Kang et al., 2008; Kühn et al., 1993; Spencer et al., 1998; Zigmond et al., 2014 ). Given that colitis in infants lacking functional IL10R is an aggressive disease that presents very early in life ( Glocker et al., 2009; Shouval et al., 2014a ), it is unclear whether the same cellular mechanisms observed in adult mice lacking IL10R are in fact operating within the time frame of infant development. Furthermore, it has not been determined whether specific developmental events during the post-partum period such as initial bacterial colonization at the time of birth, or the diversification of the infant microbiome that occurs at the time of weaning are influenced by the absence of IL10R and/or play catalytic roles in driving inflammation in the absence of IL10R. To address these issues, we performed detailed time-series experiments using IL10R-deficient infant mice and their littermate co-housed controls, and evaluated histology, inflammatory gene expression, cellular composition of the LP, and luminal bacterial communities from birth to 14 weeks of age. We used clodronate depletion to investigate the role of colonic MΦs in colonic inflammation that develops in infant IL10R-deficient mice. In addition, we analyzed the onset of colitis in crosses between C57BL/6 mice lacking IL10Rα specifically in MΦs and those carrying a genetic locus driving colitis susceptibility, Cdcs1, neither of which independently develop colitis

. Further, while resident P3/P4 MΦs typically exhibit an anti-inflammatory phenotype, RNA-seq analyses indicated that the anti-inflammatory phenotype of IL10R-deficient LP MΦs was compromised at the onset of inflammation, suggesting that altered MΦ phenotype had a causative role in initiating the inflammatory process. In contrast to a clear alteration in LP MΦ phenotype between 2 and 3 week old IL10R-deficient mice, significant alterations in effector T cell populations were not consistently observed. Consistent with a key role for MΦs, we found that clodronate-mediated depletion of MΦs inhibited colitis, and that the lack of IL10Rα specifically on MΦs led to the development of aggressive colitis in 3–4 week old C57BL/6 Cdcs1 congenic mice. Interestingly, while treatment with antibiotics suppressed inflammation in 3–4 week old mice lacking the IL10R, we found no evidence that IL10R regulated microbiota composition during infancy. These results strongly support a model in which IL10R signaling is required on MΦs to prevent a microbiota-driven inflammatory response that develops during the third week of infant life. Understanding the factors that drive this response, and delineating how IL10 inhibits this, could uncover essential pathways that regulate the development of intestinal inflammation in infants. A central question raised by this study is why colonic inflammation in IL10R-deficient mice is first detected in the third week of life. Certainly, one of the most obvious changes in this time frame is the transition from breast milk to solid food, with the concomitant introduction of complex dietary carbohydrates. Multiple aspects of physiology change at the time of weaning ( weaning transition ), including rapid expansion of the microbiota, alterations in intestinal metabolites ( Arrieta et al., 2014; Pantoja-Feliciano et al., 2013; Blacher et al., 2017; Torow et al

. Our data demonstrate that the requirement for macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling develops during a critical developmental transition, which has important implications for understanding factors that initiate colitis in infants with genetic deficiencies in IL10R signaling.

IBD including CD and UC typically present during adolescence and early adulthood. However, rare patients with causative single gene defects can present in infancy ( age <2 ), or at an age less than 6 years ( VEOIBD ) ( Uhlig et al., 2014 ). A prime example of this is IL10R deficiency which often presents in the first 2 years of life ( Shouval et al., 2014a; Glocker et al., 2011 ). However, because commonly used mouse models lacking IL10R signaling do not exhibit overt signs of colitis until adulthood, there is a paucity of information regarding requirements for IL10R signaling during infancy. Given the rapid developmental changes in intestinal physiology, immune system responsiveness, diet, and the microbiome that occur during the first weeks of life ( Arrieta et al., 2014; Pantoja-Feliciano et al., 2013 ), characterizing the function of IL10R signaling during this period could reveal fundamental regulatory processes that are essential to preventing IBD in infancy, and may aid our understanding of the pathological mechanisms driving IBD in general. To this end, we have provided a detailed analysis of the function of IL10R signaling during infant development using a series of genetically modified mice. Here we demonstrate that although there are no signs of inflammation within the intestine of IL10R-deficient mice less than 14 days of age, IL10R is required to prevent an intestinal inflammatory response that emerges during the third week of life. Consistent with previous work suggesting that IL10R signaling in MΦs prevents excessive lower bowel inflammation in various models ( Li et al., 2015; Shouval et al., 2014b; Zigmond et al., 2014 ), the onset of intestinal inflammation in 3 week old Il10rb-/- mice was associated with increased numbers of LP MΦs, as well as an inversion in the ratio of newly recruited P1/P2 MΦ populations and resident P3/P4 MΦs

., 2012 ) indicates the likely importance of direct pathogen recognition, including that of Helicobacter sp. and potential other colitis-triggering microbes, for the development of intestinal inflammation in the absence of IL10R signaling. The increase in microbial diversity observed at the weaning transition also coincides with the initiation of monocyte recruitment into the LP, and replacement of yolk sac-derived LP MΦs with monocyte-derived MΦs ( Bain et al., 2014 ). It is unclear whether inflammation in infant Il10rb-/- mice is driven by resident MΦs or the newly recruited monocyte-derived MΦs. The data from our clodronate experiments demonstrated that a phagocytic cell is responsible for driving inflammation in the infant IL10R-deficient mice but whether this is due to newly recruited monocyte/MΦs is an open question. Interestingly, while blocking monocyte recruitment by using a CCR2-neutralizing antibody ( MC21 ) inhibited DSS-induced colitis ( Zigmond et al., 2012 ), in a preliminary experiment we were unable to detect significant differences in the colonic expression of inflammatory genes including Il12b, Ifng, Tnf, and Il1b between isotype and MC21 antibody-treated 3 week old Il10rb-/- mice despite markedly decreased infiltration of Ly6C+ cells ( data not shown ). Consistent with this preliminary experiment, it has previously been demonstrated that genetic loss of CCR2 did not reverse colonic inflammation in IL10-deficient mice ( Hoshi et al., 2012 ). Notably, monocyte recruitment was not completely blocked in Il10-/-Ccr2-/- mice, suggesting that there might be alternate and potentially redundant mechanisms of monocyte recruitment ( Hoshi et al., 2012 ) in these models, and therefore the question of exactly which clodronate-sensitive monocyte/MΦ population drives inflammation in IL10/IL10R deficiency remains open

    Title: A tudor domain protein, SIMR-1, promotes siRNA production at piRNA-targeted mRNAs in C. elegans
    Abstract: piRNAs play a critical role in the regulation of transposons and other germline genes. In Caenorhabditis elegans, regulation of piRNA target genes is mediated by the mutator complex, which synthesizes high levels of siRNAs through the activity of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, the steps between mRNA recognition by the piRNA pathway and siRNA amplification by the mutator complex are unknown. Here, we identify the Tudor domain protein, SIMR-1, as acting downstream of piRNA production and upstream of mutator complex-dependent siRNA biogenesis. Interestingly, SIMR-1 also localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P granules and Mutator foci, two phase-separated condensates that are the sites of piRNA-dependent mRNA recognition and mutator complex-dependent siRNA amplification, respectively. Thus, our data suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates in organizing the piRNA pathway and promoting mRNA regulation by the mutator complex.

   . These discoveries have led to an intriguing model where the small RNA pathway is temporally and spatially organized into membrane-less organelles, with distinct steps of the silencing pathway occurring in neighboring condensates, while still allowing for trafficking of RNAs and perhaps some proteins between condensates. Here we identify a protein required to coordinate RNA silencing between the piRNA pathway in P granules and siRNA amplification in Mutator foci. Specifically, through proteomic analysis of MUT-16, we identified an uncharacterized Tudor domain protein, SIMR-1 ( siRNA-defective and mortal germline ). Unlike mut-16 mutants, simr-1 mutants are not defective in exogenous RNAi, but do have a transgenerational sterility phenotype at elevated temperature. Interestingly, while SIMR-1 is not required for production of piRNAs or the expression of PRG-1, simr-1 mutants fail to produce high levels of siRNAs from many piRNA-target loci. These data suggest that SIMR-1 may act at a step in between PRG-1 targeting and siRNA biogenesis by the mutator complex. Finally, we demonstrate that SIMR-1 localizes to perinuclear foci, adjacent to, but distinct from Mutator foci, P granules and Z granules, which we name SIMR foci. Therefore, this work identifies SIMR-1 as a factor that acts downstream of PRG-1 to mediate the production of secondary siRNAs by the mutator complex, and suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates to promote mRNA regulation by the piRNA pathway and mutator complex.

. elegans piRNA silencing pathway. Finally, SIMR-1 localizes to cytoplasmic foci near P granules, Z granules, and Mutator foci, implicating a series of distinct perinuclear condensates in the regulation of mRNAs by the piRNA pathway and mutator complex.

. While no localization has been determined for RDE-10 and RDE-11, RSD-6 localizes to foci near P granules that may be coincident with SIMR-1 foci. RDE-12 localizes to both RSD-6 foci and P granules, suggesting it can traverse the boundary between perinuclear condensates, and it has been proposed that RDE-12 may shuttle primary siRNA bound target mRNAs from P granules to RSD-6 foci to initiate mutator-dependent siRNA synthesis ( Yang et al., 2014 ). While loss of RDE-12 does not affect siRNAs mapping at piRNA target genes, there are 36 RDE-12 paralogs in C. elegans, several of which localize at or near P granules, including GLH-1, –2, −3, –4, DDX-19, LAF-1, MUT-14, and VBH-1 ( Supplementary file 1 ). One of these proteins could potentially serve a function similar to RDE-12, in the shuttling of piRNA-targeted mRNAs into SIMR-1 foci and ultimately to Mutator foci. In conclusion, numerous proteins have been identified in C. elegans that are required for piRNA transcription, trimming, and modification ( Kamminga et al., 2012; Montgomery et al., 2012; Billi et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2016; Weick et al., 2014; de Albuquerque et al., 2014; Kasper et al., 2014; Cordeiro Rodrigues et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2019 ), however, how mRNAs travel between the piRNA pathway, required for mRNA recognition, to the mutator pathway, necessary for siRNA production has remained a mystery. Here we demonstrate that the Tudor domain protein, SIMR-1, is required at a step between the piRNA pathway to the mutator complex. SIMR-1 may function similarly to how Krimper coordinates Ago3 and Aubergine during ping pong piRNA biogenesis in Drosophila ( Webster et al., 2015 ), but in this case bridging the gap between the primary and secondary phases of the C. elegans piRNA silencing pathway

., 2008; Wang and Reinke, 2008 ). Similar to what we observed with PGL-1, PRG-1 is localized adjacent to but not coincident with SIMR-1 foci ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1A ). Furthermore, SIMR-1 is not required for PRG-1 localization or expression, and PRG-1 is not required for SIMR-1 localization ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–C ). These data indicate that, while SIMR-1 and PRG-1 function in the same pathway to mediate siRNA biogenesis at piRNA target genes, they do not colocalize and are not required for one another’s localization or expression. Also identified in our MUT-16 and SIMR-1 immunoprecipitations was RSD-2, a previously characterized RNAi factor required for exogenous RNAi introduced in low doses and production of secondary siRNAs at target genes dependent on the ERGO-1 primary siRNA pathway. Because RSD-2 also forms foci in close proximity to Mutator foci ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ), we next generated a strain with fluorescently-tagged SIMR-1 and RSD-2. Following immunostaining, we observed that SIMR-1 and RSD-2 were highly coincident, suggesting SIMR-1 and RSD-2 may localize to the same perinuclear structure ( Figure 7A–B ). These results indicate that SIMR-1 and RSD-2 interact closely with one another at perinuclear foci near but distinct from Mutator foci, P granules and Z granules. Because these foci are distinct from previously characterized structures, we are calling them SIMR foci. Finally, to better understand the organization of these multiple perinuclear foci, we immunostained for SIMR-1, ZNFX-1, and PGL-1 together. Interestingly, we observed that the foci appeared to be stacked, with ZNFX-1 localizing between SIMR-1 and PGL-1 ( Figure 7C ). This result is reminiscent of the tripartite PZM granule ( P granule/Z granule/Mutator foci ) observed by Wan et al. ( 2018 ), except that we observe the Z granule flanked by SIMR foci and P granules, instead of Mutator foci and P granules

. While we have not yet identified the relevant protein-binding partners of the SIMR-1 Tudor domain, we hypothesize that they are likely members of the piRNA pathway or mutator complex and contain the RG repeat motif preferentially recognized by the Tudor domain. An obvious candidate is PRG-1 itself, as it contains a ‘GRGRGRG’ sequence near its N-terminus, however there are certainly other candidates and further experiments will be necessary to test this possibility. While we do not have direct evidence for a physical interaction between SIMR-1 and PRG-1, it is likely that SIMR-1 interacts with either PRG-1 or some other member of the piRNA pathway to promote the downstream regulation of piRNA target mRNAs by the mutator complex. Similarly, because SIMR-1 was initially identified in a MUT-16 immunoprecipitation, it may also interact directly with the mutator complex, even if transiently. It is therefore interesting that PRG-1, SIMR-1, and the mutator complex all localize to distinct sub-compartments of nuage ( Supplementary file 1 ). We have observed that Z granules localize between SIMR-1 foci and P granules, similar to the organization of Mutator foci, Z granules and P granules ( Wan et al., 2018 ). We have not been able to determine the relationship between SIM-1 foci and Mut foci, but it is possible that SIM-1 and Mut foci are part of the same perin condensate or SIM-1 foci are adjacent to Mut foci. In either case, our data suggest that SIM-1 and Mut foci are distinct from gran and Pules, which are sites of piRNA-dependent mRNA recognition and mutator-dependent siRNA amplification, respectively, and that SIM-1 and Mutoci are involved in the regulation of mRN by the pi pathway and mutator complex.

    Title: AMPA receptor mediated synaptic excitation drives state-dependent bursting in Purkinje neurons of zebrafish larvae
    Abstract: Purkinje neurons are central to cerebellar function and show membrane bistability when recorded in vitro or in vivo under anesthesia. The existence of bistability in vivo in awake animals is disputed. Here, by recording intracellularly from Purkinje neurons in unanesthetized larval zebrafish ( Danio rerio ), we unequivocally demonstrate bistability in these neurons. Tonic firing was seen in depolarized regimes and bursting at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. In addition, Purkinje neurons could switch from one state to another spontaneously or with current injection. While GABAAR or NMDAR were not required for bursting, activation of AMPARs by climbing fibers ( CFs ) was sufficient to trigger bursts. Further, by recording Purkinje neuron membrane potential intracellularly, and motor neuron spikes extracellularly, we show that initiation of motor neuron spiking is correlated with increased incidence of CF EPSPs and membrane depolarization. Developmentally, bistability was observed soon after Purkinje neuron specification and persists at least until late larval stages.

   ., 2014 ). We now show that functionally also, Purkinje neurons of zebrafish have shared and unique physiological properties in comparison to mammals. Unlike mammalian Purkinje neurons, zebrafish larval Purkinje neurons do not exhibit complex spikes. Instead, they show large amplitude all-or-none CF EPSPs and broad calcium spikes. In spite of such major differences, we also identified several similarities that have been evolutionarily conserved. Similar to mammalian neurons, spontaneous firing appears to be an intrinsic property of zebrafish Purkinje neurons as these neurons continue to fire at high rates even when fast synaptic transmission is blocked, as has been shown in rodent Purkinje neurons in cerebellar slices ( Häusser and Clark, 1997 ). Secondly, like in mammalian Purkinje neurons, two kinds of glutamatergic excitation are observed: strong excitation from CFs and weak excitation from PFs, both mediated by AMPA receptors ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ). Lastly, we demonstrated bistability in Purkinje neurons of zebrafish larvae. Though bistability in Purkinje neurons has been reported in vitro in amniotes ( Llinás and Sugimori, 1980; Oldfield et al., 2010 ) and in vivo under anesthesia in rodents ( Loewenstein et al., 2005; Schonewille et al., 2006 ), there has been disagreement on whether it occurs in vivo under ‘awake’ conditions ( Schonewille et al., 2006; Yartsev et al., 2009; Engbers et al., 2013 ). The zebrafish larval preparation allows us to perform intracellular recordings of membrane potential in the absence of anesthesia. Under these conditions, we observed membrane bistability and toggling between ‘up’ and ‘down’ states. Based on the conservation of other structural and functional properties of the cerebellum, it seems reasonable to conclude that bistability is a conserved feature of Purkinje neurons from fish to mammals

. Our experiments indicate that in vivo, Purkinje neurons can be found either in the tonic or bursting mode and that they spontaneously toggle from one mode to another. When Purkinje neurons are in the ‘down’ state, strong AMPAR-mediated excitation from the CFs is sufficient to trigger bursts. In zebrafish, GABAergic inhibition or NMDAR-dependent excitation seem not to be critical for generating bursts. Both a hyperpolarized membrane potential and AMPAR-mediated CF-activation were required for triggering bursts, suggesting that CF-EPSPs activate voltage-dependent conductances in the Purkinje neuron to trigger bursts. Further experiments are needed to tease out the ionic basis of the bursts triggered by CF-EPSPs. We report here that the three elements of spontaneous activity in zebrafish Purkinje neurons, namely, sodium spikes, calcium spikes and CF-EPSPs are all present within a day after they differentiate ( Figure 9 ). These three properties seem to persist at least until late larval stages. Further, bistability also appears soon after Purkinje neuron specification and persists at least until 19 dpf, indicating that Purkinje neuron electrical properties mature rapidly. However, fewer CF EPSCs were seen at 19 dpf compared to 4 dpf. While this could reflect a developmental decrease in the firing rates of olivary neurons, there may also be a gradual maturation of CF inputs from many relatively weaker inputs at 4 dpf to few strong inputs at 19 dpf. In adult vertebrates, each Purkinje neuron is innervated by a single CF. Analogous to the neuromuscular junction, CF to Purkinje neuron synapses progress from polyinnervation to single innervation through a process of synapse elimination. In rodents, this process occurs during the first two weeks of post-natal life ( Hashimoto and Kano, 2005 )

We have recorded from Purkinje neurons of larval zebrafish from 4 dpf to 19 dpf. This preparation allows us to study intracellular membrane potential dynamics of Purkinje neurons in vivo in the context of fictive motor output. However, because it is a larval animal, it is possible that the bistability that we observe is the property of a developing network and that it may not be present in the mature cerebellum of the adult. Nevertheless, other factors suggest that the cerebellum is functionally mature at least by 7 dpf and that the bistability observed is integral to this function. Purkinje neurons are born at ∼3 dpf ( Bae et al., 2009; Hamling et al., 2015 ) and are electrically active at the earliest stage we recorded from, that is, 4 dpf. The cerebellar layers and synaptic contacts onto Purkinje neurons are observed as early as 5 dpf ( Bae et al., 2009 ). Calcium imaging in 6–7 dpf larvae has revealed Purkinje neurons to be active during optomotor and optokinetic responses ( Ahrens et al., 2012; Matsui et al., 2014 ). Optogenetic silencing of Purkinje neurons interfered with optomotor and optokinetic responses in larval zebrafish of this age ( Matsui et al., 2014 ). The cerebellum has been shown to be involved in associative learning in adult vertebrates such as goldfish, rodents, rabbits and non-human primates ( Thompson and Steinmetz, 2009; Gómez et al., 2010 ). Ablation of the entire CCe in 6–8 dpf zebrafish larvae resulted in deficits in associative learning in a classical conditioning paradigm ( Aizenberg and Schuman, 2011 ). These studies provide support to the idea that the functioning of the larval cerebellum is analogous to its function in the adult and that the activity patterns we recorded are functionally relevant in the larva and in the adult

Cerebellar Purkinje neurons have long fascinated neuroscientists due to their elaborate dendritic arbors ( Ramón y Cajal, 1911 ), and their high rates of spontaneous activity in vitro ( Llinás and Sugimori, 1980; Raman and Bean, 1999; Han and Bell, 2003 ) and in vivo ( Armstrong et al., 1979; Kitamura and Häusser, 2011 ). Being the sole output neuron of the cerebellar cortex, the firing patterns of Purkinje neurons are functionally significant for motor co-ordination and motor learning ( Thach, 1968; Medina, 2011; Yang and Lisberger, 2014; Hewitt et al., 2015 ). In addition, mammalian Purkinje neurons exhibit membrane bistability in vitro ( Llinás and Sugimori, 1980; Oldfield et al., 2010 ) and in vivo under anesthesia ( Loewenstein et al., 2005; Schonewille et al., 2006 ), transitioning between ‘up’ and ‘down’ states. The existence of bistability in Purkinje neurons of awake animals has been the subject of some debate ( Schonewille et al., 2006; Yartsev et al., 2009; Engbers et al., 2013 ) not least because of the difficulty of obtaining intracellular recordings from Purkinje neurons of awake animals. Zebrafish are a convenient model system for studying the intracellular dynamics of Purkinje neurons using whole-cell patch clamp recording in vivo in the context of simple motor behaviors. The zebrafish cerebellum has three major parts namely, the corpus cerebelli ( CCe ), the valvula cerebelli ( Va ) and the vestibulo lateral lobe which is subdivided into eminentia granularis and lobus caudalis cerebelli ( Bae et al., 2009; Hibi and Shimizu, 2013 ). Purje neurons are found in all three parts of the zebish cerebellum ( Bae et al,2009; Hibi and Shimizu 2013 ). In this study, we focus on the Purje of the cerebellum, the largest part of the zebish cerebellum. Purje of the cerebell have been shown to be involved in motor learning in larval zebish ( Aizen and Schuman,2011 ) and adult zebish (Thompson and Steinz,2009; Gmez et al,2010 ). Purje of the cerebell have also been implicated in optomotor and optokin responses in larval zebish (Ahrens et al,2012; Matsui et al,2014 ). Purje of cerebell are born ∼3 dp ( B et al,2009; Ham et al,2015 ) and are electrically active at earliest we recorded, that is 4 dp. Purje of cere are innervated by climbing fibers (CFs ) and parallel fibers (PFs ). CFs are glutamatergic and PFs are GABAergic. Purje of cere have been shown to fire at high rates in vitro (lin and Sugori,1980; Raman and Bean,1999; Han and Bell,200 ) and in vivo ( Armstrong et al,1979; Kit and Häser,201 ). Purje of cere exhibit bistability in vitro (lin and Sugori,198; Old et al,201 ) and in vivo under anesthesia ( Loew et al,200; Schew et,2006 ). However, bistability in Purje of awake animals has been disputed ( Schew et,200; Yse et,2009; Eng et,201 ) due to difficulty obtaining intracellular recordings from Purje of awake animals.

    Title: Principles of self-organization and load adaptation by the actin cytoskeleton during clathrin-mediated endocytosis
    Abstract: Force generation by actin assembly shapes cellular membranes. An experimentally constrained multiscale model shows that a minimal branched actin network is sufficient to internalize endocytic pits against membrane tension. Around 200 activated Arp2/3 complexes are required for robust internalization. A newly developed molecule-counting method determined that ~200 Arp2/3 complexes assemble at sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells. Simulations predict that actin self-organizes into a radial branched array with growing ends oriented toward the base of the pit. Long actin filaments bend between attachment sites in the coat and the base of the pit. Elastic energy stored in bent filaments, whose presence was confirmed by cryo-electron tomography, contributes to endocytic internalization. Elevated membrane tension directs more growing filaments toward the base of the pit, increasing actin nucleation and bending for increased force production. Thus, spatially constrained actin filament assembly utilizes an adaptive mechanism enabling endocytosis under varying physical constraints.

    Supporting Text:
    Understanding the relationship between actin filament assembly, actin network organization, and force generation on the plasma membrane requires iterative feedback between experimental measurements and computational modeling. An ultimate goal of this study was to relate single actin filament mechanics to force generation by the collective actin filament network in CME ( Lacayo et al., 2007 ). We integrated modeling and quantitative cellular measurements to show that a minimal actin network composed of actin, the Arp2/3 complex and capping protein, with linker attachments in the clathrin coat and rates constrained by cellular and biochemical measurements, is able to generate sufficient force to internalize endocytic pits against mammalian plasma membrane tension. Approximately 200 Arp2/3 complexes constitutively assemble at sites of endocytosis in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Endocytic actin filaments self-organize into a radial dendritic array, in which filaments grow toward the base of the pit. These filaments bend and store elastic energy, which supports internalization. The endocytic actin network adapts to changes in membrane tension by driving more filaments to the base of the pit and increasing filament bending, which supports a higher load and nucleates more actin filaments. Four lines of experimental evidence support our model ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 ). Two pieces of evidence serve as model validation based on published data and two more are based on experiments conducted in this study. Previous experiments from our lab showed that knocking down Hip1R in HeLa cells inhibited endocytosis ( Engqvist-Goldstein et al., 2004 ). Consistent with these observations, our simulations showed that a threshold number of actin linkers such as Hip1R is necessary for endocytic internalization ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3A and Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–B )

. Our results show that a minimal branched actin network is sufficient to create sustained internalization of an endocytic pit against physiological membrane tension. Actin filament self-organization and bending, which arise from the spatial distribution of actin-coat attachments around the curved endocytic pit, allow the actin network to adapt to changing loads. We anticipate that the mechanistic insights gained for actin in mammalian endocytosis will also apply to a variety of local membrane-bending processes carried out by branched actin throughout the cell.

. Having established that endocytic internalization depends on two spatially confined boundary conditions -- Hip1R/actin attachments at the curved pit ( Figure 4 ) and active Arp2/3 complex activity at the base of the pit ( Figure 6 ) -- we next investigated how these boundary conditions alter the endocytic response to membrane tension ( Figure 8A ). We systematically varied membrane tension and Arp2/3 complex activity in our model to generate a phase diagram of endocytic internalization as a function of membrane tension and Arp2/3 complex activity ( Figure 8B ). This phase diagram shows that cells with high membrane tension are especially sensitive to changes in Arp2/3 complex nucleation rate ( Kaplan et al., in preparation ), whereas cells with low membrane tension carry out endocytosis even with low Arp2/3 complex activity, consistent with experimental observations ( Boulant et al., 2011 ). We hypothesized that actin network self-organization arising from the broad Hip1R distribution around the pit ( Figure 4 ) and filament bending ( Figure 5 ) might allow for the endocytic actin network to change its organization and force-producing capacity under elevated loads ( Figure 7 ). To test this hypothesis, we conducted simulations in which Hip1R coverage was varied for different values of plasma membrane tension ( Figure 8A and Figure 7—video 1 ). We found that the endocytic actin network’s ability to adapt to load ( Figure 7 ) depends on Hip1R coverage around the pit ( Figure 8D–F ). As the coverage of Hip1R around the pit increased, actin’s ability to adapt to changes in membrane tension also increased, as measured by the number of barbed ends near the base of the pit ( Figure 8D ), the binding of active Arp2/3 complex at the base of the pit ( Figure 8E ), subsequent nucleation of additional actin filaments ( Figure 8F ), and bending of actin filaments near the base of the pit ( Figure 8G )

. Importantly, this direct scaling between resistance to internalization and membrane tension allowed us to treat this step of endocytic pit internalization as a linear spring, with the spring constant calibrated using measurements of plasma membrane tension in mammalian cells ( Diz-Muñoz et al., 2016; Kaplan et al., in preparation ). The simple spring-like relationship uncovered above between force and endocytic pit internalization ( Figure 1D ) allowed us to simplify our mechanical treatment of the plasma membrane while modeling individual actin filaments and actin-binding proteins with realistic kinetics and mechanics ( Figure 1E–G, Supplementary file 3 ). We used Cytosim ( Nedelec and Foethke, 2007 ) to construct a filament-based model of the endocytic actin network. This agent-based model allowed us to simulate the emergent architecture and mechanical functions of branched actin for realistic endocytic geometries. We simplified the endocytic pit as a solid, impermeable structure, initially a hemisphere, attached to a flat plasma membrane corresponding to the ‘U-shaped’ intermediate ( Avinoam et al., 2015; Boulant et al., 2011; Messa et al., 2014; Yarar et al., 2005; Figure 1E ). The following rules were prescribed for actin filament dynamics. Initially, actin filament-nucleating proteins seed a small number of actin filaments near the endocytic pit. These randomly-oriented ‘mother filaments’ serve as templates for binding pre-activated Arp2/3 complexes, which correspond to the coincidence of Arp2/3 complex and its activator N-WASP, arranged in a ring ( Almeida-Souza et al., 2018; Mund et al., 2018 ) at the base of the endocytic pit ( Idrissi et al., 2008; Kaksonen et al., 2003; Picco et al., 2015; Kaplan et al., in preparation ). When an active Arp2/3 complex comes in proximity with an actin filament, it can bind to the filament and nucleate the growth of a new branched filament at an ~77° angle ( Blanchoin et al

., 2017; Rangamani et al., 2014; Walani et al., 2014 ) we next varied the value of membrane tension in simulations to understand the relationship between tension, actin filament bending, and actin assembly ( Figure 7A ). In our simulations, endocytic progression attenuated in a tension-dependent manner ( Figure 7A–E ), consistent with previous modeling ( Hassinger et al., 2017 ) and experimental observations ( Boulant et al., 2011; Ferguson et al., 2017; Ferguson et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2017 ). However, at higher membrane tensions, endocytosis persisted better than expected for a non-adapting network, suggesting the existence of an adaptive mechanism ( Figure 7E ). Therefore, we sought to understand how endocytic actin networks adapt to increases in load. We found that under low tension ( 0. 015 pN/nm ), endocytic pits internalize strongly ( Figure 7B and E ) and few barbed ends encounter the base of the pit ( Figure 7F ), with fewer Arp2/3 complexes recruited to the network ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1A ) and a correspondingly low filament bending energy ( Figure 7H ). Under >50 x higher membrane tension ( 1 pN/n ), endytic pits internalize poorly ( Figure 7B and E ) and more barbed ends encounter the base of the pit ( Figure 7 ) with more Ar2/3 recruited to the network ( Figure 7— supplement A ) and higher filament bending ( Figure 7 ).

    Title: A plasma membrane template for macropinocytic cups
    Abstract: Macropinocytosis is a fundamental mechanism that allows cells to take up extracellular liquid into large vesicles. It critically depends on the formation of a ring of protrusive actin beneath the plasma membrane, which develops into the macropinocytic cup. We show that macropinocytic cups in Dictyostelium are organised around coincident intense patches of PIP3, active Ras and active Rac. These signalling patches are invariably associated with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery, as are all examined structures based on PIP3 patches, including phagocytic cups and basal waves. Patch formation does not depend on the enclosing F-actin ring, and patches become enlarged when the RasGAP NF1 is mutated, showing that Ras plays an instructive role. New macropinocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones. We propose that cup-shaped plasma membrane structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP3, which recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery.

   ., 2013; Zhou et al., 1998 ). In macrophages, which often evolve macropinocytic cups from linear ruffles, it has been suggested that ruffle circularisation creates a diffusion barrier in the membrane leading to intensified PIP3 signalling and a domain of PIP3 in the centre of the circular ruffle ( Welliver et al., 2011 ). This domain then drives the further progression of the macropinocytic cup. In axenic strains of Dictyostelium, which grow efficiently in liquid medium, macropinocytosis is massively up-regulated due to mutation of the RasGAP neurofibromatosis-1 ( NF1 ) ( Bloomfield et al., 2015; Hacker et al., 1997; Kayman and Clarke, 1983 ). These strains are thus an excellent starting point for research into the organising principles behind macropinocytic cup formation. Here we examine macropinocytosis with unprecedented 3D detail using lattice light sheet microscopy, and map the spatial and temporal control of actin regulators such as SCAR and WASP with respect to signalling molecules including PIP3 and active Ras. This leads us to propose a new and general hypothesis for the formation of cups from the plasma membrane.

Macropinosomes develop from cup-shaped projections of the plasma membrane, whose walls are driven outwards by actin polymerization. They contain a central patch of activated Ras and PIP3 throughout their life and we find that in Dictyostelium, this patch is invariably associated with a ring of active SCAR at its edge. We propose that this ring of active SCAR is recruited by the signalling patch and drives a hollow ring of F-actin to extend the walls of the macropinocytic cup. A possible alternative mechanism comes from immune cells, which make abundant linear ruffles. These occasionally fold back to form circular ruffles, which have been described as diffusion traps that can intensify signalling within them, leading to the formation of a patch of active Ras and PIP3, ( Welliver et al., 2011 ). In this model, PIP3 patches form as a consequence of circular ruffle formation, rather than as a cause of it. Despite the evidence that sharply curved membrane areas such as those present at the leading edge of lamellipods can act as a diffusion barrier ( Weisswange et al., 2005 ), this idea does not easily extend to Dictyostelium, where linear ruffles are much less common, and the central PIP3 patch of macropinocytic cups can still form when ruffle formation is inhibited. However it remains possible that a diffusion barrier forms by a ruffle-independent mechanism, for example by septin-like molecules ( Golebiewska et al., 2011 ), or perhaps by cross-linking components within the patch. Further, Dictyostelium patches become larger when Ras signalling is increased by NF1 inactivation, showing that Ras plays an instructive part in their formation. PIP3 patches are coincident with patches of activated Ras, which presumably support them by activating PI3-kinase, and also of activated Rac. Previous work suggest that patches are self-organising structures, which can form independently of input from G-protein coupled receptors ( Sasaki et al

To determine whether macropinosomes form in Dictyostelium by circularization of linear ruffles, as reported for macrophages ( Welliver and Swanson, 2012 ), we used lattice light sheet microscopy ( Chen et al., 2014 ), which allows unparalleled high-resolution imaging of light-sensitive and dynamic cells over prolonged periods. In axenic cells expressing an F-actin reporter, three types of large F-actin structure are routinely detected: macropinocytic cups, which predominate, pseudopods and basal waves. 3D movies show that the majority of macropinocytic cups initiate by splitting of existing ones ( 62%; n = 152, Figure 1E ). Splitting occurs by a variety of routes, including: simple division in the middle; detachment of a small ruffle that grows into a new macropinocytic cup ( Figure 1A, Video 1 ) ; and abortive fragmentation of a parental macropinocytic cup into multiple daughter cups. We examined a reporter for active Rac in some of these movies and found that it is spatiotemporally associated tightly with F-actin in this morphological process ( Figure 1B, Video 2 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 20085. 003Figure 1.

., 1975 ). However, macropinosomes take up fluid and so cannot use a particle as a template in this way. Nor is there any known equivalent in macropinocytosis of the coat that organises clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Thus it appears that macropinocytic cups must form by a self-organizing process within the actin polymerization machinery and its regulators. The dynamic actin that polymerises around macropinocytic cups is probably initiated by a number of nucleators, including both formins, such as ForG, which is needed for the basal part of phagocytic cups in Dictyostelium ( Junemann et al., 2016 ), and the Arp2/3 complex ( Insall et al., 2001 ), which produces dendritic structures ( Pollard and Borisy, 2003 ), like the actin that drives pseudopods. Assembly of Arp2/3 based actin is controlled by the WASP family of nucleation promoting factors; the two family members that act at the plasma membrane are WASP and SCAR/WAVE ( hereafter called SCAR ). WASP is important for actin polymerisation during clathrin-mediated endocytosis ( Taylor et al., 2011 ), and SCAR, acting in a five-membered complex ( Eden et al., 2002 ), for the formation of pseudopods ( Seastone et al., 2001; Veltman et al., 2012 ). It is not known which is responsible for macropinocytosis. Ras and phosphoinositide signalling help organize the cytoskeleton for macropinocytosis and phagocytosis ( Bar-Sagi and Feramisco, 1986; Bloomfield and Kay, 2016; Bohdanowicz and Grinstein, 2013; Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1997; Swanson, 2014 ). There is evidence that Ras activity stimulates macropinocytosis in both mammalian and Dictyostelium cells, and macropinocytic cups are associated with an intense domain, or ‘patch’, of PIP3 ( Araki et al., 2007; Parent et al., 1998; Yoshida et al., 2009 ), which is essential for their function ( Araki et al., 1996; Buczynski et al., 1997; Hoeller et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 1998 )

    Title: Structural evidence for Scc4-dependent localization of cohesin loading
    Abstract: The cohesin ring holds newly replicated sister chromatids together until their separation at anaphase. Initiation of sister chromatid cohesion depends on a separate complex, Scc2NIPBL/Scc4Mau2 ( Scc2/4 ), which loads cohesin onto DNA and determines its localization across the genome. Proper cohesin loading is essential for cell division, and partial defects cause chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcriptional regulation, leading to severe developmental defects in multicellular organisms. We present here a crystal structure showing the interaction between Scc2 and Scc4. Scc4 is a TPR array that envelops an extended Scc2 peptide. Using budding yeast, we demonstrate that a conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is required to recruit Scc2/4 to centromeres and to build pericentromeric cohesion. These findings reveal the role of Scc4 in determining the localization of cohesin loading and establish a molecular basis for Scc2/4 recruitment to centromeres.

    Supporting Text:
    Cohesin targeting to specific genomic locations is required in all species for robust centromeric cohesion and for tissue-specific transcriptional programs in multicellular organisms ( Kawauchi et al., 2009; Fay et al., 2011 ). DNA sequences per se do not drive cohesin loading ( Onn and Koshland, 2011; Murayama and Uhlmann, 2013 ). Instead, targeting likely depends on interactions between the loading complex and chromatin-associated factors. We have determined the structure of Scc4 bound to a minimal fragment of Scc2, and we have used this structure to derive separation of function alleles that uncouple cohesin loading from cohesin targeting to centromeres. These experiments demonstrate that cohesin targeting in yeast depends on Scc4. This finding is consistent with unpublished genetic evidence for an Scc4-dependent cohesin localization pathway ( Nasmyth, personal communication ). Because the pathway that targets cohesin to centromeres requires Scc4 residues that are, in some cases, invariant across diverse eukaryotes, we suggest that the Scc4-dependent cohesin targeting we describe is a general feature of the control of cohesin loading. Consistent with previous reports ( Fernius et al., 2013; Natsume et al., 2013 ), we find that the centromeric enrichment of cohesin loading is not essential for viability and that arm cohesion is unaffected in strains in which this pathway is compromised. These results probably reflect two modes for cohesin loading: one that depends on a conserved patch of Scc4 and happens at centromeres, and a second opportunistic mode that happens everywhere on the chromosome and is sufficient to support viability in the absence of the first mode. If so, Scc4-conserved patch mutations would not eliminate cohesin loading but would redistribute loading events, resulting in similar cohesin levels at centromeres and on chromosome arms

Tight association between sister chromatids is crucial for successful chromosome segregation in eukaryotic cell division. Cohesin, a ring-shaped protein complex that wraps around sister chromatids ( Gruber et al., 2003; Haering et al., 2008 ) is the molecular agent of sister chromatid cohesion, which persists from the time of DNA replication until anaphase. A distinct protein complex containing Scc2NIPBL and Scc4Mau2 ( Scc2/4 ) initiates linkage of cohesin with DNA ( Ciosk et al., 2000 ), and an in vitro reconstitution of cohesin loading by Scc2/4 suggests that the product of this reaction is a topological protein–DNA linkage ( Murayama and Uhlmann, 2013 ). In metazoans, cohesin deposition by Scc2/4 is required for normal development ( Dorsett et al., 2005; Kawauchi et al., 2009 ), and mutations in NIPBL, the human homolog of Scc2, are dominant and causally linked to a severe developmental disorder, Cornelia de Lange Syndrome ( CDLS ) ( Krantz et al., 2004 ). In addition to initiating a connection between cohesin and chromatin, Scc2/4 determines the timing and location of cohesin loading ( Ciosk et al., 2000; Kogut et al., 2009 ). Cohesin enrichment at mitotic centromeres and pericentromeres results in tension across sister chromatids when paired kinetochores attach to opposite spindle microtubules ( Tanaka, 2000 ). Mitotic spindle checkpoint signaling senses the tension between sister centromeres to ensure correct kinetochore–microtubule attachments ( Stern and Murray, 2001 ). Defective centromeric cohesion therefore leads to elevated rates of chromosome missegregation ( Eckert et al., 2007; Fernius and Marston, 2009 ). Centromeric cohesion depends on recruitment of Scc2/4 to centromeres in late G1/early S phase ( Hu et al., 2011; Fernius et al., 2013 )

., 2011; Fernius et al., 2013 ). A group of conserved kinetochore proteins—the Ctf19 complex in yeast ( homologous to the human CCAN ) —participates in this recruitment pathway, along with the S phase kinase complex, DDK ( Fernius and Marston, 2009; Hu et al., 2011; Natsume et al., 2013 ). Deletion of any of several Ctf19 complex members leads to impaired centromeric cohesion and chromosome missegregation ( Eckert et al., 2007; Fernius and Marston, 2009; Ng et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2011 ), but whether individual components make direct contact with Scc2/4 is not yet known. The cohesin loading activity of Scc2/4 in vitro requires only Scc2 ( Murayama and Uhlmann, 2013 ). Scc4 is essential in yeast, however, and in humans, de novo Mau2Scc4 missense and nonsense mutations are significantly underrepresented in exome sequences, indicating that disruption of Mau2Scc4 function is probably dominant and lethal ( Table 1 ). Thus, Scc2 activity in vivo must depend on Scc4 in ways not recapitulated by the in vitro loading reaction. We report here the structure of yeast Scc4 in complex with an N-terminal fragment of Scc2 and demonstrate that Scc4 determines cohesin localization through a conserved patch on its surface. These findings show that Scc4 targets cohesin loading to a specific genomic locus and that this function is separable from its essential role in establishing sister chromatid cohesion across the genome. 10. 7554/eLife. 06057. 019Table 1. De novo mutation profiles for human NIPBL and Mau2DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 06057. 019ObservedExpectedNIPBL Synonymous5858. 4 Missense88160. 9 Loss of function018. 4Mau2 Synonymous2526. 6 Missense1352. 7 Loss of function03. 8

. This prediction is borne out both by strains bearing Scc4-conserved patch mutations and by strains lacking CHL4 ( Fernius and Marston, 2009 ). Recent reports have shown that cohesin targeting to specific locations along the chromosome arms of fission yeast ( Mizuguchi et al., 2014 ) and flies ( Oliveira et al., 2014 ) is critical for normal three-dimensional chromosome structure. In addition to findings from studies conducted in mammalian cells ( Dowen et al., 2014 ), one of these reports ( Mizuguchi et al., 2014 ) suggests that cohesin complexes residing at specified sites in the genome function in gene looping and in defining chromosome territories. Because our ChIP-seq experiments show that Scc4 directs cohesin localization to broad centromeric domains but does not affect the local distribution of cohesin peaks, we suggest that the Scc4-dependent localization pathway we discuss here is overlaid upon local determinants of cohesin positioning on chromosomes. These local determinants would be a second level of cohesin regulation, operating at roughly the resolution of the transcriptional units in yeast. Integration of these spatial cues with temporal cues, including the kinase activity of DDK, could then generate the final cohesin distribution observed in metaphase cells. The Scc4-conserved patch presents a possible explanation for how broad cohesin-dense domains may be specified by the cohesion-loading complex, and it provides a molecular foundation for the study of chromatin-associated factors, both known and unknown, that localize cohesin loading.

. Strains lacking Chl4 have extended metaphase spindles, and this phenotype corresponds to weakened centromeric cohesion ( Fernius and Marston, 2009; Laha et al.,2013 ). This is consistent with our finding that S4-dependent cohes localization is required for centrom cohesion. In contrast, strains bearing S4-conserved mutations have normal metaphase sples and centrom cohesion ( Fern and Marston 2009 ), indicating that the second mode of cohes loading is sufficient for viability in the absence of the S4-dependent pathway. This second mode of cohes loading is probably opportunistic, as it happens everywhere on the chromosome and is sufficient to support viability in the absence of the first. If so, S4-conserved mutations would not eliminate cohes loading but redistribute events, resulting in similar cohes levels centrom and chromosome arms. The S4-conserved patch is conserved across diverse eukaryotes, suggesting that S4-dependent cohes localization is a general feature of cohes loading.

    Title: Implications of being born late in the active season for growth, fattening, torpor use, winter survival and fecundity
    Abstract: For hibernators, being born late in the active season may have important effects on growth and fattening, hence on winter survival and reproduction. This study investigated differences in growth, fattening, energetic responses, winter survival and fecundity between early-born ( ‘EB’ ) and late-born ( ‘LB’ ) juvenile garden dormice ( Eliomys quercinus ). LB juveniles grew and gained mass twice as fast as EB individuals. Torpor use was low during intensive growth, that are, first weeks of body mass gain, but increased during pre-hibernation fattening. LB juveniles showed higher torpor use, reached similar body sizes but lower fat content than EB individuals before hibernation. Finally, LB individuals showed similar patterns of hibernation, but higher proportion of breeders during the following year than EB dormice. These results suggest that torpor is incompatible with growth but promotes fattening and consolidates pre-hibernation fat depots. In garden dormice, being born late in the reproductive season is associated with a fast life history.

   . Therefore, investing enough resources in the energy-demanding processes of postnatal growth and pre-hibernation fattening is of high relevance for juvenile hibernators. This can, however, represent a challenge, notably when the time before hibernation onset is shortened, as for juveniles born late in the reproductive season. Further, food availability during key periods of development might also be reduced ( Metcalfe and Monaghan, 2001 ), as it can happen late in the reproductive season. Therefore, being a hibernator born late in the summer might trigger coordinated energy-sparing strategies for FM gain at the expense of body growth and subsequent reproductive success. One of the common responses shown by late-born ( ‘LB’ ) individuals is to grow and gain mass at higher-than-normal rates. This is indeed the case in LB garden dormice ( Eliomys quercinus ) that grow almost twice as fast as early-born ( ‘EB’ ) individuals, reaching lower fat content prior to hibernation ( Stumpfel et al., 2017 ). One possible strategy to lower energy requirements and to minimize the impact of energetic challenges is the use of short torpor bouts during certain parts of the day, namely daily torpor ( Ruf et al., 1991 ). In particular, torpor use is thought to sustain and promote growth, body mass gain and pre-hibernation fattening and may ensure survival in young individuals ( Geiser and Brigham, 2012; Geiser et al., 2006; Giroud et al., 2012; Giroud et al., 2014 ). Previous studies of our group have demonstrated that LB juvenile garden dormice use daily torpor to counteract intermittent periods of fasting, showing similar trajectories of body mass gain as ad libitum-fed individuals prior to hibernation ( Giroud et al., 2012; Giroud et al., 2014 ). However, we presently know very little about the use of daily torpor in juvenile hibernators ( Geiser, 2008; Geiser and Brigham, 2012 )

. Despite this fact, LB juveniles showed hibernating patterns and survival rates similar to EB individuals. This result is in line with findings on common dormice, from a population also producing two litters per year, and in which no significant differences in winter survival between EB and LB juveniles were detected ( Bieber et al., 2012 ). The pre-hibernation fat reserves of LB juveniles in our study were hence sufficient to fuel their shorter winter duration due to the five-weeks delay of hibernation start. Interestingly, we found that the overwintering body mass loss of juveniles was mainly accounted for a reduction of FM. This result contrasts with our previous findings on equal reductions of FM and FFM in garden dormice during winter hibernation ( see Figure 3, Giroud et al., 2014 ). However, in Giroud et al. ( 2014 ), we determined pre-hibernation BC of the animals at the end of the period of highest summer mass gain, at a ~10% lower body ( fat ) mass compared to the peak body mass prior to hibernation. As the last phase of body mass gain prior to hibernation mainly corresponds to fat deposition, pre-hibernation level of FM, but not FFM, might have been largely underestimated. In contrast, in the present study BC was assessed slightly after the peak of body mass prior to hibernation, closely reflecting BC of the animals at the onset of hibernation. Therefore, the current data provides a rigorous determination of the source ( i. e. FM and FFM ) of body mass loss overwinter in garden dormice, which almost exclusively point to FM loss during winter hibernation. It is indeed a characteristic of most hibernating species to fuel their energy needs in torpor almost exclusively with fat oxidation, as supported by studies that measured MR and substrate-type utilization during torpor in hibernators kept at Ta between 0°C and 8°C in winter ( for review see Dark, 2005; Heldmaier et al., 2004 )

. Further, to our knowledge no study so far has specifically investigated the effect of torpor and alternative energy-saving strategies on processes of growth and pre-hibernation fattening in hibernators according to their time of birth within the season. The garden dormouse, henceforth 'dormouse', is a small nocturnal and omnivorous rodent endemic to Europe ( Bertolino et al., 2008; Vaterlaus-Schlegel, 1997; Vogel, 1997 ). The hibernation season, during which they solely rely on body energy reserves accumulated prior to hibernation, can last up to 7 months ( Bertolino et al., 2001 ). Because a second litter late in the season is possible, both in captivity and in the field ( Giroud et al., 2012; Giroud et al., 2014; Moreno, 1988 ), dormice provide an excellent model to determine differences between juveniles from EB and LB litters. In the present study, we therefore investigated the effects of the time of birth ( EB vs. LB ) and food availability ( ad-libitum ‘AL’ vs. intermittently fasted ‘IF’ ) on ( i ) the rate of growth and pre-hibernation fattening, ( ii ) the use of energy saving strategies such as daily torpor, ( iii ) the body size and body fat content prior to hibernation, ( iv ) the subsequent overwinter hibernating patterns and mass losses, and ( v ) the fecundity at the following spring of female juvenile dormice. Specifically, we hypothesized that LB juvenile dormice ( i ) grow and fatten at higher rates, due to ( ii ) a higher use of torpor, and ( iii ) reach similar pre-hibernation levels of body size but a lower body fat content, leading to ( iv ) differences in hibernating patterns and mass losses overwinter, compared to EB individuals. Further, we expected IF juveniles to employ more often and longer torpor bouts than AL fed individuals to reach similar levels of body fat content prior to hibernation

., 1986 ). In humans, mothers who were exposed to a famine in the Netherlands during the winter of 1944–1945 had reduced weight gain during pregnancy and, consequently, produced infants with reduced foetal growth, birth weight and length, and neonatal survival ( Stein et al., 1995 ). In our study, the intermittent fasting treatment during early life might have been interpreted by the juveniles as a signal for an environment with low and unpredictable food availability, leading them to dampen their subsequent reproductive investment, probably to the advantage of their somatic maintenance, hence their fitness. Taken together, the present study shows that growth acceleration, enabled by increased food intake and reduced activity duration, acted as compensatory strategy for a late start. This led to pre-hibernation body sizes in LB juveniles that are indistinguishable from those of EB dormice. Further, an extensive use of torpor seemed to be incompatible with structural growth, but supports pre-hibernation fattening late in the season and the preservation of the fat reserves previously deposited prior to hibernation. This was especially the case for EB juveniles that reached higher levels of fat reserves prior to hibernation, compared to LB individuals. LB juveniles delayed their onset of hibernation by 5 weeks. Further, their lower body FM had no consequences for subsequent winter hibernation and survival, showing similar hibernating patterns to EB individuals. For both EB and LB juveniles, overwintering body mass loss was mainly explained by a reduction of FM, meaning that garden dormice spare their lean mass during winter hibernation. Finally, it seems that the fact of being born late in the reproductive season accelerates the individual pace of life, by accelerating growth rate and increasing fecundity in sub-adults during the following year

. Torpor represents a flexible tool whose use strongly depends on the individual endogenous and exogenous conditions ( Humphries et al., 2003a ). Since LB dormice had in total 5 weeks less time for growth and fattening before hibern than EB, they had to invest in tor to save energy. This is in contrast to EB, which had more time for growth and fattening before hibern, and therefore did not need to rely on tor to save energy. This is in line with the idea that tor is incompatible with growth but promotes preibern fattening ( Geiser and Brigham,2012; Geiser et al.,2006; Giroud et al,2012; Giroud et al,2014 ). In our study, tor use was low during growth but increased during preibern fattening in both AL and IF dormice. However, tor use was more frequent and longer in IF than AL dormice to reach similar levels of body fat prior hibern. This is in line with the idea that tor is used to sustain body mass and preibern fattening ( Geiser and Brigham,2012; Geiser et al,2006; Giroud et al2012; Giroud et2014 ) and ensure survival in young ( Geiser,2008 Geiser and Brigham,201 ). Despite this, dormice showed hibern patterns and survival rates similar to EB. This is in line with findings on dormice from a population also producing two litters per year, in which no differences in winter survival between EB and LB were detected (Bieber et al,2012 ) The preibern fat of dorm in our study were sufficient to fuel their shorter hibernation due to 5-weeks delay of hibern start. Overwinter body loss of dorm was mainly accounted for reduction of FM. This contrasts our previous findings on reductions of FM and FFM in dormice during hibern (Giroud et al,2014 ) However, in Goud et al (2014 ) determined preibern BC of animals at the end of period of highest summer gain at ~10 lower body fat mass compared to peak prior hibern.

    Title: The C. elegans neural editome reveals an ADAR target mRNA required for proper chemotaxis
    Abstract: ADAR proteins alter gene expression both by catalyzing adenosine ( A ) to inosine ( I ) RNA editing and binding to regulatory elements in target RNAs. Loss of ADARs affects neuronal function in all animals studied to date. Caenorhabditis elegans lacking ADARs exhibit reduced chemotaxis, but the targets responsible for this phenotype remain unknown. To identify critical neural ADAR targets in C. elegans, we performed an unbiased assessment of the effects of ADR-2, the only A-to-I editing enzyme in C. elegans, on the neural transcriptome. Development and implementation of publicly available software, SAILOR, identified 7361 A-to-I editing events across the neural transcriptome. Intersecting the neural editome with adr-2 associated gene expression changes, revealed an edited mRNA, clec-41, whose neural expression is dependent on deamination. Restoring clec-41 expression in adr-2 deficient neural cells rescued the chemotaxis defect, providing the first evidence that neuronal phenotypes of ADAR mutants can be caused by altered gene expression.

    Supporting Text:
    In this study, we have provided the first analysis of the tissue-specific role of ADR-2, both in A-to-I editing and in regulating neural gene expression in C. elegans. Combining neural cell isolation with RNA-sequencing and editing site detection with SAILOR, we identified over 7300 A-to-I editing sites in the C. elegans neural transcriptome, including 104 novel edited genes. In addition to identifying neural editing events, the neural RNA-seq data revealed 169 genes to be misregulated in worms lacking editing. The intersection of these two datasets lead to the identification of clec-41, a gene that was expressed three-fold lower in adr-2 ( - ) neural cells and whose transcripts contained multiple 3’ UTR editing events. Importantly, using a combination of transgenic worms and chemotaxis assays, we demonstrated that transgenic expression of clec-41 in neural cells was sufficient to rescue the aberrant chemotaxis of adr-2 deficient worms and that editing is required for proper clec-41 expression and chemotaxis. Although ADARs play critical roles in editing codons of neuronal transcripts to generate the proteomic diversity needed for proper neuronal function in mammals, our data indicate the aberrant behavioral phenotypes caused by lack of C. elegans adr-2 are a result of altered neural gene expression rather than recoding events. Consistent with this idea, previous studies indicated that loss of critical components of the RNA interference ( RNAi ) pathway, namely rde-1 or rde-4, can restore proper chemotaxis to adr mutant worms ( Tonkin and Bass, 2003 ). However, previous attempts to identify genes antagonistically regulated by RNAi and ADARs were unable to pinpoint transcripts that underlie the chemotactic behavior ( Wu et al., 2011 ). Interestingly, previous transcriptome-wide studies of gene expression in RNAi mutant worms identified elevated levels of clec-41 in dcr-1, rde-4 and rde-1 mutant worms ( Welker et al., 2007 )

. However, clec-41 expression was reduced three-fold in neural cells expressing the ADR-2 G184R mutant compared to wild-type neural cells, mirroring the adr-2 ( - ) neural cells ( Figure 6E ) and suggesting deamination is required for proper neural expression of clec-41. Similarly, chemotaxis in the adr-2 ( G184R ) mutant worms was impaired compared to wildtype, further implicating A-to-I editing and clec-41 expression in regulating this biological function ( Figure 6F ). This is the first study to link a phenotype associated with loss of C. elegans ADAR enzymes to editing-dependent regulation of a specific gene.

. This is consistent with previous data that indicated a similar chemotaxis defect for worms lacking either adr-1 or adr-2 and worms lacking both adr-1 and adr-2 ( Tonkin et al., 2002 ). Despite the fact that the similarity in chemotaxis phenotypes has been known for over a decade, this study is the first to identify an editing target whose expression is regulated by both C. elegans ADARs. Furthermore, this study brings into light the need to assess editing and gene expression at a tissue-specific level in C. elegans, as this molecular phenotype cannot be observed in RNA isolated from L1 worms. As our gene regulatory data indicates that both C. elegans ADARs are important for proper clec-41 expression and a previous genome-wide screen suggested clec-41 was important for proper locomotion/chemotaxis, we sought to directly assess the role of clec-41 in regulating the chemotaxis defects associated with loss of ADARs. To test this, a worm line expressing clec-41 under the control of the pan-neuronal rab-3 promoter ( rab3p ) was generated. To visually follow the clec-41 transgene, the worms were co-injected with a rab3p::GFP reporter. As the chemotactic effects of restoring clec-41 expression to adr-2 ( - ) worms were of interest, the transgenic wild-type worm generated by microinjection was crossed to C. elegans adr-1 ( tm668 ) ; adr-2 ( ok735 ) mutant male worms. After identifying progeny that were wild-type for the adr-1 locus, worms homozygous for the adr-2 ( ok735 ) mutation and carrying the rab3p::clec-41 transgene as well as wild-type worms carrying the transgenes were isolated from the F2 progeny. Neural expression of clec-41 from the transgene in both the wild-type and adr-2 ( - ) worms was confirmed by performing qRT-PCR on neural cells isolated from the transgenic worms. Compared to wild-type worms, both transgenic lines express higher levels of clec-41 in neural cells ( Figure 5A )

. These data are consistent with the number of coding region editing sites previously identified from RNA isolated from whole-worms, and we identified nearly all of the same edited transcripts, including the heavily edited coding regions of histone genes ( Wu et al., 2011 ). Together, this data indicates that re-coding editing events are not enriched in the C. elegans nervous system and demonstrates that the role of C. elegans ADARs in the nervous system is not to generate proteomic diversity, but rather to fine-tune gene expression. To further assess the role of ADR-2 in regulating the neural transcriptome, the RNA-seq datasets from three independent biological replicates of wild-type and adr-2 ( - ) neural cells were assessed for differential gene expression using DESeq ( Love et al., 2014 ) ( Supplementary file 2 ). This analysis identified 76 genes that were ≥2 fold upregulated in neural cells lacking adr-2 as compared to wild-type neural cells and 93 genes that were ≥2 fold downregulated. Of these 169 differentially regulated genes, only four genes were identified as ADR-2 editing targets in neural cells, suggesting ADR-2 can also regulate expression of many genes via a mechanism that is independent of direct editing of the target mRNA. To validate the differential expression values obtained from the RNA-seq dataset, qRT-PCR was performed for two genes from each category ( Figure 3A and B ). Expression of these genes reflected the fold-change determined by the RNA-seq analysis. Interestingly, qRT-PCR analysis of the expression of these genes in RNA isolated from whole L1 larvae did not follow the same trend ( Figure 3C ). This reveals that loss of adr-2 regulates expression of genes at a tissue-specific level in C. elegans and suggests that these changes may not be observed in whole worm analysis. Previous studies have shown that worms lacking adr-2 ( - ) exhibit defects in chemotaxis ( Tonkin et al

., 2007 ). Similarly, data from our lab has indicated that neural cells from rde-4 ( ne299 ) mutant worms have increased levels of clec-41 compared to wildtype worms ( unpublished data ). Therefore, despite the conserved role of ADARs in regulating proper neurological function and essential roles for A-to-I editing within codons of neurologically important targets in certain organisms, our data indicate studies addressing the role of ADARs in the nervous system need to focus not only on direct editing targets but also on differentially expressed genes. In this regard, our analysis revealed 169 genes to be misregulated in adr-2 ( - ) neural cells; however, A-to-I editing was only detected in the transcripts of four of these genes. At present, it is unclear how ADR-2 is regulating expression of these genes. Several recent studies have identified editing-independent mechanisms by which mammalian ADARs promote gene expression by either promoting or inhibiting binding of other RBPs. Specifically, human ADAR1 was shown to promote binding of the mRNA stabilizing RBP, HuR, while human ADAR2 was shown to inhibit the mRNA degrading RBP, poly ( A ) specific ribonuclease deadenylase ( PARN ) ( Anantharaman et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017 ). It is possible that C elegans ADR-2 employs similar mechanisms to modulate expression of genes in the neural transcriptome. Further studies are needed to determine how ADR-2 regulates expression of genes in C. elegans.

    Title: A systematic view on influenza induced host shutoff
    Abstract: Host shutoff is a common strategy used by viruses to repress cellular mRNA translation and concomitantly allow the efficient translation of viral mRNAs. Here we use RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to explore the mechanisms that are being utilized by the Influenza A virus ( IAV ) to induce host shutoff. We show that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated and instead the decline in cellular protein synthesis is mediated by viral takeover on the mRNA pool. Our measurements also uncover strong variability in the levels of cellular transcripts reduction, revealing that short transcripts are less affected by IAV. Interestingly, these mRNAs that are refractory to IAV infection are enriched in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that the continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is important for viral propagation. Our results advance our understanding of IAV-induced shutoff, and suggest a mechanism that facilitates the translation of genes with important housekeeping functions.

    Influenza A viruses ( IAV ) are included among the Orthomyxoviridae family of negative single-stranded, segmented RNA viruses. These viruses cause an infectious disease that constitutes an important public health problem and remains today an important cause of morbidity and mortality ( Fields, 2007 ). Like all viruses, IAV is absolutely dependent on the host-cell protein synthesis machinery to produce its proteins. To ensure priority access to host translation machinery, many viruses utilize host shutoff mechanisms that eliminate competition from cellular transcripts ( Walsh et al., 2012 ). Host shutoff could be achieved by two complementary mechanisms: 1. Direct co-opting of the translation machinery by mechanisms that force better translation of viral mRNAs compared to their host counterparts. A classic example for this strategy is employed by poliovirus. It cleaves an essential host cap- binding protein, eIF4G, therefore preventing cap-dependent translation of host mRNAs while viral RNA translation stays unperturbed through the use of an internal ribosome entry site ( Ventoso et al., 1998 ). 2. Viral-induced degradation of host mRNAs. This strategy is employed by several herpesviruses that express endonucleases which cleave host mRNAs, thereby eliminating the competition with host mRNA for the translation apparatus and ensuring efficient cap-dependent translation of viral mRNAs ( Glaunsinger and Ganem, 2006 ). IAV has long been known to significantly shutoff host gene expression. Interestingly, it is one of the few viruses for which both direct translation co-opting and host mRNA degradation were suggested to play a prominent role in host shutoff ( Yanguez and Nieto, 2011; Jagger et al., 2012 )

. To this end, we have used RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) and ribosome profiling ( deep sequencing of ribosomes-protected fragments ) to globally map the changes in host genes RNA and translation levels during IAV infection. These comprehensive and simultaneous measurements complemented with Single molecule Fluorescence in-situ Hybridization ( smFISH ) revealed that host shutoff is mainly achieved by reduction in cellular mRNAs levels, and that IAV transcripts are not preferably translated. Our systematic analysis also reveals that host transcripts are affected differently by IAV infection and that the extent of mRNAs reduction is related to their length and GC content. Interestingly, we noticed that transcripts encoding oxidative phosphorylation related proteins are less affected by IAV infection, their protein levels remain stable throughout infection and their continuous expression supports the energetic demands that are essential for virus replication.

. 9E-13 ), including Viperin and IDO1 that were previously shown to be elevated during IAV infection ( Ranaware et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2013 ). Interestingly, cluster 1 which is composed of mRNAs that are most drastically downregulated is enriched with genes related to DNA repair and cell cycle ( Pval = 1. 7E-17 and Pval = 4. 3E-18 respectively ) whereas cellular mRNAs that are barely affected by IAV infection ( cluster 3 ) are enriched with genes related to oxidative phosphorylation and for transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins ( Pval = 3. 4E-10 and Pval = 3. 9E-8, respectively ). These measurements and analysis reveal that the shutoff in host protein synthesis is mainly driven by reduction in cellular mRNA levels, and that host mRNAs sensitivity to influenza is not uniform and certain mRNAs are more resistant to viral interference. One limitation of global deep-sequencing measurements is that these measurements provide relative but not absolute quantification of RNA and translation levels. To address this issue we confirmed that there are no significant changes in the overall levels of translation ( Figure 4B and Katze et al., 1986 ) and in total RNA ( Supplementary file 2 ) along IAV infection. We also extracted RNA from an equal number of cells along infection and performed real-time PCR analysis for cellular mRNAs from each of these clusters. These independent measurements were in strong agreement with our RNA-seq measurements ( Figure 3D ). 10. 7554/eLife. 18311. 009Figure 4.

. Instead, our systematic analysis demonstrates that host shutoff stems from the viral dominance over the mRNA pool. At 8 hpi viral mRNAs take over 53. 8% of the translation activity in the cells as 57. 3% of the mRNAs in the cells are viral ( Figure 3B ). These findings show that the relative reduction in cellular mRNA expression is the main cause for host shutoff during infection. Our analysis concurs with the finding that PA-X endonuclease activity plays a dominant role in host shutoff during IAV infection ( Jagger et al., 2012; Khaperskyy and McCormick, 2015; Khaperskyy et al., 2016, 2014; Bavagnoli et al., 2015 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 18311. 007Figure 3.

. This can explain the specificity to Pol II transcripts and the relative resistance of short transcripts which intrinsically also tend to have less exons. However, this possibility seems less favorable as at least by over expression PA-X did not affect the expression of cellular nascent transcripts ( Khaperskyy et al., 2016 ). Future work focused on PA-X activity can help shed light on the exact mechanism. Host shutoff is a common phenomenon, employed by diverse viruses and it is thought to contribute to the viral progression in two main ways: by redirecting the translation machinery towards viral gene expression and by inhibiting cellular anti-viral responses. However, shutting off cellular protein production could also have adverse effects. Viruses are completely dependent on cellular resources and inhibiting cellular protein production can dampen processes that are indispensable for the virus. Interestingly, we noticed that transcripts that are less affected by IAV infection are enriched for genes involved in pathways that the virus potentially depends on, such as oxidative phosphorylation components and ribosomal proteins. In contrast, genes that were most significantly reduced are related to cell cycle, a cellular activity that is often blocked by viruses. Indeed, we were able to show that the levels of mitochondrial proteins are not affected by IAV even at 16 hpi, a time point in which other proteins were reduced. Further experiments demonstrated that inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation to levels that do not affect cell’s viability severely impairs viral replication. Our results suggest that host shutoff is a double-edged sword for IAV and that it may be a mechanism to ensure the translation of genes that are essential for viral replication.

    Title: Feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated transport shapes a tissue-specific FGF morphogen gradient
    Abstract: Gradients of signaling proteins are essential for inducing tissue morphogenesis. However, mechanisms of gradient formation remain controversial. Here we characterized the distribution of fluorescently-tagged signaling proteins, FGF and FGFR, expressed at physiological levels from the genomic knock-in alleles in Drosophila. FGF produced in the larval wing imaginal-disc moves to the air-sac-primordium ( ASP ) through FGFR-containing cytonemes that extend from the ASP to contact the wing-disc source. The number of FGF-receiving cytonemes extended by ASP cells decreases gradually with increasing distance from the source, generating a recipient-specific FGF gradient. Acting as a morphogen in the ASP, FGF activates concentration-dependent gene expression, inducing pointed-P1 at higher and cut at lower levels. The transcription-factors Pointed-P1 and Cut antagonize each other and differentially regulate formation of FGFR-containing cytonemes, creating regions with higher-to-lower numbers of FGF-receiving cytonemes. These results reveal a robust mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific gradient contours through feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated dispersion.

   . In accordance with the same line of thinking, one hypothesis predicts that Drosophila Bnl diffuses from its source to form an extracellular gradient and that the gradient guides directional migration of the tracheal branches such as the ASP ( Horowitz and Simons, 2008; Ochoa-Espinosa and Affolter, 2012 ) ( Figure 1A’ ). However, whether Bnl forms a gradient and if so, how Bnl is transported and modulated in the extracellular space to form a gradient remain unexplored. Moreover, all tracheal cells express the Bnl receptor, Breathless ( Btl ), and develop under the guidance of the same Bnl signal, but different embryonic and larval tracheal branches adopt different developmental stage-specific morphologies ( Sato and Kornberg, 2002; Sutherland et al., 1996 ). We do not understand whether and how the shape of a Bnl gradient can dynamically adapt to diverse tissue morphologies. To investigate these important gaps in knowledge, we chose to focus on the Drosophila larval ASP because of its unique features. In this system, the wing disc bnl-source is spatially separated from the recipient ASP epithelium ( Figure 1A” ). Bnl signals exclusively to the ASP because the wing disc cells and myoblasts located between the disc and the ASP do not express its receptor, Btl. Moreover, the two additional Drosophila FGF family proteins, Pyramus and Thisbe, do not share receptors with Bnl ( Sato and Kornberg, 2002; Stathopoulos et al., 2004 ). This system where there is a clear inter-organ communication path and a single Bnl-specific receptor exclusively expressed in the ASP is ideal for an unbiased interpretation of the extracellular route of Bnl transport and gradient formation. Genome-edited Bnl:GFP and Btl:Cherry constructs generated in this study revealed Bnl distribution with high sensitivity and precision, allowing direct visualization of an endogenous signal and signaling gradient

. The consequence is a regulatory loop that controls the generation and reinforcement of different numbers of cytonemes and levels of Bnl signaling, making the contours of the Bnl gradient robust, precisely tissue-specific, and self-sustaining. The roles of these target genes might also explain how variable shapes of Bnl gradients are sculpted in coordination with the growth and development of recipient tissues. One current morphogen model proposes that the signal gradients are generated and scaled to the size of the recipient tissue by the ratio of two diffusible molecules, a morphogen and a contractor/expander, which emanate from opposite poles of the tissue and elicit non-autonomous global feedback to control each other’s distribution ( Barkai and Shilo, 2009; Ben-Zvi et al., 2011; Restrepo and Basler, 2011; Shilo and Barkai, 2017 ). Although Cut and PntP1 are intracellular transcription factors that function cell autonomously, their counteracting feedback activities, regulating where and when signal-specific cytonemes are made as a function of the levels of signal received, can self-generate gradients adopting any recipient-specific shape ( Figures 1F; 8A' ). This mechanism implies an interesting systemic feedback where the gradient shape is a result of the growth and patterning of the recipient tissue, which it controls. However, this mechanism also implies that to initiate such a self-sustaining gradient, initial physical contact of a part of the recipient epithelium with the signal source is required. In fact, each tracheal cell is capable of inducing either PntP1 or Cut/Yan expression irrespective of its position within the recipient epithelium ( Figure 8A ). Thus, an ectopic new bnl source near a pre-existing tracheal branch can initiate a local gradient of cytoneme contacts leading to polarized signal and signaling gradient formation as well as neo-branch organization ( Figure 8B )

Prior to this study, branching morphogenesis of tissues such as vertebrate lung or vasculature was proposed to be induced by exogenous, diffusible signal gradients. For instance, a mesenchymal FGF10 gradient induces branching in the vertebrate lung, and a Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/VEGF gradient induces vascular sprouting ( Affolter et al., 2009; Spurlin and Nelson, 2017 ). Although the paracrine functions of these signals were well characterized, our demonstration and detailed characterization of the Bnl gradient represents the first example of an inductive gradient for branching morphogenesis. In contrast to the traditional idea of a preexisting diffusible gradient, we showed that the shapes of the inductive Bnl gradient are dynamic, adaptable, and form only in a receptor-bound state within the recipient tissue. Moreover, we showed that the Bnl gradient self-generates its variable recipient branch-specific shapes by regulating its cytoneme-mediated transport. Self-generation of tissue-specific gradients may be a common and essential strategy for sustaining the robust, yet variable gradient shapes in dynamically migrating tissues. Consistent with this view, the chemokine Cxcl12a also forms a self-generating gradient to regulate dynamic migration of the Zebrafish lateral line ( Donà et al., 2013 ). Notably, inductive signals such as Bnl or VEGF were previously thought to induce chemotactic migration by inducing binary signaling responses in the recipient cells ( Ochoa-Espinosa and Affolter, 2012 ). Therefore, identification of an organizer-like morphogenetic role of Bnl brings a critical shift to our understanding of branching morphogenesis. Several earlier reports, including biophysical analyses of vertebrate FGF8 and its distribution patterns in tissues, proposed a free or restricted diffusion-based dispersion mechanism for gradient formation ( Bökel and Brand, 2013; Toyoda et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2009 )

. We showed that Bnl moves target-specifically from the producing cells to the ASP through cytonemes and forms a long-range concentration gradient by dynamically adopting the recipient ASP-specific shapes and contours. We also demonstrated that Bnl functions as a morphogen and, most importantly, we uncovered a novel self-regulatory mechanism of cytoneme-mediated signaling by which the Bnl morphogen gradient forms. Thus, these findings showed an example of morphogenesis in which cytoneme-dependent signaling can provide precision and adaptability in shaping long-range positional gradients and tissue architectures in space and time.

. The polarized distribution pattern of Bnl:GFPex was consistent with a potential cytoneme-mediated direct transport of the molecules. Previous studies showed that ASP cells project receptor-containing cytonemes to establish direct membrane contacts with the wing disc Bnl source. These cytonemes were shown to be essential for induction of pMAPK signaling in the ASP ( Roy et al., 2014 ). However, Bnl transport through cytonemes was never visualized before. To examine if Bnl:GFPex molecules localized on the surface of the ASP cytonemes, we carried out EIF assays with either αGFP or αBnl antibody on CD8:Cherry-marked ASPs of bnl:gfpendo homozygous larvae. These assays showed that the EIF-stained Bnl:GFPex puncta were highly enriched on cytonemes emanating from the distal ASP tip ( N > 50 ASP, Figure 3C–E; Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–B” ). However, as observed earlier, many of these puncta were poorly fluorescent under standard confocal fluorescence imaging conditions. Therefore, to clearly visualize the endogenous Bnl:GFP molecules on cytonemes, we employed an enhanced gain super-resolution detection method ( see Materials and methods ). This imaging method revealed that the surfaces of the ASP and ASP cytonemes were densely populated with a high concentration of Bnl:GFP molecules, which appeared as small sub-resolution-sized puncta of <200 nm in diameter ( henceforth referred as nanopuncta due to their sub-resolution size; arrowheads in Figure 3F–F”, Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–A” ). These nanopunct were not observed on the surface of non-ASP cells ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2–B” ), indicating that they are specific to the ASP cyton. Moreover, the number of nanopunct per cyton decreased with increasing distance from the ASP source ( Figure 3G–H, Figure 3— supplement 2–C” ), consistent with a gradient of cyton-mediated transport of Bnl. We conclude that Bnl is transported through cyton from the ASP to the wing disc and forms a long-range gradient through cyton-mediated transport.

    Title: α/β coiled coils
    Abstract: Coiled coils are the best-understood protein fold, as their backbone structure can uniquely be described by parametric equations. This level of understanding has allowed their manipulation in unprecedented detail. They do not seem a likely source of surprises, yet we describe here the unexpected formation of a new type of fiber by the simple insertion of two or six residues into the underlying heptad repeat of a parallel, trimeric coiled coil. These insertions strain the supercoil to the breaking point, causing the local formation of short β-strands, which move the path of the chain by 120° around the trimer axis. The result is an α/β coiled coil, which retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil. Our results show that a substantially novel backbone structure is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold.

   . On the right, top views are shown, looking down the bundle from the N-terminus. As indicated by the arrows next to the side view, they show 1, 2, 3 or all 4 β-layers. At the bottom, the sequence of the construct is shown together with the assigned register. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 11861. 008 The α/β coiled coil of Thermosinus Tcar0761 is built of nonads and thus contains six residues per repeat in the α region of the Ramachandran plot, which retain one backbone hydrogen bond characteristic of α-helical structure. We think that it should be possible to reduce this structure by removing three α-helical residues and thus the single remaining backbone hydrogen bond from the parent structure. Such a minimalistic α/β coiled coil would be built of hexads, with three residues in the β and three in the α region of the Ramachandran plot. We have not so far detected coiled-coil proteins with β-layers in hexad spacing, nor have we been successful in constructing such a structure by fusion of MATKDD repeats between GCN4-N16V adaptors. However, as we will show in the next section, a tail-fiber protein from a Streptococcus pyogenes prophage ( 2C3F ) contains an α/β coiled coil with four β-layers, two of which are in a hexad spacing. At the beginning of this project we had identified nonads in the stalks of TAAs and in the N-terminal coiled coils of a family of prokaryotic endonucleases listed in Pfam as PD- ( D/E ) XK, specifically in the crenarchaeal representatives of this family. The bacterial representatives, where they had the coiled-coil stalk, lacked nonads or related periodicities ( in Pfam however, all the coiled-coil segments of this family are grouped together in entry DUF3782 ). Surprisingly, we found that some bacteria contain coiled-coil proteins that lack the endonuclease domain, but are very similar to the coiled coils of the crenarchaeal proteins; Thermosinus Tcar0761 belongs to these

α-Helical coiled coils are ubiquitous protein domains, found in a wide range of structural and functional contexts ( Lupas, 1996 ). They were the first protein fold described in atomic detail ( Crick, 1953b ) and are also the only one whose backbone structure can be computed with parametric equations ( Crick, 1953a ), placing them at the forefront of protein design efforts ( Huang et al., 2014; Joh et al., 2014; Thomson et al., 2014; Woolfson, 2005 ). The structure of coiled coils is understood at a level unrivaled by any other fold. They consist of at least two α-helices, wound into superhelical bundles and held together by a mostly hydrophobic core. In their most prevalent form they follow a heptad sequence repeat pattern. The seven positions in a heptad are labeled a – g, where positions a and d are oriented towards the core of the bundle and are thus mostly hydrophobic. Beyond the heptad repeat, a range of other periodicities is accessible to coiled coils, which is only restrained by the periodicity of the unperturbed α-helix ( Gruber and Lupas, 2003 ). This restraint is responsible for the supercoiling of the bundle: As an ideal, straight α-helix has a periodicity of about 3. 63 residues per turn, the heptad coiled coil has a left-handed twist to reduce the periodicity to 3. 5 residues per turn with respect to the bundle axis. In hendecad coiled coils, the situation is reversed: 11 residues are accommodated in 3 helical turns, resulting in 11/3 = 3. 67 residues per turn. As this is slightly above 3. 63, hendecads are slightly right-handed. With the periodicity of pentadecad coiled coils, 15/4 = 3. 75 residues per turn, right-handedness is as pronounced as left-handedness is in heptad coiled coils. Many naturally occurring coiled coils contain transitions between segments of different periodicity ( Alvarez et al., 2010; Hartmann et al

The range of periodicities that α-helical coiled coils can assume is limited by the strain they impose on the constituent helices, as they progressively deviate from the 3. 63 residues per turn of an undistorted α-helix. Insertions of 3 residues into a heptad background ( stammers, 10/3 = 3. 33 ) lead to the largest strain observed so far in continuous coiled coils and are accommodated by the local distortion of the α-helix into a 310 helix. We find that increasing the strain further by insertions of 2x3 or 3x3 residues leads to a complete loss of helical structure and the local formation of short β-strands. These cross to form a triangular plane, which moves the path of each chain by 120° counterclockwise around the trimer axis. Within this plane, the central residues of the three β-strands form backbone hydrogen bonds whose geometry deviates substantially from that seen in β-sheets. We have named them β-layers and show that they can be brought about in a straightforward way by the insertion of 6 or 2 ( 9 = 2 modulo 7 ) residues into a heptad background. We propose that β-layers offer two clear advantages to protein fibers. They increase their resilience by tightly interleaving the monomers within the fiber and they offer a simple mechanism to integrate β-stranded domains into these fibers, thus increasing their functional complexity. Our results show that a novel backbone structure is accessible to the 20 proteinogenic amino acids in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot with only minor mutations to a known fold.

. The two segments are stabilized in their relative orientation by backbone hydrogen bonds from the last ( c position ) residue of each N-terminal helix to the first ( e position ) residue in the C-terminal helix of the neighboring chain ( Figure 2C ). This extends the continuous backbone hydrogen-bond network of each α-helix across the chains. The nature of the discontinuity represented by this β-layer is related to the nature of stammers, but its effects are much stronger. With the insertion of 3 residues, stammers constitute a major strain on the conformation of the constituent helices of the coiled coil. In all examples to date, the resulting overwinding of the helices is absorbed by a short 310-helical segment. While these stammers can be best described to be part of a decad, the β-layer in OMP100 occurs in a motif of nine residues, a nonad. As the requirements of a nonad on its helices would be even more extreme than those of a decad, the strategy for its accommodation is a local but complete departure from helical structure. Given the structural simplicity of β-layers, we wondered whether these could be brought about more generally by insertions of 2 residues into heptad coiled coils. Furthermore we wondered whether insertions of 6 residues, which pose similar demands on the coiled coil ( Figure 1 ), also lead to the formation of β-layers. To tackle these questions experimentally, we designed a set of constructs that had either 6 or 9 residues inserted between two consecutive GCN4 N16V adaptors, based on two different sequence motifs ( Figure 3, Table 1 ). One motif is IENKADKAD from Actinobacillus OMP100. The other, MATKDDIAN, is from a second family of prokaryotic coiled-coil proteins that we found to contain nonads and related periodicities; it occurs for example in 14 consecutive repeats in the protein Tcar0761 of Thermosinus carboxydivorans

., 2012 ), we searched systematically for other instances of β-layers in proteins of known structure. The results are collected in Figure 7 and Table 2. All proteins we identified are homotrimers, except for the SLH domain, which is a monomer with pseudo-threefold symmetry. The β-layers in these proteins are all in the same orientation as those found in our constructs ( Figure 2 ) and are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the last residue of the N-terminal helix and the first of the C-terminal helix of the neighboring chain. We also found β-layers in a protein from Streptococcus pyogenes prophage 2C3 ( Figure 8, Table 2 ) which has four β-layers, two of which are in hexad spacing. This is the first example of a coiled-coil protein with β-layers in hexad spacing. We were unable to construct such a structure by fusion of MATDD repeats between GC4-NV adaptors, nor have we found coiled-coil proteins with β-layers in hexad in the Pfam database. Our results show that β-layers can be formed by insertions of 2 or 6 residues into hept coiled coils and are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the last residue of the N-terminal helix and the first of the C-terminal helix of the neighboring chain. They offer a mechanism to integrate β-stranded domains into coiled fibers and increase their resilience by interleaving monomers within the fiber.

    Title: Epsin deficiency impairs endocytosis by stalling the actin-dependent invagination of endocytic clathrin-coated pits
    Abstract: Epsin is an evolutionarily conserved endocytic clathrin adaptor whose most critical function ( s ) in clathrin coat dynamics remain ( s ) elusive. To elucidate such function ( s ), we generated embryonic fibroblasts from conditional epsin triple KO mice. Triple KO cells displayed a dramatic cell division defect. Additionally, a robust impairment in clathrin-mediated endocytosis was observed, with an accumulation of early and U-shaped pits. This defect correlated with a perturbation of the coupling between the clathrin coat and the actin cytoskeleton, which we confirmed in a cell-free assay of endocytosis. Our results indicate that a key evolutionary conserved function of epsin, in addition to other roles that include, as we show here, a low affinity interaction with SNAREs, is to help generate the force that leads to invagination and then fission of clathrin-coated pits.

   ., 2012 ). The goal of the present study was to provide conclusive evidence about the function ( s ) and sites of action of epsin in endocytosis using a gene KO strategy to completely eliminate all epsins. Our results, which capitalize on triple KO ( TKO ) cells generated from conditional epsin TKO mice, show that epsin provides a link between the clathrin coat and actin and is needed for the transition of pits from a shallow to a deeply invaginated state. As in unicellular organisms, epsin acts in concert with Hip1R but with differences from yeast to mammals. An additional function of epsin is a low affinity interaction of its ENTH domain with synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2 ( Syb2 ) that may help ensure the presence of a vesicular SNARE in the budding vesicle.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis involves a complex set of factors besides clathrin itself and the classical clathrin adaptors. These factors help coordinate nucleation of the clathrin coat with cargo selection, membrane invagination and fission ( Schmid, 1997; Slepnev and De Camilli, 2000; Kaksonen et al., 2003; Merrifield et al., 2005; Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012 ). An important player in these processes is epsin, the collective name for a family of evolutionarily conserved clathrin-associated proteins ( Chen et al., 1998; Wendland, 1999, 2002; Ford et al., 2002; Chen and De Camilli, 2005 ), which in mammals is represented by three isoforms: epsin 1, 2, and 3 ( encoded by the Epn1, Epn2, and Epn3 genes, respectively [Ko et al., 2010] ). Epsin was identified as a major interactor of Eps15 ( Chen et al., 1998 ), another clathrin coat associated protein. It comprises a membrane binding N-terminal ENTH ( Epsin N-Terminal Homology ) domain, which is followed by ubiquitin-interacting motifs ( UIMs [Polo et al., 2002] ) and a long sequence ( tail ) predicted to be primarily unfolded and flexible ( Wendland, 2002 ). The core of the ENTH domain is preceded by a short sequence that is unfolded in solution but folds into an amphipathic α-helix upon binding to PI ( 4, 5 ) P2. The hydrophobic portion of the helix partially penetrates the bilayer, thus conferring membrane curvature generation and sensing properties to the protein ( Itoh et al., 2001; Ford et al., 2002 ). Epsin's disordered tail binds components of the clathrin coat via multiple short amino acid motifs: ‘clathrin boxes’ bind clathrin, DPW/F motifs bind the appendage domain of AP-2, and NPF motifs bind the EH domains of Eps15 and intersectin ( Chen et al., 1998; Rosenthal et al., 1999; Drake, 2000; Shih et al., 2002; Overstreet et al., 2003 ). As epsin binds ubiquitin and genetically interacts with enzymes of ubiquitin metabolism ( Cadavid et al

Previous reports have addressed the role of epsin in endocytosis. However, studies in different organisms and in cell-free systems had emphasized the different aspects of its function, so that a complete picture of its physiological role ( s ) has remained elusive. Elucidation of epsin function in mammalian cells had been complicated by the existence of the three Epn genes with overlapping functions. To overcome this problem, we have generated cells that lack all the three epsins by a conditional KO approach involving the OHT-dependent disruption of the Epn1 gene in epsin 2 and 3 double KO mice. A main conclusion of our study is the occurrence of a close coupling between the function of epsin and the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. While such coupling had been suggested by studies in unicellular organisms, studies of epsin in cells of metazoan had emphasized its role as a bilayer deforming protein ( Ford et al., 2002; Boucrot et al., 2012 ) and as a cargo-specific adaptor ( Polo et al., 2002; Overstreet et al., 2003; Chen and De Camilli, 2005; Meloty-Kapella et al., 2012 ). A link of epsin to actin function at endocytic clathrin-coated pits, and in particular a role as a factor that ensures a ‘controlled’ actin growth at sites of endocytosis, is supported by several observations. First, Hip1R, which had so far been considered the major link of endocytic clathrin coats to actin in mammalian cells ( Engqvist-Goldstein et al., 2001; Le Clainche et al., 2007 ), is not recruited to endocytic clathrin-coated pits in the absence of epsin. This is consistent with the interaction and functional partnership of epsin with Sla2/Hip1R, previously demonstrated in yeast and Dictyostelium, although in yeast it is Sla2 that recruits epsin to clathrin-coated pits ( Skruzny et al., 2012 )

. Reported roles of epsin in clathrin-independent endocytosis may also be linked to its function in actin regulation ( Sigismund et al., 2005 ). Another important finding of our study is a weak interaction of epsin's ENTH domain with the SNARE synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2. As intracellular vesicles need SNAREs to fuse with their target membranes, a coupling must exist between vesicle budding and incorporation of the proper SNARE ( s ) in the bud. Accordingly, other coat adaptors with ANTH or ENTH modules, such as AP180/CALM and epsinR were shown to bind SNAREs ( Hirst et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2007, 2011; Koo et al., 2011 ). We hypothesize that the very low affinity of the binding of synaptobrevin 2 to epsin, which explains why such an interaction had not been described so far, may nevertheless be physiologically relevant when compounded by other interaction of epsin with the bilayer, other coat components, and ubiquitinated cargo proteins. Recently, it was proposed that a main role of epsin in endocytic clathrin-coated pit dynamics is to help mediate membrane fission via the membrane remodeling properties of the amphipathic helix zero of its ENTH domain ( Boucrot et al., 2012 ). While this action seems plausible, our study strongly suggests that epsin becomes critically important at the earlier stages of clathrin coat maturation, as we have observed an accumulation of shallow and U-shaped endocytic clathrin-coated pits in epsin TKO cells. The diffuse, rather than punctate distribution of proteins that assemble at the necks of deeply invaginated endocytic clathrin-coated pits, such as dynamin 2, endophilin 2, and myosin 1E further supports a stalling of pits at an early stage in epsin TKO cells. In contrast to the observations made in epsin triple KD cells, we have not observed clearly multiheaded pits, although the dome of some pits was irregular

. A very strong link between epsin and actin is consistent with evidence for a general and evolutionarily conserved role of actin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is more prominent under conditions of high plasma membrane tensions ( Merrifield et al., 2005; Kaksonen et al., 2006; Ferguson et al., 2009; Boulant et al., 2011; Taylor et al., 2012 ). The force of actin polymerization may help drive the deep invagination of the pits, as suggested by studies of actin dynamics in endytic clrin-coated vesicles ( Schmid et al,1997; Slep and Deilli,2000 ). Our results indicate that epsin is a key player in this process, by linking the clath coat to the actin cytoskeleton and ensuring the transition of pits from shallow to deeply invaginated state.

    Title: Risk factors for asthma among schoolchildren who participated in a case-control study in urban Uganda
    Abstract: Data on asthma aetiology in Africa are scarce. We investigated the risk factors for asthma among schoolchildren ( 5–17 years ) in urban Uganda. We conducted a case-control study, among 555 cases and 1115 controls. Asthma was diagnosed by study clinicians. The main risk factors for asthma were tertiary education for fathers ( adjusted OR ( 95% CI ) ; 2. 32 ( 1. 71–3. 16 ) ) and mothers ( 1. 85 ( 1. 38–2. 48 ) ) ; area of residence at birth, with children born in a small town or in the city having an increased asthma risk compared to schoolchildren born in rural areas ( 2. 16 ( 1. 60–2. 92 ) ) and ( 2. 79 ( 1. 79–4. 35 ) ), respectively; father’s and mother’s history of asthma; children’s own allergic conditions; atopy; and cooking on gas/electricity. In conclusion, asthma was associated with a strong rural-town-city risk gradient, higher parental socio-economic status and urbanicity. This work provides the basis for future studies to identify specific environmental/lifestyle factors responsible for increasing asthma risk among children in urban areas in LMICs.

    The risk of asthma among schoolchildren in urban Uganda is strongly predicted by their area of residence in early life, particularly at birth, with the highest risk among children whose early life is spent in small towns and in the city. This risk increases further in the presence of other asthma risk factors such as parental history of allergic disease, children’s own atopy, higher measures of socio-economic status and urbanicity. Given the current rapid urbanisation in Africa and other LMICs, the prevalence of asthma is likely to increase further. This study provides the basis for future studies investigating environmental and lifestyle factors that increase asthma risk in the urban areas of LMICs.

., 2017a; Oluwole et al., 2017b ). Unlike in HICs, higher parental education and socioeconomic status has been associated with asthma among children in Africa ( Addo-Yobo et al., 2007; Nantanda et al., 2013; Wolff et al., 2012 ). We undertook a case-control study among schoolchildren in an urban area in Uganda, to investigate the main risk factors for asthma and the patterns of allergic sensitisation.

Asthma is estimated to affect more than 235 million people globally, and is the most common non-communicable condition among children ( World Health Organisation, 2017 ). In Africa, the prevalence of asthma appears to be increasing ( Asher et al., 2006; Addo-Yobo et al., 2007; van Gemert et al., 2011; Zar et al., 2007; Lawson et al., 2017 ), particularly in urban areas ( Addo-Yobo et al., 2007; Morgan et al., 2018 ), but the causes of this increase are not fully understood. Moreover, asthma has various phenotypes which may have different aetiologies ( Lötvall et al., 2011 ). Asthma risk factors appear to vary internationally, and to differ between high-income countries ( HICs ) and low-and-middle income countries ( LMICs ) ( Douwes and Pearce, 2002 ). There is little previously published data on asthma risk factors from Africa. The few studies reported have suggested that current residence in urban areas is associated with a higher risk of asthma than rural residence in Africa ( Botha et al., 2019; Addo-Yobo et al., 2001 ) and other LMICs ( Robinson et al., 2011; Gaviola et al., 2016 ). The association between helminth infections and asthma has been investigated in Africa and other LMICs, but the findings have been inconsistent across studies ( Leonardi-Bee et al., 2006; Mpairwe and Amoah, 2019 ). Other risk factors for asthma in Africa and other LMICs, similar to those in HICs, include maternal smoking ( Ayuk et al., 2018; Arrais et al., 2019 ), maternal history of asthma ( Nantanda et al., 2013 ), childhood atopic sensitisation ( Addo-Yobo et al., 2001; Nyembue et al., 2012 ) and history of allergy ( Nantanda et al., 2013; Mehanna et al., 2018 ). Previous reports suggest no association between biomass fuels and asthma risk ( Thacher et al., 2013; Oluwole et al., 2017a ), but increased asthma symptoms ( Oluwole et al., 2017a; Oluwole et al., 2017b )

. 77 ( 1. 02–3. 05 ) ], which increased substantially among atopic children born in town [4. 61 ( 3. 07–6. 90 ) ] or in the city [4. 67 ( 2. 56–8. 52 ) ], Table 6. We investigated the combined effects of parental education and urbanicity on asthma risk, by looking at the father’s education level in combination with the child’s area of residence at birth. We found that for each level of father’s education, there was an increasing risk gradient from rural-town-city; for each area of residence, increasing father’s education level was associated with increased asthma risk; the highest risk of asthma was among children born in the city whose fathers had a tertiary education [6. 95 ( 3. 52–13. 71 ) ] ( Table 7 ). The same pattern in Table 7 was seen for mother’s education and for child’s area of residence in the first five years of life. For the combined effect of atopy ( SPT positive ) and parental history of allergic disease, we found that asthma risk was more than five times among children with both atopy and a parental history of allergic disease [5. 74 ( 4. 07–8. 10 ) ] ( Supplementary file 1b ). However, children who had both parents with a history of allergic disease had an effect size similar to children who had only one parent with a history of allergic disease [2. 49 ( 1. 74–3. 58 ) ] ( Supplementary file 1c ).

. 57 ( 2. 01–3. 29 ) ] ( Table 3 ). We investigated the relative importance of area of residence at birth versus the first years of life, on the asthma risk, by looking at children who migrated between rural and urban areas during these two periods. Children born and raised in rural areas had the lowest risk ( the reference group ) ; children born and raised in urban areas had the highest risk [2. 55 ( 1. 80–3. 61 ) ], children born in the urban area who migrated and spent most of 0–5 years in rural areas still had an increased risk of asthma [2. 11 ( 1. 14–3. 91 ) ], unlike children who were born in rural areas but migrated and spent most of 0–5 years in urban areas ( Table 4 ). We investigated the combined effects of the child’s area of residence at birth and parental history of allergic disease. Even among children with no parental history of allergic disease, compared to being born in a rural area, being born in a town [2. 15 ( 1. 35–3. 44 ) ] or in the city [3. 33 ( 1. 61–6. 90 ) ] was associated with an increased risk of asthma, Table 5. Compared to the same reference group, children with a parental history of allergic disease had a higher risk of asthma that increased steadily from among children born in rural areas [2. 78 ( 1. 58–4. 89 ) ], in a town [5. 16 ( 3. 25–8. 17 ) ] and in the city [5. 54 ( 2. 99–10. 26 ) ] ( Table 5 ). We also investigated the combined effects of area of residence at birth and children’s atopic status ( positive SPT to any of seven allergens ). Taking non-atopic children born in rural areas as the reference group, we found that non-atopic children born in town had a modest increase in asthma risk [1. 72 ( 1. 16–2. 55 ) ], which increased further among city-born children [2. 63 ( 1. 41–4. 91 ) ], Table 6. However, atopic children had a modestly increased risk of asthma even if they were born in the rural area [1. 77 ( 1. 02–3

    Title: Gap junctions composed of connexins 41.8 and 39.4 are essential for colour pattern formation in zebrafish
    Abstract: Interactions between all three pigment cell types are required to form the stripe pattern of adult zebrafish ( Danio rerio ), but their molecular nature is poorly understood. Mutations in leopard ( leo ), encoding Connexin 41. 8 ( Cx41. 8 ), a gap junction subunit, cause a phenotypic series of spotted patterns. A new dominant allele, leotK3, leads to a complete loss of the pattern, suggesting a dominant negative impact on another component of gap junctions. In a genetic screen, we identified this component as Cx39. 4 ( luchs ). Loss-of-function alleles demonstrate that luchs is required for stripe formation in zebrafish; however, the fins are almost not affected. Double mutants and chimeras, which show that leo and luchs are only required in xanthophores and melanophores, but not in iridophores, suggest that both connexins form heteromeric gap junctions. The phenotypes indicate that these promote homotypic interactions between melanophores and xanthophores, respectively, and those cells instruct the patterning of the iridophores.

    The leo phenotype varies, depending on the strength and combination of different alleles, from irregular, wavy stripes that are occasionally interrupted, over rows of spots to a complete loss of the pigment pattern, where isolated melanophores remain dispersed in a uniform background of dense iridophores and xanthophores. In the complete absence of Cx41. 8 protein, in leot1 mutants, there is still some patterning activity present, leading to the formation of spots. The homozygous leotK3 phenotype is considerably stronger than this, indicating that the mutant Cx41. 8 protein present in leotK3 cells has a dominant negative effect on some further component ( s ) involved in pigment pattern formation. In a simple model, this additional factor could be another connexin involved in the formation of heteromeric gap junctions together with Cx41. 8, a notion that has been suggested previously, based on the analysis of leotq270 ( Watanabe et al., 2006 ). The zebrafish genome contains 37 genes coding for connexins and it is impossible to deduce from the predicted amino acid sequences alone possible partners for Cx41. 8. Therefore we performed a mutagenesis of leot1 fish and screened for mutants enhancing the phenotype to a strength similar to leotK3. In this screen we identified two dominant alleles of luc; we show that luc encodes another connexin, Cx39. 4, and that loss-of-function of luc leads to a phenotype very similar to that of leot1. The loss of both connexins results in a phenotype that is as strong as the one seen in homozygous mutants for the dominant alleles of leo or luc. Therefore the strong phenotypes of the dominant alleles can be fully explained by the loss of the two proteins. Cx39. 4 is a fish specific connexin, closely related sequences can only be found in the genomes of other teleost fish. It has been classified either as novel ( Eastman et al

. Our results are most easily explained if the two connexins form heteromeric gap junctions. To establish the time point when the phenotype of the leo and luc mutants becomes first apparent, we followed wild-type and mutant fish during the course of metamorphosis. The first signs of the phenotype become visible at stage PR ( 8. 6 mm SSL ). When in wild-type, melanophores gather immediately dorsally and ventrally to the dense iridophores of the first light stripe, they stay more dispersed in the mutants ( Figure 4A–E ). Dense iridophores covered with xanthophores disperse in an irregular manner in the mutants to form a wider first light stripe, branching into the dark stripe region and suppressing melanophores dorsally and ventrally to form irregular patches ( Figure 4F–J ). At stage J++, when in wild-type three dark and three light stripes are formed, in the luc and leo loss-of-function mutants the spotted pattern is already clearly apparent ( Figure 4L, M ) and the dominant mutants show fields of dense iridophores and xanthophores with few, scattered melanophores ( Figure 4N, O ). This analysis reveals that the leo;luc function is required during development and the mutant patterns are not caused by pattern instability. 10. 7554/eLife. 05125. 006Figure 4. The leo and luc phenotypes arise during metamorphosis. In wild-type dense iridophores of consecutively formed interstripes become visible during stages PR ( A ), J ( F ), and J++ ( K ). Melanophores appear in the stripe regions. In luc loss-of-function ( B, G, L ), leot1 ( C, H, M ), luctXG1 ( D, I, N ), and leotK3 mutants ( E, J, O ) iridophores of the first interstripe form normally at stage PR ( B–E ), however, the melanophores ventral to the first interstripe are more scattered. In the mutants at stage J ( G–J ) the second interstripe fails to form in the ventral region where dense iridophores appear in irregular positions

. In double mutants with shd or tra, where iridophores are lacking, the number of melanophores is further reduced and xanthophores are evenly distributed, indicating that in wild-type there might be a positive interaction between melanophores and xanthophores via gap junctions. The phenotypes of the double mutants with the leo or luc loss-of-function alleles are generally a bit weaker than with leotK3. This indicates that in the absence of one of the connexins, when heteromeric channels cannot form, homomeric channels retain some functionality. The leo and luc mutant phenotypes seem to be caused by iridophores not behaving appropriately and failing to undergo the transition from the dense to the loose form at the correct time and place. Recently it was shown that proliferation and dispersal of iridophores during metamorphosis, the time when the adult pigment pattern is generated, outline the light and dark stripe regions in the trunk of zebrafish ( Singh et al., 2014 ) ; at the same time the larval xanthophores also start to proliferate, they re-organize and change their shapes to densely cover the light stripe regions and loosely the dark melanophore stripes ( Mahalwar et al., 2014 ). This raises the possibility that in normal development the xanthophores, which cover the iridophores, induce the transition to the loose form when they reach the regions destined to form dark stripes. It is interesting in this context that in schachbrett ( sbr ) mutants, which display interrupted dark stripes, the affected gene is specifically expressed in iridophores and codes for Tight Junction Protein 1a ( Tjp1a, ZO-1 ) ( Andrey Fadeev, JK, HGF, and CN-V, submitted ). If gap junctions are indeed involved in the signalling events between xanthophores and iridophores, there must be ( at least ) one, so far unidentified, connexin, which is expressed in iridophores

Adult zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) display a characteristic pattern of horizontal dark and light stripes on their bodies as well as on their anal fins and tailfins ( Figure 1A ). Three types of pigment cells ( chromatophores ) are required to create this pattern. In the dark stripes of the trunk, a net of loose or blue iridophores and pale, stellate xanthophores cover the melanophores, the light stripes are composed of dense silvery iridophores covered by compact orange xanthophores ( Hirata et al., 2003, 2005; Frohnhofer et al., 2013; Mahalwar et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2014 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 05125. 003Figure 1. The leo mutant phenotype. Wild-type zebrafish ( A ) show a pattern of dark and light stripes on the body and on anal- and tail-fins. At higher magnification ( A′ ), dark melanophores in the stripe regions and orange xanthophores in the light stripe regions are discernible. In mutants homozygous for leot1 ( B ) and heterozygous for leotK3 ( C ), the stripes are dissolved into spots. Clusters of melanophores are still visible ( B′ and C′ ). Fish homozygous for leotK3 ( D ) or trans-heterozygous for leotK3 over leot1 ( E ) show an identical phenotype of a completely dissolved pattern. Individual melanophores that hardly cluster together are still present, mostly associated with blue iridophores ( D′ and E′ ).

    Title: Evolution of insect olfactory receptors
    Abstract: The olfactory sense detects a plethora of behaviorally relevant odor molecules; gene families involved in olfaction exhibit high diversity in different animal phyla. Insects detect volatile molecules using olfactory ( OR ) or ionotropic receptors ( IR ) and in some cases gustatory receptors ( GRs ). While IRs are expressed in olfactory organs across Protostomia, ORs have been hypothesized to be an adaptation to a terrestrial insect lifestyle. We investigated the olfactory system of the primary wingless bristletail Lepismachilis y-signata ( Archaeognatha ), the firebrat Thermobia domestica ( Zygentoma ) and the neopteran leaf insect Phyllium siccifolium ( Phasmatodea ). ORs and the olfactory coreceptor ( Orco ) are with very high probability lacking in Lepismachilis; in Thermobia we have identified three Orco candidates, and in Phyllium a fully developed OR/Orco-based system. We suggest that ORs did not arise as an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle, but evolved later in insect evolution, with Orco being present before the appearance of ORs.

   ., 2013 ). The transition from sea to land meant that molecules needed to be detected in gas phase instead of aquatic solution. Therefore, the olfactory system of a hexapod ancestor had to adapt to the terrestrial conditions and detection of volatile, air-borne chemicals. One proposed hypothesis has been that Orco and ORs of the insect type are an adaptation to this terrestrial lifestyle ( Robertson et al., 2003; Krång et al., 2012 ). To reconstruct an evolutionary scenario for insect ORs, we investigated species belonging to different ancient insect orders, including Archaeognatha ( jumping bristletails ) and Zygentoma ( silverfishes and firebrats ), and a neopteran insect belonging to the Phasmatodea ( leaf and stick insects ) as so far not analyzed control group using morphological, electrophysiological and molecular techniques.

Insects provide us with an excellent opportunity to study groups of animals that have retained ancestral characteristics and understand how the specific building blocks in olfaction have evolved in both insects and other animals. Consequently, we selected insects at crucial positions of the phylogenetic tree with a functional olfactory system adapted to terrestrial conditions and detection of volatile chemicals. This species collection provides an excellent model to study the early evolution of the insect olfactory system. To address which receptors are involved in odor detection in these insects and in basal insects in general, we applied several different approaches. Based on our transcriptome data sets, we suggest a stepwise evolution of the Orco/OR complex with Orco having evolved in the lineage of Dicondylia ( Zygentoma + Pterygota ) and the functional complex of Orco and ORs emerging within the pterygote insects ( this study, Clyne et al., 1999; Gao and Chess, 1999; Smadja et al., 2009; Vosshall et al., 1999; Robertson and Wanner, 2006; Kirkness et al., 2010 ). Although it is impossible to completely rule out the presence of ORs, none of our extensive experiments led to the identification of either ORs or Orco in the bristletail L. y-signata. The well-established conservation of the Orco coding gene through evolution suggests that it is highly unlikely that we missed it. We did, however, identify a number of IRs, including the IR coreceptors IR25a, IR8a, and IR76b in the L. y-signata antennal transcriptome. FISH allowed us to visualize expression of the IR co-receptors in a large number of OSNs associated with basiconic sensilla. Based on these results we propose that the olfactory system of L. y-signata is not based on ORs. In insects, different sensillum types house OSNs typically responding to different sets of odors. In D

All living organisms, including bacteria, protozoans, fungi, plants, and animals, detect chemicals in their environment. The sensitivity and chemical range of animal olfactory systems is remarkable, enabling animals to detect and discriminate between thousands of different odor molecules. Although there is a striking evolutionary convergence towards a conserved organization of signaling pathways in vertebrate and invertebrate olfactory systems ( Hildebrand and Shepherd, 1997 ), the involved receptor gene families evolved independently. The molecular identity of olfactory receptors was first unraveled in vertebrates ( Buck and Axel, 1991 ). In mammals, as many as 1000 heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein ( or G protein ) -coupled receptors are considered to be employed in olfactory discrimination ( Buck and Axel, 1991 ). A similar number of chemoreceptors, with about 1300 receptor genes and 400 pseudogenes, have been hypothesized for Caenorhabditis elegans ( Robertson and Thomas, 2006 ). All data on insect olfactory receptors are based on studies investigating the neopteran insects ( overview of insect order relationship is given in Figure 1 ). The identity of receptors involved in olfaction in the evolutionarily more ancient apterygote insects ( Archaeognatha, Zygentoma ) and paleopteran insects ( Odonata and Ephemeroptera ) is thus completely unknown. In neopteran insects ( Polyneoptera, Paraneoptera, and Holometabola ) most volatile stimuli are recognized by members of the olfactory receptor family ( ORs ). ORs are multitransmembrane domain proteins unrelated to nematode or vertebrate olfactory receptors ( Mombaerts, 1999; Robertson, 2001; Hill et al., 2002 ), displaying a distinct membrane topology ( Benton et al., 2006; Lundin et al., 2007 ). The number of functional OR genes varies from 10 in the human body louse Pediculus humanus humanus ( Kirkness et al., 2010 ) to about 60 in Drosophila melanogaster ( Clyne et al

., 1999; Gao and Chess, 1999; Vosshall et al., 1999 ) and up to 350 OR genes in ants ( Zhou et al., 2012 ). ORs have been suggested to be distantly related to the gustatory receptors of arthropods, with some proteins containing a signature motif in the carboxyl terminus ( Scott et al., 2001 ). 10. 7554/eLife. 02115. 003Figure 1. Hexapodan phylogeny. Phylogeny was adapted from Trautwein et al. ( 2012 ). Timescale was adjusted for higher level taxa based on Rota-Stabelli et al.

( 2009 ) and the remaining groups based on their fossil record ( http://insects. about. com/od/evolution/a/Timeline-of-Fossil-Insects-by-Order. htm ), in order to correlate important events in plant and insect evolution with the emergence of insect olfactory receptors. IRs and GRs are known to be much older than insects ( Peñalva-Arana et al., 2009; Croset et al., 2010 ), however, ORs and Orco have evolved during the evolution of insects and cannot be found outside the insect clade ( Peñalva-Arana et al., 2009 ). Insects with a described OR/Orco-based olfactory system were highlighted in blue, whereas species were Orco was described in this study were colored in red. All orders investigated in this study are labeled by an asterisk. Our data suggests the evolution of the coreceptor Orco after the bristletails split from its last common ancestor with the remaining insects. However, an olfactory system that relies both on ORs and Orco seems to have evolved after the emergence of wings. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02115. 003 Insect olfactory receptors function as heteromultimers composed of at least one ligand-specific OR and the coreceptor Orco ( Vosshall et al., 1999; Elmore et al., 2003; Krieger et al., 2003; Larsson et al., 2004; Sato et al., 2008; Wicher et al., 2008 )

., 2012 ). The oldest flying insect orders Odonta ( dragonflies and damselflies ) and Ephemeroptera ( mayflies ) were traditionally considered to be anosmic, lacking both a glomerular antennal lobe and mushroom body calyces ( Strausfeld et al., 1998; Farris, 2005 ). Recent studies have shown that at least dragonflies have an aerial sense of smell ( Rebora et al., 2012 ). However the small antennae and the low number of olfactory sensilla will make it even more challenging to identify putative ORs and Orco in antennal transcriptomes. ORs were definitely present in the last common ancestor of neoptan insects ( Clyne et al. 199; Gao and Chess 199; Smja et al. 2009 Vshall et al. 199; Robertson and Wanner 2006; Kirkness et al 2010 ). In contrast, we did not find any evidence of ORs or Orco in the bristail L. yata. However, we identified a number of IRs, including IR25, IRa and IRb in the L. yata antennal transcriptome FISH allowed us to visualize the expression of IRs in a number of OSNs associated with basicon sensilla Based on these results we propose that the olfactory system of L yata is based on IRs Insects different sensillum house OS typically respond to different sets of odors In all living organisms, including bacteria, protozoa, fungi, plants, and animals, detect chemicals in their environment The sensitivity and range of animal olfactory is remarkable enabling animals to detect and discriminate between thousands of odor.

The article discusses the evolution of olfactory receptors in insects, specifically focusing on the transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments and the emergence of the olfactory system in insects. The study investigates the olfactory systems of three ancient insect orders: Archaeognatha (jumping bristails), Zygent (silverfish and firebrats), and Phasmataneopter (leaf and stick insects). The results suggest that the olfactory system of the bristail Lepach yata is based on ionotropic receptors (IR) rather than olfactory receptors (OR), while the other two species have a fully developed OR/Or-based system. The study proposes that ORs did not arise as an adaptation to terrestrial lifestyle but evolved later in insect evolution, with Orco present before the appearance of ORs.

The article highlights the importance of insects in understanding the evolution of the olfactory system, as they have retained ancestral characteristics and provide an opportunity to study the building blocks of olfaction in both insects and other animals. The study uses transcriptome data to suggest a stepwise evolution of the Or/OR complex, with Orco evolving in the lineage of Diconylia (Zygent+Pgota) and the complex ofco and OR

The study found that individuals living in neighborhoods with low M adherence to M had 2.85 times the odds of having a malaria episode post-M compared to those in high-adherence neighborhoods, suggesting a herd effect. High mosquito biting rates, living with someone with malaria, or asymptomatic infection were also predictors of clinical episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence to M, even in villages with high participation, may frustrate elimination efforts.

The study found a group effect of M adherence, evident from three lines of evidence: clinical episodes decreased among groups for longer than the prophylactic effect (approximately 1 month) of administered antimalials, group protective from M in the rainy season following M, and a lag of 1 month between onset clinical episodes in neighborhoods with low and high M adherence. Neighborhoods with high M adherence experienced lower levels of infection than those with or low M. Individuals who participated in M but lived in low-adherence had highest risk of clinical episode, whereas those did not participate in M but lived in high had lowest risk.

The study investigated associations between individual and group participation M, subclinical infections, and clinical episodes post-M. The results suggest living in a neighborhood with proportion of people not adhering to M was a risk factor for acquiring clinical episode, adjusting for individual M and other predictors. The study points to the need considering scale in M and M adherence, as current programs often target a single village or community.

Mass administration can reduce parasite reservoirs and act as catalyst for regional elimination. The concept of herd applies to communicable diseases, if sufficient population participates, transmission cannot be sustained, leading to reduction morbidity and mortality. The aim of M is to interrupt transmission, notion of herd providing additional protection plausible but not examined empirically. The study describes geographic and epidemiological patterns of clinical and subclinical P. falcum malaria in villages undergoing M, the first documentation of herd conferred by M. The increase post-M episodes corresponded an increase in mosquito biting rates, which peaked in one village at same time as another, but in absence detectable reservoir and did not persist.

The study has limitations, individuals did not participate M did not participate screenings after M.

    Title: Conservation of transcription factor binding specificities across 600 million years of bilateria evolution
    Abstract: Divergent morphology of species has largely been ascribed to genetic differences in the tissue-specific expression of proteins, which could be achieved by divergence in cis-regulatory elements or by altering the binding specificity of transcription factors ( TFs ). The relative importance of the latter has been difficult to assess, as previous systematic analyses of TF binding specificity have been performed using different methods in different species. To address this, we determined the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila TFs, and compared them to human and mouse data. This analysis revealed that TF binding specificities are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals, and that for orthologous TFs, the similarity extends even to the level of very subtle dinucleotide binding preferences. The few human TFs with divergent specificities function in cell types not found in fruit flies, suggesting that evolution of TF specificities contributes to emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.

   . The lack of large, high resolution datasets generated using similar methods have limited previous studies of conservation of TF binding specificity to studies of divergence of strong core binding specificities in a limited number of cases ( see e g., Bohmann et al., 1987; Struhl, 1987 ). However, in addition to the primary specificity, many TFs have secondary modes of DNA binding, can recognize multiple different homodimeric sites and/or recognize multiple different sequences based on DNA shape ( Badis et al., 2009; Rohs et al., 2010; Jolma et al., 2013 ). These, more subtle DNA binding preferences could potentially change faster than and independently of the canonical core DNA recognition motif, and could thus also allow TF specificity to slowly drift in evolution. To characterize the role of divergence and subtle drift in TF DNA binding specificity in animal diversity, we used HT-SELEX to determine TF binding specificities in Drosophila melanogaster. For this, we used existing full-length collection of Drosophila TF cDNAs ( Hens et al., 2011 ), and also generated a novel genome-scale collection of fruit fly TF DNA binding domain ( DBD ) constructs. The TFs were expressed in E. coli and their specificity determined using HT-SELEX ( Jolma et al., 2010, 2013 ), and compared to our existing human and mouse HT-SELEX data. A striking level of conservation of TF binding specificity was observed, with fruit flies having almost as complex a repertoire of TF binding motifs as humans. Conservation of specificity extended to secondary modes of binding, and even subtle dinucleotide preferences, suggesting that TF binding specificities are not subject to substantial evolutionary drift. Specificities exclusive to either of the species were detected most commonly in cases where a TF subfamily had expanded in one of the species. Only two clear cases of divergence of specificity were observed between orthologs

We report here high-resolution DNA-binding specificity for a large fraction of Drosophila TFs. The binding models were determined using HT-SELEX, the same method we have used previously to determine specificities of mammalian TFs. Consistent with our earlier data, we found that TFs and TF DBDs recognize the same, relatively long sites, with more than half of all models being >10 bp in length ( Jolma et al., 2013 ). To analyze the data, we developed novel computational algorithms, including a novel distance metric for gapped subsequences, score for dinucleotide preferences, and a method for comparing TF binding specificity models to each other. In addition, we developed a new barcode logo that facilitates visualization of similarities and differences in PWMs. These methods will have many applications in DNA sequence-analyses that extend beyond analysis of TF binding specificity. The high resolution of the data coupled with the novel computational and data visualization tools allowed comparison of TF binding specificities at an unprecedented scale and resolution, revealing a striking level of conservation of binding specificities that extends to homodimeric sites, minor secondary binding modes, and subtle dinucleotide preferences. This result is surprising even considering the similarity of protein sequences between DBD ortholog pairs, and also in marked contrast to the reported low degree of conservation of protein–protein interactions between species ( Gandhi et al., 2006 ). Despite significant number of differences in the number of TFs, most binding specificities present in mammals were also identified in Drosophila, suggesting that the gene regulatory code is highly conserved. Previously, Wolfe and colleagues have reported a dataset of Drosophila TF motifs ( Noyes et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2011; Enuameh et al., 2013 ). Much of these data are obtained using B1H analysis

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 04837. 020 Several previous studies have analyzed TF DNA binding specificities in Drosophila using methods different to those used here. The highest coverage fruit fly TF-specificity dataset has been generated using the bacterial one hybrid ( B1H ) and DNase I footprinting methods ( Noyes et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2011; Enuameh et al., 2013 ). This collection contains a partial or complete specificities for a total of 325 fruit fly TFs. The profiles we obtained for the proteins that had been analyzed using B1H showed, with very few exceptions, the same core binding specificities ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). To compare the similarity of the datasets in detail, we used the motif similarity score from SSTAT ( Pape et al., 2008 ) to draw a dendrogram ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ). Motifs generally clustered based on the corresponding TF families. However, motifs obtained using HT-SELEX and B1H for the same proteins were often not located next to each other. One reason for this is that flanking sequences obtained using HT-SELEX and B1H are often not identical. The HT-SELEX data also generally yield somewhat longer profiles ( average width of 12. 7 bp vs 10. 7 bp ), particularly in cases where TFs bind as dimers ( e. g., nuclear receptors ). We and others have shown earlier that inclusion of dimeric sites and the extended flanking specificity improve prediction of in vivo occupied sites ( Jolma et al., 2013; Orenstein and Shamir, 2014 ), indicating that the extended specificity information revealed by HT-SELEX is biologically relevant. In addition, the HT-SELEX data include binding models for 65 genes, which are not included in the B1H collection ( Supplementary file 1C ). In conclusion, our dataset and the existing B1H dataset support each other, but appear to have method-specific differences and do not overlap completely. TFs are generally highly conserved in evolution

. The conservation of the secondary binding mode despite divergence of the primary specificity indicates that the binding modes can in some cases evolve independently of each other. Protein sequence-level conservation of the DNA-binding domains of the ETS proteins suggests that the divergence in specificity occurred at or near the divergence of invertebrates and vertebrates ( not shown ). Individual cell types of a multicellular organism are defined by expression of specific combinations of TFs ( Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006 ), and the number of TF genes correlates with complexity of organisms ( see e g., Mastracci and Sussel, 2012 ). Interestingly, many of the TFs that we find to have a different specificity in humans are related to endocrine system function ( AR, ESR1 ), or physiology of cell types that do not exist in fruit flies ( Figure 7F ). For example, ATF2 and non-canonical E2F repressors are important for placental morphogenesis ( Chen et al., 2012; Maekawa et al., 1999 ), whereas ETS class III and IRF factors have important roles in differentiation of cells of the adaptive immune system ( Bartel et al., 2000; Lu et al., 2003 ). SPDEF, in turn, regulates goblet cell differentiation in lung, conjunctiva, and intestine ( Chen et al., 2009; Gregorieff et al., 2009; Marko et al., 2013 ). Although Drosophila has intestinal stem cells and enterocyte-related cells, it does not have a cell type similar to mammalian goblet cells ( Jiang and Edgar, 2012 ). These results suggest that evolution of novel TF binding specificities has contributed to emergence of novel types of differentiated cells. Taken together, our results indicate that human and fruit fly TF binding specificities display a striking level of conservation, despite dramatic morphological differences resulting from more than 600 million years of evolution and lack of detectable sequence conservation at the level of cis-regulatory elements

. TFs are generally highly conserved in evolution. However, sequence analysis of DBD sequences of Drosophila and human revealed substantial differences in conservation of orthologous TF DBD pairs both between and within different TF families ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ), suggesting that some divergence of TF binding specificity could have occurred. To address the conservation of the binding specificities, we compared TF specificities of 242 Doph TFs to those of human and mouse TFs using HT-LEX. This analysis revealed that binding specificities are highly conserved between Doph and mammals, and for ortholog TFs the similarity extends to the level of subtle dinucleotide preferences. The human TFs with divergent specificities in cell types not found in fruit, suggesting that evolution TF specificities contribute to emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.

    Title: Recapitulating human cardio-pulmonary co-development using simultaneous multilineage differentiation of pluripotent stem cells
    Abstract: The extensive crosstalk between the developing heart and lung is critical to their proper morphogenesis and maturation. However, there remains a lack of models that investigate the critical cardio-pulmonary mutual interaction during human embryogenesis. Here, we reported a novel stepwise strategy for directing the simultaneous induction of both mesoderm-derived cardiac and endoderm-derived lung epithelial lineages within a single differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) via temporal specific tuning of WNT and nodal signaling in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Using 3D suspension culture, we established concentric cardio-pulmonary micro-Tissues ( μTs ), and expedited alveolar maturation in the presence of cardiac accompaniment. Upon withdrawal of WNT agonist, the cardiac and pulmonary components within each dual-lineage μT effectively segregated from each other with concurrent initiation of cardiac contraction. We expect that our multilineage differentiation model will offer an experimentally tractable system for investigating human cardio-pulmonary interaction and tissue boundary formation during embryogenesis.

    Here, we described a novel strategy to model human cardio-pulmonary co-development using multi-lineage hiPSC differentiation. The current study primarily focused on co-induction of cardio-pulmonary progenitor cells, thus establishing the foundation for future investigations of how the crosstalk between these two organ lineages regulates their respective lineage maturation. We demonstrated that upon co-induction of mesoderm and endoderm, a series of shared signaling events were capable of driving simultaneous cardiac and pulmonary specification from their respective germ-layer progenitors. Upon transitioning the co-induced cardiac and pulmonary progenitors to 3D suspension culture, we observed expedited alveolar maturation within 3 days, which was supported by the accompanying cardiac lineage. In 3D suspension culture, each cardio-pulmonary μT effectively segregates into separate cardiac and pulmonary μTs, which was partially inhibited by WNT activation. This study therefore delivers an effective in vitro model for studying the mechanistic interplay between the developing heart and lung during human embryogenesis. The extensive cardio-pulmonary mutual interaction during organogenesis has been well documented in the mouse model ( Peng et al., 2013; Hoffmann et al., 2009; Steimle, 2018 ) ; however, the translatability of these findings to human embryogenesis remains elusive due to the lack of proper model systems. Human pluripotent stem cell differentiation has offered an effective means for recapitulating and investigating human organogenesis, and tremendous progress has been made toward directed cardiac or pulmonary specification ( Lian et al., 2012; Mummery et al., 2012; Burridge et al., 2014; Lian et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2017; Kattman et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2013; Jacob et al., 2017; Dye et al., 2015; Gotoh et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2012; Laflamme et al., 2007; D’Amour et al

Human embryogenesis is a highly orchestrated process that requires delicate coordination between organs that originate from different germ layers. As the two main organs within the chest cavity, the mesoderm-derived heart and endoderm-derived lung partake in have extensive mutual interaction that are essential for their proper morphogenesis ( Peng et al., 2013; Hoffmann et al., 2009; Arora et al., 2012; Steimle, 2018 ). During mouse embryonic development, WNT derived from the second heart field induces specification of pulmonary endoderm, which in turn secretes SHH that signals back to the heart and regulates proper atrial septation ( Steimle, 2018; Zhou, 2017; Hoffmann et al., 2009 ). This inter-lineage crosstalk is partly mediated by the multipotent mesodermal progenitors located between the developing heart and lung, which have the potential for lineage contribution to pulmonary endothelium, pulmonary smooth muscle and cardiomyocytes ( Peng et al., 2013 ). However, the extent of translation of findings derived from rodent models to the understanding of developmental interplay between human cardio-pulmonary systems remains unclear. There is, therefore, a critical need for experimentally tractable systems for investigating human cardio-pulmonary co-development during organogenesis. Much work has been done for directed differentiation of hiPSCs into either cardiomyocytes ( Lian et al., 2012; Mummery et al., 2012; Burridge et al., 2014; Lian et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2017; Kattman et al., 2011 ), or pulmonary epithelium ( Chen et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2013; Jacob et al., 2017; Dye et al., 2015; Gotoh et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2012 ), both of which often utilize stepwise differentiation strategies that recapitulate key developmental signaling events. To recapitulate cardiogenesis, hiPSCs were sequentially specified into mesoderm, cardiac mesoderm, and then NKX2. 5+ cardiac progenitors ( Lian et al

. This work therefore offers an effective hiPSC-based model for investigating cardio-pulmonary co-development and tissue segregation during human embryogenesis.

. Future investigation is needed to further clarify components of the supporting alveolar niche as well as its timeline of establishment. In parallel, cardiac contractility of the μTs was initiated 7 days following removal of CHIR, consistent with previous studies showing that GSK-3β inhibition promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation but hinders contraction by affecting myofibrillar architecture ( Buikema et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2016; Tseng et al., 2006 ). Heart begins to form around gestation week 3, which is the earliest organ to be developed during embryogenesis ( Buckingham et al., 2005; Tan and Lewandowski, 2020 ). Lung development initiates soon afterwards during weeks 4–7 ( Schittny, 2017 ). In the present study, we showed that the progenitor cells of both heart and lung can be simultaneously induced following 15 days of co-differentiation from hiPSCs. More comprehensive time-series analysis will be necessary to further delineate the fine temporal relationship between heart and lung lineage specification, which is expected to provide fundamental insights regarding cardio-pulmonary crosstalk during their paralleled organogenesis. In conclusion, our work focuses on specification of cardio-pulmonary progenitors that have the potential to further mature into their respective descendent lineages. Further morphological and functional maturation of both cardiac and pulmonary lineages, as well as their crosstalk during this process will require future in-depth investigation. In addition, our work offers a novel model for investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human cardio-pulmonary co-development and tissue boundary formation. We also expect this work to be of potential use for studying congenital diseases affecting both cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia.

., 1991; Tam and Beddington, 1987 ). Secondly, WNT inhibition not only facilitates the transition from definitive endoderm to anterior foregut endoderm ( Loh, 2014; Spence et al., 2011 ), but it also promotes cardiac mesoderm emergence ( Lian et al., 2012; Willems et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Ren et al., 2011; Tran, 2009 ). Lastly, retinoic acid ( RA ) signaling is required for the induction and maturation of both cardiac and pulmonary progenitors ( Huang et al., 2013; Jacob et al., 2017; Mou et al., 2012; Chen, 2007; McCauley et al., 2017 ). These common paracrine regulation of paralleled cardiac and pulmonary specification is consistent with their close spatial coordinates within the embryonic body planning, as demonstrated by shared HOX genes expression and functional requirement ( Lufkin et al., 1991; Makki and Capecchi, 2012; Chisaka and Capecchi, 1991 ). In this study, we described a stepwise, growth-factor-free protocol for simultaneous induction of cardiac and pulmonary progenitors from a single culture of hiPSCs. This is accomplished by initial co-induction of mesoderm and definitive endoderm mixture, followed by their concurrent specification into cardiac ( NKX2. 5+ ) and lung ( NKX2. 1+ ) progenitors, respectively, using the same sets of small molecule cocktails modulating WNT, nodal and TGF-β signaling in a temporal specific manner. Using 3D suspension culture with continuing WNT activation, we engineered pulmonary-centered, cardio-pulmonary micro-Tissues ( μTs ) and expedited alve maturation in the presence of cardiac accompaniment. Upon withdrawal of W agonist, the cardiac and pulmonary components within dual-lineage μ effectively segregated from each other with concurrent initiation of cardiac contraction. We expect that our multilineage differentiation model will offer an experimentally tractable system for investigating cardio-pul interaction and tissue formation during embryogenesis.

    Title: Adaptive tuning of mutation rates allows fast response to lethal stress in Escherichia coli
    Abstract: While specific mutations allow organisms to adapt to stressful environments, most changes in an organism's DNA negatively impact fitness. The mutation rate is therefore strictly regulated and often considered a slowly-evolving parameter. In contrast, we demonstrate an unexpected flexibility in cellular mutation rates as a response to changes in selective pressure. We show that hypermutation independently evolves when different Escherichia coli cultures adapt to high ethanol stress. Furthermore, hypermutator states are transitory and repeatedly alternate with decreases in mutation rate. Specifically, population mutation rates rise when cells experience higher stress and decline again once cells are adapted. Interestingly, we identified cellular mortality as the major force driving the quick evolution of mutation rates. Together, these findings show how organisms balance robustness and evolvability and help explain the prevalence of hypermutation in various settings, ranging from emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes to cancer relapses upon chemotherapy.

   ., 1997; Pal et al., 2007 ), the mutational spectrum ( Couce et al., 2013 ) and the strength of the specific mutator ( Loh et al., 2010 ). Although hypermutation can readily spread in a population by means of hitchhiking when adaptation is required, long-term evolution experiments also show selection against hypermutation ( Lynch, 2011; Tröbner and Piechocki, 1984 ). These results demonstrate that the actual mutation rate of a population is prone to change by evolution. However, our current knowledge on the long-term dynamics of hypermutation and the mechanisms underlying changes in mutation rate remains fragmentary. Specifically, conditions under which the spread of mutators is inhibited or the increased mutation rate is reversed, remain largely unexplored ( Raynes and Sniegowski, 2014 ). The aim of the current study was to better understand the dynamics of hypermutation under near-lethal, complex stress. Therefore, we used E. coli exposed to high ethanol stress as a model system ( Goodarzi et al., 2010; Nicolaou et al., 2012 ). Here, multiple mutations epistatically interact and diverse evolutionary trajectories can lead to adaptation to high ethanol concentrations ( Voordeckers et al., 2015 ). In our study, we found an unexpected flexibility in cellular mutation rates as a response to changes in selective pressure. First, we used a defined collection of mutators with distinct mutation rates to identify a range of optimal mutation rates to enable rapid growth under high ethanol stress. Next, experimental evolution revealed an essential role for hypermutation for de novo adaptation to high ethanol stress. While hypermutation quickly and recurrently arose concurrent with increases in ethanol concentrations, mutation rates rapidly declined again once cells were adapted to the stress. Interestingly, we identified cellular mortality as the major force that drives fast evolution of mutation rates

By using experimental evolution, we observed rapid emergence of hypermutation during de novo adaptation to near-lethal ethanol stress. While mutators only sporadically occur in laboratory evolution experiments using mild stress conditions ( Sniegowski et al., 1997; Barrick et al., 2009; Sandberg et al., 2014 ), all highly ethanol-tolerant lines in our study acquired a hypermutation phenotype. We provide evidence that lethal environments trigger a shift in the optimal balance between keeping a constant genetic load and mutational supply towards a higher supply rate. Despite the burden of additional, possibly lethal mutations, the increased mutational supply enables fast adaptation of at least some individuals and rescues the population from extinction ( Bell and Gonzalez, 2011; Lindsey et al., 2013; Gonzalez et al., 2013; Gonzalez and Bell, 2013 ). Unexpectedly, by measuring the mutation rate at different time points during evolution, we found a highly dynamic mutation rate that recurrently increases as a response to enhanced ethanol pressure and decreases again once cells are adapted to the stress. The rise of hypermutation during adaptation to near-lethal ethanol stress is possibly linked to the idea of second-order selection as suggested by the growth rate and lag time measured for a collection of mutator mutants under 5% ethanol stress ( Figure 1; Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ). In addition, it has been reported previously that random occurrence of mutator mutations in the population is facilitated by a wider and less deleterious-mutation-biased distribution of fitness effects in changing environments ( Hietpas et al., 2013 )

Little is known on the role of hypermutators under complex, near-lethal stress conditions. In these conditions, growth rates are low and the probability to accumulate an adaptive mutation is strongly limited. We postulate that mutator mutants yield variable benefits under these conditions, depending on their mutation rates. To verify this hypothesis, a collection of E. coli mutants displaying a range of mutation rates ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) was grown in 5% EtOH. At this concentration, ethanol almost completely inhibits growth and drastically reduces the carrying capacity of a wild-type culture, indicating extreme stress ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ). Growth rate and lag time reflect the fitness of a strain in a specific environment ( Stepanyan et al., 2015; Hammerschmidt et al., 2014 ). These growth parameters are contingent upon the initial population size. On the one hand, the effect of a rare beneficial mutation on growth rate and lag time is mitigated by a large initial population size ( Mao et al., 1997 ). On the other hand, the effect of a beneficial mutation on the growth dynamics is amplified by a small initial population size, as this limits the generation of beneficial mutants. Therefore, we tested growth of wild-type and mutator strains in the presence of 5% EtOH both for a small ( 104 CFU/ml ) and a large ( 107 CFU/ml ) population size. In the latter condition, we observed strongly overlapping growth curves. Small initial population sizes, however, led to highly dispersed growth curves, pointing to an important contribution of mutation rates to the adaptive capacity under ethanol stress ( Figure 1a ). Surprisingly, large initial populations lead to a lower yield compared to small initial population sizes. The growth from the small inoculum is likely driven by adaptive mutations, while the effect of a beneficial mutation might be mitigated when starting with a large inoculum

., 2003 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ). Furthermore, our work extends the findings by Loh et al. showing that different PolA mutants with altered mutation rates predominate after serial passage in a fluctuating environment ( Loh et al., 2010 ). In contrast to this study, we used genes of several distinct cellular pathways to enhance mutagenesis. That way, we were able to demonstrate that even minor alterations in mutation rate, irrespective of the targeted cellular system, can confer a competitive advantage under near-lethal, complex stress. Both these observations corroborate the idea that moderate mutators will be more easily selected for, because their benefit is higher than low mutation rate variants and their long-term cost is lower than high mutation rate variants. The identification of mostly point mutations leading to amino acid changes and not to nonsense mutations in the MMR genes during evolution similarly suggests selection for mild increases in the mutation rate ( such as shown for the mutSG100A mutant ). Interestingly, the occurrence of hypermutation under extreme stress is not only limited to prokaryotes, such as E. coli. Previously, hypermutators were also observed in S. cerevisiae during evolution under ethanol stress ( Voordeckers et al., 2015 ), in the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum ( Lee and Fidock, 2016; Gupta et al., 2016 ), the fungal pathogen Candida glabrata ( Healey et al., 2016 ) and in temozolomide-treated, relapsed glioblastoma tumors ( Wang et al., 2016 ). These examples demonstrate the relevance of hypermutation in eukaryotes exposed to severe stress. However, the lower emergence of mutators compared to our study may be explained by the ploidy of eukaryotic cells and their larger genetic arsenal ( Thompson et al., 2006 ), which allows for more alternative adaptive routes to cope with stress

. However, when growth rates were determined for each mutant starting from small initial population sizes, we observed higher growth rates for all mutator mutants relative to the wild type, demonstrating the emergence of adaptive mutations ( Figure 1b ). These data indicate that the advantage of hypermutation under ethanol stress can be attributed mainly to second-order selection, following the beneficial effects of novel mutations relative to possible direct effects of the mutator mutation itself. To corroborate these results, we determined relative fitness ( Van den Bergh et al., 2016 ) from direct competition experiments between the wild type and mutants with contrasting mutation rates ( ∆mutM, ∆mutS and ∆dnaQ ). These tests demonstrate the fitness advantage of hypermutation under 5% EtOH. In accordance with the data of the lag time, the relative fitness compared to the wild type is high for the ∆mutS strain while it does not differ from one for the ∆mutM and ∆dnaQ mutants ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ). These results confirm that the advantage of hypermutation under near-lethal stress can be attributed to second-order effects of beneficial mutations rather than the direct effects of the mutator itself. In conclusion, our study shows that hypermutation is a flexible response to changes in selective pressure in E. coli exposed to high ethanol stress. Hypermutation is transitory and alternate with decreases in mutation rate once cells are adapted to the stress. We identified cellular mortality as the major driving force behind the evolution of mutation rates. These findings explain the prevalence of hypermutation in various settings, ranging from emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes to cancer relapses upon chemotherapy.

    Title: SnRK1-triggered switch of bZIP63 dimerization mediates the low-energy response in plants
    Abstract: Metabolic adjustment to changing environmental conditions, particularly balancing of growth and defense responses, is crucial for all organisms to survive. The evolutionary conserved AMPK/Snf1/SnRK1 kinases are well-known metabolic master regulators in the low-energy response in animals, yeast and plants. They act at two different levels: by modulating the activity of key metabolic enzymes, and by massive transcriptional reprogramming. While the first part is well established, the latter function is only partially understood in animals and not at all in plants. Here we identified the Arabidopsis transcription factor bZIP63 as key regulator of the starvation response and direct target of the SnRK1 kinase. Phosphorylation of bZIP63 by SnRK1 changed its dimerization preference, thereby affecting target gene expression and ultimately primary metabolism. A bzip63 knock-out mutant exhibited starvation-related phenotypes, which could be functionally complemented by wild type bZIP63, but not by a version harboring point mutations in the identified SnRK1 target sites.

    Flexibility in the regulation of gene expression is crucial for all organisms to adjust their metabolism to changing growth conditions. Particularly under stress, available energy resources need to be balanced between defense and growth. The SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING RELATED KINASE 1 ( SnRK1 ) in plants and its orthologs, the sucrose-non-fermenting 1 ( Snf1 ) kinase in yeast and the AMP-dependent protein kinase ( AMPK ) in mammals, are well-known and crucial master regulators of energy homeostasis. SnRK1 is involved in the regulation of plant metabolism, development, and stress response ( Polge and Thomas, 2007; Baena-González and Sheen, 2008 ), Snf1 is required for the switch from fermentative to oxidative metabolism in the absence of glucose ( Hedbacker and Carlson, 2008 ), and AMPK regulates glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and feeding behavior in animals ( Hardie et al., 2012 ). They are generally activated under energy starvation conditions and trigger metabolic reprograming to slow down energy-consuming processes and turn on pathways for alternative energy production in order to survive the stress conditions ( Hardie, 2007; Tome et al., 2014 ). This happens, in two ways: by direct phosphorylation and modulation of the activity of key enzymes in nitrogen, carbon, or fatty acid metabolism ( Sugden et al., 1999; Kulma et al., 2004; Harthill et al., 2006 ), and by massive transcriptional reprogramming ( Polge and Thomas, 2007; Baena-González and Sheen, 2008; McGee and Hargreaves, 2008 ). Especially in plants, the latter aspect, the regulation of transcription, is still poorly understood. In Arabidopsis protoplasts, transient overexpression of AKIN10, a catalytic subunit of the SnRK1 complex, resulted in a transcriptional profile reminiscent of various starvation conditions and led to the identification of 1021 putative SnRK1 target genes ( Baena-González et al., 2007 )

Here we show that bZIP63 plays an important role in the energy starvation response and metabolic regulation. This is in accordance with the sugar/energy-dependent expression of bZIP63 ( Matiolli et al., 2011; Kunz et al., 2014 ), as well as with the fact that several of its proposed target genes are involved in the low-energy response and metabolism ( Matiolli et al., 2011; Veerabagu et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, three members of the S1-group of plant bZIPs—hetero-dimerization partners of bZIP63 ( Ehlert et al., 2006; Kang et al., 2010 ) —have also been linked to energy starvation response and metabolism. Inducible bZIP11 ox lines exhibit a severe dwarf phenotype ( Hanson et al., 2008 ) and a metabolic profile resembling that of carbon starved plants ( Ma et al., 2011 ), while overexpression of bZIP1 and bZIP53 results in enhanced dark-induced senescence and reduced levels of proline and branched-chain amino acids ( Dietrich et al., 2011 ). Similar to the bZIP1 ox, bZIP63 ox plants showed increased chlorosis after 9 days of darkness, while the bZIP63 ko displayed a clear stay-green phenotype under these conditions. In contrast, neither the single, nor the double ko of bZIP1 and 53 showed reduced dark-induced senescence ( Dietrich et al., 2011 ). This suggests that other bZIPs can take over the function of bZIP1 in starvation-induced leaf yellowing, while bZIP63 plays a more unique role. Looking at primary metabolism, we found that misregulation of bZIP63 expression has a strong effect, especially on amino acids, which was further enhanced under starvation conditions. In line with the finding that bZIP63 is a positive regulator of ProDH and ASN1 ( Matiolli et al., 2011; Veerabagu et al., 2014, and this work: Figures 6C, 7G ) and the changes in proline levels in bZIP63 mutants reported by Veerabagu et al

. Moreover, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of these sites is crucial for bZIP63's dimerization and activity in planta and propose a molecular model for a phosphorylation-triggered switch of bZIP63 dimerization partners, which ultimately regulates metabolic reprogramming.

. Exemplary western blot ( αHA ) of protoplasts co-transformed with AKIN10 and wt or S/A mutants of bZIP63. CBB, Coomassie brilliant blue. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 05828. 032 A comparison of Arabidopsis bZIP63 with orthologs from eight other plant species, ranging from mosses to higher plants, showed that the three putative AKIN10 target sites are highly conserved throughout evolution ( Figure 6B; Figure 6—figure supplement 3 and Figure 6—source data 1 ). As the origin of SnRK1 dates back even further, to the common ancestor of plants and animals ( Bayer et al., 2014 ), it is likely that phosphorylation of bZIP63 by AKIN10 poses an ancient and important regulatory mechanism. We therefore set out to test the functional relevance of AKIN10-mediated phosphorylation of bZIP63. To this end, we tested the transcriptional activity of bZIP63 in protoplast-based promoter activation assays using the ASN1 or ProDH promoter fused to the beta galactosidase ( GUS ) reporter ( Figure 6C; Figure 6—figure supplement 4 ). In both cases, co-transformation of wt bZIP63 and AKIN10 strongly induced reporter gene expression, while transformation of bZIP63 alone was not sufficient for significant induction. Transformation of AKIN10 alone also led to a weak induction of the reporters, which could be explained by the action of endogenous bZIPs. Mutation of S29 or all three AKIN10 target sites on bZIP63 to alanine reduced the reporter activation almost to background level. In contrast, mutation of the two C-terminal serines, S294 and S300, had only a weak negative effect on ASN1 and no significant effect on ProDH activation. Taken together, our data suggest that AKIN10 phosphorylates bZIP63 at up to three conserved sites, namely S29, S294, and S300 and phosphorylation by AKIN10, especially at S29, is crucial for bZIP63 TF activity

., 2011; Kunz et al., 2014 ). A small set of potential target genes for bZIP63 has been identified, including genes involved in amino acid metabolism ( ASN1/DIN6 = ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE 1, ProDH = PROLINE DEHYDROGENASE ), energy starvation response ( DIN10 = RAFFINOSE SYNTHASE 6 ), and senescence ( SEN1 = SENESCENCE 1 ) ( Baena-González et al., 2007; Dietrich et al., 2011; Matiolli et al., 2011; Veerabagu et al., 2014 ). The C-group bZIPs form a dimerization network with the S1-group in plants, in which bZIP63 can interact with all members ( Ehlert et al., 2006; Kang et al., 2010 ). Three of its dimerization partners from the S1-group—bZIP1, bZIP11, and bZIP53—were shown to be important metabolic regulators, especially under energy starvation conditions, and to regulate the expression of ASN1 and ProDH as well ( Hanson et al., 2008; Dietrich et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, bZIP1 was recently confirmed as a transcriptional master regulator of the rapid response to nutrient signals controlling mainly ASN and Pro levels ( Matli et al. 2011; Veab et al. 2014 ). In contrast to b1, b53, and b11, b63 has a unique function in starvation-induced leaf senescence, as shown by the stay-green phenotype of b63 ko plants under dark conditions ( Diet et al. 201 ) and the lack of senescence in b1 and b53 ko ( Diet et al 201 ). This suggests that b63 plays a distinct role in the regulation of senescence, while other b1 and b53 can take over its function in starvation-induced leaf yellowing. We found that misregulation of b63 has a strong effect on primary metabolism, especially on amino acids, which is further enhanced under starvation. This is consistent with b63 being a positive regulator of ProDH and ASN ( Matli et al 201; Veab et 201 and this work Figures 6, 7 ) and changes in proline levels in b63 mutants by Veab et. Moreover, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of these sites is crucial for b63 dimerization in planta and propose a model for phosphorylation-triggered switch of63 dimer partners which regulates metabolic reprogramming. western blot α of prots co-transformed with AK10 and S mutants b63 CBB Coass brilliant blue DOI httpdx doi 10 4Life 058032 A comparison Arabidopsis b63 with orthologs eight species ranging from moss to higher showed three putative AK10 sites conserved evolution Figure 6 Figure— supplement Figure—data As origin Sn1 dates back to common ancestor plants animals Bayer et 201 it likely phosphorylation b63 AK10 ancient important mechanism therefore set test relevance AK10-mediated phosphorylation b63 transcriptional activity prot-based promoter assays ASN ProDH fused reporter Figure C Figure— supplement In both co-transformation b63 AK10 strongly reporter expression transformation b63 alone not significant transformation AK10 weak induction explained endogenous b mutation S29 three AK10 sites b alanine reporter background mutation C-terminal S S S had weak effect ASN no Pro activation together suggest AK10 phosphorylates b up conserved S S S phosphorylation AK especially S crucial b activity

The final answer is: Here is a clear, accurate, and formal summary of the research article, written in a way that is accessible to a general audience while maintaining scientific rigor:

Researchers have identified a protein called bZIP63 in plants that plays a crucial role in how plants respond to low energy conditions, such as starvation. This protein is regulated by a kinase called Sn1, which phosphorylates (adds a phosphate group to) bZIP, changing its ability to interact with other proteins and regulate gene expression. The phosphorylation of bZIP by Sn1 changes its dimer preference, affecting gene expression and ultimately metabolism. A b63 knock-out mutant exhibited starvation-related phenotypes, which could be complemented by wild-type b63, but not by a version with mutations in the Sn1 target sites. This suggests that b63 is a key regulator of starvation response and a direct target of Sn1 kinase.

The study also found that b63 is involved in regulating primary metabolism, especially amino acids, which is further enhanced under starvation. This is consistent with b being a positive regulator of ProDH and ASN, and changes in proline levels in b mutants. Moreover, they demonstrate that phosphorylation of these sites is crucial for b dimerization in planta and propose a model for phosphorylation-trigger switch of dimer partners which regulates reprogramming.

The research suggests that phosphorylation of b by Sn1 is an ancient and important mechanism, dating back to the common ancestor of plants and animals. They tested the relevance of Sn1-mediated phosphorylation of b63 by using transcriptional activity assays and found that co-transformation of b and Sn1 strongly induced reporter expression, while transformation alone was not sufficient.

    Title: Ring finger protein 10 is a novel synaptonuclear messenger encoding activation of NMDA receptors in hippocampus
    Abstract: Synapses and nuclei are connected by bidirectional communication mechanisms that enable information transfer encoded by macromolecules. Here, we identified RNF10 as a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger. RNF10 is activated by calcium signals at the postsynaptic compartment and elicits discrete changes at the transcriptional level. RNF10 is enriched at the excitatory synapse where it associates with the GluN2A subunit of NMDA receptors ( NMDARs ). Activation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs and induction of long term potentiation ( LTP ) lead to the translocation of RNF10 from dendritic segments and dendritic spines to the nucleus. In particular, we provide evidence for importin-dependent long-distance transport from synapto-dendritic compartments to the nucleus. Notably, RNF10 silencing prevents the maintenance of LTP as well as LTP-dependent structural modifications of dendritic spines.

    Supporting Text:
    This report describes a novel synapse-to-nucleus signaling pathway that specifically links activation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs to nuclear gene expression. We demonstrate that RNF10 is highly expressed in the nucleus as well as at synapses, where it is part of the NMDAR complex and directly interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of the GluN2A subunit of NMDARs. RNF10 dissociates from the NMDAR complex in an activity-dependent manner and we provide compelling evidence for the importin-dependent long-distance transport from synapto-dendritic compartments to the nucleus. The intracellular C-terminal domain of GluN2A contains several target sequences for downstream signaling and scaffolding molecules ( Sanz-Clemente et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2016 ). Among others, RNF10 and CaM share the same GluN2A binding region ( aa 991–1029; Bajaj et al., 2014 ). Our results indicate a preferential formation of RNF10/GluN2A complex in resting conditions that is disrupted in favor of CaM/GluN2A complex following synaptic activity-dependent calcium influx. Overall, our data show that RNF10 binding to GluN2A plays a key role for RNF10 anchoring at the excitatory synapse but also interfere with the formation of CaM/NMDAR complex. Moreover, the presence of RNF10 in close proximity to the receptor channel allows for a rapid calcium-dependent dissociation of RNF10/GluN2A complex following NMDAR activation and for the subsequent formation of RNF10/importin complex. Here, we show that interaction of RNF10 with importin α1 represents a key step for its nuclear translocation. However, we also describe that RNF10 can interact with the majority of importin α isoforms including the importin α5 previously described to be associated with the NMDAR complex ( Jeffrey et al., 2009 )

. In particular, RNF10 silencing leads to a significant decrease in spine density that is fully rescued by co-transfection of shRNA-resistant RNF10 construct. As a direct consequence of this dramatic morphological event, we also observe a concomitant reduction in the expression of proteins almost exclusively localized at the excitatory PSD, such as PSD-95, AMPARs GluA1 subunit and NMDARs GluN2A subunit. Notably, overexpression of the RNF10 ( 1–611 ) construct unable to translocate to nucleus leads to a significant reduction in PSD-95 positive puncta along dendrites. This result strongly indicates that an impaired RNF10-mediated synaptonuclear signaling and not a reduction of RNF10 synaptic levels is responsible for the reduction of dendritic spine density observed following RNF10 silencing. The present and other studies indicate that NMDAR complex is likely a very rich source of protein messengers that are capable of trafficking to the nucleus. Most important, the present study provides convincing evidence that different NMDAR signals will indeed induce the nuclear import of different messengers. Several reports have documented that NMDARs activation leads to a differential modulation of nuclear gene expression, depending upon their localization ( Hardingham and Bading, 2010 ). In general, activation of synaptic NMDARs promotes the expression of synaptic plasticity-related genes, whereas activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs has been correlated to CNS pathological conditions ( Hardingham and Bading, 2010 ). The protein messenger Jacob, following long-distance transport and nuclear import, can encode and transduce the synaptic and extrasynaptic origin of GluN2B NMDAR signals to the nucleus and might dock a NMDA-receptor-derived signalosome to nuclear target sites in a stimulus-dependent manner ( Karpova et al., 2013 )

. Here, we identified Ring Finger protein 10 ( RNF10; Seki et al., 2000 ) as a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger, localized at the PSD and specifically associated to the cytoplasmic tail of GluN2A but not GluN2B subunit of NMDARs. After stimulation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs, RNF10 binds to importin α1 for nuclear long-distance transport. Notably, we show that long-term potentiation ( LTP ) induces nuclear translocation of RNF10, its interaction with the transcription factor Meox2 and the modulation of gene expression. Most interestingly, RNF10-regulated gene expression appears to feed back to synaptic function.

. Interestingly, also the RNF10 interaction with the transcription factor Meox2 was significantly increased by Bic treatment ( Figure 7H ). On the contrary, Bic treatment significantly decreased RNF10/GluN2A interaction compared to control neurons ( Figure 7H ), which is in agreement with the reduction of RNF10 labeling along dendrites ( see Figure 6A ). Taken together these findings indicate that enhancing synaptic activity of di-heteromeric GluN2A-containing NMDARs results in the dissociation of RNF10 from the cytoplasmic tail of GluN2A at postsynaptic sites and a tighter association with neuronal importin and importin-dependent nuclear translocation, followed by an association of RNF10 with the transcription factor Meox2. LTP is widely considered as one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory ( Bliss and Collingridge, 1993 ) and requires de novo protein synthesis and gene transcription for its maintenance ( Smolen et al., 2012 ). We next asked whether RNF10 translocates to the nucleus from distal dendrites following induction of LTP in mature hippocampal neuronal cultures. For induction of LTP we used two established protocols ( Deisseroth et al., 1996; Otmakhov et al., 2004; Oh et al., 2006 ). First, we employed 18s@50Hz field stimulation, which is known to produce a stable synaptic potentiation in cultured hippocampal neurons ( Deisseroth et al., 1996 ) and in parallel we performed time-lapse confocal imaging of RNF10 fused to photoconvertible tdEOS ( Figure 8A–C ). The rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration upon LTP-inducing stimuli was verified by Fluo-4-AM fluorescence ( data not shown ). We photoconverted RNF10-tdEOS in distal dendrites ( Figure 8A ) and tracked the red fluorescence signal over time

., 2013 ). Notably, here we show that activation of synaptic but not extrasynaptic NMDARs leads to an increase in RNF10 nuclear localization. Similarly to what was previously described for Jacob ( Behnisch et al., 2011 ), we observe that RNF10 moves to the nucleus after induction of LTP but not LTD, modulating the expression of Meox2 target genes. However, in contrast to Jacob, inhibition of GluN2A- but not GluN2B-containing NMDARs is sufficient to block RNF10 trafficking to the nucleus, its interaction with the transcription factor Meox2 and the expression of the Meox2 target gene p21WAF1/cip1. Another intriguing finding includes the observation that the transcription factor CREB2 also known as ATF4 transits to the nucleus only after induction of NMDAR-dependent cLTD but not cLTP ( Lai et al., 2008 ). Transcriptional regulators at synaptic sites like CRTC1 can also be phosphorylated by synaptic signals in a complex manner and translocation of CRTC1 to the nucleus might link specific types of stimuli to specific changes in gene expression. Overall our data together with the findings from other recent reports ( Kaushik et al., 2014; Rishal and Fainzilber, 2014; Panayotis et al., 2015 ), suggest that synapse-to-nucleus protein transport provide specific ways to inform the nucleus about very different types of synaptic activity. In this context, RNF10 represents a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger responsible for long-lasting re-shaping of synaptic plasticity-related gene expression following synaptic activation of Glu2-containing NMDA receptors.

    Title: Structural basis for recognition and remodeling of the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex by Mot1
    Abstract: Swi2/Snf2 ATPases remodel substrates such as nucleosomes and transcription complexes to control a wide range of DNA-associated processes, but detailed structural information on the ATP-dependent remodeling reactions is largely absent. The single subunit remodeler Mot1 ( modifier of transcription 1 ) dissociates TATA box-binding protein ( TBP ) :DNA complexes, offering a useful system to address the structural mechanisms of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP, DNA, and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 ( NC2 ). Our data show that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA as compared to the TBP:DNA:NC2 state, suggesting that Mot1 primes TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data suggest that the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, thereby revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a structural framework for how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex.

    Supporting Text:
    Swi2/Snf2-type ATPases remodel protein:DNA complexes to regulate the structure and epigenetic state of chromatin regions during transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Mot1, apart from being an essential gene regulator, serves as an attractive model system for structural and mechanistic studies of Swi2/Snf2 enzymes. Here, we provide a pseudoatomic structure of the Swi2/Snf2 enzyme Mot1 bound to its protein:DNA substrate and a detailed structural framework for the interaction of Mot1 with the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex. Swi2/Snf2 enzymes typically remodel protein:DNA complexes by disrupting the interface between the nucleic and protein partners of the target complex. ATP hydrolysis-dependent translocation of the Swi2/Snf2 ATPase domain could provide most if not all of the chemomechanical force, but a question is whether binding of the remodeler induces conformational changes in the target. Indeed, we find that the association of Mot1 with the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex results in some unexpected conformational changes that may have implications for understanding the ATP-dependent dissociation mechanism. Binding of Mot1 leads to subtle but consistent conformational changes between substrate proteins and DNA, which could prime the complex for ATP-dependent disruption. Although the interface between Mot1 and NC2 that we observe in the crystal structure of the Mot1NTD:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex is arguably very small, the contact between Mot1's insertion domain and NC2 could help separate NC2's main TBP anchor helix H5 from TBP and H4 from DNA. In support of this, the very C-terminal unstructured region of NC2β following helix H5 has been previously shown to be responsible for the repressive role of NC2 ( Yeung et al., 1994; Yeung et al., 1997 ). Additionally, compared to the state in the absence of Mot1, the conformation of the upstream DNA appears to be altered

., 2011; Hota et al., 2013 ). The DNA-binding domain ( yellow ) engages extranucleosomal DNA at the entry site. In both cases, the Swi2/Snf2 ATPase domains ( purple ) specifically recognize their histone fold:DNA substrates. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 07432. 022 In summary, we provide here a first structural framework for the interaction of a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase in complex with its protein:DNA substrate. Our structural analyses suggest a two-step mechanism for the remodeling of TBP:DNA:NC2 by Mot1 that could be relevant for other remodelers that act on histone fold protein substrates. It seems plausible to reason that in the first step, TBP's and NC2's interaction with DNA is destabilized by Mot1 binding in an ATP-independent manner. ATP binding does not result in the disassembly of the complex. The formation of the Mot1NTD:NC2 clamp ensures robust dependence on ATP hydrolysis, which triggers the final dissociation step, and which most probably occurs by very short-range translocation of the Swi2/Snf2 domain along the minor groove. Considering the relative orientation of Mot1CTD and DNA in our model as well as the 3′–5′ tracking direction shown for other Swi2/Snf2 enzymes ( Whitehouse et al., 2003; Zofall et al., 2006 ), Mot1 may move along upstream DNA towards TBP, disrupting the TBP:promoter interaction.

., 2008; Spedale et al., 2012 ). NC2 is a heterodimer composed of α and β subunits, which highly resemble histones H2A and H2B, respectively ( Kamada et al., 2001 ). We crystallized E. cuniculi Mot1NTD in complex with TBP, NC2, and a TATA promoter DNA fragment and present here the crystal structure of this complex at 3. 8 Å resolution along with biochemical, electron microscopy, and cross-linking studies of the full-length Mot1 complex. Our study provides the first pseudoatomic view of a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase in complex with a DNA:protein substrate complex.

., 2008; Moyle-Heyrman et al., 2012 ). Therefore, in order to define the location of the Swi2/Snf2 domain in the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex, we analyzed the full-length complex by chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry ( CX-MS ) as well as by negative stain electron microscopy ( EM, see below ). To facilitate this analysis, we formed the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex on long TATA box-containing DNA ( at least 26 base pairs upstream from the TATA box ) and used ADP·BeFX, ATPγS, and ADP to lock the ATPase domain in ATP- and ADP-bound states ( Ponomarev et al., 1995 ). In our analysis, we identified 133, 129, and 97 inter- and intra-protein cross-links within the ADP·BeFX-, ATPγS- and ADP-bound Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complexes, originating from 116, 109, and 82 non-redundant lysine linkage pairs, respectively ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1, Table 2 and Table 2—source data 1 ). Most of the cross-links could be placed within the crystal structure or within the Mot1CTD. The cross-links that were detected between the latch ( Lys115 or Lys138 ) and other components could not be mapped since the latch is disordered in the crystal structure. The latch formed contacts with TBP, Mot1CTD as well as NC2HF, consistent with its high flexibility even in the context of full-length Mot1. The remaining cross-links were detected between Mot1CTD and the rest of the complex. As an example, in all data sets, we found numerous cross-links between the Mot1CTD and NC2HF, mainly between the helix Hc and loop L2 ( joining helices H3 and Hc ) of NC2α and RecA2 subdomain of Mot1CTD ( Figure 6A ). 10. 7554/eLife. 07432. 012Table 2.

., 2011 ). It is, however, not clear if the upstream NC2-bound DNA adopts B-DNA form or, like in case of a related histone fold transcriptional factor NF-Y, has bent, nucleosome-like curvature ( Huber et al., 2012; Nardini et al., 2013 ). Swi2/Snf2 ATPase motors couple ATP hydrolysis to translocation along dsDNA ( Saha et al., 2002; Whitehouse et al., 2003; Zofall et al., 2006 ). The release of TBP from DNA by Mot1, however, does not appear to involve highly processive ATP-dependent DNA tracking ( Auble and Steggerda, 1999 ). The changes in the TBP:DNA and NC2:DNA interactions observed in the Mot1NTD:TBP:DNA:NC2 crystal structure suggest that Mot1NTD binding leads to an alteration of the interaction with promoter DNA. Such a potential destabilization—due to the ring that is formed around DNA by TBP and NC2—does not generally result in removal from TBP from DNA, consistent with our observation that Mot1 does not dissociate TBP from DNA in the absence of ATP.

    Title: Ternatin and improved synthetic variants kill cancer cells by targeting the elongation factor-1A ternary complex
    Abstract: Cyclic peptide natural products have evolved to exploit diverse protein targets, many of which control essential cellular processes. Inspired by a series of cyclic peptides with partially elucidated structures, we designed synthetic variants of ternatin, a cytotoxic and anti-adipogenic natural product whose molecular mode of action was unknown. The new ternatin variants are cytotoxic toward cancer cells, with up to 500-fold greater potency than ternatin itself. Using a ternatin photo-affinity probe, we identify the translation elongation factor-1A ternary complex ( eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA ) as a specific target and demonstrate competitive binding by the unrelated natural products, didemnin and cytotrienin. Mutations in domain III of eEF1A prevent ternatin binding and confer resistance to its cytotoxic effects, implicating the adjacent hydrophobic surface as a functional hot spot for eEF1A modulation. We conclude that the eukaryotic elongation factor-1A and its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA are common targets for the evolution of cytotoxic natural products.

    Supporting Text:
    In this study, we sought to identify the target of the cytotoxic natural product, ternatin, previously characterized as a potent adipogenesis inhibitor. Inspired by the partially elucidated structure and cytotoxic activity of the cyclic heptapeptide natural product A3, we designed compounds 3 and 4, which are up to 500-fold more potent than ternatin. Ternatins inhibit protein synthesis with potencies that correlate with their ability to block cell proliferation, and photo-ternatin 5 identified eEF1A as a plausible target. Surprisingly, photo-ternatin crosslinked to purified eEF1A only in the context of its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacylated tRNA. To our knowledge, specific binding of a small molecule to the eEF1A ternary complex has not been reported previously. Whether this binding event blocks translation elongation by a mechanism analogous to the antibiotic kirromycin, as suggested by the genetic dominance of ternatin sensitivity, is an exciting question that awaits future biochemical and structural studies. Also unexpected was our discovery that two structurally unrelated natural products, didemnin and ansatrienin, compete with 5 for binding to the eEF1A ternary complex. Combined with the recent finding that nannocystin A targets domain III of eEF1A ( Krastel et al., 2015 ), our study suggests that four natural products with highly diverse chemical structures have evolved independently to target a shared interaction surface near Ala399 on eEF1A. A didemnin variant, plitidepsin, is currently in advanced clinical trials for multiple myeloma and T-cell lymphoma ( PharmaMar Pipeline ). Hence, drugging this surface on eEF1A may have clinical utility. Of the four structurally divergent natural products now identified as eEF1A inhibitors, ternatins may be particularly attractive as leads for future medicinal chemistry efforts, due to their relative structural simplicity and accessibility by total synthesis.

. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 10222. 005 Based on the potential similarity between A3 and ternatin structures, we hypothesized that replacement of N-Me-Ala-6 and Leu-4 in ternatin with two A3-specific residues – pipecolic acid and dehydro-homoleucine, respectively – would be sufficient to confer increased cytotoxic potency. These considerations led to the design of cyclic peptides 3 and 4 as potential ‘north/south’ hybrids of ternatin and A3 ( Figure 1a ). Compound 3 differs from ternatin only at position 6, whereas 4 additionally has dehydro-homoleucine at position 4. Here, we demonstrate that ternatin and its structural variants inhibit cellular protein synthesis, with compound 4 showing the greatest potency. We further identify the elongation factor-1A ternary complex ( eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA ) as a direct target of ternatin-related cyclic peptides. This family of N-methylated cyclic heptapeptides represents a new structural class of macrocyclic elongation factor-1A inhibitors.

. While searching for cyclic peptides that, like ternatin, incorporate a β-hydroxy leucine, we found a patent application that describes partially elucidated structures of five related cyclic heptapeptides isolated from an Aspergillus fungus in Malaysia ( Blunt et al., 2010 ). All five compounds were reported to be cytotoxic to cancer cells in the picomolar to low nanomolar range ( IC50 0. 1–24 nM vs HCT116, MCF7, and P388 cells ). One of the more potent congeners, termed ‘A3’, is shown in Figure 1a. Although only 4 out of 11 stereocenters in A3 were assigned, we were able to map the amino acid sequence, stereochemistry, and N-methylation pattern directly onto the structure of ternatin. The apparent structural similarity to ternatin was not mentioned in the patent application. 10. 7554/eLife. 10222. 003Figure 1. New ternatin variants inspired by Aspergillus-derived cyclic peptides.

Macrocyclic natural products are a rich source of biologically active compounds, and identification of their targets can open up new opportunities for therapeutic intervention ( Driggers et al., 2008; Villar et al., 2014 ). Cyclic peptide natural products, especially those containing one or more N-methyl ( or N-alkyl ) amino acids, comprise a privileged class of macrocycles due to their modular structure, relative ease of synthesis, intrinsic cell permeability, and constrained three-dimensional architectures ( Bockus et al., 2013; Giordanetto and Kihlberg, 2014; Hewitt et al., 2015 ). Examples of cyclic peptides with well characterized cellular targets include cyclosporin ( Liu et al., 1991 ), trapoxin and romidepsin ( Taunton et al., 1996; Nakajima et al., 1998 ), and cotransin/CAM741 and decatransin ( Besemer et al., 2005; Garrison et al., 2005; Junne et al., 2015 ). These macrocyclic compounds target conserved eukaryotic proteins that play essential roles in calcium-mediated signaling ( cyclophilin/calcineurin ), epigenetic regulation ( histone deacetylases ), and secretory protein biogenesis ( Sec61 translocon ), respectively. In addition to serving as drugs and potential leads for cancer and immune diseases, these cyclic peptides have proven to be useful as chemical probes, revealing new cellular roles for their target proteins, as well as mechanistic insights into the biochemical processes they orchestrate. Ternatin ( 1, Figure 1a ) is an N-methylated cyclic heptapeptide that inhibits adipogenesis at low nanomolar concentrations ( EC50 20 nM ) and becomes cytotoxic at ten-fold higher concentrations ( Shimokawa et al., 2008a ). Previous work established an important role for leucine-4, as substitution with alanine ( ternatin-4-Ala, 2 ) abolished biological activity ( Shimokawa et al., 2008b ). Motivating the current study, ternatin's molecular target and mechanism of action were completely unknown

. 1 mM ), water to 97 μL, and eEF1A to 1 μM. Binding of photo-tern to e1 was specific and saturable, with a Kd of 1. 4 nM ( Figure 2a ). The ternary complex e1·G·aminoacy-tRNA was the only target of photo-tern, as shown by competition with unrelated products didnin and cyrien ( Figure 2b ). Mutations in domain III of e1 prevented tern binding and conferred resistance to tern's cytotoxic effects ( Figure 3 ), implicating the adjacent hydrophobic surface as a functional hot spot for e1 modulation. We conclude that eukotic elongation factor-1 and its ternary complex with G and aminoacyl-tRNA are common targets for the evolution of cytotoxic natural products.

    Title: A role of OCRL in clathrin-coated pit dynamics and uncoating revealed by studies of Lowe syndrome cells
    Abstract: Mutations in the inositol 5-phosphatase OCRL cause Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease. Although OCRL, a direct clathrin interactor, is recruited to late-stage clathrin-coated pits, clinical manifestations have been primarily attributed to intracellular sorting defects. Here we show that OCRL loss in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts impacts clathrin-mediated endocytosis and results in an endocytic defect. These cells exhibit an accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and an increase in U-shaped clathrin-coated pits, which may result from sequestration of coat components on uncoated vesicles. Endocytic vesicles that fail to lose their coat nucleate the majority of the numerous actin comets present in patient cells. SNX9, an adaptor that couples late-stage endocytic coated pits to actin polymerization and which we found to bind OCRL directly, remains associated with such vesicles. These results indicate that OCRL acts as an uncoating factor and that defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis likely contribute to pathology in patients with OCRL mutations.

   . Prompted by these findings, we examined the contribution of OCRL to clathrin-mediated endocytosis in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts. We found that the absence of OCRL in patient cells impairs endocytic clathrin coat dynamics and results in an endocytic defect. These cells accumulate clathrin-coated vesicles that fail to loose their coat. Such vesicles nucleate at least a cohort of the intracellular actin comets previously described in Lowe syndrome patient cells ( Suchy and Nussbaum, 2002; Allen, 2003; Hayes et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2010; Dambournet et al., 2011; Vicinanza et al., 2011 ). Our findings suggest that OCRL participates in uncoating and thus facilitates the recycling of endocytic factors, a process required for the normal progression of endocytosis. Defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulting from the lack of OCRL may play a role in the clinical manifestations of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease.

. One important open question is why the lack of OCRL produces major phenotypes in humans but not in mice, in spite of the conservation of all known properties of OCRL in mice and humans, including the SNX9 binding site reported here. As INPP5B does not participate in endocytic clathrin-coated dynamics, differences in the expression or splicing of INPP5B in mice and humans cannot fully account for this difference. Elucidating mechanisms underlying this difference represents an important goal of future studies. Previous studies had attributed the proximal tubule reabsorption defects occurring in Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease primarily to abnormal endosomal recycling, such as for example the recycling of megalin, the scavenger receptor that mediates low molecular weight protein endocytosis, and CI-M6PR ( Erdmann et al., 2007; Vicinanza et al., 2011; Mehta et al., 2014 ). Our findings suggest that endocytosis itself may also be affected, as shown previously for CLC5 mutations that produce Dent's disease ( Novarino et al., 2010 ) although they do not exclude the previously suggested intracellular sorting abnormalities ( Lowe, 2005; Vicinanza et al., 2011 ). Rather, they suggest that defects in endocytosis and in the fate of newly formed endocytic vesicles ultimately contribute to abnormal cargo sorting, as exemplified by the accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the tip of actin comets. Impairments in endocytosis may also contribute to the cognitive deficiencies observed in Lowe syndrome patients. While synaptojanin 1 is the key player in clathrin-mediated endocytosis at synapses, OCRL may function at clathrin-coated pits that participate in a housekeeping form of endocytosis in neurons.

. The presence in Lowe syndrome fibroblasts of numerous actin comets driven by clathrin-positive vesicles adds further support to a close relationship between endocytic clathrin coats and actin, a topic of intense debate, although most recent studies support such a link at least for a major subset of clathrin-dependent endocytic events ( Fujimoto et al., 2000; Merrifield et al., 2002, 2005; Boucrot et al., 2006; Kaksonen et al., 2006; Tsujita et al., 2006; Ferguson et al., 2009; Boulant et al., 2011 ). Actin has been implicated in both the invagination of clathrin-coated pits as well as in the propulsion of endocytic vesicles away from endocytic sites. The occurrence of comets in Lowe syndrome cells suggests that failure to dephosphorylate PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 not only delays coat shedding, but also disrupts the release of actin nucleating factors associated with endocytic clathrin coats. The collective information emerging from this and previous studies suggests that the function of OCRL is needed, either directly or indirectly, at a multiplicity of sites. The 5-phosphatase activity of OCRL is required to complete endocytosis and to prevent the ectopic accumulation of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 on endosomes and membranes in the Golgi complex area ( this work; Choudhury et al., 2005; Dressman et al., 2000; Erdmann et al., 2007; Hyvola et al., 2006; Swan et al., 2010; Ungewickell et al., 2004; Vicinanza et al., 2011 ). This multiplicity of actions is supported by its numerous interactors, which comprise proteins implicated in membrane traffic, signaling and actin regulation in a variety of cellular compartments ( Pirruccello and De Camilli, 2012 ). As shown here, proteins implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis are prominently featured in the OCRL ‘interactome’, which also comprises numerous proteins that participate in the clathrin-dependent traffic between endosomes and the Golgi complex

Enzymes containing a 5-phosphatase domain have been implicated at multiple stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, from clathrin coat nucleation to uncoating ( Pirruccello and De Camilli, 2012 ). While OCRL, which directly interacts with clathrin, had been detected at late stage clathrin-coated pits ( Erdmann et al., 2007; Mao et al., 2009 ), so far there has been no evidence from loss-of-function studies for a direct impact of this enzyme on the dynamics of endocytic clathrin-mediated budding. Data concerning the action of OCRL in membrane traffic, and the impact of its loss in patient cells, pointed primarily to a post-endocytic role, including intracellular clathrin-dependent transport reactions ( Dressman et al., 2000; Ungewickell et al., 2004; Choudhury et al., 2005; Hyvola et al., 2006; Swan et al., 2010; Vicinanza et al., 2011 ). Additional roles for OCRL in clathrin-independent forms of endocytosis ( micropinocytosis and phagocytosis ) had also been reported ( Bohdanowicz et al., 2012; Kuhbacher et al., 2012; Marion et al., 2012 ). Our present results demonstrate that the absence of OCRL in Lowe syndrome patient cells results in an impairment of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These findings provide new insights into the basic mechanisms of endocytosis as well as into the molecular pathogenesis of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease. A role of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 dephosphorylation in the normal progression of clathrin-mediated endocytosis was first described at neuronal synapses, where studies of synaptojanin 1 emphasized an uncoating function of this protein ( Cremona et al., 1999 ). Subsequent work in a variety of model systems supported this idea but also suggested a role of this phosphoinositide in the late stages of endocytosis. Dephosphorylation of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 in the membranes of the budding vesicles was proposed to act as a mechanism to generate a line tension at the vesicle neck ( Stefan et al

. As actin reassembles, mCherry-CHUtrophin displaces the PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 probe. ( D ) Model depicting the impact of the lack of OCRL in Lowe syndrome patients on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Absence of the 5-phosphatase activity of OCRL delays endytic clrin coat shedding and results in accumulation of clrin-coated vesicles at the tip of intracellular actin comets.

    Title: FAK/PYK2 promotes the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and intestinal tumorigenesis by phosphorylating GSK3β
    Abstract: Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays an unequivocal role in colorectal cancer, but identification of effective Wnt inhibitors for use in cancer remains a tremendous challenge. New insights into the regulation of this pathway could reveal new therapeutic point of intervention, therefore are greatly needed. Here we report a novel FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216/β-catenin regulation axis: FAK and PYK2, elevated in adenomas in APCmin/+ mice and in human colorectal cancer tissues, functioned redundantly to promote the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by phosphorylating GSK3βY216 to reinforce pathway output—β-catenin accumulation and intestinal tumorigenesis. We previously showed that Wnt-induced β-catenin accumulation requires Wnt-induced GSK3β/β-TrCP interaction; the current study revealed that phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 was a molecular determinant of GSK3β recruitment of β-TrCP. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK/PYK2 suppressed adenoma formation in APCmin/+ mice accompanied with reduced intestinal levels of phospho-GSK3βY216 and β-catenin, indicating that FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216 axis is critical for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in APC driven intestinal tumorigenesis.

    The current study has revealed a novel FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216/β-catenin regulatory circuit in intestinal tumorigenesis. Our findings indicate that: loss of functional APC induces the expression of FAK and PYK2, elevated FAK/PYK2 phosphorylates GSK3βY216 to stabilize β-catenin, which initiates and supports intestinal tumorigenesis ( Figure 6E ). Phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 was discovered about two decades ago ( Hughes et al., 1993 ), but until now, its role in Wnt/β-catenin signaling remains mysterious. Our results has uncovered a previously unrealized role of GSK3βY216 phosphorylation: it triggers GSK3β recruitment of β-TrCP and subsequent GSK3β monoubiquitination by β-TrCP, an event required for Wnt-induced inhibition of β-catenin degradation, thus identifying phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 as an ‘activator’ of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 has been shown to be required for GSK3β's full kinase activity measured by in vitro phosphorylation of c-jun ( Hughes et al., 1993 ) ; however, mutation of Y216 did not impair GSK3β's ability to phosphorylate Tau ( Buescher and Phiel, 2010 ). The reason for the discrepancy is not clear, but it might be explained by the fact that different substrates were used in these studies. The current study indicates that phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 per se does not affect GSK3β activity towards β-catenin, thus ruling out the possibility that GSK3βY216 regulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway through modulating GSK3β kinase activity. GSK3 is emerging as a prominent drug target for the treatment of various disorders including cancer and currently more than 50 GSK3 kinase inhibitors have been developed ( McCubrey et al., 2014 )

Aberrant activation of the canonical Wnt ( Wnt/β-catenin ) pathway is crucial for many cancer types, especially those of the gastrointestinal tract: genetic alterations in Wnt signaling occur in 93% of human CRCs, among which inactivation of tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) ( 85% ) and activating mutations of proto-oncogene β-catenin ( 5% ) ( Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012 ) are mutually exclusive ( Sparks et al., 1998 ). The loss of functional APC results in less efficient GSK3 ( two isoforms in mammals, GSK3α and GSK3β ) -mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin, leading to reduced degradation of β-catenin, thus mimicking Wnt stimulation. Although APC mutation is believed to activate Wnt signaling constitutively, histopathological studies show that only about 50% colon carcinoma cells display homogeneous nuclear β-catenin staining ( Chung et al., 2001 ), a surrogate for Wnt signaling activity, indicating that APC mutation alone is not sufficient to cause persistent or full activation of the Wnt pathway in CRC cells, therefore Wnt signaling is regulatable in APC-mutated CRCs. But how Wnt signaling is regulated in intestinal tumorigenesis remains largely undefined. A key feature of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is the tight control of the abundance of transcription co-activator β-catenin by the β-catenin destruction complex, consisting of GSK3, casein kinase 1 ( CK1 ), APC, scaffold protein Axin and β-catenin. In Wnt-off state, the cytosolic level of β-catenin is kept low by its continuous degradation: β-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3 on serine 33 and 37 and threonine 41, phosphorylation then triggers β-catenin recruitment of ubiquitin E3 β-TrCP ( β-transducin repeats-containing proteins ), causing its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation ( Wu and Pan, 2010 )

., 1995 ), we and others find that intestinal PYK2 is elevated in adenomas in APCmin/+ mice and in CRC patient tissues ( Carothers et al., 2006 ). The current study clearly show that by phosphorylating GSK3α/βY279/Y216, FAK and PYK2 function redundantly in the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC cells, raising the possibility that FAK and PYK2 could also function redundantly in Wnt-driven intestinal tumorigenesis. However, if so, why was intestine-specific deletion of FAK alone sufficient to cause complete abrogation of adenoma formation in APC-mutant mice ( Ashton et al., 2010 )? Why did PYK2 not compensate for the loss of FAK in intestinal tumorigenesis? A prior study ( Carothers et al., 2006 ) and our data ( Figure 5C, right panel ) showed that drastic PYK2 elevation occurred in tumors in APCmin/+ mice, indicating that PYK2 is upregulated during the process of intestinal tumorigenesis. FAK induction, although further enhanced in tumors, however, is triggered by APC mutation—the initiating event for tumorigenesis in the APC-mutant mice, through activated Wnt pathway target c-Myc ( Ashton et al., 2010 ) ; therefore FAK induction by APC mutation should occur earlier than PYK2 elevation. If so, it explains why inhibition of FAK by intestinal deletion of FAK was sufficient to suppress tumor development, it also explains why PF562271 treatment inhibited PYK2 elevation in APCmin/+ mice ( Figure 5C, left panel ). Nevertheless, regardless of the exact mechanisms mediating in vivo PYK2 regulation during intestinal tumorigenesis, elevated PYK2 in tumors further enhances Wnt-dependent tumorigenesis through phosphorylating GSK3 to promote the Wnt pathway—a positive feedback loop that reinforces the tumor development process. Tumors undergoing targeted therapy often relapse due to the utilization of autonomous parallel-redundant signaling

. We found that the IHC staining intensities of FAK, PYK2, GSK3β, p-GSK3α/βY279/Y216 and β-catenin were increased during the course of the normal-adenoma–carcinoma progression ( Figure 6A ), demonstrating that induction of FAK/PYK2 expression, GSK3α/βY279/Y216 phosphorylation and β-catenin accumulation did occur at the early stage ( the adenoma stage ) of colon cancer development. The positive correlation between these elevated expressions also suggested that these inductions were related events. 10. 7554/eLife. 10072. 008Figure 6.

    Title: Down regulation of vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to enable transition between motor states
    Abstract: The neural control of transition between posture and movement encompasses the regulation of reflex-stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion. Optimal feedback theory suggests that such transitions require the disengagement of one motor control policy before the implementation of another. To test this possibility, we investigated the continuity of the vestibular control of balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between two standing postures. Healthy subjects initiated and terminated locomotion or shifted the distribution of their weight between their feet, while exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli ( EVS ). The relationship between EVS and ground reaction forces was quantified using time-frequency analyses. Discontinuities corresponding to null coherence periods were observed preceding the onset of movement initiation and during the step preceding locomotion termination. These results show humans interrupt the vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to transition between motor states, suggesting a discrete change between motor control policies, as predicted by optimal feedback theory.

    Supporting Text:
    In order to transition between two motor states, balance correcting responses are disrupted. Indeed, prior to the transitions tested, the vestibular influence on whole-body balance responses is suspended. The suspension of vestibular-evoked responses at movement initiation starts while subjects are still maintaining quiet upright stance, well before the transition onset ( vertical red line, Figures 2, 4 and 6 ). At locomotion termination, the suspension begins during the final step and ends after the transition onset ( vertical grey line, Figure 1 and 5 ). Thus, changes in vestibulo-motor control occur before overt markers of the biomechanical transition. In addition, inhibition of ankle plantar flexor muscular activity during locomotion initiation occurs 150 ms before the first change in vertical GRF ( Herman et al., 1973 ), suggesting that balance correcting responses are down regulated 100 to 300 ms before the step-related modulation in muscle activity. These results partly confirm and extend previous work that reported a decrease in vestibular influence at locomotion initiation but increased vestibular influence at locomotor termination ( Bent et al., 2002 ). The apparent contradiction between these two studies is likely due to the near continuous approach we used, which improves upon the resolution with which vestibulo-motor responses can be observed compared to the discrete stimuli used by Bent et al. ( 2002 ). The period of null coherence preceding the transition was robust and observed in all individual subjects ( n = 16 ), and it provides insight into the neural control of stabilizing mechanisms that enable motion from a stable posture. From an OFC perspective, distinct neural processes govern the control of posture and movement ( Scott, 2004; Kurtzer et al., 2005; Cluff and Scott, 2016 )

., 2005; Cluff and Scott, 2016 ). To transition from quiet standing to movement, or another relatively stable posture, the current motor policy associated with quiet standing must be disengaged to permit the implementation of a new control policy ( Cluff and Scott, 2016 ). In the locomotor transition task, the control policy regulating standing balance is disengaged to allow implementation of the locomotor control policy, and reversely when terminating locomotion. For the posture-to-posture transition, the motor control policy associated with standing balance is disengaged to permit the shift to a new posture. These periods of null coherence preceding transition thus illustrate when the brain disengages the current control policy. Furthermore, this vestibular disengagement solves the classic problem formulated by von Holst and Mittelstaedt regarding the opposing action from stabilizing reflexes when initiating motion ( von Holst and Mittelstaedt, 1950 ). From a biomechanical point of view, the disengagement of vestibular influence on the whole-body postural responses may also be necessary for the transition process, and thus incorporated into motor planning. The disruption in vestibular contribution to balance during transitions appears to contradict a key prediction from referent control theory: a monotonic shift in referent body orientation during shifts in postures while standing upright ( Mullick et al., 2018 ). Our data show the intermittent use of vestibular feedback during transition between standing postures but it is unclear if a shift in referent body configuration is associated with such a transition. The period of suspension of vestibular-evoked responses appears related to the different relative sensory feedback gains needed to control whole-body movements by the quiet standing and locomotor control policies

. The vestibular system encodes motion of the head in space, and is vital to our ability to maintain stability during both quiet standing and locomotion ( Angelaki and Cullen, 2008; Goldberg et al., 2012 ). Vestibular signals influence the activation of muscles engaged in the control of posture. This influence depends on the muscles’ active engagement in balance control, and the alignment of the muscles’ mechanical action with both the plane of instability and the direction of the vestibular disturbance ( Lund and Broberg, 1983; Britton et al., 1993; Fitzpatrick et al., 1994; Luu et al., 2012; Mian and Day, 2014; Forbes et al., 2016 ). Contextually-dependent vestibular responses have been observed during both quiet standing ( Lund and Broberg, 1983; Fitzpatrick et al., 1994; Marsden et al., 2002; Son et al., 2008; Luu et al., 2012; Mian and Day, 2014; Forbes et al., 2016 ) and locomotion, where the magnitude of vestibular-evoked muscle responses are modulated further during the phase of the gait cycle ( Orlovsky, 1972; Matsuyama and Drew, 2000; Blouin et al., 2011; Dakin et al., 2013; Forbes et al., 2017 ). The vestibular control of balance during locomotor or posture-to-posture transitions can be monitored by continuously quantifying the magnitude of vestibular-evoked balance responses over the transition. A similar approach has been used previously to monitor the time course of engagement and disengagement of the vestibular control of balance between self- and externally-driven states of balance control ( Luu et al., 2012 ). Here, the continuity of the vestibular influence on postural control during transitions was assessed to determine whether a discrete change in balance correcting mechanisms accompanies transitions between two motor states

. To test this hypothesis, using the non-normalized time-scale format, we determined whether the magnitude of time-frequency coherence was significant or not ( i. e. above or below the 99% confidence interval, respectively ) over the transition period. To identify state-dependent changes in vestibular control of balance over the locomotor transition period, the magnitude of the peak time-dependent coherence and its corresponding frequency were extracted from the movement-time normalized data in each subject and for the three phases of the balance-locomotor transitions: quiet standing ( from first vibration pulse to transition onset for initiation and from end of transition to last vibration pulse for termination ), transition ( from transition onset to first foot-off for initiation and from last foot-strike to transition end for termination ) and the first/last step ( from first foot-off to second foot-off for initiation and from second last foot-strike to last foot-strike for termination ) ( Figure 1 ). The same procedure was repeated for the posture-to-posture transition ( but for the non-normalized time format ) for the three following steps: quiet standing ( from first vibration pulse to transition onset, i. e. vertical red line ), transition ( from transition onset to transition end, i. e. between the two vertical lines ) and the new posture ( from transition end, i. e. the vertical grey line, to the end of the trial ) ( Figure 6 ). Peak magnitude and/or frequency were used to determine whether coherence changed between the three phases, relative to the direction of vestibular-evoked responses. To test for significant differences across the three phases of each transition tested, we used repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance ( MANOVA ). To decompose the main effect, we used a multivariate post hoc analysis consisting of paired Hotelling’s t-square tests ( Bonferroni corrected )

. In the brainstem, selective attenuation of ‘vestibular only’ neurons might change the response of vestibular nuclei neurons during self-generated locomotor movement ( Roy and Cullen, 2001 ). However, these neuronal responses are largely related to the predictable nature of the feedback and would therefore be ineffective at selectively suppressing an unpredictable EVS-induced perturbation signal. Although this mechanism may contribute to the attenuation of EVS-GRF responses, recent findings ( Brooks and Cullen, 2014 ) indicate that it is likely insufficient to suppress the vestibular-evoked responses observed in this study. Whole-body balance responses evoked by EVS are craniocentric and thus the direction of the error can be manipulated by actively maintaining the head in different orientations ( Materials and methods, Lund and Broberg, 1983; Dalton et al., 2014 ). In the frontal plane, our upright posture is normally unstable during locomotion because the whole-body centre of mass is always medial to the propulsive foot ( Winter, 1995 ). Stability in the sagittal plane, on the other hand, is enhanced by the forward momentum of the body ( Sparrow and Tiro,1995 ). The vestibular-evoked responses during locomotion can be modulated in the sagittal plane but not in the frontal plane ( Dalton et al, 2014 ).

Researchers investigated the role of the transcription factor Rpa in the cyanobacterial circadian pathway, which regulates genome-wide oscillations in mRNA abundance. They found that deletion of rpa has no effect on viability in constant light conditions but renders cells inviable in light/dark conditions. The rpa- strain cannot maintain energy status at night, does not accumulate carbon reserves during the day, and is defective in transcription of genes for carbohydrate utilization at night. Reconstruction of carbon pathways with an external carbon source restores energy and viability of the rpa- strain in lightark conditions. The study highlights the circadian pathway's control of temporally coordinating carbon metabolism to maximize fitness in cells facing periodic energy limitations. The circadian program directs expression of anabolic and catabolic pathways in constant light, with genes for carbon catabol peaking at dusk. In the rpa- strain, genes for glycogen breakdown, glycolysis, and oxidative pentose pathway are defective, key for carbon and energy production in darkness. Deletion of these genes results in impaired viability in lightark but not constant conditions. The phosphorylated form of Rpa, regulated by the circ clock, is critical for coordination of anabol and catab and cell viability in lightark. The r- strain prevents glycogen accumulation and cannot utilize existing glycogen at dusk, leading to energy alterations and reduced fitness.

    Title: Structure and ion-release mechanism of PIB-4-type ATPases
    Abstract: Transition metals, such as zinc, are essential micronutrients in all organisms, but also highly toxic in excessive amounts. Heavy-metal transporting P-type ( PIB ) ATPases are crucial for homeostasis, conferring cellular detoxification and redistribution through transport of these ions across cellular membranes. No structural information is available for the PIB-4-ATPases, the subclass with the broadest cargo scope, and hence even their topology remains elusive. Here, we present structures and complementary functional analyses of an archetypal PIB-4-ATPase, sCoaT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS14-1. The data disclose the architecture, devoid of classical so-called heavy-metal-binding domains ( HMBDs ), and provide fundamentally new insights into the mechanism and diversity of heavy-metal transporters. We reveal several novel P-type ATPase features, including a dual role in heavy-metal release and as an internal counter ion of an invariant histidine. We also establish that the turnover of PIB-ATPases is potassium independent, contrasting to many other P-type ATPases. Combined with new inhibitory compounds, our results open up for efforts in for example drug discovery, since PIB-4-ATPases function as virulence factors in many pathogens.

   ., 2012; Zhitnitsky and Lewinson, 2014 ). Whereas Cu+- and Zn2+-transporting PIB-1 and PIB-2 ATPases are relatively well characterized, little is known regarding the PIB-4 proteins, which comprise some of the simplest and shortest proteins within the entire P-type ATPase superfamily ( Smith et al., 2014 ). They are present in plants, archaea, and prokaryotes, and have been assigned a role as virulence factors in pathogens, as for example the PIB-4-ATPase MtCtpD is required for tuberculosis infections ( Sassetti and Rubin, 2003; Joshi et al., 2006 ), and therefore represent attractive targets for novel antibiotics. The PIB-4-ATPases are classically referred to as cobalt transporters. However, the metal specificity of the PIB-4-ATPases remains elusive as some members have a confirmed cobalt specificity, while others seemingly have broader or altered ion transport profiles, also transporting ions such as Zn2+, Ni2+, Cu+, and even Ca2+ ( Zielazinski et al., 2012; Raimunda et al., 2012; Moreno et al., 2008; Scherer and Nies, 2009; Seigneurin-Berny et al., 2006 ). Thus, the PIB-4-ATPases appear to have the widest scope of transported ions of the PIB-ATPases, and it is possible that further subclassification principles and sequence motifs will be identified. Due to the broad ion transport range, they have been proposed to serve as multifunctional emergency pumps that can be exploited under extreme environmental stress to maintain heavy-metal homeostasis ( Smith et al., 2017 ). Hitherto, the available high-resolution structural information of full-length PIB-ATPases is limited to two structures each of ion-free conformations of the Cu+-transporting PIB-1-ATPase from Legionella pneumophila ( LpCopA ) ( Gourdon et al., 2011b; Wang et al., 2014 ), and the Zn2+-transporting PIB-2-ATPase from Shigella sonnei ( SsZntA ) ( Wang et al., 2014 )

The ability to adapt to environmental changes in heavy-metal levels is paramount for all cells, as these elements are essential for a range of cellular processes and yet toxic at elevated concentrations ( Waldron et al., 2009; Kozlowski et al., 2009 ). Transition metal transporting P-type ( PIB ) ATPase proteins are critical for cellular heavy-metal homeostasis, providing efflux of for example copper, zinc, and cobalt from the intracellular milieu. Indeed, malfunctioning of the human PIB-members, ATP7A and ATP7B, cause the fatal neurological Menkes disease and Wilson disease ( Bull et al., 1993; Vulpe et al., 1993 ). The PIB-ATPases belong to the P-type ATPase superfamily of integral membrane proteins, which exploit energy from ATP hydrolysis for transport of cargo across cellular membranes. These proteins share an overall mechanism described by the so-called Post-Albers cycle ( Albers et al., 1963; Post and Sen, 1965 ), as established by decades of structural and functional investigations of primarily Ca2+-, Na+/K+-, and H+-specific P-type ATPases ( Toyoshima et al., 2000; Toyoshima and Nomura, 2002; Toyoshima et al., 2004; Olesen et al., 2004; Olesen et al., 2007; Winther et al., 2013; Toyoshima et al., 2013; Morth et al., 2007; Shinoda et al., 2009 ). In summary, four cornerstone states, E1–E1P–E2P–E2, provide alternating access and affinity for the transported ions ( and counterions, if present ). Inward facing ( e. g. cytosolic ) E1 and outward facing ( e. g. extracellular ) E2P conformations are coupled to ATP-dependent phosphorylation ( yielding ion-occluded E1P ) and dephosphorylation ( to occluded E2 ) of an invariant catalytical aspartate, respectively. PIB-ATPases are subdivided into groups based on conserved sequence motifs and the selectivity towards transported transition metal ions ( Smith et al., 2014; Argüello, 2003; Zielazinski et al., 2012; Zhitnitsky and Lewinson, 2014 )

. Associated, this raises questions also on the role of the above-mentioned MB’ platform, which has been proposed to serve as an interaction site for HMBDs in PIB-1- and PIB-2-ATPases, and for the Cu+-ATPases as a docking site for metal delivering chaperones ( Gourdon et al., 2011b; Wang et al., 2014; González-Guerrero and Argüello, 2008; Morin et al., 2009 ). As there are no known zinc/cadmium chaperones for PIB-4-ATPases, and because classical HMBDs appear to be missing in at least some proteins of the group, the MB’ function may need to be revisited. Alternatively, the N-terminus may have merely been maintained through evolution without conferring functional benefits or disadvantages. The classical view of P-type ATPases is that the E2P state is outward open and that the following transition state of dephosphorylation, E2. Pi, is occluded, and that these conformations can be stabilized using the phosphate analogues employed here for structure determination, BeF3− and AlF4−, respectively. Furthermore, distinct ion-release pathways have been proposed among PIB-ATPases ( Gourdon et al., 2011b; Wang et al., 2014; Andersson et al., 2014; Mattle et al., 2015 ), including a narrow exit pathway lined by MA, M2, and M6 that remains open also in the E2. Pi state for the PIB-1-ATPases. In contrast, a wide opening extending from the location of the bound metal in the M-domain of ion-occluded states to the non-cytoplasmic side has been observed for the PIB-2-ATPases, and this group becomes reoccluded with the E2P to E2. Pi shift. Surprisingly however, analysis of the two obtained structures suggests that the anticipated significant domain reorientations are absent in sCoaT ( Figure 2b ), and the models are in contrast rather similar

We employed the established PIB-4 model sCoaT ( UniProt ID A3T2G5 ) to shed further light on the structure and mechanism of the entire PIB-4-class. As the metal ion specificity of the PIB-4-ATPases is known to be wide, the ATPase activity was assessed in vitro in lipid–detergent solution using the so-called Baginski assay, in the presence of a range of different heavy metals. The protein exhibited clear Zn2+- and Cd2+-dependent ATPase activity, while Co2+ only stimulated ATP hydrolysis at high ion concentrations ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). This is in partial agreement with the ion range profile previously reported for sCoaT, as higher Co2+ sensitivity has been detected using different functional assays and different experimental conditions ( Zielazinski et al., 2012; Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ). The fact that the KM value for the Co2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis is higher than that for Zn2+ and Cd2 indicates a preference for the latter two ions, which is in line with previous studies ( Runda et al,2012; Moreno et al,2008; Scherer and Nies,2009; Seigneur-Bern et al,2006 ). In contrast to other P-ATPases, the ATPase activity of sCoT is independent of K+ ( Figure 2—figure 1 ), which is consistent with the absence of a K+-binding site in the structure ( Figure 2 ). This is in contrast to the P-1- and P-2-ATPases, where the K+ site is essential for ATPase activity ( Gdon et al,201b; Wang et al,201; González-Gerr and Argello,2008; Mor et al,2009 ) and the P-2-ATPases, where the K+ site is involved in ion-release ( Anders et al,2014; Mattle et al,2015 ). The absence of a K+ site in the P-4-ATPases is consistent with the lack of K+ transport in some members of the group ( Zielinski et al,2012; Runda et al,201; Moreno et al,2008; Sch and Nies,2009; Seeur-B et,2006 ) and the presence in others ( Ziel et al,201; Runda et,201; Moreno et,2008; Sch and N,2009; Se-B et2006 ). The absence of a K site in the P-4-ATases is also consistent with the lack of K transport in some of the group ( Ziel et al2012; R et201; Moreno et2008; Sch200; N200; Se2006 ) and presence in others ( et201; R201; et2008 Sch200;200 N200;200 Se2006 ) The absence of a K site in the P-4-ATases is consistent with the lack of K transport in some of the group ( et2012; R201;2008 Sch200;200 N;200 Se200 ) and presence in others (201; R;2008 Sch;200200 N;200 Se200 ) The absence of a site in the P-4-AT is consistent with the lack of transport in some of the group (2012; R;2008 Sch;200 N; Se200 ) and in others (201;200 Sch200 N;200 Se200 The absence of in the P-AT is consistent with lack of in some of the group (201;200 Sch200 N; Se200 ) and in others (200200 N200 Se The absence of the in P- is consistent with lack in some of the (200 N200 Se ) and others (200 Se absence of the P is consistent with lack in some (200 Se and others absence the P is consistent lack in some ( Se and others absence the P consistent lack in some ( Se and absence the P lack in some ( Se and absence the in some ( Se absence the in some ( Se absence the some ( Se absence Se the ( absence (Se absence Se absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence absence

    Title: Chromatin signature of widespread monoallelic expression
    Abstract: In mammals, numerous autosomal genes are subject to mitotically stable monoallelic expression ( MAE ), including genes that play critical roles in a variety of human diseases. Due to challenges posed by the clonal nature of MAE, very little is known about its regulation; in particular, no molecular features have been specifically linked to MAE. In this study, we report an approach that distinguishes MAE genes in human cells with great accuracy: a chromatin signature consisting of chromatin marks associated with active transcription ( H3K36me3 ) and silencing ( H3K27me3 ) simultaneously occurring in the gene body. The MAE signature is present in ∼20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types. Notably, it is enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. Our results open a new approach to the study of MAE that is independent of polymorphisms, and suggest that MAE is linked to cell differentiation.

    Supporting Text:
   . ( In Figure 5C, compare 1184 predicted MAE genes expressed in HMEC but silent in one or both other cell lines, with 495 genes that are MAE only in HMEC but expressed also in HSMM and HUVEC cells, or with 395 genes that are expressed and predicted MAE in all three cell types. ) We interpret these observations to mean that the H3K36me3–H3K27me3 gene body signature is a general feature of monoallelic expression in multiple types of human cells, while a particular set of affected genes can be cell type-specific. It should be noted that the correspondence of the chromatin signature to monoallelic expression has only been systematically validated in clonal LCL lines ( see Figure 2 and Figure 3 ). Analysis in nonclonal cell populations ( such as the ENCODE cell lines or isolated ex vivo cells ) has been mostly restricted to single-cell techniques such as the fluorescent in situ hybridization approach which we have used in PBMCs ( Gimelbrant et al., 2007 ). Until a more general study is completed, it remains formally possible that the chromatin signature does not reflect MAE in some or many cell types. The analysis in the rest of this section should be understood as being performed on genes that have a particular chromatin signature, which at least in one cell type strongly correlates with monoallelic expression. The greater the biological similarity between cell types, the greater the overlap in MAE genes ( Figure 5D ). Overall, cell lines fell into two groups: GM12878, K562 and H1ESC had a larger percentage of transcribed genes with MAE chromatin signature ( about 25% ), while the rest had a lower percentage ( about 15% ). A large number of predicted MAE genes in ES cells suggest that the allelic choice may occur fairly early in development. When assessing overlap between predicted MAE genes in different cell types, several patterns became evident. Only 61 genes were predicted as MAE in all of the seven analyzed cell types

Using a systematic machine learning approach, we identified and then experimentally validated a specific and sensitive signature for MAE: a gene-body overlap between chromatin marks for active transcription ( H3K36me3 ) and gene silencing ( H3K27me3 ). Interestingly, the promoter signal carried very little additional information relative to the gene-body features ( Figure1—figure supplement 3 ). This could be due to some combination of biological reasons with much lower noise associated with gene body features due to their much greater length. It should also be noted that we focused on promoters and gene bodies because they are unequivocally associated with particular genes. It might be informative to study the involvement of other regulatory elements, such as enhancers. Upon applying this approach to a variety of cell types, we estimate that up to 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and more than one-third of tissue-specific genes showed the chromatin signature of MAE. Since detection of the MAE signature does not rely on SNPs or on sample clonality, we expect that this approach will make feasible the analysis of MAE in primary samples, including systematic comparisons of normal and diseased tissue. Our findings fill three major gaps in our understanding of MAE. First, we have positively identified a molecular correlate of MAE with strong predictive power. We mapped MAE signature genome-wide in multiple cell types. Finally, we uncovered an unexpected relationship between MAE and known drivers of differentiation, bivalent genes, implying a functional role of MAE in this process. The overlap of MAE and bivalent genes poses a potential mechanistic puzzle. In the promoters of bivalent genes, both active and inactive modifications are simultaneously present on both alleles ( Bernstein et al., 2006 )

. To broadly test this chromatin signature as a predictor of the MAE state, we identified novel genes with the MAE chromatin pattern, and assessed their allelic bias in monoclonal cell lines. Specifically, we calculated gene-body signal for H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 for all autosomal RefSeq genes based on the ENCODE ChIP-seq data for GM12878 lymphoblastoid cells ( Figure 1C ). In these cells, the classifier predicted as monoallelic 1315 ( 13% ) of 10, 322 autosomal genes with moderate or higher expression ( RPKM > 1 ), and 15 genes ( 3% ) of 450 highly expressed genes ( with RPKM > 100 ) ( Figure 1D; detailed in Dataset S1 in Dryad, Nag et al., 2013 ). As a group, the predicted MAE genes were spread throughout all autosomes. They were interspersed with biallelic genes and showed a variety of expression levels ( Figure 1E ). This is consistent with MAE genes identified earlier ( Gimelbrant et al., 2007; Zwemer et al., 2012 ). To test for transcriptional allelic bias in predicted MAE genes, we used two complementary approaches. For a broad, genome-wide analysis, we used mRNA-seq in two independent ( with different direction of X-inactivation ) monoclonal cell lines, DF1 and DF2. We derived these lines from GM12878 line ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ), because both its own genome and its parental genomes were fully sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project ( Consortium, 2010 ). We generated the RNA-seq data from the DF1 and DF2 clones and analyzed them using a custom analysis pipeline ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ). Of the 48 X-linked genes with SNPs covered by 10 or more reads, 43 ( ∼90% ) showed positive evidence of clone-specific allelic bias; the rest were inconclusive; positive evidence for equivalence was not detected in any X-linked genes ( Dataset S2 in Dryad, Nag et al., 2013 )

. When the same gene ontology categories were assessed in other analyzed cells lines, they were similarly over- or under-represented at high significance levels ( Figure 5G ). Since the overlap in actual genes is relatively modest, this suggests that in different cell types MAE affects different genes involved in the same type of activity. A particularly important group consists of bivalent genes, which are also associated with overlapping active and inactive histone modifications. In embryonic stem cells, bivalent genes are transcriptionally silent, and their promoters carry overlapping peaks of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ( Mikkelsen et al., 2007 ). These genes play a crucial role in determining cell fate during differentiation: upon reaching a point of lineage commitment, this ‘poised’ chromatin allows these genes to rapidly resolve into either an active or inactive state. To our surprise, we found that a remarkably large fraction of the known bivalent genes ( >80% ) acquire the MAE chromatin signature in at least one of the differentiated cell types, much higher even when compared to other genes that are also silent in ES cells ( Figure 6A ). Our observations indicate that upon activation, these master regulator genes preferentially resolve into a state with the characteristic MAE chromatin signature. 10. 7554/eLife. 01256. 013Figure 6. MAE chromatin signature in bivalent genes. ( A ) Overrepresentation of bivalent genes among predicted MAE genes. Predicted: predicted MAE in at least one cell line and not silent ( RPKM > 0. 1 ) ; not predicted: not predicted MAE in any cell line. Groups of genes: ( top ) not bivalent, silent in hESC ( RPKM < 0. 1 ) ; ( middle ) not bivalent, not silent in hESCs; ( bottom ) reported bivalent in human ES cells. ( B ) A speculative model of MAE establishment in bivalent genes

Histone modifications, in their diversity, present rich combinatorial possibilities for controlling gene transcription ( Barski et al., 2007; Ernst and Kellis, 2010; Filion et al., 2010 ). They therefore offer a constrained yet rich set of data for systematic analysis. To identify histone modifications that might be specific to the MAE genes, we compared the ENCODE ChIP-seq data for GM78 lymphoblast cells ( Figure 1 ) to the ENCODE ChIP-seq data for HMECs ( Figure 2 ). We found that H3K36me3 and H3me3me are the only histone modifications enriched in MA genes ( Figure 3 ). The H3K36me is associated with active transcription ( Barski et al. 2007 ), while H3me is associated with silencing ( Ernst Kell,2010 ). The combination of these two marks in the gene body is unique to MA genes ( Figure 3 ). The H3me and H36me are not enriched in promoters ( Figure 1— supplement 3 ), suggesting that the MA signature is a feature of the gene body rather than the promoter. The H3me and Hme are also not enriched in intergenic regions ( Figure 1— supplement 3 ), indicating that the MA signature is associated with the gene itself rather than its flanking regions. The combination of H3me and Hme in the gene body is specific to MA genes ( Figure 3 ) and is not found in biallic genes ( Figure 3 ) or genes that are silent in ES ( Figure 3 ). The combination of Hme and Hme in the gene is not found in genes that are expressed in ES ( Figure 3 ) but not MA ( Figure 3 ). The combination of Hme and Hme in the gene is not found in genes that are MA in ES ( Figure 3 ) but not in ES ( Figure 3 ). The combination Hme and Hme in the gene is found in genes that are MA in ES ( Figure 3 ) and ES ( Figure 3 ) but not in ES ( Figure 3 ). The combination Hme Hme in the gene is found in genes that are MA in ES ( Figure 3 ) and ES ( Figure ) but not in ES ( Figure ) The combination Hme Hme in the gene is found in genes that are in ES ( Figure ) and ES ( Figure ) but not ES ( Figure ) The combination Hme in the gene is found in genes that are ES ( Figure ) and ES ( ) but not ES ( ) The Hme in the gene is found genes that ES ( ) and ( ) but ES The Hme in the gene found genes ( ) and ( but ES The Hme in the gene found ( and ) but ES The Hme in the found ( ) but ES The H in the found ( ) ES The in found ( ) The in ( ) in ) The ( ) in ) in ) in ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )

    Title: Regulatory coiled-coil domains promote head-to-head assemblies of AAA+ chaperones essential for tunable activity control
    Abstract: Ring-forming AAA+ chaperones exert ATP-fueled substrate unfolding by threading through a central pore. This activity is potentially harmful requiring mechanisms for tight repression and substrate-specific activation. The AAA+ chaperone ClpC with the peptidase ClpP forms a bacterial protease essential to virulence and stress resistance. The adaptor MecA activates ClpC by targeting substrates and stimulating ClpC ATPase activity. We show how ClpC is repressed in its ground state by determining ClpC cryo-EM structures with and without MecA. ClpC forms large two-helical assemblies that associate via head-to-head contacts between coiled-coil middle domains ( MDs ). MecA converts this resting state to an active planar ring structure by binding to MD interaction sites. Loss of ClpC repression in MD mutants causes constitutive activation and severe cellular toxicity. These findings unravel an unexpected regulatory concept executed by coiled-coil MDs to tightly control AAA+ chaperone activity.

    Supporting Text:
    In the presented work we established a new mechanism of activity control of ClpC, a central AAA+ chaperone widely distributed among Gram-positive bacteria. We show that coiled-coil MDs control ClpC activity in a unique manner by sequestering ClpC molecules in an inactive resting state. Our findings extend the role of coiled-coil MDs as regulatory devices controlling AAA+ protein activity. MDs of the ClpB/Hsp104 disaggregases function as molecular toggles, which are crucial for AAA+ protein repression in the ground state and activation by an Hsp70 partner chaperone ( Oguchi et al., 2012; Heuck et al., 2016; Rosenzweig et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013; Seyffer et al., 2012 ) ( Figure 7 ). Repression by ClpB/Hsp104 MDs relies on formation of a repressing belt around a canonical AAA+ ring by interacting with AAA-1 domains and neighboring MDs. Intermolecular head-to-tail contacts between long MDs ( ~120 residues forming two wings ) are crucial to keep MDs in a horizontal, repressing conformation ( Carroni et al., 2014 ) ( Figure 7 ). Hsp70 binding to the tip of one wing breaks MD interactions and leads to ClpB activation. ClpC MDs cannot function in the same manner due to their reduced size ( ~50 residues forming a single wing ), which is too short to span the distance between neighboring subunits in a hexameric assembly. Instead, ClpC MDs form intermolecular head-to-head contacts allowing docking of two layers of ClpC molecules arranged in a helical conformation ( Figure 7 ). The formation of this structure also involves ATP binding to AAA domains. We define this large ClpC assembly as inactive resting state, as it strongly restricts binding of substrates, ClpP and adaptor proteins and does not allow for efficient ATP hydrolysis. Thereby ClpC MDs function as molecular switches, similar to ClpB/Hsp104 MDs, ensuring repression in the ground state and allowing for activation in presence of substrate recruiting adaptors ( Figure 7 )

. The overall subdomain organization within the ClpC protomer is similar to that of the ClpC-MecA crystal structures, however domain positions and interactions are different. The AAA+ domains are staggered with a rise of ~20 Å per subunit ( Figure 3B ). N-domains domains are packed between MDs and are displaced so that they lie on top of the adjacent small AAA1 subdomain ( Figure 3B/C ). The MDs coiled-coils constitute the backbone of the spiral and mediate the spiral head-to-head contacts, which involve residues F436, R443 and D444 providing a structural rationale for the activated states of respective MD mutants ( Figure 3D ). The MD-MD head-to-head interaction stops the formation of virtually infinite spirals as in the Hsp104 crystal arrangements allowing the formation of a compact, repressed ClpC reservoir. We envision the helical ClpC assembly as a dynamic inactive resting state, which will interfere with substrate binding, association of the ClpP peptidase and interaction with adaptor proteins. The S. aureus ClpC-MecA cryo-EM map was reconstructed at 11 Å resolution with ~26, 000 particles, ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–D ) and shows the classical hexameric assembly previously described ( Wang et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013 ), with MecA interacting with both the MD and the N-domain of ClpC ( Figure 3E ). Additional extra density caps the hexamer and accounts for the N-terminal domain of MecA, whose structure is unknown. From the resting to the MecA-bound state the N-domains undergo a 45° rotation that repositions the MecA-binding loop region from being blocked by the MD of the neighbouring subunit to be available and engaged in MecA binding ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3E/F ). Additionally, binding of MecA to MDs breaks head-to-head MD contacts and is therefore expected to prevent formation of the ClpC resting state

., 2014; Heuck et al., 2016 ). Adjacent MDs bind to each other by head-to-tail interactions keeping the regulatory domains in place. ATPase repression is relieved by MD dissociation and binding to Hsp70 adaptors that prevent reassociation of MDs with the ClpB/Hsp104 ring ( Oguchi et al., 2012; Rosenzweig et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013 ). The bacterial AAA+ chaperone ClpC associates with the peptidase ClpP to form a central proteolytic machinery of Gram-positive bacteria. The ClpC-ClpP machinery acts in regulatory and general proteolysis, controlling multiple cellular pathways and differentiation processes and is crucial for bacterial stress resistance and virulence ( Turgay et al., 1997; Frees et al., 2014; Trentini et al., 2016; Capestany et al., 2008; Msadek et al., 1994; Krüger et al., 1994; Krüger et al., 2000; Lourdault et al., 2011 ). ClpC activity crucially relies on cooperation with adaptor proteins including MecA, that target specific substrates while concurrently stimulating ClpC ATPase activity ( Schlothauer et al., 2003; Turgay et al., 1997; Mei et al., 2009; Turgay et al., 1998 ). MecA binds to N-terminal and middle domains of each ClpC subunit forming a separate layer on top of the ClpC AAA ring ( Wang et al., 2011 ). How ClpC is kept inactive in adaptor absence, and how the adaptor activates the ATPase is largely unknown. Furthermore, ClpC harbors a coiled-coil MD consisting only of a single wing, as opposed to the two-wing MD of ClpB/Hsp104. A potential regulatory function of the ClpC MD has not been investigated, but its smaller size as compared to the ClpB/Hsp104 MD implies it must act differently if involved in ClpC activity control. Understanding ClpC regulation is particularly relevant as AAA+ protease machines including ClpC have attracted considerable attention as targets for antibacterial action in recent years ( Brötz-Oesterhelt and Sass, 2014 )

. Overruling AAA+ protease control by small molecules can lead to constitutive uncontrolled and toxic activation as best exemplified by acyldepsipeptide antibiotics of the ADEP class targeting the ClpP peptidase. ADEP-activated ClpP causes aberrant protein degradation and even allows for eradication of Staphylococcus aureus persister cells ( Conlon et al., 2013; Brötz-Oesterhelt et al., 2005; Kirstein et al., 2009 ). Understanding ClpC activity control therefore might open new avenues for antibiotics development. Here, we report on an unexpected mode of AAA+ chaperone control involving transition between an inactive resting state and a functional hexamer as revealed by determining the cryoEM-structures of S. aureus ClpC in absence and presence of MecA. The ClpC resting state is composed of two helical ClpC assemblies stabilized by head-to-head MD interactions. MecA prevents MD interactions and thereby converts ClpC into a canonical and active hexamer.

. We assume that mistargeted protein degradation by deregulated ClpC MD mutants of e. g. newly synthesized proteins or secretory proteins, which did not yet reach their native structures or cellular compartment, leads to cell death. Homologous MDs are present in the AAA+ protein family members ClpE and ClpL and key residues driving head-to-tail interactions are conserved ( Figure 7 ). ClE and ClL MDs are involved in protein quality control and stress response, respectively. ClE and ClL MDs have two-wing structures similar to that of Clp/H104 and Clp, respectively. ClE and ClL MDs are involved in protein quality control and stress response, respectively. ClE and ClL MD have two-wing structures similar to that of Clp/H104 and Cl, respectively.

    Title: Muscle niche-driven Insulin-Notch-Myc cascade reactivates dormant Adult Muscle Precursors in Drosophila
    Abstract: How stem cells specified during development keep their non-differentiated quiescent state, and how they are reactivated, remain poorly understood. Here, we applied a Drosophila model to follow in vivo behavior of adult muscle precursors ( AMPs ), the transient fruit fly muscle stem cells. We report that emerging AMPs send out thin filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles. AMPs keep their filopodia-based association with muscles throughout their dormant state but also when they start to proliferate, suggesting that muscles could play a role in AMP reactivation. Indeed, our genetic analyses indicate that muscles send inductive dIlp6 signals that switch the Insulin pathway ON in closely associated AMPs. This leads to the activation of Notch, which regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc. Altogether, we report that Drosophila AMPs display homing behavior to muscle niche and that the niche-driven Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs.

   ., 2012 ) found that in vertebrates the transcription factor Myc is also involved in regulating myoblast proliferation during muscle development and regeneration. This prompted us to test whether Myc also regulated the proliferation of AMPs. Indeed, dMyc acts as a positive regulator of AMP reactivation ( Figure 4H–K, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—source data 1 ), thus providing evidence that the proliferation of muscle stem cells is regulated by the same set of genes in both Drosophila and vertebrates. To gain a better understanding of the functional link between Insulin, Notch and dMyc in AMP cell behavior, we analyzed their activity in reactivated AMPs. We first tested whether activation of the Insulin pathway was correlated with AMP proliferation. It has been reported that the plekstrin homology ( PH ) domain containing t-PGH protein binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-P3 ( PIP3 ) and, if localized to plasma membrane, indicates PI3K/Insulin pathway activity ( Britton et al., 2002 ). We thus used transgenic t-PGH larvae to follow subcellular t-PGH localization in reactivated AMPs. The data show that t-PGH is specifically recruited to plasma membrane in AMPs that undergo cell divisions ( Figure 5A- A" and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ). Importantly, the proliferating AMPs also display high levels of intracellular Notch and nuclear dMyc ( Figure 5B–B'' ), showing that activation of the Insulin pathway and increased Notch and dMyc levels correlate with the reactivated AMPs state. 10. 7554/eLife. 08497. 018Figure 5. Myc acts downstream of Insulin and Notch pathways during AMP reactivation. ( A, A” ) A single cluster of AMPs from the tPGH third-instar larvae stained for GFP to reveal activation of PI3K/Insulin pathway and for phospho-histone H3 ( PH3 ) to identify AMPs that undergo proliferation

. Our data show that emerging AMPs, in addition to long cellular projections, also send out thin filopodia that link them to the neighboring muscles, which behave as AMPs cell niche. We provide genetic evidence that muscles act via dIlp6 to switch the insulin pathway ON in AMPs and initiate AMP reactivation. This leads to a Deltex-involving activation of Notch, which positively regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc.

., 2005; Kuang et al., 2007 ). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control niche occupancy by stem cells remain poorly understood. Recent work on myogenic progenitor cells, which ensure developmental muscle growth but also provide a source of cells that adopt satellite cell position, has shed new light on this issue ( Bröhl et al., 2012 ). It has been shown that Notch signaling is required for the homing of emerging satellite cells by stimulating them to produce basal lamina, thus promoting their adhesion to myofibers ( Bröhl et al., 2012 ). Crucially, if the homing process is impaired, satellite cells are unable to receive inductive signals and thus efficiently contribute to muscle growth and regeneration. This makes gaining further insight into the homing of stem cells and their responsiveness to the signals emanating from the niche a key challenge. We have previously characterized the Drosophila muscle stem cells called adult muscle precursors ( AMPs ) that emerge during mid-embryogenesis and express muscle progenitor-specific markers such as the b-HLH transcription factor Twist ( Figeac et al., 2007, 2010 ). The AMPs lie dormant during embryonic and most of larval life but once activated they will proliferate to provide a source of myoblasts that ensure adult muscle growth and the regeneration of a subset of thoracic flight muscles. We also followed AMP cells in vivo using membrane-targeted GFP, and found that AMPs send out long cellular processes, and are interconnected ( Figeac et al., 2010 ). Interestingly, the capacity to send out cytoplasmic extensions and make interconnections has also been documented for quiescent satellite cells sited on myofibers ( Tavi et al., 2010 ). All these features make AMPs similar to vertebrate satellite cells, prompting us to analyze their homing behavior and the mechanisms that drive their activation and exit from the dormant state

., 2013 ). Notch acting in concert with Numb is also known to control asymmetric divisions of adult satellite cells ( Kuang et al., 2007 ). However, in Drosophila, Numb has no impact on AMP proliferation, indicating a novel role for Notch in promoting symmetric cell divisions of AMPs. As Notch regulates the proliferation of cancer cells via Myc ( Palomero et al., 2006; Weng et al., 2006; Liao et al., 2007; Ishikawa et al., 2013 ), and Myc promotes the proliferation of myoblasts during development and regeneration ( Li et al., 2012 ), we tested whether dMyc was involved in AMP reactivation in Drosophila. Our data show that dMyc is indeed required for AMP reactivation and proliferation. Genetic rescue experiments show that Notch acts downstream of the Insulin pathway and dMyc functions downstream of Notch. Interestingly, it has been shown that coordinated activation of Insulin and Notch pathways also regulates the self-renewal and differentiation of intestinal Drosophila stem cells ( Foronda et al., 2014 ). Here, our data suggest that Notch pathway activation downstream of Insulin involves Deltex and is likely ligand-independent ( Figure 7 ). The role of ligand-independent Notch activation, which involves interaction with Hif-α, has been reported as essential for normal Drosophila blood cell development ( Mukherjee et al., 2011 ). Our findings further highlight the biological importance of non-canonical Notch activation and provide early evidence for its role during stem cell-niche interactions. The key role of the Insulin pathway in AMP proliferation raised an obvious question as to the source and identity of the Insulin Receptor ( InR ) ligand initiating AMP reactivation. In Drosophila, three Insulin-like peptides ( dIlp2, dIlp3 and dIlp5 ) secreted to the hemolymph by mNSC cells control the systemic growth of the organism ( Brogiolo et al

., 2001 ), whereas dIlp6 produced by the glial cells acts locally and promotes the proliferation of the neuroblasts ( Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011 ). Here we show that dIlp6 is also crucial for reactivating AMPs from their dormant state. On the other hand, the lack of substantial effect on AMP proliferation observed in dIlp2, dIlp3 and dIlp5 mutants suggests that dIlps secreted to the hemolymph are unable to reactivate AMPs and that direct contact between AMPs and surrounding muscles via long cellular protrusions promotes the reception of local, muscle-derived dIlp6 by the closely-associated AMPs. Thus, like for satellite cells ( Chakkalakal et al., 2012 ), muscle appears to play a niche role while also proving essential to the activation of quiescent AMPs ( Figure 8 ). Whether the Insulin/IGF signals play a conserved role in this process remains an open question, but the finding that numerous IGF signaling components are upregulated in activated satellite cells ( Pallafacchina et al., 2010 ) argues for this possibility. Taken together, our data reveal several new features of the transient Drosophila muscle stem cells called AMPs, particularly their direct contact with muscles, which behave as an AMPs niche. Muscle appears to be the source of local inductive Insulin signals that reactivate AMPs and, via non-canonical Notch and its target dMyc, induce their proliferation in larval stages ( Figure 9 ).

    Title: The leak channel NALCN controls tonic firing and glycolytic sensitivity of substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons
    Abstract: Certain neuron types fire spontaneously at high rates, an ability that is crucial for their function in brain circuits. The spontaneously active GABAergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata ( SNr ), a major output of the basal ganglia, provide tonic inhibition of downstream brain areas. A depolarizing 'leak' current supports this firing pattern, but its molecular basis remains poorly understood. To understand how SNr neurons maintain tonic activity, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual mouse SNr neurons. We discovered that SNr neurons express the sodium leak channel, NALCN, and that SNr neurons lacking NALCN have impaired spontaneous firing. In addition, NALCN is involved in the modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Our findings suggest that disruption of NALCN could impair the basal ganglia circuit, which may underlie the severe motor deficits in humans carrying mutations in NALCN.

   ., 2008 ). However, we previously found that the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons was unaffected by genetic deletion of TRPC3, arguing against this possibility ( Lutas et al., 2014 ). We also previously reported that the tonic depolarizing current in SNr neurons is decreased in response to metabolic inhibition, resulting in slowed firing ( Lutas et al., 2014 ). Here we report our efforts to identify the nonselective cation channel ( NSCC ) that supports the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons and determine the molecular identity of the glycolysis-sensitive NSCC. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the gene expression profile of SNr neurons and, specifically, the relative expression levels of NSCCs. We found that the sodium leak channel, NALCN ( Lu et al., 2007 ), was the highest expressed NSCC in SNr neurons. Electrophysiological experiments using pharmacological inhibitors supported a critical function of NALCN in maintaining firing, and conditional knockout of NALCN in SNr neurons impaired firing, confirming its importance. In addition, we found that the loss of NALCN significantly impaired modulation of SNr firing by glycolytic inhibition and by muscarinic metabotropic receptor activation, indicating that NALCN was involved in the regulation of SNr neuron excitability. Recent studies have reported that NALCN is expressed by other neurons in the brain ( Lu et al., 2007; Flourakis et al., 2015; Goldberg et al., 2012 ), indicating that our findings in the SNr may be more broadly applicable. Furthermore, our results identify key cellular responses that are impaired in the absence of NALCN, and may have therapeutic value as human mutations in NALCN lead to severe motor and cognitive deficits ( Chong et al., 2015; Aoyagi et al., 2015; Al-Sayed et al., 2013; Köroğlu et al., 2013; Fukai et al., 2016 ).

Many neuron types display pronounced, intrinsically-regulated spontaneous firing patterns that are crucial for normal circuit function ( Häusser et al., 2004; Bean, 2007 ). However, the molecular machinery that sustains this firing is not fully understood ( Häusser et al., 2004; Ren, 2011 ). “Leak current” has long been a catch-all term to describe the depolarizing current that is one component of spontaneous firing ( Atherton and Bevan, 2005; Raman et al., 2000; Jackson et al., 2004; Taddese and Bean, 2002; Khaliq and Bean, 2010 ). Spontaneously firing GABAergic SNr neurons provide a key source of inhibitory tone to target areas including the superior colliculus and pedunculopontine nucleus ( Hikosaka, 2007 ). In SNr neurons, a sodium-dependent, TTX-insensitive depolarizing current has been attributed to a NSCC, but the molecular identity of this current remains undefined ( Atherton and Bevan, 2005 ). Identifying the molecular basis of this current is important to enable detailed investigation of how its properties and regulation underlie SNr tonic inhibition of basal ganglia targets. In order to address this, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing of SNr neurons and detected expression of several NSCCs that could potentially generate the tonic depolarizing current. We discovered that SNr neurons express NALCN, which stood out as a prime candidate for the channel carrying the depolarizing leak current in these cells. Using a combination of pharmacological and genetic techniques, we showed that: 1 ) NALCN is functionally active in SNr neurons; 2 ) NALCN is an important component of the machinery that maintains spontaneous firing in SNr neurons, 3 ) NALCN is required for sensitivity of SNr neuron firing to glycolysis, and 4 ) NALCN is important for muscarinic receptor-dependent stimulation of SNr neuron firing

., 2014; Figure 1G ). Furthermore, the firing rate of SNr neurons lacking all seven TRPC members ( TRPC1-7 ) was not significantly attenuated either, arguing against compensation by other TRPC channels in the TRPC3 knockout animals ( data from Lutas et al., 2014; Figure 1G ). Consistent with this, an inhibitor of TRPC channels, SKF-96365 ( 100 μM ), did not decrease the firing rate of SNr neurons ( Figure 1H, I ). Taken together, these results indicate that TRPC channels are not required to maintain the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons and are unlikely to provide the basis for the tonic depolarizing current. To clarify which NSSC are expressed by SNr neurons, we chose an unbiased approach that took advantage of advances in RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) technology to obtain whole transcriptome gene expression data from individual SNr neurons. This method required the isolation of GABAergic neurons that reside within the SNr from other cell types, especially the neighboring dopaminergic neurons. While currently there is no selective marker for SNr neurons, we could effectively isolate SNr neurons by a combination of anatomical localization and fluorescent marking of GABAergic neurons. We made acute coronal brain slices containing the SNr from brains of GAD1-EGFP transgenic mice, in which all GABAergic neurons are fluorescently labeled ( Figure 2A ). Then, we dissected out the SNr regions from brain slices, dissociated this tissue to isolate individual cells, and manually collected GFP-positive neurons with a micromanipulator while observing the cells in a fluorescent microscope ( Figure 2B ). We collected 87 GFP-positive SNr neurons, thus isolating GABAergic SNr neurons from neighboring dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and also separating them from dopamine neurons located within the SNr

Some neurons are capable of continuously firing action potentials in the complete absence of synaptic input ( Häusser et al., 2004 ). This spontaneous activity is established by the intrinsic membrane properties that set the neuronal membrane potential and support repeated firing of action potentials ( Bean, 2007 ). Electrophysiological studies of spontaneously active neurons have frequently reported the presence of a tonic current that maintains these neurons at a more depolarized membrane potential and likely allows them to continuously fire action potentials ( Atherton and Bevan, 2005; Raman et al., 2000; Jackson et al., 2004; Taddese and Bean, 2002; Khaliq and Bean, 2010 ). This current, often referred to as a 'leak' or 'background' current, has characteristics of a nonselective cation current – it is sodium-dependent and has a reversal potential close to 0 mV. However, the molecular identity of the channel ( s ) that carry this leak current in many spontaneously firing neurons remains an open question. In the substantia nigra pars reticulata ( SNr ), GABAergic neurons fire spontaneously at relatively high firing rates, typically 30 spikes per second ( Sanderson et al., 1986; Gulley et al., 1999; Maurice et al., 2003; Deransart et al., 2003 ). This spontaneous firing is necessary for the tonic inhibition of downstream targets of the SNr and thus critical for the function of the basal ganglia ( Chevalier and Deniau, 1990; Hikosaka, 2007 ). SNr neurons have a leak current ( a sodium-dependent tonic current ) that maintains their membrane potential sufficiently depolarized to allow for spontaneous triggering of action potentials in the absence of any synaptic input ( Atherton and Bevan, 2005; Zhou and Lee, 2011 ). It has been suggested that a member of the Transient Receptor Potential ( TRP ) channel family, TRPC3, is the basis for the tonic depolarizing current in SNr neurons ( Zhou et al., 2008 )

., 2001 ). Therefore, understanding the function of NALCN in modulating the tonic activity of SN neurons is crucial for understanding how basal ganglia circuit function and how disruption of NAL may lead to motor and cognitive deficits in humans.
Researchers have developed a droplet-based microfluidic system to cultivate and screen for antibiotic-producing bacteria from complex microbial communities. The system consists of three phases: droplet generation, incubation, and isolation. During droplet generation, single cells are encapsulated in droplets, which are then incubated together in a vessel under dynamic conditions. After incubation, microbial cultures are isolated from droplets by depositing them on agar plates. The system allows for the cultivation of uncultured species and increased bacterial diversity compared to standard plate cultivation. Strains able to inhibit reporter strains were isolated from the system, and a variety of antimicrobial compounds were detected from selected producers.

The droplets can be used to create multispecies communities, which support the growth of dependent species or exert a change in product synthesis. Strains can be isolated after one incubation round, and the emulsion can be broken to start new droplet cultivation from pooled suspension. By passaging community through droplets, replicating organisms become enriched and domestication chance increases. The cultivation and screening strategy is adaptable to fastidious microorganisms, representing sources for natural products. The diversity of natural habitats, especially limited access samples, will be explored with the strategy.

The system combines strain discovery in-dro cultivation with selection of auspicious candidates for product through robust assay, streamlining efforts towards new antibiotics. Microfluid droplets provide genotype-phenotype linkage for secreted products, confined with cell origin. Droplets can be stored, generate incubate large populations under aerobic conditions. A high-throughput screening for antimicrobial using reporter strains in droplets was implemented. Cultivation and screening was verified by culturing complex community from soil sample, compared to agar cultivation. Isolates showed antimicrobial activity in dro screening, and secreted metabolites identified.

The system increased relevance by combining with step to detect and select dro containing cells producing compounds activity. Although axenic species not maintained standard after isolation, cells used for high-quality information. The method assists strain prioritization during mining or future campaigns. Cloning heterologous biosynthetic clusters non-canonical architectures pave novel antibiotics undetected. To increase taxa in droplets, perfluor oil dissolved gases during incubation, microaerobic or anaobic enabled.

    Title: A Bayesian analysis of the association between Leukotriene A4 Hydrolase genotype and survival in tuberculous meningitis
    Abstract: Tuberculous meningitis has high mortality, linked to excessive inflammation. However, adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids reduce mortality by only 30%, suggesting that inflammatory pathophysiology causes only a subset of deaths. In Vietnam, the survival benefit of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids was most pronounced in patients with a C/T promoter variant in the leukotriene A4 hydrolase ( LTA4H ) gene encoding an enzyme that regulates inflammatory eicosanoids. LTA4H TT patients with increased expression had increased survival, consistent with corticosteroids benefiting individuals with hyper-inflammatory responses. However, an Indonesia study did not find an LTA4H TT genotype survival benefit. Here using Bayesian methods to analyse both studies, we find that LTA4H TT genotype confers survival benefit that begins early and continues long-term in both populations. This benefit is nullified in the most severe cases with high early mortality. LTA4H genotyping together with disease severity assessment may target glucocorticoid therapy to patients most likely to benefit from it.

    Supporting Text:
   ., 2004; Tobin et al., 2012 ). Among HIV-negative patients, the survival benefit of dexamethasone was restricted to patients with the hyper-inflammatory TT genotype, with CC patients potentially harmed by this treatment ( Tobin et al., 2012 ). These findings supported the model that mortality from TBM was due to two distinct inflammatory states, and that LTA4H genotype might be a critical determinant of inflammation and consequently of the response to adjunctive anti-inflammatory treatment. If true, then personalized genotype-directed adjunctive glucocorticoid treatment would be warranted, with the drug given only to TT patients. This would be particularly important given the possible harm to the hypo-inflammatory CC group, as well as the adverse effects of long-term high dose treatment with a broadly acting immunosuppressant. To further these findings, two new studies of the association of LTA4H genotype with TBM survival in HIV-negative patients were performed in Vietnam and Indonesia, respectively ( Thuong et al., 2017; van Laarhoven et al., 2017 ). Because glucocorticoid adjunctive therapy had become standard of care owing to the benefit observed in the randomised controlled trial ( Thwaites et al., 2004 ), all patients received it in both studies. Therefore, the prediction that could be tested was that TT mortality is less than CC+CT mortality. Whereas the Vietnam study confirmed this prediction, the Indonesia study did not. The Vietnam cohort had an overall mortality of 18. 8%, similar to that reported in the literature ( Stadelman et al., 2020 ). A striking feature of the Indonesia cohort was its more than two-fold increased mortality in comparison with the Vietnam cohort. Moreover, most of the Indonesia cohort deaths occurred early with a median time to death of eight days versus 50 days in Vietnam ( Table 1 )

. Thus, LTA4H TT efficacy was limited by other factors that cause mortality. These factors appear independent of severity grade on presentation, and if they exceed a threshold ( represented by about ~40% mortality ) then the beneficial effect of LTA4H TT is lost. A limitation of this study is that we cannot definitively determine the causes of this LTA4H genotype-independent excess Grade 3 mortality in Indonesia because the patient populations, hospital care protocols and the availability of intensive care differed between each study site. One possibility is that better ancillary care was possible in Vietnam where all patients were enrolled into a clinical trial versus only 17% in Indonesia ( Thuong et al., 2017; van Laarhoven et al., 2017 ). The excess Grade 3 Indonesia mortality peaked within days, and optimized respiratory support, in particular, would be essential to keep patients alive through the early high risk stage in order allow for anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids to benefit the TT patients. Thus the beneficial effect of dexamethasone to the LTA4H TT group may simply not have had time to come into play in Grade 3 Indonesia patients. A second possibility is that Indonesia Grade 3 patients presented with a greater degree of dysregulated inflammation in a manner not revealed by standard metrics of judging disease severity. If this were the case then corticosteroids might no longer be beneficial. Since both TT and non-TT patients suffered identical excess mortality risk, its cause would have been LTA4H-independent. Indonesia patients tended to be younger than Vietnam patients in all grades ( Table 1 ), and perhaps were more prone to develop such a response. Such a previously unrecognized form of dysregulated inflammation might be caused by other genetic variants uniquely present in the Indonesia patients and would work through an inflammatory pathway that is less responsive to dexamethasone

Tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) is the most severe form of tuberculosis. Despite effective antimicrobial therapy, it results in 20–25% mortality in HIV-negative individuals and ~40% mortality in HIV-positive individuals ( Stadelman et al., 2020; Thwaites et al., 2013 ). A long-standing hypothesis that an excessive intracerebral inflammatory response underlies TBM mortality ( Shane and Riley, 1953 ) led to multiple trials of adjunctive anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids ( e. g. dexamethasone ) ( Prasad et al., 2016; Wilkinson et al., 2017 ). Findings from a randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) in Vietnam that adjunctive dexamethasone improved survival by ~30% led to it becoming standard of care treatment ( Thwaites et al., 2004 ). However, the modest benefit of adjunctive dexamethasone treatment suggested a heterogeneity in glucocorticoid-responsiveness ( Donald and Schoeman, 2004; Schoeman and Donald, 2013 ). Findings in a zebrafish model of TB provided a testable hypothesis for a mechanism underlying this heterogeneity ( Thwaites et al., 2004; Tobin et al., 2012; Tobin et al., 2010 ). The zebrafish findings suggested that either deficiency or excess of leukotriene A4 hydrolase ( LTA4H ), a key enzyme that regulates the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, increase susceptibility to TBM for opposite reasons - too little or too much inflammation ( Tobin et al., 2012; Tobin et al., 2010 ). It became possible to test the prediction when a common human functional LTA4H promoter variant ( rs17525495 ) was identified comprising a C/T transition that controlled LTA4H expression, with the T allele causing increased expression ( Tobin et al., 2012 ). A retrospective analysis of patient LTA4H rs17525495 genotypes in the Vietnam dexamethasone RCT cohort confirmed the prediction ( Thwaites et al., 2004; Tobin et al., 2012 )

. While they had somewhat more severe disease in Grade 2, in Grade 3 where the difference was the most pronounced, they had milder disease ( Figure 1 ). In sum, these analyses show that the inherent higher mortality associated with more severe disease on presentation was sharply accentuated in Indonesia. Indonesia grade 2 patients experienced similar mortality risk as Vietnam Grade 3 patients with the Indonesia Grade 3 patients experiencing far greater mortality. This higher mortality could potentially explain the finding that the LTA4H TT survival advantage did not extend to Indonesia Grade 3 patients. It may be that the TT genotype advantage, in response to corticosteroid treatment, is overridden by other factors that cause extreme mortality.

. This high early mortality raised the possibility that the impact of the LTA4H variant differs by disease severity, and may not be relevant in more severe disease ( Fava and Schurr, 2017 ). If so, then the effects of the LTA4H genotype were being masked by the preponderance of extremely severe cases in the Indonesia cohort ( Fava and Schurr, 2017 ). Both studies used, as the primary metric of significance testing, Cox regression modelling, an approach that assumes that the ratio of hazard rates between groups is constant throughout the observed period ( Bradburn et al., 2003; Greenland et al., 2016 ). Therefore, this analytical method could miss important differences in these studies of TBM, a disease which can present acutely yet have a prolonged time-course with vastly differing mortality risks over time ( Thuong et al., 2017; Thwaites et al., 2013; van Laarhoven et al., 2017 ). Moreover, testing the hypothesis that LTA4H effects are limited to specific disease severity grades requires subgroup analysis. The use of frequentist statistics would limit the ability to perform such subgroup analyses because the penalties it sets for multiple comparisons do not reflect real-world situations ( Gelman and Loken, 2013; Smith and Ebrahim, 2002 ). Bayesian analysis is ideally suited to simultaneously estimate treatment effects in multiple subgroups because it results in different interactions with the number of results obtained which are much less problematic than those arising from frequentist methods ( Gel and Loken,2013; Smith Ebrahim, 2002 ).

    Title: Gradient-reading and mechano-effector machinery for netrin-1-induced axon guidance
    Abstract: Growth cones navigate axonal projection in response to guidance cues. However, it is unclear how they can decide the migratory direction by transducing the local spatial cues into protrusive forces. Here we show that knockout mice of Shootin1 display abnormal projection of the forebrain commissural axons, a phenotype similar to that of the axon guidance molecule netrin-1. Shallow gradients of netrin-1 elicited highly polarized Pak1-mediated phosphorylation of shootin1 within growth cones. We demonstrate that netrin-1–elicited shootin1 phosphorylation increases shootin1 interaction with the cell adhesion molecule L1-CAM; this, in turn, promotes F-actin–adhesion coupling and concomitant generation of forces for growth cone migration. Moreover, the spatially regulated shootin1 phosphorylation within growth cones is required for axon turning induced by netrin-1 gradients. Our study defines a mechano-effector for netrin-1 signaling and demonstrates that shootin1 phosphorylation is a critical readout for netrin-1 gradients that results in a directional mechanoresponse for axon guidance.

   ., 2013; Kubo et al., 2015 ). However, whether shootin1a mediates axon guidance in vitro and in vivo remains unknown. In addition, how shootin1a associates with the substrates through L1-CAM is uncharacterized ( Kubo et al., 2015 ). Here, we combined gene knockout, protein interaction assays, force microscopy, speckle imaging and microfluidics to define a gradient-reading and mechano-effector machinery for netrin-1–induced axon guidance. We show that shootin1a is expressed at high levels in developing forebrain commissural axons and that Shootin1 knockout mice display abnormal guidance of these axons, a phenotype similar to that of Netrin-1 knockout mice. Notably, very small spatial differences in netrin-1 concentration elicited highly polarized directional phosphorylation of shootin1a within growth cones. Netrin-1–elicited shootin1a phosphorylation promoted direct interaction between shootin1a and L1-CAM, thereby generating traction force for growth cone motility. Furthermore, disturbance of the spatially regulated shootin1a phosphorylation within growth cones inhibited axon turning, but not axon outgrowth, induced by netrin-1 gradients. Our data demonstrate that shootin1a, through its spatially regulated phosphorylation within growth cones, mediates the gradient reading and mechanoresponse for netrin-1–induced axon guidance.

The present study defines a mechano-effector for netrin-1–induced axon guidance. Previous reports proposed that an increase in the mechanical coupling between F-actin retrograde flow in the growth cone and cell adhesions transmits the force of F-actin flow onto the adhesive substrates for growth cone migration ( Mitchison and Kirschner, 1988; Suter and Forscher, 2000 ). In relation to this notion, a recent study reported that axon guidance cues affect F-actin–adhesion coupling locally within the growth cone to influence axon outgrowth and guidance ( Nichol et al., 2016 ). In addition, we previously reported that shootin1a associates with the F-actin flow at the growth cone through its direct interaction with cortactin, and showed that netrin-1–induced phosphorylation of shootin1a by Pak1 promotes shootin1a–F-actin interaction through cortactin ( Toriyama et al., 2013; Kubo et al., 2015 ). Here, we demonstrated that netrin-1–induced shootin1a phosphorylation by Pak1 also promotes direct interaction between shootin1a and L1-CAM. Previous studies reported that netrin-1 induces dimerization of its receptor, DCC, thereby activating molecules including NCK1, FAK and FYN ( Stein et al., 2001; Ren et al., 2004; Lai Wing Sun et al., 2011 ). This in turn induces activation of Cdc42 and Rac1, and their downstream kinase Pak1 ( Li et al., 2002; Shekarabi and Kennedy, 2002; Shekarabi et al., 2005; Briançon-Marjollet et al., 2008; Demarco et al., 2012 ) ( Figure 8E ). Thus, under the activation of Pak1 via these signaling pathways, the shootin1a phosphorylation enhances both the shootin1a–adhesion and shootin1a–F-actin interactions that lead to increased F-actin–adhesion coupling ( Figure 8E ). This double regulation would enable efficient regulation of forces for axon guidance in response to netrin-1. At present, no information is available on the three-dimensional structure of shootin1a

. In addition, it is unknown how shootin1a–L1-CAM and shootin1a–cortactin interactions are promoted by the phosphorylation of shootin1a. Future investigations of the molecular structure of shootin1a, and of how the structures of the domains mediating interaction with L1-CAM and cortactin are affected by phosphorylation, will lead to a better understanding of this mechano-effector machinery. The ability of cells to sense small spatial differences in environmental cues is essential for proper axon guidance as well as directional cell migration, but the molecular mechanism underlying it remains a major question ( Quinn and Wadsworth, 2008; Hegemann and Peter, 2017 ). Initial studies reported that growth cones can respond to 1% gradients of repulsive tectal membranes presented on the substrate ( Baier and Bonhoeffer, 1992 ) and 5–10% gradients of diffusible axon guidance molecules including netrin-1 ( Ming et al., 1999 ). More recently, analyses employing microfluidic devices demonstrated that growth cones have even higher sensitivities to chemical gradients: for example, they can turn in response to 0. 1–0. 4% gradients of NGF ( Rosoff et al., 2004 ), and 0. 5 and 0. 1% gradients of substrate-bound laminin and ephrin-A5, respectively ( Xiao et al., 2014 ). This study presents the framework of a highly sensitive gradient-reading machinery for axon guidance ( Figure 8E ). Our data demonstrate that a 0. 4% ( 250:251 ) difference in netrin-1 concentration induces a 71% difference in shootin1a phosphorylation within growth cones, as a key readout of the spatial signal. This polarized phosphorylation locally promotes shootin1a–L1-CAM and shootin1a–cortactin interactions within growth cones and asymmetrically promote traction force ( blue arrows, F Figure 8E ) on the side of the netrin-1 source, leading to a decision for the migratory direction ( white arrow, Figure 8E )

. These data suggest that the interaction between shootin1a and L1-CAM mediates netrin-1–induced axon guidance. Laminins are widely used substrates for axon guidance assays ( Turney and Bridgman, 2005; Nichol et al., 2016 ) ; L1-CAM on growth cones interacts directly with laminin presented on the substrate ( Hall et al., 1997; Abe et al., 2018 ). To examine whether the shootin1a–L1-CAM interaction mediates netrin-1–induced axon guidance generally, we performed an axon guidance assay on an alternative substrate, laminin. Growth cones of cultured hippocampal neurons on laminin turned in response to netrin-1 gradients ( Figure 7—figure supplement 4A–C ), as they did on L1-CAM ( Figure 7―figure supplement 1A ). To assess shootin1a-mediated clutch coupling on laminin, we measured F-actin retrograde flow in growth cones on laminin. Consistent with previously reported data ( Abe et al., 2018 ), the F-actin retrograde flow rate in control growth cones on laminin was 2. 3 ± 0. 3 μm/min ( Figure 7—figure supplement 4D ). As in the case of growth cones on L1-CAM ( Figure 6A and B ), overexpression of shootin1a ( 1-125 ) increased significantly the retrograde flow rate under these conditions ( Figure 7—figure supplement 4D ), indicating that inhibition of the shootin1a–L1-CAM interaction also disrupts F-actin-adhesion coupling in growth cones on laminin. Furthermore, uncoupling of F-actin-adhesion coupling by shootin1a ( 1-125 ) inhibited netrin-1–induced axon outgrowth and turning on laminin ( Figure 7—figure supplement 4A–C and E ). Together, these data indicate that netrin-1–induced shoot1 phosphorylation of shoot1 promotes shoot1–L-CAM interaction, which mediates netrin-1–induced axon guidance on both L-C and lamin substrates.

    Title: How oscillating aerodynamic forces explain the timbre of the hummingbird’s hum and other animals in flapping flight
    Abstract: How hummingbirds hum is not fully understood, but its biophysical origin is encoded in the acoustic nearfield. Hence, we studied six freely hovering Anna’s hummingbirds, performing acoustic nearfield holography using a 2176 microphone array in vivo, while also directly measuring the 3D aerodynamic forces using a new aerodynamic force platform. We corroborate the acoustic measurements by developing an idealized acoustic model that integrates the aerodynamic forces with wing kinematics, which shows how the timbre of the hummingbird’s hum arises from the oscillating lift and drag forces on each wing. Comparing birds and insects, we find that the characteristic humming timbre and radiated power of their flapping wings originates from the higher harmonics in the aerodynamic forces that support their bodyweight. Our model analysis across insects and birds shows that allometric deviation makes larger birds quieter and elongated flies louder, while also clarifying complex bioacoustic behavior.

   ., 2017 ). When fruit flies use their wing as an aeroacoustic instrument during terrestrial courtship serenades; however, they reduce their stroke amplitude to a similar degree ( von Schilcher, 1976; Bennet-Clark and Ewing, 1968 ), which likely colors their timbre as in mosquitos ( Figure 4A–D ). Our acoustic model explains how the oscillating lift and drag forces generated by each wing of a hovering hummingbird radiate the distinctive humming timbre. It integrates in vivo 3D aerodynamic force and wing kinematics measurements and is corroborated spatially and temporally through in vivo nearfield acoustic holography. The measurements and model show that hovering hummingbirds generate a highly directional hum. The broadband acoustic pressure is primarily oriented downward opposing gravity, while the acoustic directivity and orientation of the harmonic components depend on harmonic parity. The model explains how perceived differences in hum loudness and timbre across birds and insects stem primarily from the harmonic content in the aerodynamic weight support profile. Higher harmonic content throughout the wing stroke makes flies and mosquitos buzz, equivalent first and second harmonic content makes hummingbirds hum, while dominant first harmonic content gives birds their softer whoosh. The associated scaling relation for radiated acoustic power shows how it is proportional to the product of stroke amplitude, body mass and wingbeat frequency squared. Our scaling analysis across 170 different animals in slow hovering flight reveals how the radiated acoustic power scaled with mass. Allometric deviation explains why larger birds radiate less acoustic power than expected and why elongated flies have a remarkably loud buzz as perceived by a casual observer

., 2004 ), this and other behavioral evidence suggests hummingbirds may be able to perceive the wing hum from a conspecific. Finally, the hum may reveal the hummingbird’s presence to predators in plant clutter when vision is obstructed. To resolve how the oscillating aerodynamic force generated by flapping wings may contribute to wing hum, we developed a new aerodynamic force platform ( Ingersoll and Lentink, 2018; Lentink et al., 2015; Hightower et al., 2017 ) to directly measure the net 3D aerodynamic force generated by freely hovering hummingbirds. We integrated this data in a new aeroacoustics model to predict the sound radiated due to the oscillating forces from flapping wings. Our model is idealized in the sense that it assumes the wings are rigid airfoils, thereby neglecting auxiliary effects such as wingtip flutter, feather whistle and ( turbulent ) vortex dynamics. Next, we compared the predicted acoustic field with novel acoustic nearfield recordings for six freely hovering hummingbirds, which corroborates the predictive power of our minimal model. We then used our validated model to determine how flapping wing hum depends on the frequency content in the oscillating forces across mosquitos, flies, hawkmoths, hummingbirds, and parrotlets in slow hovering flight. Finally, we used these findings to determine how the hum scales with body mass and flapping frequency across 170 insect and bird species.

., 2019 ) reduces the simulated nearfield sound pressure level. All these findings point to the potential role of oscillating aerodynamic forces in generating wing hum. Indeed, numerical simulation of the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings aeroacoustic equation ( Williams and Hawkings, 1969 ) showed that the farfield hum of flapping mosquito wings is primarily driven by aerodynamic force fluctuation ( Seo et al., 2019 ). Despite these important advances, in vivo acoustic near-field measurements are lacking. Finally, there is no simple model that can satisfactorily integrate flapping wing kinematics and aerodynamic forces to predict the acoustic near and far field generated by animals across taxa without using computationally expensive fluid dynamic simulations. Hummingbirds are an ideal subject for developing and testing a model of flapping wing hum: their wing kinematics and unsteady aerodynamic forces are very repeatable during hover ( Altshuler and Dudley, 2003; Tobalske et al., 2007; Ingersoll and Lentink, 2018 ). Further, hummingbird wing morphology and flight style share similarities with both birds and insects. In addition to high-frequency feather sonations, hummingbirds produce a prominent hum that is qualitatively similar to an insect’s buzz. Earlier aeroacoustics studies of hummingbirds have resolved the farfield acoustic pressure field at a distance greater than 10 or more body lengths away from the hummingbird ( Clark and Mistick, 2018a; Clark, 2008; Clark et al., 2016; Clark and Mistick, 2018b ). While this distance relates to how humans perceive and interact with these animals, hummingbirds frequently interact with conspecifics and other animals at more intimate distances—in the acoustic nearfield. Furthermore, wing hum can announce a hummingbird's presence, especially to the opposite sex ( Hunter, 2008 ). Although their audiogram has yet to be established below 1 kHz ( Pytte et al

To determine how the flapping wings of hovering hummingbirds generate unsteady aerodynamic forces as well as their namesake acoustic humming signature, we combine aerodynamic force platform ( Figure 1A ) and microphone array recordings ( Figure 1D ) in vivo. The aerodynamic force platform integrates both the steady and unsteady components of the pressure field around the bird up to three times the wingbeat frequency, which are associated with its net 3D aerodynamic forces. In contrast, the microphone arrays measure the unsteady component of the pressure field around the bird up to ~1000 times the wingbeat frequency ( of which we studied the first ten harmonics ) : the acoustic field. Critically, these two representations of the pressure fluctuations generated by the bird should relate mechanistically if the acoustic field of the hummingbird’s hum originates primarily from the oscillating aerodynamic lift and drag forces generated by the flapping wings. The oscillating 3D aerodynamic forces were recorded simultaneously with the wingbeat kinematics using three calibrated stereo high-speed camera pairs ( Figure 1A; N = 6 birds, n = 2 flights per bird, n = 5 wingbeats per flight: 60 total wingbeats ). We combined the 3D aerodynamic forces, 3D wing kinematics and wing morphology measurements to decompose the oscillating lift and drag forces that each wing generates throughout the wingbeat ( Figure 1B, C ). The oscillating lift trace consists primarily of the peak force generated during downstroke, which corresponds to a peak in its spectrum at the first wingbeat harmonic ( 44. 2 ± 1. 8 Hz ). The drag trace consists of two equivalent drag peaks during the upstroke and downstroke, which corresponds to a dominant peak in its spectrum at the second harmonic. We also measured the 3D beak contact force on the artificial flower from which the hummingbird was feeding, which is negligible ( 5. 2 ± 2. 3% bodyweight )

. 2 ± 2. 3% bodyweight ). The 3D acoustic field associated with the bird’s hum was quantitatively reconstructed from measurements recorded in a custom flight arena using four acoustic arrays ( Figure 1D; N = 6 birds, n = 18 flights total, see Supplementary file 1 for details ). The recording by a single microphone centered above the bird shows a typical pressure trace throughout a single wingbeat ( Figure 1E ). The many fluctuations explain the rich frequency content revealed in the acoustic spectrum averaged over all microphones ( Figure 1F ). These include strong peaks at the fundamental frequencies of the wingbeat as well as its higher harmonics, which rise prominently above the background noise floor and characterize the hummingbird hum. To determine if the low frequency oscillating forces generated by the birds’ flapping wings drive the characteristic humming sound spectrum, we develop a simple aeroacoustics model based on the governing acoustics equations that predict the resulting acoustic field. Our minimal model of the acoustic pressure field radiated by the flapping wings ( Figure 1G ) depends only on the physical properties of air, the wing stroke kinematics ( Figure 1H ), and the oscillating lift and drag forces that we measured in vivo ( Figure 1B ). Aerodynamic analysis of propellers shows how a radial force distribution can be decomposed into lift and drag components. The lift is proportional to the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of the wing, while drag is proportional to the pressure difference between the leading and trailing edges. We assume the wing is a rigid airfoil, neglecting effects such as wingtip, flutter, feather, and turbulent vortex dynamics. Our model predicts the acoustic field radiated by the flapping wings as a function of the oscillating lift and drag forces ( Figure 1 ), which we validated by comparing with nearfield recordings of six freely hoveringbirds ( Figure 1 ). We used the validated model to determine how flapping hum depends on the content of oscillating forces across mosquitos, flies, hawkmoths, hummingbirds, and parlets in slow flight. Finally, we used these findings to determine how the hum scales with mass and flapping frequency across 170 insect and bird species.
Researchers investigated the roles of chance and necessity in protein evolution by reconstructing ancestral B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) proteins and evolving them to acquire protein-protein interactions (PPI) specificities that occurred during animal evolution. They replicated evolutionary trajectories from ancestral proteins and found that contingency generated over historical timescales erased necessity and chance as the primary cause of sequence variation. Trajectories from phylogenetically distant proteins yielded no common mutations even under strong selection pressures. Chance arose many mutations could alter specificity at any point; contingency arose historical substitutions changed these sets. Results suggest BCL-2 sequences and other proteins are idiosyncratic products of particular and unpredictable historical events.

The study used a high-throughput phage-assisted continuous evolution (P) system to select for and against PIs. Mutations rose to frequency during evolution were different among trajectories initiated from starting points separated by phylogen distances. A strong role for chance was observed because trajectories from the same point evolved differences; a greater effect of contingency because trajectories from different starting points evolved greater differences. Combined, chance and contingency erased traces between trajectories initiated distantly starting. Predictable states were those unchanged from the point, presumably unconditionally necessary for PIs and conserved by purifying selection.

The study quantified chance and contingency by calculating variance among replicates from the same point and pooled replicates from different points. The effect of chance was quantified by comparing outcomes from the same point; contingency by outcomes from different points. This design allowed characterizing factors over phylogen time and dissecting genetic basis they emerged. Contingency's strong effect on evolution and acquisition of new functions suggests directed evolution will be effective and lead diverse outcomes using different sequences starting points. Ancestral proteins provide routes inaccessible functions from extant.

The study has implications for understanding protein evolution and natural variation. Observations suggest sequence-structure associations in alignments result contingent constraints imposed by events during history. Evolution explanations diversity conservation must consider historical trajectories evolved, not history-free dominant thought. Present-day B-2 proteins and others are anecdotes particular histories reflecting accumulated chance and necessity.

    Title: Admixture into and within sub-Saharan Africa
    Abstract: Similarity between two individuals in the combination of genetic markers along their chromosomes indicates shared ancestry and can be used to identify historical connections between different population groups due to admixture. We use a genome-wide, haplotype-based, analysis to characterise the structure of genetic diversity and gene-flow in a collection of 48 sub-Saharan African groups. We show that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 7000 years, and that Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo speaking groups share ancestry with Central West Africans as a result of recent population expansions. In fact, most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups from outside of their current geographic region as a result of gene-flow within the last 4000 years. Our in-depth analysis provides insight into haplotype sharing across different ethno-linguistic groups and the recent movement of alleles into new environments, both of which are relevant to studies of genetic epidemiology.

    Supporting Text:
   . Understanding the extent to which individuals share haplotypes ( which we call coancestry ), rather than independent markers, can provide a rich description of ancestral relationships and population history ( Lawson et al., 2012; Leslie et al., 2015 ). For each group we use the latest analytical tools to characterise the populations as mixtures of haplotypes and provide estimates for the date of admixture events ( Lawson et al., 2012; Hellenthal et al., 2014; Leslie et al., 2015; Montinaro et al., 2015 ). As well as providing a quantitative measure of the coancestry between groups, we identify the dominant events which have shaped current genetic diversity in sub-Saharan Africa. We close by discussing the relevance of these observations to studying genotype-phenotype associations in Africa.

. The remaining 23 groups are from publicly available datasets from a further eight sub-Saharan African countries ( Pagani et al., 2012; Schlebusch et al., 2012; Petersen et al., 2013 ) and the 1000 Genomes Project ( 1KGP ), with Eurasian groups from the latter included to help understand the genetic contribution from outside of the continent ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ). With the exception of Austronesian in Madagascar, African languages can be broadly classified into four major macro-families: Afroasiatic, Nilo-Saharan, Niger-Congo, and Khoesan ( Blench, 2006 ) ; and although we have representative groups from each ( Supplementary file 1 ), our sample represents a significant proportion of the sub-Saharan population in terms of number, but not does not equate to a complete picture of African ethnic diversity. We created an integrated dataset of genotypes at 328, 000 high-quality SNPs and use established approaches for comparing population allele frequencies across groups to provide a baseline view of historical gene-flow. We then apply statistical approaches to phasing genotypes to obtain haplotypes for each individual, and use previously published methods to represent the haplotypes that an individual carries as a mosaic of other haplotypes in the sample ( so-called chromosome painting [Li and Stephens, 2003] ). We present a detailed picture of haplotype sharing across sub-Saharan Africa using a model-based clustering approach that groups individuals using haplotype information alone. The inferred groups reflect broad-scale geographic patterns. At finer scales, our analysis reveals smaller groups, and often differentiates closely related populations consistent with self-reported ancestry ( Tishkoff et al., 2009; Bryc et al., 2010; Hodgson et al., 2014a ). We describe these patterns by measuring gene-flow between populations and relate them to potential historical movements of people into and within sub-Saharan Africa

. Moreover, our analysis – in addition to evidence from linguistic phylogenetics ( Currie et al., 2013; Grollemund et al., 2015 ) – provides genetic support for the late-split hypothesis, suggesting that the agriculturist Bantus migrated south around the Congo rainforest before travelling east. Our haplotype-based analyses support a complex picture of recent historical gene-flow in Africa ( Figure 6 ). Using genetics to infer historical demography will always depend on the available samples and methods used to infer population relationships. Our aim here is to highlight the key gene-flow events that chromosome painting allows us to detect, and to describe their affect on the structure of coancestry:10. 7554/eLife. 15266. 032Figure 6. The geography of recent gene-flow in Africa. We summarise gene-flow events in Africa using the results of the GLOBETROTTER analysis. For each ethnic group, we inferred the composition of the admixture sources, and link recipient population to surrogates using arrows, the width of which is proportional to the amount it contributes to the admixture event. We separately plot ( A ) all events involving admixture source components from the Bantu and Semi-Bantu ethnic groups in Cameroon; ( B ) all events involving admixture sources from East and Southern African Niger-Congo speaking groups; ( C ) events involving admixture sources from West African Niger-Congo and East African Nilo-Saharan / Afroasiatic groups; ( D ) all events involving components from Eurasia. in ( D ) arrows are linked to the labelled 1KGP Eurasian groups. Arrows are coloured by country of origin, as in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.

An alternative version of this plot, stratified by date, is shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 15266. 03210. 7554/eLife. 15266

., 2006 ). As in other regions of the world ( Novembre et al., 2008; Behar et al., 2010 ), the leading principal components show that genetic relationships are broadly defined by geographical and ethno-linguistic similarity ( Figure 1B, C ). The first two principal components ( PCs ) reflect ethno-linguistic divides: PC1 splits southern Khoesan speaking populations from the rest of Africa, and PC2 splits the East African Afroasiatic and Nilo-Saharan speakers from sub-Saharan African Niger-Congo speakers. The third axis of variation defines east versus west Africa, suggesting that in general, population structure in Africa largely mirrors linguistic and geographic similarity ( Tishkoff et al., 2009 ). To access the information from the combination of markers along chromosomes we phased the genotype data into haplotypes, and applied a previously published implementation of chromosome painting ( CHROMOPAINTER [Lawson et al., 2012] ), to estimate the amount of an individual’s genome that is shared with each other individual in the data. More specifically, we paint each recipient individual’s genome as a mosaic of haplotype segments ( chunks ) copied from each other donor individual, and summarise these as copying vectors. We used the clustering algorithm implemented in fineSTRUCTURE ( Lawson et al., 2012 ) to group individuals purely on the similarity of these copying vectors ( Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ). The pairwise coancestry between individuals can be visualised as a heatmap with each row being the copying vector for each sample ( Figure 1D ), and these are clustered hierarchically to form a tree which describes the inferred relationship between different groups ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ). The fineSTRUCTURE analysis identified 154 clusters of individuals, grouped on the basis of copying vector similarity ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 )

. For example, our analyses indicate that the Mossi share deep ancestry with Eurasian and Khoesan groups ( Figure 3 ), but any description of the historical event leading to this observation is potentially biased by the discontinuity between extant populations and those present in Africa in the past. It is for this reason that, for older events, we define and refer to broader ancestry regions. So in this case, we describe Eurasian ancestry in general moving back into Africa, rather than British DNA in particular. GLOBETROTTER provides an alternative approach by characterising admixture as occurring between sources that themselves are mixtures of ancestry from contemporary groups. In the situation where no sample group provides a good representation of the admixture source, this additional complexity is likely to be a closer approximation to the truth, with the downside that it is not always possible to assign a specific population label to mixed admixture sources. Using contemporary populations as proxies for ancient groups is not the perfect approach and would be improved by DNA from significant numbers of ancient human individuals, at sufficient quality, with which to calibrate temporal changes in population genetics. When new haplotypes are introduced into a population by gene-flow their fate will be partly be determined by the selective advantage they confer, as well as the chance effects of genetic drift. Selection can occur in response to a number of different factors. Greenlandic Inuit, for example, have adapted genetically to a diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids ( Fumagalli et al., 2015 ), and one of the strongest signals of selection in the genome is found around the LCT gene ( Bersaglieri et al., 2004 ), mutations in which allow for efficient absorption of these fatty acids. In Africa, selection may have occurred in response to environment, such as climate, diet, or disease, or other factors such as drug resistance to malaria, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.

    Title: Mitotic spindle scaling during Xenopus development by kif2a and importin α
    Abstract: Early development of many animals is characterized by rapid cleavages that dramatically decrease cell size, but how the mitotic spindle adapts to changing cell dimensions is not understood. To identify mechanisms that scale the spindle during Xenopus laevis embryogenesis, we established an in vitro system using cytoplasmic extracts prepared from embryos that recapitulates in vivo spindle size differences between stage 3 ( 4 cells, 37 µm ) and stage 8 ( ∼4000 cells, 18 µm ). We identified the kinesin-13 kif2a as a driver of developmental spindle scaling whose microtubule-destabilizing activity is inhibited in stage 3 spindles by the transport receptor importin α, and activated in stage 8 when importin α partitions to a membrane pool. Altering spindle size in developing embryos impaired spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remained robust. Thus, spindle size in Xenopus development is coupled to cell size through a ratiometric mechanism controlling microtubule destabilization.

   . To address how spindle size is determined during vertebrate embryogenesis, we created an embryo extract system capable of assembling spindles in cytoplasmic extracts at any stage of X. laevis development up to the midblastula transition when cell divisions become asynchronous ( Newport and Kirschner, 1982 ). We compared stage 3 and stage 8, the two extremes of spindle size in our extract system, and found that MT dynamics are modified to reduce spindle size upon release of an inhibitory interaction between the MT depolymerizing kinesin kif2a and importin α. This occurs through redistribution of importin α from the cytoplasm to a membrane fraction. Taking advantage of this mechanism to modify spindle size without functionally perturbing the spindle allowed us to uncover an important role for spindle size in maintaining spindle orientation in the large cells of early Xenopus development. This work suggests that the changing physical features of the cell can drive intracellular scaling through biochemical partitioning and steady-state redistribution of activities.

Reconstituting spindle formation in embryo extracts enabled us to elucidate a mechanism that coordinates spindle size with cell size during X. laevis development through differential activation of the kinesin-13 kif2a. While a number of perturbations have been shown to alter spindle size, we have identified, out the hundreds of known spindle associated proteins, physiological effectors that operate to scale the spindle during embryogenesis. Considering our recent work identifying the microtubule severing enzyme katanin as an activity that scales spindle sized between related frog species, modulation of MT destabilization has now emerged as a general means of physiologically scaling spindle size in Xenopus ( Loughlin et al., 2011 ). In contrast to interspecies spindle scaling, which relied on a regulatory phosphorylation site, the developmental mechanism described here depends on decreasing cytoplasmic levels of an inhibitor, importin α, which may be directly linked to changes in the ratio of surface membrane to cell volume ( Figure 7D ). Importantly, this mechanism functions cell autonomously and independent of developmental stage, thereby assuring that the spindle scales correctly over the range of cell sizes present in the embryo at each cleavage division. It is important to note that neither the interspecies nor developmental scaling mechanisms identified fully account for spindle size differences. Future research will tell whether many factors are involved and if there are other common themes. In principle, any pathway containing factors that partition between the cytoplasm and membrane could have altered output with changing cell size during embryogenesis. Similarly, rounds of DNA, centrosome, or other organelle replication in the absence of cell growth could provide exponentially growing sinks for inhibitory factors or drive spatial redistribution of molecules that contribute to intracellular scaling

. Interestingly, nuclear size is also sensitive to importin α levels, and in this way, nuclear and spindle size may be coordinated, positioning importin α as a central molecule in controlling the size of multiple subcellular structures ( Levy and Heald, 2010 ). While the RanGTP gradient is known to act through activation of MT stabilizers and motor proteins, we have identified kif2a as the first MT-destabilizing protein that could be regulated by this pathway ( Walczak and Heald, 2008 ). Consistent with a role for kif2a in spindle size control, either increasing its levels or disrupting its localization by inhibiting dynein can modulate meiotic spindle size in Xenopus egg extracts ( Gaetz and Kapoor, 2004; Ohi et al., 2007 ). In contrast, inhibiting the other kinesin-13 family member MCAK dramatically affects global MT dynamics ( Ohi et al., 2007 ). This difference may be due to high importin α levels limiting the activity of kif2a in egg extract spindles. Whether importin α regulates kif2a in cultured cells, where it is necessary for bipolar spindle assembly and poleward flux of MTs ( Ganem and Compton, 2004; Ganem et al., 2005 ), is unknown. Kif2a phosphorylation by aurora and polo kinases modulates its activity, which is also regulated through an interaction with inner centromere Kin-I stimulator ( ICIS ) ( Jang et al., 2009; Knowlton et al., 2009 ). A comprehensive evaluation of kif2a's many interactions will help determine how layers of regulation are integrated to control developmental spindle scaling. By identifying a physiological mechanism that controls spindle size and then altering it, we have identified a role for spindle size in maintaining spindle orientation in very large cells of the early X. laevis embryo. However, chromosome segregation was robust to decreases in spindle size indicating that spindle architecture remained viable and a large spindle is not essential for division of large cells

Cell size varies widely among different organisms and cell types, and changes rapidly during early animal development when cell division occurs in the absence of growth. The mitotic spindle, a dynamic bipolar structure composed primarily of microtubules ( MTs ) and organizing proteins ( Walczak and Heald, 2008 ), must adjust to cell size to segregate chromosomes the proper distance and signal to the cell cortex to specify orientation of the cleavage furrow ( Levy and Heald, 2012 ). However, the mechanisms coordinating cell and spindle size are poorly understood, and the functional consequences of altering these mechanisms during vertebrate development are unknown. Embryogenesis of the frog Xenopus laevis typifies the developmental scaling problem, and both cell and spindle sizes have been measured ( Wuhr et al., 2008 ). Following fertilization, the ∼1. 2-mm-diameter egg synchronously divides 12 times at approximately 30-min intervals, leading to a ∼100-fold decrease in cell volume and at least a 20-fold decrease in cell diameter by the midblastula transition ( stage 8. 5 ), when zygotic transcription starts. Initially, the cortically localized meiosis II spindle ( ∼35 µm ) segregates chromosomes a short distance, generating a small polar body that preserves egg cytoplasm. During the early cleavages, there is an upper limit to spindle size ( ∼60 µm ), and astral microtubules mediate movement of chromosomes long distances during anaphase ( Wuhr et al., 2008 ). At these stages, spindle size is small compared to cell size, and cytoplasmic mechanisms likely operate, since in vivo spindle size is maintained in extracts prepared from eggs or two-cell stage embryos ( Mitchison et al., 2005; Wuhr et al., 2008; Loughlin et al., 2011 ). As cell and spindle size converge, a constant ratio of ∼2:1 cell diameter:spindle length is established, and spindle length reduces to ∼20 µm by the end of the synchronous cleavage divisions

. To what extent cell size influences spindle size or if changes in cytoplasmic activities contribute to spindle scaling at these later stages is unknown. Experiment and simulation indicate that the balance of MT nucleation, transport, and destabilization are critical for setting spindle size in egg extracts ( Loughlin et al., 2010; Brugues et al., 2012 ). By comparing two closely related Xenopus species, we showed previously that meiotic spindle size is partially controlled by activity of the MT severing protein katanin ( Loughlin et al., 2011 ). However, the genetically encoded differences that underpinned variation in katanin activity cannot play a role during early development in an embryo with a single genetic background and when transcription is repressed. In early Caenorhabditis elegans development, decreasing spindle length correlates with a decrease in centrosome size and a decay gradient of the protein of TPXL-1 along spindle MTs ( Greenan et al., 2010 ). In contrast, spindle assembly in X. laevis egg extracts does not require centrosomes and depends heavily on a chromatin-centered gradient of RanGTP, which locally releases spindle assembly factors from the nucleocytoplasmic transport protein importin β and its adaptor importin α that binds nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) –containing cargos ( Gruss et al., 2007 ). Importin α has been shown to regulate spindle size in egg extracts by inhibiting the MT-destabilizing kines-13 kifA (this study ), which is activated when import α redistributes from the cytoplasm to a membrane fraction. This mechanism is distinct from interspecies spindle scaling, which relies on phosphorylation of a regulatory site ( Lough et al. 201 ). Importantly, this mechanism functions autonomously and independently of developmental stage, ensuring spindle scales correctly over the range of cell sizes present in the embryo at each cleavage. Future research will determine if other factors are involved and if there are common themes. In principle, pathways containing factors that partition the cytoplasm and membrane could be altered with changing cell size during embryogenesis. Similarly, rounds of DNA, centome, or other organelle replication in the absence of growth could provide sinks for inhibitory or drive redistribution molecules that contribute to intracellular scaling. Nuclear size is also sensitive to importin levels, and in this way, nuclear and spindle may be coordinated positioningin as a molecule controlling size multiple subcell structures ( Levy and Heald,201 ) While RanGTP is known to activate MT stabilizers and motor proteins, we have identified k2 as the MT-destabil protein regulated by this pathway ( Walak and Heald,2008 ) Consistent with a role k2 in size, either increasing its levels or disrupting localization inhibiting dyne can modulate meiotic spindle in Xen egg extracts (etz and Kapoor,2004 Ohi et al,2007 ) In contrast inhibiting other kines-13 member MCA dramatically affects global dynamics (hi et al,2007 This may be due import α levels limiting activity k2 in egg spind. Whether α regulates k2 in cultured, it is for bipolar assembly and poleward MTs ( Gan and Compton,200 Gan et al,2005 ) is unknown K2 phosphorylation by aurora and polo kinases modulates its activity which also through interaction with innercentrom Kin stim (IC ) Jang et al,200 Knowl et,2009 A evaluation k2 interactions will determine how regulation integrated control developmental scaling By identifying physiological mechanism controls spindle and altering, we have role size in maintaining spindle orientation large cells early X. lavis embryo However, segregation was robust decreases spindle indicating spindle architecture viable and large is not for division large cells size varies widely among organisms and cell types, and rapidly during early development when division occurs absence growth The mitotic a dynamic composed primarily microtub ( MT ) and proteins must adjust cell segregate chromosomes proper distance signal cortex specify cleavage However, mechanisms cell size poorly understood functional consequences altering vertebrate unknown embryogenesis frog lavis typifies scaling cell and sizes been measured following fertilization ∼ -diameter synchronously 12 at approximately intervals leading ∼ -fold decrease volume least -fold diameter midula stage when zyg transcription Initially cortically me II ∼ segregates short generating polar preserves cytoplasm early cleav upper limit spindle ∼ and astr mediate long during anaph Wuhr at stages size small compared cell cytoplasm mechanisms operate extracts eggs two-cell embryos Mitch et al Wuhr Lough et 201 As converge constant ratio diameter: spindle length established reduces end synchronous divisions Experiment indicate balance MT nucleation transport destabil critical extracts Lough Brues et By two species showed meiotic size controlled sever katin Lough et However genetically differences under variation katin role early embryo genetic repressed Caenorhabitis development spindle correlates decrease centome gradient TP-1 along MTs Green et contrast assembly X lavis does not centomes depends heavily chromatin RanG locally assembly factors nucleocytoplasm import β adaptor α NLS cargos Gr et Import α shown regulate spindle extracts inhibiting MTdestabilizing kif this study activated redistributes cytopl membrane mechanism distinct interspecies relies phosphorylation L

    Title: Tandem riboswitches form a natural Boolean logic gate to control purine metabolism in bacteria
    Abstract: Gene control systems sometimes interpret multiple signals to set the expression levels of the genes they regulate. In rare instances, ligand-binding riboswitch aptamers form tandem arrangements to approximate the function of specific two-input Boolean logic gates. Here, we report the discovery of riboswitch aptamers for phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( PRPP ) that naturally exist either in singlet arrangements, or occur in tandem with guanine aptamers. Tandem guanine-PRPP aptamers can bind the target ligands, either independently or in combination, to approximate the function expected for an IMPLY Boolean logic gate to regulate transcription of messenger RNAs for de novo purine biosynthesis in bacteria. The existence of sophisticated all-RNA regulatory systems that sense two ancient ribonucleotide derivatives to control synthesis of RNA molecules supports the hypothesis that RNA World organisms could have managed a complex metabolic state without the assistance of protein regulatory factors.

    Supporting Text:
   . In this regard, each RNA molecule carrying this tandem aptamer arrangement functions as a Boolean IMPLY logic gate. The truth table for an IMPLY logic gate ( Figure 6A ) indicates that gene expression should be on when neither ligand is present, and when PRPP is bound by the RNA – even when guanine is available. Finally, gene expression should be off when guanine is bound by the RNA, which should occur when guanine is abundant while PRPP is not. This regulatory pattern could be accomplished by the tandem RNA arrangement through formation of an antiterminator stem by alternative base pairing interactions between the two aptamers, similar to those observed for an allosterically-regulated tandem riboswitch-ribozyme described previously ( Lee et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2011 ). Alternatively, as noted earlier, the aptamers might compete sterically due to the proximity of their conserved sequences and structures. Regardless of the precise mechanism, we hypothesize that an unoccupied PRPP aptamer permits formation of the terminator stem, whereas an occupied guanine aptamer destabilizes the PRPP aptamer. Additional detailed kinetic and structural studies will be necessary to reveal the precise molecular interactions that yield IMPLY gene control logic. When transcription termination or gene expression is observed as the average output from a population of RNA constructs, the resulting data do not represent a perfect Boolean function because the output yields intermediate values between zero and maximal values. Whereas each of the individual RNAs operates as a binary logic gate that is either on or off, a population of these RNAs exceeds the function of an individual Boolean logic gate. Together, the output of the tandem riboswitch population functions more like a molecular rheostat to tune gene expression based on relative ligand concentrations, rather than as an all-or-nothing binary switch

Most experimentally validated riboswitch classes sense and respond to ligands originating from RNA metabolism pathways, and therefore it seemed reasonable to consider the likelihood that riboswitches for PRPP would exist. PRPP is an essential precursor for the modern biosynthesis of RNA monomers in organisms from all three domains of life, and is likely to have been important for the production of ribonucleotides very early in evolution. If PRPP was used by RNA World organisms to generate the building blocks of this major biopolymer, then RNA aptamers that selectively bound this biosynthetic precursor in ancient times might have persisted to serve as riboswitch aptamers in modern cells. Intriguingly, we had representatives of PRPP riboswitches on our list of riboswitch candidates over a decade ago ( Barrick et al., 2004 ), but due to their striking similarity to riboswitches for guanidine ( Nelson et al., 2017 ) and ppGpp, they were unusually difficult to identify and experimentally validate. Members of other riboswitch classes have previously been found to exhibit altered ligand specificities by accruing key mutations in nucleotides of their binding pockets. For example, guanine riboswitches have undergone one or a few key mutations to change their ligand specificity to adenine ( Mandal and Breaker, 2004 ) or 2´-deoxyguanosine ( Kim et al., 2007; Weinberg et al., 2017 ). Also, subtle binding site variants of FMN riboswitches appear to bind a closely related ligand ( https://patentscope. wipo. int/search/en/detail. jsf? docId=WO2011097027&recNum=27&docAn=US2011000204&queryString= ( riboswitch ) %2520&maxRec=179; Weinberg et al., 2017 ), and riboswitches for molybdenum cofactor ( MoCo ) are proposed to have modest binding site changes to alter their ligand specificity to bind tungsten cofactor ( Regulski et al., 2008 )

. Thus, the riboswitch promotes AMP synthesis, but will not turn on genes specific for GDP or GTP synthesis that are already being inhibited by ppGpp. ATP is known to be present in elevated quantities during the stringent response because it is used as the initiating nucleotide for transcription of genes under the ppGpp superregulon, whereas rRNA transcripts utilize GTP as the initiating nucleotide to suppress protein production ( Krásný et al., 2008 ). As noted above, the guanine-PRPP tandem riboswitch arrangement at its functional limits most closely approximates an IMPLY logic gate ( Figure 6A ). This all-RNA system joins the NOR gate formed by tandem S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) and adenosylcobalamin ( AdoCbl or coenzyme B12 ) riboswitches ( Sudarsan et al., 2006 ) ( Figure 6B ) and the AND gate formed by tandem T box and ppGpp riboswitch RNAs ( Figure 6C ) as sophisticated regulatory RNAs that approximate Boolean logic functions. Similarly, the tandem riboswitch-ribozyme arrangement formed by a c-di-GMP-II riboswitch and a group I self-splicing ribozyme senses both c-di-GMP and guanosine ( or any of its 5´-phosphorylated derivatives ) to approximate the function of a Boolean AND gate ( Lee et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2011 ). In this example, one chemical input is sensed by a conventional riboswitch aptamer, whereas the second chemical input is sensed by the active site of a ribozyme. These more complex riboswitch and ribozyme arrangements are notable because they demonstrate how sensory and regulatory systems comprised entirely of RNA can perform sophisticated decision-making in modern cells.

To evaluate PRPP binding and riboswitch aptamer function, we examined a 106 nucleotide singlet aptamer arbitrarily derived from the purC gene of the bacterium Facklamia ignava ( Figure 2A ) by using in-line probing ( Soukup and Breaker, 1999; Regulski and Breaker, 2008 ). This method takes advantage of the inherent chemical instability of phosphodiester linkages in unstructured regions of an RNA and the folding differences in aptamers brought about by ligand binding to provide details on riboswitch function. The 106 purC RNA construct exhibits structural modulation at highly conserved nucleotide positions upon the addition of PRPP ( Figure 2B ). In contrast, no structural modulation of the RNA is observed when the known ligands for the other ykkC subtypes ( guanidine and ppGpp ) or for the guanine riboswitch ( guanine ) are added. Importantly, the structural changes selectively brought about by PRPP largely occur in regions equivalent to those previously implicated in ligand binding by guanidine-I ( Nelson et al., 2017; Reiss et al., 2017; Battaglia et al., 2017 ) and ppGpp riboswitch classes. This observation strongly suggests that these binding site nucleotides have changed to alter ligand specificity, and that PRPP is recognized by this converted binding pocket. Due to the well-characterized instability of the PRPP molecule ( Dennis et al., 2000; Meola et al., 2003 ), especially under alkaline conditions and high Mg2+, PRPP extensively degrades into multiple breakdown products over the course of our binding experiments. As a result, in-line probing assays will not yield accurate dissociation constants. Therefore, to evaluate the effects of PRPP on riboswitch function, we performed single-turnover in vitro transcription termination experiments ( Wickiser et al., 2005a ), which involve briefer incubations under milder conditions

. First, guanine aptamers are always located almost immediately adjacent to the conserved nucleotides at the 5´ terminus of the PRPP aptamer in tandem arrangements ( Figure 1B ). Specifically, there are typically only 5 to 7 nucleotides separating the P1 stems of the guanine and PRPP aptamers, suggesting this juxtaposition is important for logic gate function. Second, the addition of PRPP to the tandem construct causes a reduction in spontaneous RNA cleavage within the conserved nucleotides at the 5´ terminus of the guanine aptamer ( Figure 3 ). This is consistent with the hypothesis that unoccupied PR aptamer permits formation of the terminator stem, whereas occupied PR aptamer destabilizes the guanine aptamer. In contrast, the addition of guanine to the construct causes an increase in cleavage within the conservedotides at the 5 terminus of the PR aptamer ( Figure 3 ). This is consistent with the hypothesis that occupied guanine aptamer destabilizes the PR aptamer, whereas unoccupied aptamer permits formation of the terminator.

    Title: The readily-releasable pool dynamically regulates multivesicular release
    Abstract: The number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential dictates the reliability of synaptic transmission. Variability of this fundamental property provides diversity of synaptic function across brain regions, but the source of this variability is unclear. The prevailing view is that release of a single ( univesicular release, UVR ) or multiple vesicles ( multivesicular release, MVR ) reflects variability in vesicle release probability, a notion that is well-supported by the calcium-dependence of release mode. However, using mouse brain slices, we now demonstrate that the number of vesicles released is regulated by the size of the readily-releasable pool, upstream of vesicle release probability. Our results point to a model wherein protein kinase A and its vesicle-associated target, synapsin, dynamically control release site occupancy to dictate the number of vesicles released without altering release probability. Together these findings define molecular mechanisms that control MVR and functional diversity of synaptic signaling.

    Excitatory glutamatergic synapses mediate the majority of fast communication between neurons in the brain. While general mechanisms underlying synaptic transmission are well-conserved, there is robust diversity in the synaptic parameters that dictate the reliability and temporal fidelity of transmission between brain regions and species ( Nusser, 2018 ). One fundamental parameter that controls synaptic efficacy is the number of vesicles released in response to an action potential. At each presynaptic bouton that contains a single anatomically-defined active zone, it was originally surmised that at most, one neurotransmitter-filled vesicle can be released ( Redman, 1990 ). Although the one-site-one-vesicle hypothesis was well accepted for decades, a wealth of evidence now demonstrates that multiple vesicles can be released from a given active zone, a process termed multivesicular release ( MVR; Tong and Jahr, 1994; Auger et al., 1998 ). MVR is widespread in the rodent CNS and it appears to be the dominant release mode in human cortex ( Rudolph et al., 2015; Molnár et al., 2016 ). Yet some synapses are limited to the release of a single vesicle per active zone, termed univesicular release ( UVR; Korn et al., 1981; Stevens and Wang, 1995; Silver, 2003; Biró et al., 2005 ) and other synapses switch release modes in an activity-dependent manner ( Bender et al., 2009; Higley et al., 2009; Pulido et al., 2015 ). Understanding the mechanisms that determine whether an active zone supports UVR or MVR is important to understand synaptic diversity as well as to develop unifying models of presynaptic function that account for multiple presynaptic parameters. The number of vesicles released from an active zone is the product of vesicle release probability ( Pr ) and the number of vesicles available for release. While MVR typically correlates with Pr, experimental evidence supporting Pr as the sole determinant of MVR is mixed

. Thus, suppression of MVR by PKA inhibition was absent in synapsin TKO mice. Altogether these data suggest that synapsins may be the principal targets of PKA at CF synapses and that this family of proteins is required for bidirectional regulation of MVR via regulation of the RRP. Our results show PKA-dependent regulation of the RRP bidirectionally transforms the release mode at CF synapses ( UVR ⇔ MVR ) without affecting Pr. The simplest explanation for our results is that the RRP is a functional measure of the number of release-competent vesicles per active zone, that is under the control of synapsins, and constrains the number of vesicles released ( MVR ). Surprisingly, this fundamental synaptic parameter has not been explored, leading to the exclusive focus on Pr as the principal regulator of UVR ⇔ MVR ( reviewed in Rudolph et al., 2015 ). To understand how RRP size affects MVR across the range of release probabilities, we used a classic model that incorporates facilitation and depression to estimate vesicle release ( Dittman et al., 2000 ) and added a reaction step to account for the interaction of vesicles with docking sites. We use common terminology and abbreviations to be consistent with a recently proposed two-step model of release ( Miki et al., 2016 ). For simplicity, the size of the RRP is shown to be dependent on synapsin that may also function to assist in the priming of already-docked vesicles ( Figure 7A ). In our scheme, the phosphorylation state of synapsin is critical to controlling the probability of site occupancy and the RRP size upstream from the probability that a competent vesicle will undergo fusion. Vesicles in this RRP are only then subject to calcium-driven reactions ( Ca-X ) that drive facilitation as well as recovery from depression, parameters that dictate short-term plasticity

. Recent release models have proposed that vesicles transition between sequential states: from loose to tighter tethering with release machinery followed by Ca2+-triggered fusion ( Neher and Brose, 2018 ), which may be akin to transitions from replacement sites to docking sites prior to fusion ( Miki et al., 2016 ). These transitions are likely regulated by intracellular Ca2+ and thus, may occur too rapidly to discriminate using electrophysiological methods ( Neher and Brose, 2018 ). Therefore, estimates of release probability include the equilibrium between states. Our results support these models, assuming that molecules such as synapsins contribute to the molecular machinery upstream of these transitions, since PKA-dependent synapsin signaling changes the size of the RRP without affecting the probability of Ca2+-triggered fusion. Recently, synapsin was proposed to form a distinct liquid phase that captures synaptic vesicles and is rapidly disassembled upon phosphorylation by CamKII ( Milovanovic et al., 2018 ). We speculate that PKA phosphorylation triggers a similar mechanism that allows vesicles to enter the loose/replacement sites.

. We find that cyclic AMP-dependent ( cAMP ) protein kinase A ( PKA ), a canonical pathway that induces various forms of presynaptic plasticity and increases MVR ( Huang et al., 1994; Salin et al., 1996; Chen and Regehr, 1997; Moulder et al., 2008; Bender et al., 2009; Midorikawa and Sakaba, 2017 ), bidirectionally modifies release mode via regulation of the RRP. We show that PKA regulation of MVR can be dissociated from its effects on Pr, and requires synapsins, a family of proteins that are well-known to control the RRP. Our results support a model wherein the release mode is controlled by release site occupancy upstream of Pr, potentially explaining the paradoxical reports of MVR in conditions of high and low Pr. By dissociating the requirement of high Pr from MVR, these results provide new insight into molecular mechanisms that control MVR and illustrate how diverse modes of synaptic transmission can arise from common signaling pathways.

. Thus, a model that incorporates PKA-mediated control of the RRP is sufficient to recapitulate our experimental results and reconcile those at other synapses. These results show that PKA-mediated regulation of RRP is sufficient to generate a bi-directional shift in release mode ( from MVR→UVR or UVR→MVR ) without changing Psucc, thus illustrating that high Pr is not required for MVR at CF synapses where this release mode predominates. PKA-mediated changes in the size of the RRP could contribute to heterogeneity in MVR across CNS synapses. We thus sought to evaluate the generality of our model by testing cAMP/PKA regulation of MVR at a more conventional excitatory synapse that exhibits a diversity of release properties. The regular arrangement of cerebellar parallel fibers ( PFs ) allows isolation of individual PF-molecular layer interneuron ( MLI ) synapses using minimal stimulation ( Nahir and Jahr, 2013; Malagon et al., 2016 ). PF axons rarely form multiple contacts with an individual postsynaptic cell ( Napper and Harvey, 1988 ) and the maximum number of released vesicles indicates the presence of several docking sites, ranging between 2 and 10 ( Malagon et al., 2016; Pulido and Marty, 2017 ). Assessing synaptic responses to train stimulation of single PF synapses revealed a diversity of UVR or MVR across a large range of Prs ( Nahir and Jahr, 2013; Malagon et al., 2016 ). To test whether cAMP/PKA-dependent regulation of MVR occurs at PF synapses, we delivered a 50 Hz train of five stimuli ( Figure 8A ) and defined successful single synaptic responses as those that showed ( a ) short response latency, ( b ) consistent EPSC kinetics, ( c ) clear differentiation between success and failures, and ( d ) all-or-none responses ( Figure 8A and B )

While mechanisms underlying transmission are well-conserved, there is diversity in parameters that dictate reliability and fidelity transmission between regions and species. One parameter that controls efficacy is the number ves released in response an action. At presynaptic bout that contains a anatomically active zone, it was surmised that most one neurotransmitter-filled ves can be released. The one-one-ves hypothesis was accepted for decades, a wealth evidence demonstrates multiple ves can be from given, process multives release (M). M is widespread in rodent CNS and appears dominant in human cortex. Some synapses limited release single ves per zone, unives (Korn et al, 1981; Stevens Wang, 1995; Silver,2003; Bir,2005) and synapses switch modes in activity manner (Bender et,200; Hley,200; Pulido,201). Understanding mechanisms determine whether zone supports UVR or M is to understand diversity and unify models presaptic function.

The number ves from zone is product release probability (P) and ves available. M typically correlates with P, evidence supporting P sole of M is mixed. Suppression M by PK inhibition absent synin TK mice. These data suggest synins may principal PK at synapses and family required bidirectional regulation M via R.

    Title: Reconstitution of selective HIV-1 RNA packaging in vitro by membrane-bound Gag assemblies
    Abstract: HIV-1 Gag selects and packages a dimeric, unspliced viral RNA in the context of a large excess of cytosolic human RNAs. As Gag assembles on the plasma membrane, the HIV-1 genome is enriched relative to cellular RNAs by an unknown mechanism. We used a minimal system consisting of purified RNAs, recombinant HIV-1 Gag and giant unilamellar vesicles to recapitulate the selective packaging of the 5’ untranslated region of the HIV-1 genome in the presence of excess competitor RNA. Mutations in the CA-CTD domain of Gag which subtly affect the self-assembly of Gag abrogated RNA selectivity. We further found that tRNA suppresses Gag membrane binding less when Gag has bound viral RNA. The ability of HIV-1 Gag to selectively package its RNA genome and its self-assembly on membranes are thus interdependent on one another.

   . We show that Gag-tRNA interactions may also serve to increase Gag fidelity for viral RNA. In the absence of tRNA, any long RNA caused a slight increase in Gag membrane association. But in the presence of 20 µM tRNA, 5’UTR and a longer 1947 nt fragment of the HIV-1 genome increased Gag membrane association more than other RNAs. We hypothesize that a viral RNA with several high-affinity binding sites for Gag can recruit several Gag molecules to the membrane if only one of them dissociates from its membrane-occluding tRNA. In summary, our study leads to a model for HIV-1 genome selection where the NC domain of Gag is necessary but not sufficient for the selective packaging of the HIV-1 genomic RNA ( Figure 7 ). Lattice contacts conferring Gag ability to multimerize on a membrane are crucial for the selective packaging of viral RNA. The 5’UTR is recruited to membranes by multimerized Gag without any gross changes to its secondary structure. Moreover, the association of Gag with tRNA serves to inhibit genome-less virus assembly. 10. 7554/eLife. 14663. 013Figure 7. A model for selective HIV-1 genome packaging. Cytosolic Gag ( light gray triangles ) is inhibited from membrane association by its association with tRNA ( yellow ). Gag ( triangles and hexagons, colored dark gray where forming specific contacts with the packaging signal ) binding viral genomic RNA ( red; thick portions correspond to the 5’UTR, thin portions to the remainder, not shown to scale ) has a higher probability to overcome this inhibition and associate with the plasma membrane. The selectivity of membrane-bound Gag for the viral genome necessitates CA-CA immature lattice contacts. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 14663. 013

. The minor fraction of cytosolic Gag which binds viral RNA has a strong preference for the 5’UTR but also binds to the Rev-responsive element ( RRE ), whose main function is thought to be in nuclear export ( Kuzembayeva et al., 2014 ). On the other hand, Gag in the membrane fraction has lost its tRNA association and is strongly enriched for viral RNA, interacting with equal probability with all parts of the genomic RNA. Existing structural and biochemical data are not sufficient to explain how a pool of cytosolic Gag, binding mainly cellular RNA, assembles into virus particles which package dimeric viral genomes with 90% probability. Here, we have reconstituted the selective genome packaging of HIV-1 in a minimal system using giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ), recombinant myristoylated HIV-1 Gag and purified RNAs. Gag assembling on GUV membranes selectively packages the HIV-1 5’UTR at subnanomolar concentrations in the presence of excess competitor RNA. We find that the RNA selectivity of Gag is abolished by mutations that subtly affect its ability to cluster on a membrane. Using SHAPE analysis, we find that membrane recruitment of the 5’UTR by Gag does not lead to drastic changes in its secondary structure, and we further demonstrate that the association of soluble Gag with tRNA confers additional RNA packaging selectivity.

We previously reported an in vitro reconstitution of HIV-1 assembly using recombinant myristoylated Gag protein and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2-containing giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) ( Carlson and Hurley, 2012 ). We showed that GUV-bound Gag clusters mimic the behavior of cellular HIV-1 budding sites in their lipid requirements for assembly, nucleic acid- and ESCRT ( endosomal sorting complex required for transport ) protein binding. We reasoned that this system could also be used to study the RNA selection of an assembling HIV-1 virus. The 5’ untranslated region ( 5’UTR ) and the Rev-responsive element ( RRE ) of the HIV-1 genome ( nucleotides 1–345 and 7259–7612, of the genomic RNA of HIV-1 strain NL4-3 and ARV-2/SF2, respectively ), along with a nominally unstructured 378 nt single-stranded control RNA ( RNA378 ), were produced by in vitro transcription. The 1–345 construct was previously shown to dimerize even in the absence of Gag ( Heng et al., 2012 ). RNAs were labeled with the fluorophore Alexa488 on random guanosines, at measured average labeling efficiencies of ~1. 1–1. 2 fluorophores per RNA molecule. 100 nM Gag-ATTO594 was premixed with 0. 5 nM fluorescent RNA, and added to GUVs which were imaged by confocal microscopy starting 10 min after addition of protein and RNA. Due to the reported Mg2+-dependence of the 5’UTR dimerization ( Wilkinson et al., 2008 ), 2 mM MgCl2 was included in the final buffer. The addition of Mg2+ to the imaging buffer made the GUV morphology more variable, but this increased morphological heterogeneity did not hamper the experiments nor the image quantification. In order to quantitate the RNA occupancy of assemblies, ten confocal z-stacks were recorded at random positions on each sample, with each data set containing an average of 50–100 GUVs. Strong RNA fluorescence was consistently observed at Gag clusters on GUV membranes, regardless of which RNA was used ( Figure 1a–c, g )

Here, we used biochemical reconstitution methods to show that a minimal system consisting of the HIV-1 Gag protein, the HIV-1 5’UTR, and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2-containing GUVs is capable of selective RNA packaging in the presence of an excess of non-specific RNA. We find a strong correlation between the ability of Gag to multimerize on a membrane and its selective packaging of viral RNA. Mutations in the lattice-forming CA domain that lessen Gag clustering on membranes ( W316D, M317D and K290A, Figure 3b, d, f, g ) drastically lowered its RNA selectivity ( Figure 4g, i, k ), without affecting the total capacity of Gag to recruit RNA to a membrane ( Figure 4b, d, k ). Mutations of these residues in the C-terminal part of CA ( CA-CTD ) have previously been described to lead to virus release defects related to aberrant virus assembly ( Gamble et al., 1997; von Schwedler et al., 2003 ). In line with our findings, it has been reported that the amount of viral RNA coprecipitated with cytoplasmic Gag is reduced five fold when its CA-CTD is deleted, whereas the amount of cellular RNA coprecipitated remains the same ( Kutluay and Bieniasz, 2010 ). On the other hand, in experiments which did not address selectivity, a ΔCA-CTD Gag was still able to tether genomic RNA to the plasma membrane in cells ( Jouvenet et al., 2009; Sardo et al., 2015 ), which is consistent with our finding that the mutant Gag proteins can still recruit 5’UTR although being less selective in the presence of competitors. Mutations at the three-fold symmetry contact in CA-NTD did not alter Gag clustering on membranes ( Figure 3g ), concurring with observations that a ΔCA-NTD Gag still supports particle release ( Borsetti et al., 1998; Accola et al., 2000 ). Live-cell fluorescence microscopy has delivered important constraints on the stoichiometry and the location of the RNA selection event

Packaging the correct genetic material is a key event in the assembly of an infectious virus. In the case of HIV-1, both the recognition of the genomic RNA, its targeting to the plasma membrane, and assembly of a membrane-enveloped virus around it is carried out by the viral protein Gag ( Rein et al., 2011; Sundquist and Kräusslich, 2012; Freed, 2015 ). The HIV-1 genome is a dimeric, unspliced RNA of approximately 9.9 kilobases in length, consisting of the 5 untranslated region (5’R), the Rev-responsive element (RE) and the rest of the genome. The 5’R is the first to be encapsidated into the virion and is crucial for the initiation of reverse transcription. The HIV-1 genome is packaged in the cytosol in the presence of a large excess of cellular RNAs, and the mechanism by which G selects the viral RNA is unknown. We have reconstituted the selective packaging of the HIV-1 genome in a minimal system of purified RN, recombinant HIV-1 G and PI 4, 5 P-containing GUVs. We find that the selectivity of G for the 5’R is abolished by mutations that affect its ability to cluster on membrane. The association of soluble G with tRNA confers additional selectivity for the 5R. We propose a model for HIV-1 genome selection where the NC domain of G is necessary but not sufficient for the selective packaging of the HIV-1 RNA.
