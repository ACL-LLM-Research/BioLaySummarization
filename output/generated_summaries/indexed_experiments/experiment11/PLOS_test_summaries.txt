Researchers have developed a stochastic model to capture the dynamics of Gambian human trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) at a health area level of approximately 10,000 people. This is the first time a stochastic model has been fitted directly to data, allowing for quantification of uncertainty in results. The model uses a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methodology to fit to data from 16 health areas in Mosango zone, Kwu province. Spatial heterogeneity in cases is reflected in results, predicting Kinamba II, with a third of the zone's cases, will have the latest year for elimination of transmission (ET) under current strategies. Fitting a deterministic version of the model using MCM has faster computation times than stochastic, but produces indistinguishable posteriorisation. This suggests using deterministic fits for health area expansion, but stochastic for projections to capture parameter and stochastic variation in reporting and elimination estimations.

A particle MCM algorithm was used to fit a stochastic model to historical AT screening case data, which is complex and computationally intensive compared to traditional MCM. However, it accounts for variations in infection dynamics with realism and allows fitting multiple parameters in a reasonable time. Previous work used parameters from deterministic models to make projections in stochastic variants, shown to be a good approximation. Deterministic and stochastic models produce similar results for health data, but diverge in future projections to elimination. Stochastic models are suited for low infections, expanded to small-scale health area modelling, capturing heterogeneity and focal nature of AT infections.

Mathematic models have a role in quantifying progress towards elimination of ET of AT. Cases have declined due to detection and treatment in endemic regions, but target ET requires estimating real infections and understanding transmission. Spatial distribution is dependent on factors such as vector density, parasite, human settlements, and work locations. Distribution is heterogeneous and confined to geographic regions with few cases in between. Factors such as diagnostics and treatment availability impact distribution. Times of infection are approximately three years without treatment.

A stochastic model was fitted to health areas of 10,000 people in DRC, capturing local variation and defining intervention areas. Small population with prevalence <1% used stochastic to capture uncertainty. Deterministic would require proxy threshold for elimination. The zone Mosango, Kwu province was used to fit a stochastic model to 16 health areas. A mechanistic model can be fitted to health data, providing detailed projections for scenarios. Similarity in stochastic and deterministic models validates previous studies, but stochastic remains for elimination and uncertainty.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to analyze tumor microenvironment (TME) data, which contains information on patient cancer through cellular and spatial distribution of tumor and immune cell populations. The method combines spatial statistics and functional analysis with machine learning to predict outcomes such as patient survival and treatment success with immunotherapies. The approach is shown to be effective in experiments identifying important interactions while controlling false discovery rate. It was applied to real data from multiplex ion imaging of triple negative breast and lung cancer patients. The method is publicly available in a R package called funkells. 

The approach uses a combination of spatial statistics and functional analysis with machine learning to identify significant differences between groups in distribution of cell phenotypes, proteins, or mixtures. It aims to predict a new patient's group using their ME data. The model is applicable, has few parameters, and visualized output. It is robust to parameter choice and demonstrates ability to identify variables while maintaining predictive power. It is resistant to overfitting and false discovery. The method was evaluated on simulated data, demonstrating effectiveness for spatial patterns with interactions. It was applied to TNBC and lung data from multiplex imaging. The TN data compared "compartmentalized" and "mixed" groups based on tumor-immune interactions. The separation gave two groups with differences in ME, making useful for demonstration. The model showed predictive accuracy and identified specific relationships and interactions. The lung data detected differences in cell relationships. 

The method assumes homogeneity of spatial processes defining functions in the model. It is a framework for analyzing and identifying spatial relationships in ME predicting outcomes. It uses a combination of spatial statistics and functional analysis with machine learning. The application of functional analysis to point data is a recent development. The approach begins by producing functions for cell or marker interactions within images. After dimension reduction, data is combined with non-functional patient data, and a random model is used to predict patient. The method is motivated to evaluate predictive power of interactions "knock" patterns mimic spatial in ME, independently of responses. The importance of spatial interactions is evaluated by comparison to predictive of knock patterns. This overcomes challenge of distinguishing interactions among many interest, controls false rate. It generates plots showing interactions useful in response. It has power for few cells due to robustness of functions and power with small sizes. Small sizes are common for this data. The method is the first to evaluate spatial interactions in ME that vary with many interactions

A computational study investigated how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure co-evolve during desynchronization processes and how they are affected by external perturbations. To investigate the impact of different plasticity mechanisms, a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons was combined with synaptic and structural plasticity: spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), homeostatic structural plasticity (hSP) without weight-dependent pruning and STDP, a combination of ST and h, and a combination of ST and SP that includes h and weight pruning. A stochastic model was introduced to accommodate diverse scales of neuronal firing. Network reorganization remarkably enhanced synchrony when contacts were preferentially eliminated by weight pruning. Synchrony was achieved with sparser connections than in randomly structured networks in the ST-only model. Strengthening contacts from neurons with higher firing rates to lower rates and weakening in the opposite direction, followed by removal, allowed synchron with fewer connections. This reorganization resulted in degree-degree correlations and assortativity. Stimulation-induced desynchronization in the ST-only model was compared to desynchronization in models with and. Latter required higher intensity to achieve long-term desynchronization. Findings may inform preclinical and clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive modalities aiming at long-lasting relief of symptoms, e.g., Parkinson's disease.
Researchers investigated the regeneration of neurons and glia in planarians, a type of freshwater worm that can regenerate its entire body parts. They found that neurons express a gene called delta-2 at specific positions in the central and peripheral nervous system, which interacts with Notch-1-expressing mesoderm-like phocytic progenitors to form glia. Inhibition of delta-2 or Notch-1 reduced glia, but not other phocytic cell types. Loss of delta-2-expressing neurons prevented gl differentiation of associated with them, while transplantation of delta-2-express neurons formed gl at ectopic locations. This suggests a model where delta-2-express neurons instruct phoc progenitors to differentiate into gl, a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of numbers and pattern of cell types. Neurons and gl must be produced and functionally integrated together in regeneration, but how pattern formation of these cell types is coordinated is unknown. The study uncovered a mechanism where regenerative patterning for neurons is leveraged for regenerating pattern gl. Specific classes of neurons are regenerated in proper numbers and positions in the system that express delta-2. Delta interacts with Notch-1 meserm progen, triggering formation of gl from these progenitors. Delta expression in neurons is required to maintain gl state in neighboring glial cells, supporting long-term coordination of cell types. Notch pathway regulates gl specification and differentiation through interaction between neurons and unrelated phoc progenitors, raising possibility of conserved role in gl specification.
Researchers investigated the role of gamma-delta (γ) T cells in the development of neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 in individuals with varying levels of neutralization breadth. They found significant differences in γ T cell surface marker expression between participants who developed neutralization breadth and those who did not. Activation of γ cells occurred within the first weeks of HIV acquisition and was associated with viral load. Expression of CD16 on V1 cells and CD57 on V2 cells were higher in broad neutralizers during acute infection and associated with development of neutral breadth later. Levels of CD on V1 cells were associated with early Env-specific IgM production. γ T cells may promote development of neutral breadth, which has implications for vaccine strategies. The study found that V2 T cells were reduced during acute infection and loss associated with viral load, while V1 cells expanded during chronic infection and not with viral load. Expression of CD on V1 and CD on V2 cells were higher in broad neutralizers and associated with development of breadth. Levels of CD on V1 were associated with early Env-specific Ig production. γ cells might promote B engagement following HIV-1 acquisition and development of neutral breadth. The frequency of V2 cells was lower at 18 days post HIV-1 positive in broad neutralizers, reflecting higher VL. CD levels on V1 and V2 cells and CD on V2 were higher in broadizers. Differences were specific to γ cells, not observed in CD CD and CD or NK cells. The study suggests γ cells are important for early promotion of B engagement HIV-1 and development of neutral breadth.
Researchers have developed a computational model of a bispecific antibody, BS1, targeting the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors, which are involved in a synergistic pathway that drives metastasis. The model is a series of ordinary differential equations for each receptor, antibodies, and antibody-receptor complexes. Simulations match experimental data and constrain parameters. Deploying the model to simulate binding to cells with one or both receptors, and comparing to monospecific antibodies, reveal mechanistic differences between treatments. One arm of the antibody binds a surface receptor, the second must be within reach for a second binding event. Bispecific antibodies have demonstrated simultaneous engagement at receptor densities. Simultaneous inhibition of IL-6/8 with tocilizum and reparixin decreased cell migration and metastasis without affecting growth, suggesting targeting IL-6, IL-8, and receptors is a promising approach. Monospecific antibodies have limitations, including resistance, while bispecifics demonstrate potential to overcome shortcomings. The model of BS1, against IL-6 and IL8, establishes binary and ternary complex formation drives inhibition. The ratio of IL-6 and IL-8 expression is crucial for bispecific binding, leading to differences in monos and bis behavior. Simulations predict optimal concentrations for binding, most stable complex at high receptor and intermediate antibody concentrations. The model clarifies effects of binding affinity and expression on inhibition, applicable to bis design. Cells with high one receptor act as "sinks" for monos, while bis preferentially bind both receptors. Expression on healthy cells impacts distribution and clearance. The model includes circulation and transport to study treatment dynamics. Binding is governed by affinity, avidity, concentration, and expression. The model predicts receptor occupancy, distribution, and impact on complex formation, rather than amount binding, is critical for performance.
Researchers investigated the role of ZYG-8, a conserved microtub-associated protein, in centrosomal spindle assembly and stability in C. elegans oocytes. They found that ZYG-8 depletion resulted in elongated spindles with pole and midindle defects, and experiments with monopolar spindles revealed excess forces within the spindle, suggesting a potential role for Z-8 in regulating the force-generating motor BM-1/kines-5. Z-8 was also required for microtule dynamics within the oocyte and kinase activity was necessary for its function in both meiosis and mitosis. The study revealed new roles for Z- in oocytes and insights into how centomal spindles are stabilized to promote faithful meiosis. Z- contains a microtub-binding doubleort domain and kinase domain, and previous studies showed it regulates spindle positioning in mitotically dividing embryos and modulates microtule dynamics in mitosis. In oocytes, Z- is required for anaphase spindle elongation and excludes microtule crosser SPD-1 from anaph spindle, regulating spindle structure during chromosome segregation. This study showed Z- is required for both assembly and stability of the oocyte spindle, and its kinase activity is necessary for functions in mitosis and meiosis. Z- modulates microtule dynamics and motor forces within the oocyte, and its localization enables it to regulate microtules at poles and midindle and co-localizes with motor BM-1 throughout meiosis.
This study investigated the relationship between metabolite levels, genetics, and type 2 diabetes (T2) risk in the UK Biob dataset using the Nightingale panel of 249 metabolites, mostly lipids and lipoproteins. Integrating data with large-scale T2 GWAS from the DIANTE meta-analysis, Mendelian randomization analyses found 79 metabolites with causal association to T2, spanning lipid-related classes except glucose and tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites were causally affected by T2 liability, spanning all classes, including branched-chain amino acids. Interaction trait locus (QTL) analysis described four metabolites replicated in an independent Estonian dataset, with genetic loci in different regions attenuated in T2 cases compared to controls. Variants from QTL were significant in the population but not associated with T2 risk, suggesting consequences of T2 on metabolite regulation. Differential analyses found 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macro, or both types of T complications, with few discriminating between classes. Of 165 metabolites, 40 were not causally linked to T in either direction, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to complications. This work provides a map of T consequences on metabolite levels and regulation, enabling understanding T trajectory to complications.
Researchers investigated the genetic factors contributing to tolerance to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in mice. They crossed a susceptible strain (CC061) with a tolerant strain (CC024) to generate F1 and F2 populations. The F1 and F2 mice showed a complex inheritance pattern of tolerance, with survival rates of 65% and 55, respectively. Colonization in F2 mice was more extreme than their parents, suggesting segregation of genetic factors. A Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping identified a peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection. The WSB/EJ allele in CC024 contributed to the tolerant phenotype, and genes C5 and C2, receptors for complement Ca, were high-impact variants in this region. Ca may have altered binding to receptors in CC mice, reducing cytokine storm damage and allowing higher pathogen burden and survival. IL-10 was increased in CC mice, while IL-1, IL-4, IL-9, IL-18, IL-23, and IL-27 were increased in CC after infection, suggesting different immune responses. F1 mice had a median survival of 7 days, similar to CC and higher than CC. F mice maintained weight similar to CC, losing less than CC. F mice were bred to generate a large F2 panel to investigate genetic components of tolerance and susceptibility. 316 F2 mice were infected with MRSA, with 175 (55%) surviving 7 days, while 141 (45%) met euthanasia criteria. Pre-infection and dose did not correlate with survival, but weight and colonization significantly correlated. Survival was not influenced by sex, but weight and colonization were not different between males and females. Host genetics play a major role in protection against bacterial infections, and outcome in mice is dependent on strain used, suggesting strong influence. Mice lacking N2, Myd, and T2 are susceptible to S. aureus than expressing these genes. The tolerant strain CC survived longer and lost less than CC, despite similar colonization, including kidney. Accounting for baseline differences, several cytokines differed post-infection, with IL-10 increased in CC. IL-10 is anti-inflammatory, produced by innate and adaptive cells, major immunoregulatory modulating production. Overexpression worsens outcome, including S aure infections.
This study investigates how genetic networks influence adaptation during an adaptive walk. Traditional models of adaptation rely on genotype-phenotype relationships, ignoring intricate gene interactions that drive trait expression. The authors model a simple regulatory network, the autoreg motif, and use forward genetic simulations to measure adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both additive and network models. They find that both models exhibit similarities in key aspects of adaptive walks, but the distribution of fitness among beneficial mutations is sensitive to estimation method. Utilizing a pooling approach leads to homogenization of the parameter, nudging the distribution towards exponential, while non-pooling preserves unique contributions to the parameter. The authors suggest researchers be cautious of the homogen effect when estimating the distribution among beneficial mutations. Their approach contributes to the field and holds broad applicability to questions in evolutionary biology, genetics, and mechanisms underpinning adaptability. They introduce how networks can generate epistasis, implications for evolution recombination, maintenance, and trade-offs between complexity and adapt. The study shows networks can create distributions of fitness that differ from additive expectations. The authors acknowledge model limitations, particularly computational demands and simplifications, and suggest empirical validation through experiments to assess real-world applicability.
Researchers propose a novel Bayesian framework for understanding the dynamics of conductance-based neurons and synapses, suggesting they are naturally equipped to optimally integrate information. The approach posits that apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials, parametrized by local quantities such as reversal potentials and membrane conductances. They demonstrate that under these assumptions, the somatic compartment computes the corresponding posterior distribution. A gradient-based plasticity rule allows neurons to learn target distributions and weight inputs by their relative reliabilities. The theory explains experimental findings on single-cell and multi-sensory integration, illustrating simulations, and makes experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and synapticity. 

The framework interprets the physics of cortical neurons as Bayesian computations, demonstrating conduct-based models compute posterior distributions from Gaussian functions represented in dendritic compartments. Somatic dynamics derive from gradient ascent on posterior, synaptic plasticity matches posterior to target distribution. The rule accommodates relative reliabilities by scaling weights of inputs with high correlation to target potentials given presynaptic activities. Targets may be formed by periomatic input from other modalities or informed input from cortical areas. Demonstrated learning in multisens integration with modalities different reliabilities. Cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons described driven by two inputs, 'top-down' on apical predicting 'bottom' basal [39, 40]. In this framework, adapting basal conceptualized as 'dendritic prediction of somatic' [30, 41, 42]. In Bayesian view, plasticity matches bottom to top expectations. Depending on top input, can be interpreted as matching or regularization, similar to prior in variational autoencoders [43]. Supervised learning seen as predictive, neuron as nonlinear element with dendritic predicting somatic activity, with high conduct contributing more to pooled opinion.
Researchers used the Evolutionary Classification of Domains (EC) from experimental structures as a basis for classification to describe and catalog domains from 48 proteomes in the AlphaFold Database. They classified 746,349 domains from 536,808 proteins comprised of 226,424,000 amino residues, providing positive classification for 90% of residues in proteomes. The study examined populations of homolog groups in eukaryotes and bacteria, finding eukotes have a higher fraction of disordered and unassigned regions, and a higher proportion of repeated proteins, both globular and small. They enumerated highly populated domains shared in eukotes and bacteria, such as Rossm domains, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains. The study compared sampling of homolog groups from whole proteome against EC reference and stable groups enriched by predictions, discussing implications for protein selection for future classification of large sets. The researchers found a lower fraction of eukotic proteomes well-assigned (57.6 ± 5.5%) than bacteria (81.1 ± 6.9%), examining well-ass domains and commonalities and differences among populated EC homolog groups. Among eukotes, ARM, β-β-Zn fingers, I domains, and H domains were most populated, while in bacteria, H domains, Rossm-fold, P-ase, and TIM were most populated. Common populated groups in both euk and bacteria were Rossm, P-loops, I, ARM, and H domains. The study stratified domain populations by species and homolog groups, showing contribution of certain species and groups to population. Zinc domains were found in eotic transcription factors, enriched in mammals and zebraf, while EGF domains were in extracellular factors, lacking in bacteria and fungi.
BKPolyomavirus (BKPy) is a small, double-stranded DNA virus that infects the kidneys of approximately 80% of adults worldwide, causing graft loss in transplant patients and increased risk of bladder cancer. Despite its prevalence and severity, there are no treatments for BKV reactivation. BKV relies on host machinery to replicate DNA, but provides its own helicase, large antigen (TAg). Studies using single-cell analysis revealed BKV requires host cycle for TAg and viral production, contrasting the model where T is expressed early and pushes cells into S for replication. Data supports a new model where BKV requires initial S to replicate, aligning with other small DNA viruses like papillomaviruses and adenoviruses. TAg expression is observed before viral proteins, but robustly expressed in S/G2, not G1. Inhibiting host replication prevented T expression and reduced titers, demonstrating T depends on initial S. If replication was inhibited after cells reached 4 DNA and T was expressed, replication was no longer required for T or production. Proteome failed to increase T, suggesting stability not due to shift, as reported for related MCPV. T was not result of genome amplification in S, infecting up to 80 virions per cell did not result T+ in G/early phase. Replication is rare in uninfected RP, activation DDR prevents replication, expected aberrant licensing and firing, but canonical mechanisms required and displayed distribution across cycle.
Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as a powerful tool for identifying gene-trait associations by integrating expression studies with genome-wide association (GW). Most existing TWAS focus on marginal analyses examining one gene at a time, but recent developments in TW fine-mapping methods enable joint modeling multiple genes to refine identification of potentially causal ones. Here, we present FAB, a TW fineapping method specifically for binary traits capable of modeling genes jointly on an entire chromosome. FAB employs a probit model to link genetically expression (GRe) of genes to binary outcomes while taking into account GRe correlation among genes on a chromosome. As a result, FAB controls false discoveries while offering power over existing TW fineapping approaches. We performed simulations to evaluate FAB and applied in-depth analyses of six disease in UKob datasets. FAB significantly reduced the size of causal sets 27.9-36.9% over existing approaches across traits. Leveraging its power, FAB prioritized multiple genes associated with diseases, including GATA for asthma, ABC2 for gout, and SHB for hypertension. Overall, FAB represents an effective tool for TW fineapping of traits.
This study investigates the roles of Btn2 and Hsp protein sequeases in maintaining proteostasis during oxidative stress. Oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide exposure is known to inhibit translation and increase protein misfolding and aggregation. The study shows that levels of oxidative damage in response to oxidative stress are similar in wild-type and sequease mutants, but aggregation is elevated, suggesting Btn and Hsp sequeases act to sequester oxidatively damaged proteins as part of the antioxidant system. Btn and Hsp mutants are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, implicating a functional role for sestration in oxidant tolerance. Data show that Btn and H act to protect against amorph and amyloid protein aggregation during oxidative conditions. The study identifies Sup35 termination factor as an in vivo sequease substrate and shows Btn and H act to suppress oxid-induced formation of the [PS+] prion, an amyloid form of Sup35. [+] pr formation in sequease mutants does not require insoluble protein localization, where amyloids are thought to undergo fragmentation and propagate heritable form. Instead, both amorph and amyloid Sup aggregates are increased in Btn H mutants, consistent with prion formation occurring at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress in absence sequease. Overexpression of H104 rescues oxidant sensitivity of H mutants by protecting against toxicity of aggregate accumulation in absence sease activity.
Researchers conducted a CRISPR-interference (CRPR) screen to evaluate the functional role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in glioblastoma (GB) invasion. They identified 48 ncRNAs associated with a 33-83% decrease in invasion upon knockdown, with the top candidate LINC45 showing an 82.7% decrease in tumor invasion upon knockdown. LINC45 expression was significantly associated with patient survival and tumor grade. RNA analysis revealed WASF, implicated in tumor invasion studies, was correlated with ncRNA expression, and WASF knockdown was associated with decreased invasion. WAS overexpression rescued invasive function lost with LINC45 knock. The CRPR screen identified LINC45, a previously unannotated ncRNA, as critical to GB invasion. Gene expression is associated with tumor grade and survival. RNA-seq mechanistic studies suggest this novel ncRNA regulates WASF. A CRPR-based screen of 2,307 loci identified 45 hits affecting GB invasion. Upon evaluation, LINC45, a previously unannot and poorly studied ncRNA, was significantly associated with invasion. Functional methods, such as CRPR and CR screens, have gained popularity due to their ability to quickly identify therapeutic targets. Prior studies have focused on coding genes affecting glioma, but the role of ncRN in GB pathogenesis has begun to grow, primarily focusing on proliferation. This study uniquely addresses the role of nc in GB invasion, suggesting noncoding RNAs play a functional role in this phenotype. Knock of candidate nc via CR and AS revealed decreases in invasion while not affecting proliferation.
Researchers investigated how the brain assigns probabilistic models to sequences of auditory stimuli using electroencephalographic (EEG) data from participants exposed to a sequence generated by a stochastic chain. A new clustering procedure was introduced to group EEG signals by their law, indicating the brain uses recurrent auditory stimulus occurrences to build a model. The brain identifies statistical regularities in sequences and organizes them to classify and make predictions, but how it proceeds is still an open question. Previous studies proposed Bayesian inference, probabilistic tree models, and context models to represent regularities in sequences. However, each assumed a particular class of models used by the brain, leaving the identification of actual models used by the brain open. This study used a new clustering procedure on EEG data from participants exposed to sequences driven by a context, showing the brain uses the occurrence of a strong beat in a stochastic sequence to select a model. Entrainment, a phenomenon where neurons synchronize with regular auditory occurrences, is a possible mechanism to model the sequence. Results indicate the prefrontal cortex uses the occurrence of strong to chunk auditory in larger scales, with seconds between each occurrence. The clustering procedure groups EEG by dissimilarity based on Kolmogorov-Snov distance, retrieving partitions similar to the expected by the occurrence of strong. The brain selects a partition of the past sequence with four, defined by the occurrence of strong, indicating it identifies structural aspects to estimate next amidst stochasticity. A partition with four elements is an economical representation, encoding temporal dependencies in electrodes over prefrontal cortex. Results for R and L F E P are similar to expected, with slight lateralization when removing central electrode 11. Occipital electrodes did not correspond to partition determined by strong, but strings in strong assigned same cluster.
Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for analyzing gene expression and cellular composition at single resolution, but has limitations. It fails to account for cell-to-cell variations in transcript-size (total number of transcripts per cell) and cell dissociation/processing-induced crypt gene expression, particularly in heterogeneous solid/tissues requiring dissociation for analysis. This results in discrepancy between bulk RNA-seq and reconstituted bulk-seq using sc-se data. To address this, a computationally calculated "cell-specific weighting factor" (cWF) is proposed. A method to compute WF is introduced and reported for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs, validated by accurate reconstitution and deolution of bulk-se data using sc data and WF. WF effectively predict aging, implicating diagnostic applications and association with aging. The study provides a method to solve limitations of sc-se analysis of complex tissues. WF suggest diagnostic and biological significance. Transcript-size variations and crypt gene expression are unrepresented in sc-se data of solid organs. An algorithm is developed to compute unrepresented factors. WF is computed for 76 cell across 10 organs. WF account for transcript-size variations and crypt expression by reconstuting and deolving bulk-se using WF. WF recapitulate experiment-d total mRNA-differences using PB data. WF differentially change among cell-types over aging, predict progression in aging model.
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the effect of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVM) extends this to estimate the direct effect of multiple exposures simultaneously. However, MVM can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic genetic variants used as instrumental variables, violating one of the core assumptions. Genetic variants giving outlying estimates are considered potentially pleiotropic. Radial plots can be used in MR to identify these variants. Analogous plots for MVM have been unavailable due to the multidimensional nature of analysis. A radial formulation of MVM and adapted radial plot are proposed, allowing the effect of each exposure within M analysis to be visualized. Radial MVM includes option for removal of outlying SNPs violating one or more of M assumptions. AVMR package is presented as software for implementing methods.

Radial MR and M approaches facilitate assessment of pleotropic associations between genetic and phenotypes using GWAS data. Conducting within radial framework allows outliers to be visualized, MVM analyses for direct effects multiple exposures estimated. Radial M builds upon existing methods, providing visual M approaches absent and outlier identification in framework. Radial approach used to communicate findings as visual aid and sensitivity for pleotropic bias adjusted heterogeneity. When implementing Radial, assumptions of M considered, instruments should be strong to overcome weak bias, using conditional-stat. Specific Radial correction relies on unbiased estimates of direct effect each exposure. If majority SN pleotropic in same direction, adjusted Radial estimates biased.

MVM can obtain pleotropy estimates when mechanism acting understood. However, often unclear mechanism acting or multiple effects present. Range of pleotropy methods proposed for M, not focusing identification SN contributing heterogeneity. Multidimensional M cannot visual scatter plots as MR, making inspection challenging. Radial approach allows visualization effects M and identification SN outlying association all exposures. Rad used prune outliers, results not influenced SN. Illustrated through simulation range balanced unbalanced pleotropy. Applied example evaluating LDL, HDL, triglycer on coronary disease, univar estimates biased pleiot via other exposures. Radial used visualize M results, obtain robust estimates removing SN contributing heterogeneity.
Researchers recorded the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days in featureless arenas on sucroseagar media using the deep learning framework SLE to produce a full-body postural dataset for 47 individuals resulting in nearly 2 billion instances. They identified stereot behaviors such as grooming, probis extension, and locomotion and used the resulting ethograms to explore how the flies' behavior varies across time and days in the experiment. Daily patterns were found in stere behaviors, adding information about trends in grooming modalities, probis extension, and locom speed to known about the D melanog circadian cycle. The hour after dawn was a unique point in the flies' daily pattern, and the composition of this hour tracked with other indicators of health such as locom speed and fraction of time spent resting. The data and analysis provided a new picture of D melan behavior across times, revealing features of unexplored biological mechanisms.

The researchers used compositional analysis to characterize the dynamics of the behavioral repertoire across time and days, recapitulating known characteristics of the D melan circadian cycle and finding daily patterns in behaviors including grooming, probis extension, and locom speed. A decline was seen in behavior between day and night hours across days, similar to weakening circadian rhythms with age. A decline in probis extension and locom speed was found as the fraction of time in idle increased. The hour after dawn was identified as unique, tracking the general health of the flies. High-resolution data revealed differences in patterns during morning and evening peaks, primarily in grooming behavior. The data captured expected and novel patterns of melan behavior across 24 periods, offering a window into hourly and daily patterns of activity and a step in quantifying multi-times structure of behavior.
This study identifies novel functions for the conserved C. elegans phosphatase PTP-22, establishing its role in nematode molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. Through a non-b genetic screen, loss of PTP-22 phosphat activity suppressed mol defects caused by loss-function mutations in conserved N-related kinases NE-2 (NE8/NE9) and NE-3 (NE6NE7), which act at the interface of membrane trafficking and act regulation. Proximity labeling studies identified the CDC guanine nucleotide factor DNBP1 as an in vivo partner of P22. Consistent with this interaction, loss DNBP also suppressed ne-associated molting defects. Genetic, localization, and labeling revealed roles for P22 in several epidermal adhesion complexes, including C. elegans hemidesomes, suggesting P22 plays a role in maintaining structural integrity. Localization and labeling also implicated P22 in functions to nucleocytoplasm transport and regulation, particularly in the germl, nearly one-third of identified P22 proximity are gran components. The study highlights the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying gene functions.
Researchers used a comprehensive dataset from the WorldWide Antimal Resistance Network (WWARN) on the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch 13 (K) gene, associated with artem resistance, and a Bayesian geostatistical model to produce spatio-temporal predictions of artem resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion. The maps show an expansion of the K mutation across the region from 2000 to 202, with the most change occurring between 2010 and 2015. The model provides insights into spatial and temporal trends of artem resistance not possible with data alone, enabling improved decision support on a fine spatial resolution. The study predicts the first spatio-temporal and extents of artem resistance at the subcontinent level, providing critical information for malaria elimination in Southeast Asia. The maps provide estimates of resistance for locations with no data, guiding prioritization of surveillance and policies to prevent further resistance. The work advances earlier predictions of K prevalence over the Greaterong Sub from 200 to 202 based on a comprehensive dataset of K studies in the region, illustrating the expansion of artem resistance in the last 10 years and increase in east and north Myanmar border Indian States. The results are consistent with earlier modelling and data on the spread of artem resistance. The identification of mutations in the K protein associated with artem resistance allows monitoring on a large scale, with almost 200 candidate genotypes established and a refined set of K alleles with slow clearance.
NLR1 and CARD8 are mammalian proteins containing the FI domain, existing in three forms: full-length (FL), cleaved N-terminal (NT), and cleaved C-terminal (CT) peptides due to autopolysis within the FI domain. Both NLR1 paralogs and CARD form conserved autoinhibitory complexes involving NT-CT and FL-CT interactions, with distinct mechanisms. The Linker region between LRR and FI in murine NLR1 (mLR1) plays a role in NT-CT autohibitory, while Z5 of rat NLR1 (r1) and CARD mediates NT-CT. Cellular protease dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP) interacts with NT of mLR1, r1 and CARD through Z5, forming NT-PP-CT; however, PP cannot bind NT of hLR1. Functional assays indicate PP involved in NT-CT of rodent NLR and CARD, but not inhibitory activity of NT on CT. The study enhances understanding of regulatory functions of FI-containing proteins in inflamome autohibition and underscores complexity of interactions in immune response. NLR1 and CARD are sole mammalian proteins containing FI domain, existing in three forms at steady state: full protein (FL), cleaved-terminal (NT), and cle C-terminal (CT). Diversity arises due autopolysis between Z5 and U subdomains FI. NLR forms two autohibitory complexes, both NLRFL and NLRNT with NLRCT, preventing inflamome assembly by NCT. Link region, between PY and NHT of NLR, critical for these autohibitory; not conserved in NLR paral or CARD. Investigated NLR paral, mLRb, r1, and CARD, forming autohibitory. Co-immoprecipitation in HEK cells demonstrated N-terminal tagged mLRbNT, rNT, and CARDNT with C-tagged counterparts. Cleavage mutants mLRb984, r969 and CARD297 interacted corresponding CT, consistent previous interactions. Findings suggest formation two complexes common shared CARD and NLRal. Assessed complexes influence activation NLR or CARD inflome. NCT and CARD capable triggering secretion IL in HE cells ASC, casp-1, pro-IL. Expression cleavage forms NLR or CARD inhibited IL maturation preventing activity CT.
This study reveals the function of the endoplasmic retic (ER) and Golgi localized protein R1 (Rer1) in regulating protein homeostasis in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium. Loss of R1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PER-mediated phosphorylation of eukotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), indicating the onset of prote stress in the ER. R1 is localized to the ER and cis-Gol compartments, consistent with its proposed function as a regulator of ERostasis. Studies in yeast, worms, and mouse cortex have shown that absence of R1 induces ER stress and activates the U pathways, suggesting a conserved function of R1 across species. Results show proteotoxic induced by R1 deficiency creates loser cells eliminated via cell competition. R1 levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression, which causes overgrowth under prote stress, suggesting increased R1 provides cytoprotection to My-overexpressing cells by alleviating stress and supporting overgrowth. The study demonstrates R1 as a novel regulator of proteasis in Dophila and its role in competitive survival.
A study evaluated the functional impact of 4,887 non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of the CHEK2 gene, which is associated with increased risk of breast and other cancers. The researchers used a high-throughput technique called deep mutational scanning (DMS) to test the ability of SNVs to complement a yeast ortholog of CHE2, RAD53. Among the 3,187 non-syn changes, 770 were damaging to protein function while 2,417 were tolerated. The results correlate with previous structure and function data and provide a first functional assay for the variants of uncertain significance in clinical databases. The study also showed that CHE2 missense leading to S428 in the kinase domain does not complement, while missense leading P85 in SCD has wild-type activity. RAD complementation using DNA agent methylmethanesulfon (MS) was performed to evaluate functional of 100 germl miss variants in breast cancer patients from ClinVar. Over 2,700 CHE2 miss variants have not been tested in functional, including most in ClinVar. The study found that variants that did not fully complement RAD in assays were depleted in the screen, suggesting that depletion can be a predictor of function. The results correlate with previous annotations of pathogenicity, with pathogenic variants significantly depleted in the screen compared to variants of uncertain or conflicting annotations. Most CHE2 SNs considered pathogenic or likely in Clin create premature stop codons in the ORF.
This study reports the discovery of the Spx1-Ten toxin-antitoxin system in Streptococcus pneumoniae, which regulates the orientations of hS inversions in the colony-determin (cod locus, leading to epigen and phenotypic diversity. Spx1 and Ten were found to constitute a conserved type II toxinantoxin system, with Spx1 repressing the transcription of the sp1-ten operon. Overexpression of Ten led to growth arrest in E. coli and autolysis in S. pneumonia, while antitox S1 repressed the transcription of the sp1-ten oper. Spontaneous variations in the AT-rich region of the sp1 promoter altered the transcription of the sp-ten oper and unbalanced the functional relationship between S1 and Ten. The toxin Ten targets the ribosomes by interacting with ribosome chaper Rim, reducing the abundance of Com, which leads to enhanced expression of invertase Psr and shift of hS inversions in the locus. The epigen variations yield phenotypic diversity in colony morphology and traits. Ten-driven allelic loss of hS1 was verified under various settings, including ectopic expression of Ten, deletion of, and changes in the AT-rich region. The epigen level, pneumoc with promoter-driven Ten lost 6-methylation of the motif recognized by HSA-specific methylase, with abundant methylation of HSA- and H-recognized sequences. Ten-driven epigen overhaul alters aspects of biology, manifested by switch of colony from opaque to transparent under multiple settings. The mechanistic link between methylation and phase remains undefined, but methylome by HSA shapes pneumoc colony via complex processes.
Researchers have developed a new method called generalized contrastive PCA (gcPCA) to compare high-dimensional datasets collected under different experimental conditions. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), operate on one dataset and cannot account for experimental conditions. Contrastive PCA (cPCA) was proposed to address this, but requires a hyperparameter α, which controls how much covariance from the second condition to subtract from the first, and must iterate over multiple choices with no objective to determine the correct value. Generalized PCA (gc) eliminates this requirement by introducing a normalization factor to penalize high-variance dimensions. gc finds dimensions that exhibit the largest changes in variance between conditions, not patterns distinguishing one from the other. Unlike linear discriminant analysis (LDA) or partial least squares (PLS) regression, gc finds patterns within-dataset variability in one than another. gc has two caveats: gcPCs are not orthogonal in the original space but in normalized, and normalization introduces numerical instability if the matrix is rank-deficient. The toolbox includes versions of gc that are constrained to be orthogonal in space and excludes dimensions with zero or near-zero variance. gc is applied to diverse biological datasets, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay and transcriptomic heterogeneity in type II diabetes single-cell sequencing. gc is a fast, robust, and easy-to-use method for comparing high-dimensional datasets to gain insights into complex phenomena.
Researchers developed a semi-quantitative model of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells using perturbation data from BL-2 and BL-41 cells. The model revealed feedback and cros structures in the BCR network, including a negative cros from p38 to ME/ERK. The relevance of the cros was verified in B and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by phosphoproteomics on ER and ERK sites. The BL-2 network was transferable to BL-41 cells and also modelled B signaling in diffuse large B lymphoma lines with aberrant B signaling (H-1, OCIY). The model did not show major rewiring due to B aberration. A semi-quantitative network of BCR was established and tested in different cell lines to describe conserved B receptor signaling. The model introduced new links in B mediated intracellular signaling and confirmed earlier network talks and feedbacks. The RAF->ME->ER regulatory loop exists in BL and DLB, while the negative impact of B mediated p38 on this loop is a new cros found in three BL and DL cells. The c from p38 to RAFMEER might dampen excessive MEER signaling. Despite feedback and cros in ER and p signaling, no dependency was found in studied cells. However, the motifs are conserved across B lymphoma types, suggesting insights may apply to other lymphomas.
The Notch signalling network is crucial for tissue growth and maintenance, and its activity is regulated by two opposing mechanisms: intercellular Notch activation triggered by interactions between receptors and ligands in neighbouring cells, and intracellular inhibition by ligands binding to receptors in the same cell. Different Notch/ligand combinations elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses, determining the strength, duration, and specificity of Notch signalling. This study explores the molecular basis of opposing actions of Notch ligands DLL4 and J1, controlling angiogenic sprouting, using experimental and mathematical approaches, providing evidence for two mechanisms: 1) DLL rather than J1 induces Notch receptor activation; 2) J1 blocks DLL-dependent Not signalling through J1/DLL complex formation. A new Notch signalling model is proposed, recapitulating tip and stalk cell formation necessary for sprouting. Notch receptors and ligands harbour EGF repeats mediating protein-protein interactions, and homeric DLL ligand complexes promote Not inhibition. Heteromeric J1/DLL complexes are proposed, enabling angiogenic sprouting by regulating endothelial cell differentiation into tip and stalk cells. The study addresses the nature and significance of cis inhibition counteracting transactivation and how manifold receptorlig combinations give different signalling outputs for patterning. DLL and J1 have divergent roles in sprouting, DLL constraining proangiogenic properties of J1, with J1 antagonizing DLL activity, suggesting cros/competition between ligands.
Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPM) is a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm that incorporates uncertainty associated with data points. It outperforms existing methods on simulated data and clusters immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS statistics, which have uncertainty linked to sample size. DPM separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. Additionally, it clusters gene expression datasets with summarised using gene signatures, introducing a novel procedure for generating a summary of a signature on a different dataset to where it was discovered, incorporating variability in expression across genes within individuals. Three public expression datasets with IMD are summarised using relevant signatures, and disease association with clusters by DPM is replicated across datasets. This work demonstrates that data uncertainty should inform clustering and presents a method, DPM. It also presents a procedure for using gene signatures in datasets other than where defined, showing value by summarising expression from patients with IMD using relevant signatures and clustering by DPM. DPM adapts a standard Dirichlet process model to data with uncertainty, not previously explored. It shows accounting for uncertainty alters clustering solution and performance on simulated and real applications. It clusters IMD using GWAS statistics, where uncertainty varies systematically with sample size, and patients with IMD expression data to identify subtypes or predict response. Clustering has applications in bioinformatics, such as identifying disease subgroups, inferring gene function, and regulatory relationships, and clustering diseases. Common methods assume observations without error or identically distributed, but data often have uncertainty, which can improve accuracy if exploited. DPM focuses on uncertainty attached to observations, varying between or features. It extends uses on datasets with complex structure, such as patients with mix IMD, requiring dimension reduction like WGC or PCA, using genes from signature or all, hoping to coincide. DPM allows variability in signature account, which is crucial in complex datasets.
Researchers designed artificial image datasets to investigate why deep neural networks trained to classify images develop a bias towards features such as color and texture, rather than shape. They trained networks from scratch to classify images with single features and combinations, showing that some architectures are unable to learn shape, while others use shape but are biased towards other features. The bias can be explained by interactions between weight updates in mini-batch gradient descent, suggesting different algorithms with sparser, more local changes are required for networks to be sensitive to shape and improve capability to describe human vision. They used the neural kernel as an analytical tool to identify a mechanism by which learning can bias networks towards color and texture: groups of images with gradients that increase sensitivity to these features are aligned, whereas there are no such groups for shape. This opens opportunities to improve network models of visual processing in the brain. Some networks, such as transformers, appear structurally unable to learn shape, while convolutional networks developed bias despite being able to learn shape classification. The bias arises from learning, not a problem with architecture. Networks trained on stylized images, stronger augmentations, and custom components can mitigate texture bias, but not shape. Artificial images with parametric shapes and textures controlled can be used to probe selectivity and experimentally. However, each alteration has effect on textures and vice versa.
Researchers developed a rule-based model to study the dynamics of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) during liver fibrosis and its reversion using the Kappa language. The model describes the interactions between HSC and transforming growth factor 1 (TGF1), which regulates H activation and secretion of type I collagen, the main component of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Studies revealed the critical role of HSC inactivation during fibrosis progression and reversion. Inactivation allows elimination of activated HSC during reversion, while reactivation of inactivated HSC (iSC) is required to sustain fibrosis. The model is sensitive to TGF1 parameters, suggesting adaptability to various pathophysiological conditions with different levels of T1 production associated with inflammatory response. Experimental data from a mouse model of C4-induced liver fibrosis validated predicted ECM dynamics. The model also predicts accumulation of iSC during chronic liver disease. RNA sequencing from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated liverrosis confirmed accumulation, identifying iSC as novel markers of fibrosis. The study provides the first model of H dynamics in chronic disease, exploring the role of iSC in liver homeostasis and can be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fib in other tissues.
Researchers have developed a novel meta-analysis framework for estimating the total effect of high-dimensional omics mediators in large-scale genomic consortia, such as the Trans-Omics Precision Medicine (TOP) program, which comprises multiple cohorts with diverse technologies to elucidate the genetic and biological mechanisms underlying human complex traits and diseases. Leveraging the established asymptotic standard error of R-squared (R)-based effect estimation for high-dimensional omics mediators, the proposed method requires only summary statistics and allows inter-study heterogeneity. Simulations showed the method was computationally efficient and yielded operating characteristics comparable to analysis of pooled-level data when there was no interudy heterogeneity. The method was applied to 5 TOP studies with 580 participants to estimate the mediation of expression on age-related systolic blood pressure and sex variation high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The method is available in R package Meta2 on GitHub. The findings align with results from individual-level data with less computational cost, highlighting efficiency in handling large-scale studies. This is applicable to mediation in large biobanks, such as the UKob with million participants diverse and multiomics profiling on different platforms. Meta can be an alternative to analysis entire dataset once in terms of feasibility and evaluating heterogeneity across factors for diseases and genomic technologies, demonstrated in application to F and M cohorts. The R measure not only characterizes overall effect but also individual mediators. In case of multiple mediators, remaining mediators are associated X and Y, and possibly M. To adjust covari and confounders, the measure was modified based on partial (13, 14). The measure mediates effect M conditional on Z, where Z is set of covari and confound including medi. As proof, was applied to single gene ABC1 selected in 4 cohorts. Lipids within TOP consortium develops analysis plan and each cohort executes shares data for meta. To address unmet in large profiling, introduced framework for fixed and effects to estimate total in high settings, requiring summary and betweenudy heterogeneity from differences technologies and ethnicity.
Researchers have developed a novel method, PWH, to identify personalized driver genes in cancer based on the impact of mutated genes on expression across a group of patients with similar genetic profiles. PWH uses a hypergraph model to represent relationships between mutated and abnormally expressed genes in each sample, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of associations across the cohort. The method was tested on 16 cancer datasets from TCG and compared to existing methods, demonstrating superior performance in identifying known and tumor-specific drivers. PWH also identified both common and rare drivers. Personalized profiles improved tumor stratification and provided insights into heterogeneity. A predicted gene, LRP1, was validated in vitro, promoting cell proliferation. PWH outperformed other methods, including Persona and Frequency, in precision and recall. The method's performance varied across cancer types, with high enrichment in BRCA, KIRC, GBM, and ST. PWH consistently outperformed cohort methods in identifying tumor-specific genes. The model primarily focused on point mutations, but integrating other alterations would improve identification. Despite limitations, PWH demonstrated reliable performance and potential for personalized treatment development.
The Virtual Epileptic (VEP) is a computer-based model that combines anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities to generate spatio-temporal seizure patterns resembling those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG, allowing for evaluation of clinical hypotheses before surgery. This study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach, the SaSS, a metaheuristic algorithm capable of parallel computation to yield high-quality solutions without excessive time. Through benchmarking on synthetic data, the proposal successfully solved different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating scalability and performance against parallel solvers. Results were enhanced using Bayesian framework for hyperparameter tuning, with gains in accuracy and cost. Additionally, a scalable quantification phase was added to assess variability in estimated parameters across problems. This study has potential to improve estimation of brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, inform clinical decision-making. VEP integrates mathematical modeling of neural activity with patient-specific anatomical data to predict brain involved in seizure generation and propagation, capturing diverse dynamics and simulations resembling intracran EEG, offering a platform to optimize strategy and aid decision-making. The model relies on estimating parameters in high-dimensional space to identify network EZ/P in brain, challenging due to sparsity, stochasticity, scalability, and non-linearity in spatiemporal organization and uncertainty. Several studies have demonstrated advancements in accurate estimation of V parameters to inform decision and optimize strategies, driving the use of parallel search techniques to eliminate strong assumptions.
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a major global health problem with 10.6 million cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2021. Pulmonary TB is due to Mtb growth in the lung, but estimates of Mtb replication and death in lungs of infected animals, such as monkeys or rabbits, are largely unknown. Experiments were performed with rabbits infected with a novel, virulent M isolate of the Beijing lineage, H878, carrying plasmid p10. In vitro, p10 was more stable in H878 than in the commonly used laboratory-adapted M strain H37R. The kinetics of plid-bearing bacteria in lungs of M-infected rabbits did not follow a monotonic decline; percent plid cells increased between 28 and 56 post-infection and remained stable between 84 and 112 post-infection. Mathematical modeling suggested a nonotonic change in percent plid cells can be explained by lung Mtb consisting of at least 2 subpopulations with different replication/death kinetics. A model with kinetically homogeneous M population could not explain the data, including when run stochastically. Given H878 forms circumscribed granomas, results suggest bacterial dynamics in subsets of granomas. Model predictions can be tested in future experiments following H878-p10 dynamics in granomas over time.

In vivo, infected rabbits with aerosized bacteria and measured number of bacteria or plid cells in lungs at different points after infection. Found similar numbers in left and right lungs, despite higher CF numbers in right lung. Infected with original H878, not carrying plid, found similar CF numbers in lung, suggesting plid did not impact replication of H strain. M dynamics in lungs not monotonic; large increase in number from 500 to 108 in first 28 days, then declined next 56 days, and exploded to 1010 CF/lung in one or maintained 107/l in another. Changes in plid cells followed total with initial increase, decline, and increase last 28 days. Percentid nonot with decline between 0 and 56 and 84, and increase 28 and 56, and stable 84 112. Stable frequencyid contrasted with increase total number last 28 days.

Tuberculosis remains a global threat with 1.6 million deaths in 202. Infection results heterogeneity of disease, such as clearance, persistence, and disease, and lungitation. Studies suggested quarter to third world population has evidence. Most exposed do not develop disease, requiring long-term studies. Most know about M dynamics early infection comes from animal studies. M can persist non-replic status under hypoxic conditions, resisting killing. In B mice, infected with conventional M, numbers increase during acute but static during chronic. Defined as equilibrium, viable but not dividing. Another reported no difference CF and chromosomal equivalents supporting non-rep persistence. Treating M-infected with antib drugs showed differential response, suggesting heterogeneity in M. Using RS metric, showed differences M replication in lung areas of CHe/Fe mice forming necroticating granomas. This study extends by measuring M numbers and percent plid in whole lung, detecting and quantifying heterogeneity in M replication and death in vivo. Results may explain differential response to treatment and help design strategies depending granomas slow or replicating.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm, GlycanModel, to computationally build glycans layer-by-layer using kernel density estimates of glycan conformations from the Protein Data Bank and quantum mechanics calculations. GlycanModel was benchmarked on a set of glycan structures varying in length and complexity, predicting native structures with high accuracy for both de novo and density-guided modeling. The algorithm was used to design glycans onto a protein vaccine scaffold to shield regions from antibody recognition, and experimentally verified shielding. This work informs glycoprotein prediction, glycan modeling, and aids computational structure determination and refinement. The GlycanModel is part of the Rosetta software suite, incorporating state-of-the-art applications for macromolecular modeling and design. It includes user interfaces for creation of tailor-made protocols, a knowledge-based energy function to evaluate models, and designs. The algorithm was rigorously benchmarked on high-resolution glycan structures using SimpleMetrics and rota_scripts, showing GlycanModel recapitulates native structures with high accuracy. GlyModel was used with Rosetta design to engineer glycans onto a nanoparticle scaffold, reducing reactivity to the underlying surface in immunization, demonstrating glycans can be computationally engineered for immunogenic vaccines.
This study identifies the ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair SCF23-Ace1 in Penicillium oxalicum, where the F-box protein Po23 recognizes and activates the transcription factor Ace1 within the nucleus. Ace1 is a ubiquitinated protein, and in the absence of Po23, Ace accumulates in a dysfunctional form. Po23 acts as a transcriptional coactivator, recognizing and activating Ace, allowing the latter to regulate transcription of target genes with different effects under signals. Under cellulose, the active form of Ace binds to promoter regions of hemi-cellulase genes and represses target transcription as negative. In the absence of Po23, Ace accumulates in cell, mediated by SCF23 complex is interrupted, but Ace is still ubiquinated and degraded by 26 proteasome. Po23 is necessary for Ace to have DNA-binding activity, and its absence leads to downregulation of genes associated with asexual development and secondary metabolite biosynthesis under glucose, and upregulation of hemi-cellulase under cellulose. The study proposes a model for regulation of gene expression by Po23-Ace.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanisms of basement membrane (BM) formation in Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium. They found that Rab10 and Rab8 define parallel routes for BM secretion, with Rab10 promoting lateral planarized secretion and Rab8 basal secretion, leading to fibril and homogenous BM formation, respectively. The dystroph-associated complex (DAP) and Rab10 are present in a planar-polar compartment, with DAP essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards Rab10. The exoc complex, specifically Ex70, interacts with dystrophin to limit planar polarization and is required for Rab8 route. BM diversification emerges from spatial control of distinct routes, with fibr acting as cue for actin orientation and mechanical effector of elongation. Rab10 overexpression increases lateral accumulation of BM and fibrils, suggesting its implication in fibril formation. D and Dys are core components of evolutionarily conserved DAP, with mutants lacking BM devoid of fibrils. Genetic evidence indicates Rab and Rab define parallel routes forming homogenous and fibrils, respectively. Analyses reveal diversification due to Rab-driven lateral planar secretion and Rab basal secretion. The exoc complex is required for homogenous BM formation.
Researchers developed a machine learning model to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) using a multi-task learning (MTL) approach. The model, named language-based universal model (LB), was trained on Env sequences with neutralization data and fine-tuned with Env sequences with non-bnAb and bnAb data. The LB's performance was comparable to Gradient Boosting Machine (GB) and Random Forest (RF) models, with improvements over both methods. Unlike other methods, the LB does not require aligning Env sequences, an advantage given the incredible variability of Env. The model was trained to predict in vitroAb resistance, not validated with clinical outcomes, relying on correlations between in vitro to in vivo. A systematic comparison between methods requires testing different preprocessing, feature selection, and learning algorithms. The LB was compared to RF and GB models because boosting and trees underlie published methods not using neural networks. The most subtypes in sub-Saharan Africa are A, C, and circulating recombinant forms (CR). The model's performance is expected to increase with the size and diversity of training data, chosen small architectures due to computational requirements and data availability. The model addresses key challenges in HIV-1 research, developed with code available at https://github.com/ia/LBUM. The framework is a starting point for designing immunotherapies, potentially relevant to other infectious diseases treated with monoclonal antibodies. The model mitigates bias from underrepresented subtypes and allows learning patterns of co-resistance between antibodies, providing tools to predict epitopes and select optimalAb combinations.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disease characterized by aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow. The effects of treatments for MM vary between patients, highlighting the importance of developing prognostic models for therapeutic decision-making. Most previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the fact that dysfunction of pathways is associated with disease development and progression. This study considered two strategies to construct predictive models taking pathway information into account: pathway score method and grouplasso using pathway information. The former converted gene expression to sample-wise pathway scores for fitting. Three methods for pathway calculation (ssSEA, GS, GS, and z-scores) and 14 sources providing pathway information were implemented in microarray data for MM (GSE324) and obtained a candidate with best performance in validation. The model was compared with gene-based and published models in external data. Also, effects of missing values on prediction were investigated. Results showed grouplasso incorporating pathway information (Vax) was more competitive than gene in both internal and external validation. Immune information including V pathways seemed more predictive for MM. Vax outperformed previously published models. The model was more resistant to missing values, and presence <5% would not deteriorate its accuracy using missing imputation. Pathway-based models using grouplass were competitive to gene-based for MM. These were documented in R package (https://github.com/ShStatMM), where missing imputation method was integrated for future validation.
Researchers have developed a nonlinear dynamical model to study the process of mitochondrial fission, which is the division of a mitochondrion into two organelles. The model focuses on Drp-dependent fission, where Drp is a protein that plays a key role in the process. The model shows that the total fission rate, the number of fission events per second, depends on three parameters: the association and dissociation rates between Drp and M, the total concentration of Drp tetramers, and the association and dissociation rates between Drp-M oligomers on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter, which determines the stability and behavior of the total fission rate. The cumulative fission, the total number of fission over a time, also depends on this parameter. The researchers found that the cumulative fission does not monotonically increase with the parameter, but instead increases to a point and then decreases. This non-monotonic dependence suggests that targeting these parameters may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission mechanism. The model suggests that the total fission may oscillate as a function of time, like other mitochondrial dynamics such as ATP production and Ca2 levels. The researchers also found that the largest cumulative fission values occur when the association and dissociation rates are large, and the dissociation rate is between 0.1 and 1. The model represents the fission of an entire cell and focuses on the oligomerization process to understand how upstream changes affect the number of fission per second.
Researchers have developed a CRISPR/Cas-based gene drive system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyros decarboxylase 2 (T2) in Drosoph suuk, a major agricultural pest. The system exhibited low homing efficiency in the germline, but feeding octamine restored egg-laying in T2 mutant females, allowing for easier maintenance of the drive. The effectiveness of a similar system in Drosila melanogaster was tested, and additional drive systems were constructed by introducing Cas9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency. Genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene alleles and Cas activity. The study highlights the potential of conditionally rescuing female infertility caused by the drive, offering a tool for industrial-scale production of gene transgenic insects. A CRPR/Cas-based drives consist of Cas endonuclease, multiple gRNAs, and a marker, biasing inheritance of specific genes for widespread transmission. In D melanogaster, two Cas promoters showed good expression but did not improve homing, while introducing Cas from another source increased efficiency, indicating position effects may account for results. Gene drive is a tool for controlling disease vectors and pests, with CRPR/Cas having broad prospects due to specificity and flexibility. In D suuk, the system did not exhibit high homing efficiency, possibly due to polymorphisms, Cas expression, or fitness cost. In melanogaster, the drive was tested with two Cas promoters, but introducing Cas increased efficiency, suggesting position may affect results.
The brain's energy consumption is not only limited by the energy needed for computation, but also by the energy required to form memories. Experiments have shown that simple learning tasks, which require few synaptic updates, have a significant metabolic cost. Learning tasks like MNIST to 95% accuracy require at least 108 synaptic updates, suggesting the brain has evolved to learn with minimal energy. The study explores energy for learning in feedforward networks using a parsimonious model, proposing two plasticity algorithms that save energy: 1) modify synapses with large updates and 2) restrict plasticity to subsets of synapses forming a path through the network. Biological networks are larger than required, yet backprop updates all synapses. In this case, savings can be achieved with slightly worse learning performance. Restricting plasticity saves metabolic energy associated with synaptic plasticity. Results may lead to better understanding biological plasticity and match between artificial and biological learning. Algorithms may benefit hardware as electronic storage is energetically costly.

 The study examines reducing energy while maintaining learning. Observations of synaptic fluctuations, number of synapses undergoing modification is restricted. Plasticity is spatially and temporally limited. Backprop updates every synapse every trial, leading to inefficient learning. Artificial networks model neural learning, while backprop abstraction of biological, allows complex associations not matched by biological algorithms. Biological backprop have been suggested, but likely less efficient. Neural research limits plasticity for other reasons, selecting synapses to modify prevent overwriting information, catastrophic forgetting. Randomly plasticity helps regularization, drop and variants. Memory is energetically costly in hardware, storing 32-bit in DRAM more expensive than multiplying.

Experiments show simple learning metabolically costly. Networks learn complicated tasks, costs become high, particularly large networks. Macaque V has 150 million neurons, 300 × 109 synapses. Extrapolating, plasticity distributed all synapses, updates 105 larger, energy 700 times larger. Introduced approaches to reduce costs: restrict plastic to subset synapses and express only syn with large updates. Consistent with neuroscience, typically threshold plastic induction observed. Study suggests competitive algorithm modifying fraction synapses. Physically, competition follows resource constraints. Strategies combined with synaptic caching, skip uninformative samples leading further saving.
Researchers engineered Acinetobacter bayi AD1x strains with deletions of 22-42 kilobases and 70-293 kilobases and evolved them in chemically defined and complex media for 300 generations. Whole-genome sequencing of endpoint isolates revealed mutations in protein-coding and small RNAs associated with fitness in certain environments and deletions. The postcriptional regulatory network, including ribonuclease D, csrA, and hfq, were frequently mutated, but effects varied with deletion and environment. Mutations in this network likely compensate for earlier deletion of a transon in AD1x ancestor. Most strains regained fitness, except two that failed in one of two environments. The study demonstrates that fitness lost during genome streamlining can be rapidly regained through evolution and tends to occur through deletion-specific and global adjustments. This is in contrast to previous studies on E. coli and B. subtilis, which showed limited recovery. The results suggest that evolution can overcome defects in reduced-genome strains and should be considered in strain engineering for biotechnology applications.
Researchers have developed a self-cleaving ribyme-based tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebraf using an in vivo strategy. They first showed that inserting the T3 self-caving ribyme in an intron enables pre-mRNA cleavage with up to 20-fold reduction in expression, and this ribyme displays superior activity compared to other ribymes. The T3 ribyme was then inserted in the second intron of the alb gene using CRPR/C9 and observed pigmentation similar to that in the mutant. Using base-editing to inactivate the ribyme, they showed this phenotype is reversible, illustrating specificity of the approach. A Flase and- Cre-activ version of the T3 ribyme, called Ribo, was generated to control mRNA of the alb gene. Ribo activation induced mRNA knockdown and recapitulated the alb mutant phenotype. Additionally, a Cre and Dre-controllable Gal/UAS in Ribo cassette was used to label cells independently of target gene expression. The Ribo cassette is introduced as a flexible tool to control endogenous expression in vertebrate and an alternative to existing knock strategies.
Researchers have developed a user-friendly software called "aiSEG" to segment nuclei in bright field (BF) images without the need for fluorescent labeling. Previous studies have shown that neural networks can detect nuclei and cell structures in transmitted images under optimized conditions, but it is uncertain if they can accurately segment in challenging conditions like low magnification and live imaging of primary cells. aiSEG was trained on 9,849 image and mask pairs (>600,000 nuclei) of primary murine hematopoietic cells, macrophages, and stem cells at 20x magnification. It was compared to widely used segmentation software Cellpose and Star, but pretrained models were not suitable for BF segmentation. aiSEG was evaluated on a second dataset of 6,243 image pairs (>300,000) from independent experiments with similar settings, including round and complex cells with protruding pseudodia. It segmented BF images across morphologically distinct cells and scales. Segmentation quality was quantified using an adapted F-score that counted inaccurately predicted objects as error instead of false positive and false negative. aiSEG segmentations were quantitatively similar to manual segmentations. Features of the nucleus, whole, and neighborhood were extracted, but individually were not indicative of accurate segmentation. However, a random forest to classify accurate segmentation revealed features of the nucleus were more important. aiSEG was used to quantify additional channel in an experimental with limited biomarkers, replacing H2BCHERRY with fluorescent tagged proliferating cell antigen (PCNA) for live cycle detection.
Researchers investigated whether humans rely on prior knowledge of common properties of reward-predict features to address the challenge of identifying goal-relevant features in environments. One such property is the rate of change, as behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. They tested whether humans are biased to learn when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast by having participants learn the value of two-dimensional bandits with either slowly or quickly changing features. Across two experiments and a preregister replication, participants accrued more reward when the band's relevant feature changed slowly and its irrelevant quickly, compared to the opposite. No difference was found in ability to generalise to unseen values between conditions. Testing feature speed with a set of four Kalman filter models revealed participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature and adjusted learning to relevance and speed. The improvement in participants' performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more they adjusted their learning. Results provide evidence human learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach learning.

 Participants learned value stimuli faster when the reward-predict feature changed slowly and irrelevant quickly, compared to the opposite. After learning, generalised values to new stimuli equally well in both conditions. Models with different learning rates showed participants adjusted to speed of features. Learning for relevant mediated effect, suggesting differences between conditions driven by increased from slow and decreased from fast. The study extends research on slown prior humans, suggesting it aids learning in reinforcement domain. Work relates to broader discussion of human representation problems, previous shown implemented in parallel learning by feedback or replay.

A set of four models embodied hypotheses about feature speed affecting learning. Each used linear approximation and Kalman filter for generalisation and exploration. Stimuli converted to 30-dimensional vector indicating colour and shape. Von-Mises distribution reflected similarity across space, activation determined by distance from true feature. The task posed challenge to participants, indicated end-learning still room for improvement. The contained necessary to test hypothesis and provided controlled dimensionality. The winning model, four rate model, assigned rates based on speed and relevance from first trial. Participants developed sense relevance through weights, but structure anticipated outcome. The model fits accuracy within first trials, lead to believe participants quickly developed relevance.
Researchers have identified a novel gene, RES1, as a potential tumor suppressor and metastasis modifier in ER-negative breast cancer. Using a mouse genetics approach, they found that reduction of RES1 resulted in increased tumor growth, shortened survival, and incidence of lung metastases, consistent with patient data. Analysis of matched primary and metastatic tissues revealed loss of wild-type RES1 in tumor tissue, suggesting RES1 is a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis revealed a role of RES1 in transcriptional control through association with G-quadruplex sequences, particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis. These results suggest loss of RES1 enhances progression in ER breast cancer through alterations in transcriptional and translational control. RES1 is a poorly characterized gene, producing a 152 amino acid product with conserved intron-exon structure but poor amino acid conservation. CRIS or gene trap mouse models crossed with Polyoma-T antigen engineered mouse (MT-PMT) demonstrated reduction of RES1 resulted in significant increase in tumor growth, shortened survival, and incidence and number of lung metastases consistent with patient data. Furthermore, analysis of matched primary and metastatic tissues revealed loss of wild-type RES1 in tissue, consistent with RES1 being a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis revealed a role of RES1 in transcriptional control through association with G-quadruplex sequences, particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis. These results suggest loss of RES1 enhances progression in ER breast cancer through alterations in transcriptional and translational control.
During meiosis, programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are formed by the topoisomerase-like enzyme Spo11, activating the DNA damage response (DDR) kinase Mec1 via the checkpoint loader Rad24. Loss of Mec and Rad activity alters DSB formation and recombination, but their genome-wide roles have not been examined in detail. This study utilised two strategies: deletion of the mismatch protein Msh2 and control of meiotic prophase via the Ndt transcription to characterise the roles of Mec and Rad in meiotic recombination by genome-wide mapping meiotic progeny. Loss of Rad24 reduced spore viability and recombination frequency, consistent with previous studies. However, loss of Mec increased recombination frequency, consistent with its role in DSB interference, and less effect on spore viability. Despite differences, multi-chromat events by closely spaced Ds in wild-type occurred more in absence either Rad or Mec, suggesting loss spatial regulation at D formation level. Mec and Rad also regulate crossovers (COs). Loss of either Mec or Rad CO distributions became random, suggesting reductions in global interference. Results highlight shared roles in CO regulation and separable for Rad as pro-CO factor and Mec as recombination regulator, loss suppressing broader CO defects by DDR abrogation. In meiosis, Spo-DS initiate homolog recombination, essential for CO generation between homolog chromosomes. Mec and Rad limit recombination frequency and prevent formation multi-DS events, supporting view Mec mediates D interference. However, phenotypes of Mec and Rad are less, indicating separable roles. Rad may regulate resection by loading 9-1 clamp, acting barrier or inhibitor. In vegetative cells, 9-1 inhibits resection by recruiting Rad near Ds; however, may not case meiotic Ds, Rad not required checkpoint. In plants, RAD and H promote D during meiosis, suppressing nonhomous-joining and Z-independent CO between heterolog.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive in silico-scale metabolic model of Pneumocyst jirovec, a deadly fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients, to identify metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder its growth in vitro. The model was created by reviewing and refining the Pneumyst genome, incorporating literature information and bioinformatics tools, and organising data into a well-defined genome-scale network. Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement approaches were employed to predict metabolic fluxes and identify critical components of Pneumyst growth. Findings offer insights into the biology of Pyst and provide a strategy to overcome the longstanding challenge of culturing the pathogen in vitro. The model was validated using in vitro culture conditions proposed by Meral et al and made predictions regarding Pyst growth and metabolism, including critical components of Meral's medium and how to supplement it for enhanced growth. Additionally, the model can replicate drop and knockout experiments and predict the impact of inhibiting specific targets on fungal growth. A Reinforcement approach was used to simplify Meral's medium to achieve a minimal culture medium.
Researchers developed a three-dimensional (3D) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TA pathway to investigate whether increased levels of Y/TA in cancer cells are sufficient to sustain proliferation under high-density conditions. They introduced a novel component that inputs cell density, reflecting cell dynamics, into the Hipp pathway, enabling simulation of cell proliferation as output. The model mimics cell division and growth, preventing overlap by assigning exclusive domains to each cell with Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential with soft character, and cell cycle dynamics, particularly mitotic and G phases. Simulations at various Y/TA levels showed a twofold increase in YTA levels in cancer cells was sufficient to evade cycle arrest compared to normal cells, enabling continuous proliferation under high-density. The model, integrating cell-cell interactions and Hipp-Y/TA pathway, may evaluate cancer malignancy based on YTA levels, develop drugs to suppress abnormal cancer proliferation, and determine drug dosages. 

The study used 3D multicellular simulations combining methods with reaction models of the Hipp pathway, known to regulate proliferation by inhibiting YTA activity. Approach simulated division and growth, preventing overlap by assigning domains to each with LJ (12-6) potential a soft character, integrating cycle, particularly M and G phases. Introduced a modeling that inputs cell density, reflecting dynamics into Hipp simulation. This allowed to simulate proliferation as response, providing detailed representation of intracellular modulates division. Investigated elevated levels YTA in cancer tissues sufficient sustain. Developed models representing normal and cancerous tissues. Simulations revealed normal exhibited cycle arrest and suppression growth, cancer with YTA levels twice demonstrated continuous proliferation. Findings suggest increased YTA alone bypass inhibition under-density, contributing unchecked proliferation cancer. Model's integration dynamics intra-cell position as tool evaluating malignancy, exploring interventions YTA, optimizing dosages.
Researchers have developed a new framework, called the Free Landscape of Stickers (FELS), to study the role of low-complex domains (LCD) in biomolecules in phase separation and material properties. The framework uses a continuous "stickiness" energy scale, rather than an explicit sequence alphabet, to understand how LCD sequences govern condens dynamics and material properties. By varying the complexity of sequences, researchers found that periodic patterns promote elasticity, while random sequences exhibit viscosity. Minimum periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condens, avoiding transitions to glass or solid states. The energy framework explains recent findings on prion domains and predicts alterations in condens viscoelasticity. The study provides a unifying perspective on sequence-encoded properties, where features of landscapes are conserved while sequences are variable. Using FELS, researchers can dissect the complexity of LCD, quantified by periodicity and disorder, impacting dynamics and material properties of condens. By employing Wasserstein distance, sequences are varied from periodic to random, demonstrating that a handful of energy features capture visco trends in experiments. Periodic LCDs display local structure and inhomogeneities, while random sequences are homogeneous and viscous, with an order of magnitude difference in visc moduli compared to periodic sequences. Phase diagrams and dynamical properties corroborate rheological trends, with periodic elastic and viscosity increasing with periodicity. Structurally, interactions in periodic LCD result in oscillatory decay correlations. Selfan analysis reveals high periodicity drives glassy states.
The development of ectodermal organs begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial plac that progressively invaginates into the underlying mesyme as the organ takes shape. Signaling by secret molecules is critical for epithelial morphogenesis, but the information that leads to cell rearrangement and tissue changes remains open. Using the mouse dentition as a model, nonmus myos II is essential for dental epithelial invagination and functions by promoting cell-cell adhesion and convergent cell movements in the supasal layer. Sh signaling controls these processes by inducing my II via AK. Pharmacological induction of AK and my II can rescue defects caused by inhibition Sh. Results support a model in which Sh signal is transmitted my II to effective cellular rearrangement for proper epithelial invagination. Cell-cell connections persist between basal and supasal cells during invagination, losing at large due to presence of cyst disrupt force in II mutants and add invagination after 13.5. In absence II and IIB, cell adhesion through adherence junctions disrupted in invinating incisor epithelium. Loss did not affect expression total E-cadher, but significantly reduced homophil bound-cadher and membrane-localized in supasal. Weakened adhesion contributes impaired tissue integrity and formation cysts. Results demonstrate importance II in maintaining celladhesion in stratified epithelium, consistent with prior findings that II-generated forces essential maintenance and growth adherence junctions cultured cells and deletion I and IIB mislocalized-cad and defective embryos. Maintaining intercell adhesion important collective movement convergent, providing anchoring organize actin andomy tension trellular, where crawling cell-cell shortening integrated effective cellation. In developing incisor, convergent movement supasal, actin detected trellular, reduced adhesion E13.0h/ep-cko incisors trellular act delocalized effective interaction compromised.
Researchers have developed a novel transfer learning-based graph convolutional network, scGCN, to integrate and analyze large-scale single-cell multi-omics data. scGC combines different types of measurements, even when unpaired, and achieves higher accuracy in label transfer and visualization compared to other methods. It captures cell characteristics and provides a holistic view of cell functions and communication. scGC is an end-to-end and hypothesis-free framework for integrating single-cell multiomics with accuracy and robustness. The method combines omics autoencoders with convolution networks and transfer, allowing integration of different omics with different distributions. It models regulatory interactions across om layers, inferring relationships between types even when unpaired. Single-cell technologies have revolutionized studying complex systems at a cellular level, but exponential growth demands leveraging existing datasets for reliable annotations. scGC addresses this by adapting scRNA-se and scAC-se as a domain problem in transfer learning, exploring kernels for adapting representations between embeddings. It accurately transfers cell annotations across datasets, tissues, species, and molecular layers, identifying new subtypes, and reannotating cell in scACq more accurately. scGC is scalable on large datasets, providing insights into biological systems at single-cell level. It can be adapted to other omics, such as protein, histone, and methylation data. GC has advantages over methods, exploring MK-MD-based adaption, propagating information, and capturing complex patterns. It currently focuses on classification, but can be used for trajectory, cell interaction, and time-series analysis.
Researchers studied the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the Mc3 subunit of the replicative helicase, a protein essential for cell growth. They used mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 (AF) modeling to demonstrate that precise positioning of basic residues within the LS is critical for nuclear transport of Mc3 through interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs the nuclear import of Mc, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the M complex and poor growth. The results provide a structure-guided framework for predicting monopart NLS, which lack a universally conserved sequence but share characteristics with the LS of Mc3 and SV40 large antigen. The LS of Mc3 and SV40 share similar contacts with Kap60, with basic residues K768 of Mc and K of SV occupying P2 and R of Mc and K of SV occupying P3. These residues are needed for optimal growth. Mutations of Mc at P or P result in defective import, reduced chromatin association, and impaired growth. The findings underscore structural and functional parallels between the LS of Mc3 and SV, highlighting the role of P and P mediated interactions with Kap.
Ataxin-2 (ATN) is a protein implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinsonism, and is a therapeutic target for ALS-related conditions. The protein functions in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability, and assembly of mNP-granules, mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). The LSm-like domain of At2 stimulates mRNA translation and antagonizes mNP assembly. This study advances previous findings through experiments on Drosoph and human Atin-2 proteins. Targets of RNA Proteins Identified by Editing (TRIBE) co-localization and immunoprecipitation indicate the poly-binding protein (PAB) interacting P2 motif of Atin-2 is a major determinant of mRNA and protein of Atin- mNPules. Experiments with transgenic Dophila indicate the At-LS domain protects against neurodegeneration, while P2 and unstructured IDR interactions support At-induced cytotoxicity. The data propose howin interactions are remodelled during translational control and how structured and non-structured contribute to specificity and efficiency of R gran condensation as well as neurogeneration.

The study identifies conserved regions of Atin-2: LSm (Sm), L-associated (SmAD), and P2 motif, flanked by IDRs. Work in Doph has shown the c-terminal IDR of At2 is required for mNP assembly into granules. Experiments show the IDR is also required for cytotoxic in Doph FUS, C9F, and Huntington's disease models R-gran formation is a mechanism which At2 promotes neurogeneration. A discovery the At-LS domain antagonizes IDR has led a model in which At2ID: (a) does not support mNP when At2 is with actively mRN through At-LS interactions; (b) becomes accessible and mediating mNP when Sm interactions and translation stalls. The study further elaborates mechanisms of Atin functions in mRNA and mNP assembly, showing P2 of Atin and interactions with P are essential for gran but required to recruit At-target mRN and protein intoin gran. The P2:P on poly tail mRN helps specify the composition ofin gran. The propose an early role P:P working with L to support translation and oppose mNP; a later in translation-stalled P:P linked mRN into gran.

The study provides a finer analysis of Atin activities, suggesting the L domain should be spared, and IDR mechanisms and P:P interactions be targeted by therapeutics. Work showed At mutants lacking cR forin gran in Doph and S cells were resistant to neurogeneration. The L-domain antagonizes Atin gran formation. This study demonstrates Atin forms lacking L more cause cytotoxic than wild-type or IDR-deficient forms. Atin is a disordered, structured regions confer functionality by forming stable complexes, hindering aggregation. The L domain may exert neuroprotective effects.
This study investigated the role of Pitx and Pax in the emergence and maintenance of muscle stem cells (Mu) in extraocular muscles (EOM) and limb muscles. Pitx was found to be dispensable for Mu specification and maintenance in EOM despite being a major regulator during early development. Constitutive inactivation of Pax postnat led to a greater loss of Mu in EOM compared to limb. A relay between Pitx, Myf, and Pax for E stem cell maintenance was proposed. Mu in EOM adopt a quiescent state earlier than limb muscles and do not proliferate in adult, yet E have higher content of Pax+ Mu per pre and postnat. Limb Mu proliferate in mdx mouse for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, less Mu were in EOM of mdx compared to controls and not proliferative. The study provides comprehensive characterization of Mu heterogeneity along body axis and insights into sparing of E during muscular dystrophy. No differences in number of GFP+ per area or proportion Pit2+ cells were observed in foetal between control and mutant EOM, suggesting factors other than Pit and Pax ensure specification during embryonic development. Higher number of dying cells per area were in Pax null E compared to controls at P, suggesting critical period compensation by other factors. Expression of Calc, Mu marker, was absent in E and lacking Pax. Fraction of GFP in null display marked increase compared controls, no changes observed mutant and control at P21, reflecting differences pace lineage progression between muscles in vivo.
Researchers have developed a novel algorithm called VOC-IN to simulate the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants among the human population. The algorithm combines epidemiological data with deep learning and neural networks to estimate the transmission of COVID-19 strains during the pandemic. VOC-IN emphasizes underlying patterns in multivariate data to improve optimization and accurate fitting. It is capable of fitting multi-source data effectively and can be applied in scenarios involving a single virus. The researchers applied VOC-IN to data from British Columbia and internal health institutions in Canada, demonstrating good performance in simulating observed and unobserved dynamics, time-dependent inference, and short-term predictions. They compared VOC-IN with traditional methods, showcasing advantages in accuracy and predictive performance. The algorithm integrates epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemi models to estimate the intensity of COVID-19 transmission. It uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINs) to estimate time-vary parameters. PINs are data-driven algorithms that solve forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations. Recent studies have shown PINs can accurately fit compartmental models and estimate timeary parameters. The researchers propose VOC-IN that fits data and infers complex timeary parameters by encoding VOC infection, epidemiological mechanisms, and differential equations into networks. They designate two neural networks, UD and UP, with variable t as input, and weights and biases parameterized by and, respectively. The study aims to integrate VOC-IN with other machine methods to better fit and predict infectious data.
This study introduces CytoNet, a Deep Sets-based model that aggregates single-cell data into profiles using self-supervised contrastive learning. CytoNet learns an aggregation strategy by receiving single-cell morphological input and providing the aggregated profile as output. The model outperforms average profiling in both retrieval and mechanism of action tasks, with relative improvement depending on CytoNet application. For mechanism retrieval on the dataset c000, CyNet achieves 36-60% better performance than average profiling on hold-out plates with different protocols than training plates. A 30% improvement is observed on dataset c0003. When applied to c000 and validation, CyNet achieves 50-81% better than average, affirmed by 68% increase for c000 data. Results improve ~20 gains using features on different dataset. CyNet effectively overcomes retraining challenge, making easier to use. CyNet has difficulty generalizing unseen plates within same set and different set. Dataset c000 tested compounds provides insights CyNet generalizability. 

 CytoNet employs Deep Sets formulation to learn model aggregating single data into profile that outperforms population-averaged in predicting compound mechanism. This is through self-sup contrast learning within multiple-instance framework, allowing model process groups data-labeled group rather individual point and make classifications collective groups. Training evaluated replicate retrieval, retrieving wells same compound and downstream retrieving annotated mechanism using mean precision metric. Cyto evaluated two fronts: generalizing unseen compounds protocols and practical scenario trained large measured performance mechanism retrieval dataset. Methods capture subpopulations rather dispersions did not improve average. They incomparable across unless subpop defined. Many phenotypes described continuous scale. Previous work improved profiling features averages, dispersion, covariances provided ~20 better predicting mechanism gene pathway, capturing statistics heterogeneity improve tasks. However, has limitations: only captures first-second moments, produces matrix recom pairwise profiles new included. 

Cyto proposes self contrast learning leveraging profiling information experiments. Contrast aims general features beneficial tasks. Use pert ident labels train latent space distinguishing samples. This frames multiple problem assuming replicates cells feature, compounds distributions. Not every pert yields distinct, collectively feature captures biological variations. Apply contrast already features, applicable image datasets features readily. Data collection sets cells, sample corresponds set based definition. Aggregate sample profile function few properties: capable input sizes, permutation-invariant, learnable.
Researchers proposed a framework to quantify cognitive effort during task performance using electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns. The framework relies on identifying discrete dynamical states (microstates) and optimal theory. To validate its effectiveness, they applied it to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stro task, a cognitive test where participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another often conflicting aspect. Findings reveal increased cost linked to cognitive, confirming the framework's effectiveness in capturing and quantifying transitions. The study analyzed EEG data from 44 participants during a 5-minute resting-state and task sessions, including a spatial Stro task with varying levels of cognitive engagement. Microstate analysis revealed different distributions across conditions, with higher cost for incongruent stimuli and influenced by level of control. A correlation between cost and reaction times showed reduced cost associated with improved performance. Results highlight the value of characterizing brain dynamics and transitions in understanding cognitive processes and the relationship between neural patterns, effort, and performance. The framework estimates brain cost using the Schrödinger bridge, a probabilistic approach reducing dimensionality. Brain activity can be described as discrete transitions between metastable states, capturing significant variance. Microstate analysis reduces electrical signal into distinct topographies, associated with activations or deactivations of resting networks and spectral bands. The study found distinct microstates across conditions, modulated by level of demand, and asymmetric transitions indicating flux and entropy production. Future directions include quantifying entropy across tasks as a measure of cognitive load and investigating pathological conditions' influence on control.
Researchers investigated the expansion of atypical memory B cells (aBC) in individuals exposed to Plasmodium vivax (P. viv) malaria. They generated probes to detect and study the development and durability of P. viv-specific aBC and their capacity to produce neutralizing antibodies following natural infections. PvDBI-specific aBC were elicited during malaria and persisted through the recovery phase of infections. To address the biology and function of P. viv-specific aBC in producing antibodies, a single BC was cultured and secreted Ig tested for binding activity. aBC clones produced variable levels of anti-PDBI Ig and some produced high levels comparable to classical BC. Among aBC, A12 and B11 produced neutralizing antibodies against a panel PvI variants. Notably, BC receptors of PvI-specific aBC expressed unique genes with usage similar to classical BC. The somatic hypermutation rate and CDR length of VH and V in these BC were not different. Findings revealed P. viv infections elicited the development and persistence of P. viv-specific aBC. Accumulation of aBC during infections might play a role in producing antibodies against malaria. P viv-specific aBC were heterogeneous, consistent with previous study in P. falciparum exposure. Three subsets aBC were identified but not developed into ASC. Of six PvI-2 aBC clones, three differentiated and secreted Ig with inhibitory efficacy. One clone exhibited high affinity comparable to classical BC and produced inhibitory antibodies against diverse PvI variants. Findings highlight a role of aBC in humoral response by differentiating into ASC producing neutralizing against P viv invasion. However, competency of aBC in differentiation was low compared to classical. aBC have capacity to present antigens by internalizing and express MHC and interact with T cells. They primed T cells in GC to sustain response in malaria. Investigation of mechanisms driving malariaBC in presentation, cytokine secretion, and differentiation will be beneficial for vaccine design.
Researchers have developed a new method called mr-r, an extension of the mr mash model, that requires only summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates from a reference panel, making it more applicable to datasets not publicly available and scalable to biob-size data. mr-r enjoys the ability to learn patterns of effect sharing across phenotypes, model dozens of phenotypes jointly, and is computationally efficient. Through simulations and real analysis of 16 blood phenotypes in the UKobank, mr-r is competitive and often outperforms state-of-art methods for single and multi-phenotypic prediction in various scenarios differing in pattern of effect across phenotypes, number of phenotypes, number of causal variants, and genomic heritability. mr-r achieves higher accuracy than competing methods for majority of traits, especially when data has smaller sample size. mr-r shares features with Multivariate Shrink (mash) in using mixture-multivariate-Norm prior on effect sizes to leverage sharing across conditions and empirical Bayes to adapt prior to data. However, mr-r takes multivariate regression approach and adjusts sizes for sharing and correlations among variables. mr-r is tested in PGS for multiple phenotypes via simulations and shows competitive accuracy with current methods. Real analysis of 16 blood traits in UKob confirms results. mr-r outperforms competing methods 14 out of 16 phenotypes, varying magnitude of improvement across phen from modest to substantial.
This study proposes a novel framework that integrates spatio-temporal heterogeneity into homogeneous models by introducing a continuous recruitment process for susceptibles. A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations (DE) model. The model is trained using deep learning and calibrated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methods. Data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai are used to train the DE model and calibrate the mechanistic model. The study projects the attack and peak of new infections for the Omicron wave in China after the adjustment of the zero-COVID policy, indicating an attack rate of 80.06% and peak of 3.17% of the population, compared to the homogeneous model's 99.97% and 32.78, providing an 18.6% improvement in accuracy. Simulations show heterogeneity decreases herd immunity by 37.36% and prolongs the outbreak from 30 to 70 days, aligning with real cases. The study lays groundwork for a new class of models and insights for heterogeneity. Employing deep learning, the DE model is validated and the mechanistic model contributes to uncovering mechanisms in recruitment. The dual strategy combines strengths of learning and mechanistic to yield a comprehensive framework for predicting disease dynamics. A comparison shows the learning approach is more flexible in capturing information. The mechan model offers intuitive insights into transmission and control. The study aims to develop a generalized framework that embeds spatio-temporal heterogeneity into homogeneous models, leveraging the compartment for efficient prediction and enhancing accuracy. A machine approach is developed to shape the recruitment from COVID-19 data. The model is applied to project trends and evaluate accuracy with traditional frameworks. The implications and applications of the novel framework are discussed.
Researchers propose a new framework, called synaptic predictive processing (SPP), which suggests that synapses use noise to represent uncertainty about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. They developed a mathematical framework where the synapse interacts with the soma of the postsyn neuron like an agent in an uncertain environment. This framework implies synapses use an internal model of somatic dynamics updated by a learning rule resembling LTP/LTD mechanisms. Synapses utilize noisy release to encode uncertainty of somatic potential. Each syn strives to predict som dynamics of postsyn neuron, but emergent dynamics of many syn in a network resolve learning problems like classification or closed-loop control in dynamic environments. Synapses coordinate to represent and utilize uncertainties in network behaviorally ambiguous situations.

The PP is applied to individual synapses, considering dynamics as an agent with cellular environment, deriving a learning rule minimizing surprise. This rule enables synapses to adapt efficacy to predict postsyn spikes from backpropagating potentials. In contrast to previous approaches, PP focuses on synaptic plasticity perspective, unraveling dynamics governed by locally accessible quantities. The synaptic rule follows interaction between syn and postsyn neuron. Predictive processing has emerged as a normative theory for biologically plausible rules from first principles, exploring compartmentalization, cortical circuits, and dendritic trees for learning.

The study focuses on temporal uncertainty induced by backpropag potentials and noise in transmission. Synaptic view allows precise timing dynamics in spike-dependent plasticity. Emergent plasticity reproduces LTP/LTD effects and predicts synaptic parameters. SPP suggests synapses probe environment with stochastic currents, integrating feedback to update efficacy to predict somatic. Every release is a "small experiment" based on experience, shaping future activity. On the network level, simulations indicate SPP allows synapses to master learning paradigms despite uncertain inputs. Synapses form a model postsyn membrane, reproducing learned behavior, installing firing patterns through plasticity. A simple example shows synapses learn to predict postsyn dynamics despite variabilities. Synaptic efficacies show increasing trend towards postsyn spike. Results demonstrate SPP can be applied to supervised and unsupervised learning, self-organizing meaningful representations.
Researchers have developed a new method, Scup, for reconstructing cell lineage trees from single-cell DNA sequencing data, addressing challenges such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors. Scup uses a probabilistic framework and neighbor-joining algorithm to compute distances between cells and reconstruct the tree. The method is embarrassingly parallel, making it faster than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining accuracy. Its robustness is investigated using synthetic and biological datasets of 18 cells. Single-cell sequencing enables detailed analysis of development and differentiation, and Scup is designed for healthy diploid data, but can be extended to cancer data by incorporating copy variations. The method is compared to state-of-art methods using synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells, showing better accuracy and faster runtime. The tree reconstruction of cell lineage from single data is a fundamental problem with potential for studies of development and differentiation. Various methods have been developed, including bulk, single DNA, and single RNA data, exploiting mutations to reconstruct trees. However, mutations are scarce in healthy tissues, highlighting the need for single DNA sequencing data, which reveals more mutations than other types but comes with challenges such as amplification errors and allelic dropouts. To compare methods, synthetic datasets were generated with ground truth trees and mutations, accounting for amplification, allelic, and sequencing errors. Scup is compared to SCI and Phylo using a fibro dataset of 18 cells, showing better accuracy and faster runtime.
Researchers developed the Thanzi Lae On (TLO) model, a tailored tool to evaluate health benefit packages (HBPs) in Malawi, addressing limitations of analytic approaches used to weigh evidence for interventions. The model mechanistically models and calibrates country-specific data on disease incidence, health-seeking behavior, and healthcare capacity to meet demand under realistic resource constraints. Simulations of plausible HBP strategies found the linear optimization (LA)-based HBP achieved the largest health gain, an 8% reduction in disability-adjusted life years (DALs) between 2023-204 compared to a benchmark, concentrating on high-impact treatments. However, this HBP incurred excess DALs in the first years of implementation. Other prioritization approaches, such as service-based on patient characteristics, achieved consistent gains relative to the benchmark on a yearly basis and 5% reduction in DALs over the period, suggesting this approach might be beneficial. The LO model was developed with input from the Malian Ministry of Health and clinicians, using large data sources, and assumes policies implemented from 2023 to 204. The population size was 100,000 individuals, with 10 simulations per scenario, and results scaled to Malawi's 14.5 million population. The LO evaluated resource strategies, including current prioritization among policy-makers, analytical tools, and new approaches based on patient characteristics. The results showed the LO provides a unique tool to test HBPs specifically for Malawi, evaluating health gains under realistic resource constraints and addressing limitations of other methods.
Researchers employed Oligaint FISH to investigate meiotic chromosome dynamics in the holoc pantry moth Plodia interpella and compared findings to previous studies in the silkworm Bomby mor, which diverged over 100 million years ago. They found that pairing in both species is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends and form rod-shaped bivalents at metaphase I. However, unlike Bomby, Plodia bival can orient in multiple ways at metaph I. Kinetochores assemble at non-telomeric loci towards the center of chromosomes, regardless of telomere position, and sister kinetocho do not pair. Instead, four kinchores are observed at metaph I with end-on microtule attachments co-orienting separated kincho. These findings challenge the classical view of paired pole-facing kinchores for accurate hom separation in meiosis. The study highlights the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model systems, as novel organisms can lead to discovery of novel biology. In Plodia, pairing is initiated at chromosome ends, but ends are not used for segregation at metaph I. Bivalents can be positioned telere or center-oriented at I with teleres facing poles or centers. Chromosome centers act kinorecruitment sites in Plodia, similar to Bomx. This mechanism differs from cup-based segregation in C elegans and inverted meiosis in plants. The study demonstrates the suitability of Plodia as a model for studying conserved and divergent meiotic biology.
Researchers investigated the role of the transcription factor SOX3 in the development of the median eminence (ME), a region at the base of the hypothalamus, and its impact on the pituitary gland. They found that mutations affecting SO3 result in hypopuitarism, a condition characterized by insufficient hormone production, likely originating from the hypothalamus. Conditional deletion of SO3 in the central nervous system, but not the pituitary, resulted in reduced growth hormone levels, consistent with a hypothalamic origin of hypopuitarism. Analysis of SO3 expression in the hypothalamus revealed its presence in tanycytes, neurons, astrocytes, and NG-glia, but not oligodendrocytes. NG-glia proliferation and differentiation were affected in SO3 mutants. Low-dose aspirin treatment, known to affect NG-glia, rescued proliferative defects and hypopuitar in SO3 mutants. The study highlights a role of NG-glia in ME function during postnatal development and sensitivity to extrinsic signals.
Researchers investigated the role of CED-5/C-12, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) in Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic epidermal morphogenesis. C-5/C-12 is known to activate C-10/Rac during corpse engulfment of dying cells, but its role in embryonic migrations was unknown. They found that loss of C-5/C-12 led to embryonic lethality due to failed epidermal migrations, contrary to expectation. C-5/C-12 inhibited F-act in migrating epider, opposite to what was expected for C-10 GEF. To address this, they investigated if C-12 harbors GAP (GTPase activating protein) functions. A candidate region in C- away from C- G catalytic region was mutated, altering epider cell function and not corpse function. Interfering with GEF by C- ability to bind Rac/C-10 resulted in loss of ventral enclosure and corpsement. Genetic studies support GAP acts on different Gases. They propose C-5/C-12 supports cycling multiple Gases by distinct domains, promoting and inhibiting F-act nucleation. C-5/C12 is a bipart GEF promoting C-10 during corpsement and ventral enclosure. Loss of C-12 reduced F-act around corpses, as expected, but increased F in epider cells during ventral, opposite to loss C-10. A GAP domain in C was identified and mutated, resembling loss C12 epider migrations but corpse was normal.
Researchers investigated the hierarchical organization of temporal processing in the rodent visual system using information-theoretic and autocorrelation analysis. They found that information and timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. Intrinsic times for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, whereas predictability was stimulus-dependent. These observations were reproduced in a basic network model with correlated sensory input. The findings suggest that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher areas while reducing predictability for an efficient neural code. A hierarchical organization of temporal processing was observed in the visual pathway of the mouse cortex, with a gradual increase in correlation and timescales and decrease in predictability along the anatomical hierarchy. Analysis of data from different conditions and network models indicated that timescales are supported by stimulus-independent network-intrinsic mechanisms, such as increasing recurrence along the anatomical. The decrease in predict is in line with efficient coding and observed in rodents, as well as formation of increasingly invariant, high-level visual representations, and might be a hallmark of hierarchical processing in mammals. The hierarchy of times was more shallow under spontaneous activity, indicating visual stimulation affects the times hierarchy. However, times and timescales were similar between stimulation and spontaneous, mirroring findings in somatosensory cortex. The results indicate network-intrinsic mechanisms, such as increase in recurrence, shape the temporal hierarchy. Such mechanisms cause stronger correlations in population codes, yielding long times of consistency and stable representations for readout and accumulation in higher areas.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with broad potential applications, but the neural circuits engaged during TMS are poorly understood. Recordings of neural activity from the corticospinal tract provide a direct readout of the response of the motor cortex to T, offering a new opportunity to model neural dynamics. This study used epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of a cortical macrocolumn through which mechanisms underlying the response to T, including direct and indirect waves, could be investigated. Sensitivity analysis identified important pathways and machine learning was used to identify common features among these pathways. Sensitivity analysis identified neuron types that preferentially contributed to corticosp waves. Single wave could be predicted by the average probability of all paths between activated type L5 pyramidal tract (PT) neurons. For activations, the conduction of the shortest path to PT determined the latency of cortic wave. Multiple neuron activations could preferentially modulate a cortic wave. Results support the hypothesis that different pathways contribute to cortic waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Activation of afferents to the cortex as well as specific types within motor initiated I-waves. Methodology provides a workflow for computationally tractable sensitivity on complex models relating to structure and identify mechanisms underlying response to acute.
Cell-free placental DNA (cDNA) is present in maternal circulation throughout gestation and has been detected as early as the fourth week of pregnancy, comprising approximately 40% of total plasma cell-free DNA. Since its discovery in 1997, cDNA has been used in clinical non-invasive testing (NIPT) to screen for fetal aberrations, notably chromosomal aneuplies. However, the basic biology of cDNA remains poorly understood, limiting its research and clinical utility. Characterization of cDNA features by release mechanisms can provide real-time insights into placental health, a powerful tool for longitudinal studies of development and disease. Improved understanding of biological mechanisms is required to leverage cDNA as a tool for assessing placental health and screening complications.

cDNA originates mainly from trophlasts, the major placental cell type, and is more accurately referred to as cell-free placental DNA (cDNA). Reports of first trimester cDNA in anembry pregnancies, presence before fetal circulation, and cell release in placental studies provide evidence of trophlastic origin. Detection of cDNA in maternal plasma and correlation between placental and cDNA methylomes solidify the placenta as source. Increased cDNA in conditions involving placental dysfunction, such as preeamps, placenta accreta, and previa, point to placental origin, hypothesized due to trooblast death.

Absolute quantification of cDNA is required for characterization across gestation and pathologies, achievable by spike controls sequencing. Markers for identifying cDNA in pregnancies regardless of sex and genotype have been proposed. Regions differentially methylated between placenta and white cells are candidate markers. cDNA carries placental genome status and has been proposed for differentiating cDNA from maternal. cDNA methylation has potential for research and nonvasive screening. Investigation of epigen modifications, such as hydroxymethylation, in cDNA is a research direction.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of cancer-specific loci for hormone-dependent cancers (HDCs), including breast, endometrial, and prostate cancers. These cancers share environmental and genetic risk factors, suggesting a common aetiology. The detection of pleiotropic loci, associated with at least two HDCs, suggests shared genetic factors contribute to polygenic risk and raises the possibility of common driver genes and biological pathways. To identify target genes affected at GW regions, gene mapping relies on statistical approaches such as quantitative trait loci (QTL) and transcript-wide association studies (TWAS). However, these methods are limited by small sample sizes, steady-state gene expression, and lack of relevant tissue data. Orthologous functional assays provide complementary approaches to define regulatory variants and connect to genes.

A study expanded the repertoire of risk regions and candidate genes for HDCs, providing insights into the genetic architecture and biology underpinning susceptibility. Candidate HDC genes were enriched for known cancer and drug targets, supporting less-characterized genes may play roles in development. The approach highlights the value of integrative genetics and genomics to identify pleotropic cancer genes. Combined with future research, results may redirect efforts to promising targets for new drugs or drug repurposing for treatment.

The study identified 44 multi-HDC risk regions across the genome, defined as overlapping regions for at least two HDC, two for three, and four HDC. Integrating GW data, epigenomics, and promoter Hi-C maps from cell models annotated 53 candidate genes at 22-HDC regions. Targets were enriched established from the COSMIC Cancer Census, but had no reported pleiotropic roles. LncRNAs were pinpointed as HDC targets and risk in several regions altered transcription motifs, suggesting mechanisms. Known targets were overrepresented among candidate-HDC genes, implying may serve for development or repurposing existing treatments.
A genome-wide association study of 33 cases and 106 controls in the Kiker dog breed indicated involvement of a region on chromosome C19 with a p-value of 4.7*10−10. Haplotype analysis showed cases shared a 2.9 Mb region in the homozygous or heterozygous state. Next-generation sequencing implicated a 39 kb deletion 10 kb upstream of interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. The frequency of the deletion was 0.81 in cases and 0.25 in a random Kiker breed sample. Leukocytes of affected dogs homozygous for the deletion overexpressed IL and IL upon mitogen stimulation. The study suggests elements 10-49 upstream IL21 play a role in regulation and deletion is a risk factor for polymyitis in Kiker dogs. Postulated penetrance of the disease was 10-20 for homozygous and 0.5-2 for heterozygous. Results suggest distant upstream IL variants may be important in human autoimmune diseases associated with the IL2 region. Follow-up experiments should fine-map elements in the 39 fragment involved in IL expression. Genome association studies established a role of IL2 in human diseases RA, SLE, type 1 DM, and SS. No variants have been identified instrumental in risk. Our results indicate variants may be at distance at least 10 upstream IL. The study demonstrates involvement of IL in polymyitis in Kiker, but responsible element and function are yet to be discovered. PCR to genotype the deletion provides a tool for breeders to prevent high-risk dogs and reduce incidence.
Researchers have developed a protein language model, ESMm, to predict protein stability using a large-scale dataset of 528 natural and de novo sequences from 461 domains, accommodating deletions, insertions, and multiple mutations. They fine-tuned ESM on the folding of small domains and showed it generalizes to sequences distant from the training set, demonstrating the potential for transfer learning to reduce experimental burden. The model's performance on larger proteins lags behind state-of-the-art, highlighting the need for a larger stability dataset mirroring the distribution of sequence lengths in nature. A mega-stability dataset of 776k sequences from 479 domains was used to fine-tune a language model, p, ESM, from E-2, as an end-to-end stability predictor. ESM performs comparably to state-the models and generalizes to small sequences. Training on an ensemble of domains improves performance for folding prediction. The model generalizes well to small domains but is weaker on larger proteins, suggesting a bias towards shorter sequences. A large-scale dataset of longer sequences is needed to improve generalizability.
Researchers investigated the role of inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (iIR) in type 1 diabetes (T1), an autoimmune disease characterized by insulin deficiency due to the destruction of insulin-producing islet cells. They hypothesized that iIR might modulate CD4 T cell responses, which play a major role in T1 etiopathogenesis. To test this, they conducted an immunogenetic analysis of a large case-control T dataset (N=11,961) and found that iIR genes, in the presence of genes encoding their ligands, had a significant and consistent effect on HLA class II genetic associations. The effect was driven by iIR-lig pairs rather than H ligands alone, which were associated with T. The results were validated in an independent dataset. iIR had no impact on detrimental H class associations. The study suggests that iIR regulate CD4 T responses in T1.
Fuchs endothelial corne dystrophy (FE) is the most common expansion-mediated disease in humans, with up to 80% of European cases attributed to a non-coding CTG repeat expansion, CT18.1, within the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor encoding gene, T4. The nonoding nature of the repeat and transcript complexity of T4 have made it challenging to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying disease. This study comprehensively describes CT18.1-driven molecular components of disease within primary-derived corneal endothelial cells (ECs) from a large cohort of individuals with CT18-expanded (+) and CT18-independent (-) FE. Employing long-read, short, and transcriptomic techniques, interrogation of expansion-specific transcript biomarkers, long-read sequencing and alternative splicing of short transcript data reveal global altered splicing within FE and transcripts associated with CT18 expansions. Differential expression highlights transcript consequences of FE within ECs. Exon usage, pathway, and transcriptomics reveal T4 isoform skewing in FE with potential consequences. Exome data from 134 FE cases identified rare, potentially deleterious T4 variants in 7/134 FE, suggesting T4 variants independently of CT18 may increase FE risk. This study supports two pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and T4 iso-specific dysregulation, underpinning FE pathophysiology.
Researchers investigated the genetic basis of low-temperature germination (LT) in rice, a crucial trait for direct seeding in cold climates. They identified the quantitative trait locus (QTL) qG11 from variety Arroz Terra, which shows rapid germination at lower temperatures, using QTL-seq. The candidate region was delineated to a 52-kb interval containing GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14 (GFh) gene, expressed during seed germination. The Arroz Terra GFh allele encodes functional GFh, whereas Japanese variety Hitb harbors a 4-bp deletion in the coding region. Knocking out GFh in a near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying Ar Terra decreased LT, whereas overexpressing GFh in Hitb increased LT, indicating GFh is the causal behind qG. Analysis of Japanese accessions revealed the functionalh allele was lost in popular varieties during breeding. A NIL in Hitb background carrying a 172b fragment from Ar Terra including GFh showed superior LT compared to Hitb, with comparable agronomic traits. The GFh from Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.
Hepatitis B virus (HB) relaxed circular (rc) DNA possesses an 8-9 nucleotide-long terminal redundancy (TR) on the negative strand derived from the reverse transcription of pregenomic (pg) RNA. It is unclear whether TR forms a 5' or 3' flap on HBrc and which copy is removed during covalently circular (cc) formation. To address this, a HB cell line Hep-C182G was established with C2G mutation in pg sequence altering 3' TR while 5 remained wild type. Production HBrc and ccc in Hep-CG was comparable to wild type levels. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis revealed positive strand ofrc and both ccc predominantly carried wt residue, indicating 5 TR serves as template during replication forming duplex with strand while 3 forms a flap-like structure removed duringcc. A survey of cellular endonucleases using loss-of-function study found 3 endonuc Mus plays a role incc in wild HB replicating cells alongside 5 enduc F1. The function between Mus and F1 indicates putative 5 and 3 formed by TR are interchangeable onrc precursor. These findings shed light on HBrc structure andcc mechanisms contributing to understanding HB replication.

A study introduced mutations into 5 terminus DHBrc and analysis revealed high frequency the strand used mutated 5 TR as template and 5 TR was largely replaced in ccc. However, the findings may not apply to HB due to different sequences and host background. HB relies on DNA machinery to convertrc intocc and studies have identified factors and intermediates involved incc biosynthesis. Aproinatedrc (DP) species has been identified as duringcc formation and analyses revealed both TR remain intact indicating removal occurs after import into nucleus. Understanding mechanisms is essential for antiv therapeutics to cure hepatitis Unlike chromosomal and viruses with double-stranded genomes, HBcc does not undergo semi-conservative but converted from rc during novo and intracellular pathway.

To investigate TR selection in HBrc andcc, a point mutation was introduced into 3 TR. The rationale mutating 3 instead of 5 is that latter requires priming site 5 epsilon on pg, important for initiation. A study mutating 5 DHB resulted in level aberrant priming and reduction. Based on HBrc biosynthesis, a mutation was designed downstream pg transcription site. The mutation at 5 end pg will be transcribed in 3 TR while 5 maintains wt. The mutation was introduced plid pREHBDES and established Hep-based tetr line Hep-C as described. Compared to prototype Hep, Hep-C exhibited levels cytoplasmic replication and production upon induction. 3 R and sequencing confirmed mutation 3 TR produced Hep-C. The completion HB synthesis is accompanied degradation pg catalyzed Pol RNase, and 5 DR-containing remnant serves to initiate synthesis after annealing DR, and strand elongates to TR region.
Researchers developed a microbe-micro interaction genome metabolic model (mmEM) to study microbial communities in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) treating sulfide wastewater from a cannedine factory. The model, based on functional lumped compartmental design, simulated microbial interactions among three major guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SR), methanogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SO). Findings revealed a shift from SO-domin to METomin community as organic loading rates (OLR) increased, with MFC performance decline. The mmEM accurately predicted microbial abundance at low OL and high OL. Simulations showed SO growth constraints under high OL due to reduced sulfate-sulf cycling and acetate crossfeeding with SR. More metabolites from SR were diverted to MET, facilitating dominance. Assessing crossfeeding under OL enabled scenario-based simulations to explore impact of acidity on SO growth and M performance. This work highlights metabolic crossfeeding's role in shaping community response to OL. Insights will inform effective M technology implementation in industrial environments.

The performance of MFC treating sulfide-rich wastewater from cannedine factory was influenced by microbial composition and activity. A microbe-micro interaction-scale model (mm) was developed to study complex interactions in M system. The model simulated microbial transition from SO-domin to METomin during increasing OL conditions, revealing crossfeeding mechanisms. The function-based model responded to dynamic substrate conditions and captured microbial interactions, providing insights into ecosystem and manipulative strategy for improving performance. This approach balances computational feasibility and realistic representation with minimal data. Unlike species-level or synthetic communities, this study offers a practical alternative for complex systems.

The performance of M system declined as OL increased during high-production seasons. A genome model of micro-micro interactions (mm) was developed to comprehensively study associations in M ecosystem, focusing on adaptation to OL. The mm was designed based on functionally lumped compartmental structure, extending microbial and environmental coverage while maintaining model effort. Each metabolic function in M is driven by a cohort, not single species. A microbial in mm conceptually incorporated multiple species, as functional representative. This allowed mm to simulate underlying phenomenon based on aggregated metabolism while accounting proportion species and condition.

The model simulated interactions among SR, MET, and SO, driven by metabolic characteristics and wastewater profile. As M transitioned to high OL, substrate composition changed, disrupting equilibrium uptake and secretion among groups. This influenced community by growth-dependent substrate availability and competitive conditions. The mm comprised four compartments: SR, MET, SO, and common pool (COM). The model contained 3,535 reactions, 3,369 metabolites, and 2,366 genes. Groups exchanged substrates and metabolites within COM. SR had most exchangeable metabolites, followed by SO and MET. A diagram presents common metabolites exchanged between groups, crossfeeding.

This highlights cross's role in shaping composition and performance under OL. Functional lumped compartmental modeling facilitated comprehensive study of dynamic interactions within communities, enhancing understanding and optimization for biotechn applications. The transition from SO-domin to METomin can be attributed interactions. Various crossfeeding mechanisms were observed, including SR-SO deterioration, cycling, and acetate crossfeeding. Efficient acet consumption by MET led changes in composition and structure, impacting performance. A strategy to enhance performance by sustaining SO under OL was proposed. Increasing proton in M environment simulated SO growth, ATP, SR-SO interactions, and performance.
Machine learning (ML) plays a crucial role in generating biological hypotheses for downstream analyses and facilitating discoveries in various applications. However, a significant challenge in ML-assisted biological discoveries is the development of models with interpretable uncertainty quantification of predictions. When applied to unseen situations, ML models without uncertainty quantification are susceptible to overconfident predictions, misdirecting experimental efforts and resources to validation of false hypotheses. Addressing this becomes essential to ensure efficiency and reliability of ML-assisted discovery. This work presents CPEC, an ML framework enabling F-controlled ML-assisted discoveries. Leveraging conformal prediction, C allows users to specify desired FDR tolerance, tailored to experiment goals and budget, making predictions with controlled F. C demonstrates effectiveness using enzyme annotation as case, simulating discovery of functions less-characterized enzymes. C integrates deep model with conform prediction, providing accurate and F-controlled predictions for given enzyme. Conform prediction provides statistical guarantees to model, ensuring expected F will not exceed user-specified level with high probability. Evaluation shows C achieves reliable F control, better or comparable performance at F than existing methods, accurate for enzymes underrepresented in training. C is expected to be a tool for discovery where high yield in experiments is desired but budget limited.

 CPEC, Conform Prediction of EC, achieves F-controlled enzyme prediction by leveraging conformal framework. C receives sequence or structure as input and outputs set functions EC that enzyme potentially has. Unique is that averaged-protein F can be controlled by user-specified hyperparameter. Conform guarantees F of per-protein is larger with high. This provides foresight, success estimates before validation. In ML-guided protein discovery, can specify F level based on budget or expectations. For example, setting smaller when most confident needed or budget limited, or larger when discover novel and F and budget acceptable. C base model is Pen2, improved for multi-label function problem, using graph network to integrate structure and language embeddings learn-aware representations. Benchmarked, C outperformed existing learning for function. Demonstrated C provides guarantees F and trade-off between precision and recall by tuning desired value.
Researchers investigated the role of heat shock protein 90 (HSP-90) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using a Caenorhabditis elegans model of mutant TDP-43 proteinopathy. They found that loss of function of HSP-90 protects against T-43 neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration in adult animals, accompanied by a decrease in both total and phosphorylated T-43 protein. H-90 modulates proteostasis by sequesting heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), preventing its turnover, and protecting newly synthesized proteins from degradation. Under stress conditions, H-90 dissociates from HSF-1 to activate the heat response, including upregulation of H-70 and H-16.1. The researchers also found that H-90 mutation or inhibition upregulates key responsive heat shock gene expression, including H-70 and H-16.1, and that normal levels of H-16 are required for H-90 effects on T-43. The neuroprotective effect of H-90 does not involve regulation of proteas activity in C. elegans. The study demonstrates for the first time that H- chaperone activity contributes to outcomes in T- proteinopathies in vivo using a whole animal model of ALS.
Researchers created a comprehensive atlas of the adult Artemia franciscana female reproductive system using single-nucle RNA and AT sequencing, mapping their data to the Cell Atlas of the Drosila melanogaster ovary. They identified major cell types, including germ, follicle, and muscle cells, and explored the regulation of the Z chromosome during meiosis, highlighting unique dynamics and the presence of meiotic sex chromosome silencing in this group. The study used single nucleus sequencing to resolve the complexity of the Artemia ovary, identifying clusters with distinct expression patterns sharing homology with Drosila ovarian clusters, suggesting conserved programs for cellular identity and function. Ovar muscle cells showed the highest conservation, with previous studies showing similarity in ortholog gene expression across vertebrate and invertebrate species. Two clusters mapped to trache and follicle cells in Dila, essential for trache system and oogenesis, respectively. Germ cells showed high conservation between species. The study addressed questions of dosage compensation in germl cells and Z-chromosome inactivation during oogenesis in Artemia, an aquatic arthrop with a pair of differentiated Z sex chromosomes. They used single cell RNA and AT-seq to explore expression and chromatin changes during oogenesis, observing a decrease in AT counts and RNA in the germ cluster, supporting prophase arrest. The study identified a cluster mapping to late germl in Dila, including nurse cells, in line with expression patterns.
Chronic pain is a widespread condition that is debilitating and expensive to manage, costing the United States around $600 billion in 2010. A common symptom of chronic pain called allodynia, non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with variable presentations across individuals. The specific mechanisms remain unclear, allody is hypothesized to be caused by dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E) balance in pain-processing circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This work analyzes biophys-motcircuit structures that represent motifs in neural in laminae-II of the horn. These are hypothesized to be part of pathways mediating two types allody: static and dynamic. Neural rate models describe activity of populations excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within subcircuits. Accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy, model parameters defining populations subcircuits yield behavior normal. Sensitivity analysis identifies mechanisms likely cause allody-producing dysreg of subcirc's E signaling. Disruption of E balance occurs due downregulation inhibitory or upregulation excitatory responses. Which mechanism, subc components involved, proportion subcirc exhibiting vary on substructure. Results suggest diverse mechanisms responsible for allody, offering predictions variability observed and targets for experimental studies underlying this chronic symptom.

A methodology is introduced for neural model circuits determining parameter values account experimental and identifying sensitivities behaviors to variations. The involves steps can be applied to any circuit populations, although implementation is more tractable feedforward with small populations. The may be useful analyzing signaling and E balance other sensory circuits feed structure. Understanding chronic conditions, such allody require underlying causes.

Researchers investigated the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and its cochaperones in the folding and translation of elongation factor 2 (EF2), a crucial for protein homeostasis. They found that Hsp and cochones have distinct roles in regulating EF2 function, with H1, C7, and C1 cochones essential for EF folding and sensitivity to diphia toxin dependent on St1 cochone. Yeast expressing H90 mutants or cochone mutations had reduced EF levels, with H90 mutants affecting EF accumulation also impacted by H1 deletion. EF mutations mimicking human disease-associated mutations were negatively impacted by H1 loss, but partially rescued by H1 overexpression. In contrast, yeast with different H90 or cochone mutations had altered sensitivity to diphia, a post-translational modification on EF2. The study suggests H90 contributes to homeostasis not only by assisting protein folding but also enabling translation of newly synthesized proteins. Additionally, results indicate yeast H90 mutants have distinct in vivo effects correlating with defects in subsets of cochones. H1 was identified as a protein bridging EF interaction with H90 or TRC chaperone systems, and its deletion impacted EF folding and solubility. The study used a system where EF was expressed under a constitutive promoter to examine the impact of H90 mutations on soluble EF levels. Deletion of H1, C7, or C1 resulted in lower EF bound to nickel resin and lower EF in lysates, indicating insolubility or misfolding and degradation. In contrast, EF was not affected by deletion of D2, required for dthamide modification. The study monitored EF folding and sensitivity to diph, suggesting H and cochones have distinct roles in mediating EF function. Folding is dependent on H, C, and sensitive to H mutants, while sensitivity to diph dependent St and sensitive to mutations. The results demonstrate H90 role varies as a client progresses to functional state.
Researchers investigated how individuals with lesions in the insula or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, regions involved in decision-making, made choices in social and non-social contexts. Participants played a gambling task where choices were made alone and after observing others' choices. Both groups showed disrupted utility-based computations for risky options in social decisions, but increased conformity with others' choices independent of utility. This suggests that in social contexts, others' choices may be a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based processing is disrupted. The insula and dACC have been implicated in decision-making about risky options in non-social contexts via lesion, neuroimaging, and electrophysiology studies. Individuals with focal insula (N=10) or dACC (N=6) lesions and non-lesioned controls (NC; N=28) made choices between gambles alone and after observing others' choices. Trials comprised four types: Solo, Info-safe, Info-risky, and Info-mix, where social choices were safer, riskier, or mixed. Results showed that individuals with ins or dACC lesions exhibited disrupted utility-based risk and used social information to guide decisions. This suggests conformity can serve as an alternative to utility-based processing in social decision-making when risk is impaired. The findings have implications for suboptimal decision-making in neurodevelopment, neurological disorders, and psychiatric conditions characterized by altered decision-making. Disrupted utility-based processing may play a role in the influence of others in adolescent decision-making and substance misuse. The study suggests avenues for addressing maladaptive decision-making, such as enhancing or changing group composition.
This study explores the concept of biomorphs, a model of morphological evolution, to demonstrate the power of natural selection in generating order from random mutations. It shows that biomorphs can also illustrate developmental bias in adaptive outcomes, where certain phenotypes are orders of magnitude more likely to appear through mutations. This bias exhibits a preference for simpler phenotypes with lower complexity, formalized by an information-theoretic principle. Using population simulations, moderately adaptive phenotypic variation appears more frequently through random mutations at the expense of highly adaptive biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent. This result and other patterns in biomorph structure, such as high mutational robustness and positive correlation between evolvability and robustness, resemble molecular-phenotype maps. These patterns can be explained by an analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained sections of the genome. The study postulates that bias towards simplicity and other biomorph patterns with molecular-phen maps may hold widely for developmental systems.

 The study shows that phenotyp bias influences adaptive evolution when phenotypes convey advantage, more frequent and simpler phenotypes are likely to evolve. This is not contradictory to complexity increasing over time, as natural selection may favor complex phenotypes and there are more phenotypes with higher complexity than lower. The probability of a phenotype appearing through mutations is higher if complexity is lower, but the probability of generating a phenotype of complexity may peak at higher due to more possible phenotypes with higher complexity. The question of simplicity interacting with morphological complexity over time needs further study.

 In the absence of selection, phenotyp frequencies are reflected in rates of biomorph appearance in evolving populations. A scenario with variation and selection shows more frequent phenotypes fix even if not fittest. A study from Dawkins' book finds hard to reconstruct an evolutionary pathway to 'insect-aped' phenotype, arguing rare phenotypes while paths exist, are a fraction of larger set, hard to find. The study illustrates shortest paths and neutral mutations make fewer phenotyp changes, easier to create fitness leading to monotonically increasing paths.

 The biomorph map exhibits simplicity and other patterns similar to molecular-phen maps, such as high mutational robustness and positive correlation between evolv and robust. These can be rationalized by a model separating genotypes into constrained and unconstrained. The study aims to analyze generation of phenotyp variation systematically and test hypothesis that biomorph also exhibits simplicity and patterns molecularphen. The biom map is analyzed by coarse-graining onto a 30x30 grid, showing frequency-complexity relationship consistent with simplicity. Other properties resemble molecularphen maps, such as phenotype robustness and evolvability.
Researchers investigated human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems by having participants interact with a virtual double pendulum through a haptic joystick. Three experiments were conducted with different pendulum configurations (P0°, 45°, 90°) and targets either aligned or offset from the nonlinear modes (N) of the system. Participants intuitively applied a control strategy to excite and stabilize motions close to the N, even when targets were not aligned. In Experiment 3, participants achieved a hit rate of 85% despite targets not coinciding with N, and oscillated at 0.81±0.02 Hz, not significantly different from the N eigenfrequency of 0.82 Hz. The mode of participants' strategy was closer to N than baseline strategies. The mode increased slightly for all configurations, indicating motions remained close to the N path. Frequencies were slightly lower than predicted, and hit rates decreased with more error compared to Experiment 1. To understand the lowered frequency, hand-joystick interaction was considered, assuming wrist stiffness altered the system. Recalculating N with decreased stiffness showed no difference to frequencies. The study extends existing research on human resonance sensitivity to nonlinear systems, emphasizing capabilities to control and exploit resonant motions in dynamic interactions.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, transcriptional regulation plays a crucial role in responding to environmental cues during the transition from exponential to stationary phase. A group of transcription factors called transition regulators (TSRs) control developmental processes such as biofilm formation, motility, genetic competence, and sporulation. Two TSRs, Sco and Abr, along with the Mar-family factor PR, negatively regulate the production of the iron chelator pulerrin in B. subtilis. Genetic analysis shows that all three factors are necessary to limit pulerr production during exponential phase and influence the rate and amount of pulerr produced. Expression of the pulerr biosynthesis gene yC is under the control of Sco, Abr, and PR and correlated with the amount of pulerr produced. In vitro data indicate a direct role for Sco in controlling pulerr production with Abr and PR. The regulation by two distinct systems underscores the importance of pulerr in B. subtilis physiology.

TSRs, originally identified in sporulation, are regulators that inhibit genes involved in developmental processes but do not result in sporulation mutation when deleted. Sco and Abr are well-stud TSRs in B. subil. Sco is a Mar-family winged helix-helix transcription factor first identified in hyperproase mutants. Array analysis between WT and Sco mutants identified 560 genes with differential expression in motility and competence as well as protease and peptide transport. Abr is a 10.8 kDa part of a family with beta-alpha DNA N-terminal domain. Mutants have pleiotropic and some overlap with Sco. IP-q analysis of Abr identified many sites with bipart TNA motif.

Pulerr is a secreted chelating molecule researched in B. subis and microorganisms. This study uncovers layered regulation of pulerr by discrete systems. The systems work together to inhibit biosynthesis of energetically costly and growth limiting metabolite. Expression of yC promoter resembles the pattern of pulerr production, but in Sco and Abr backgrounds display broad distributions, suggesting TSR influence in pulerr producing cells. Only absence of three factors is yC expression achieved and pulerr is produced throughout exponential. Biochemical shows regulators of pul biosynthetic operon and state regulators Sco and Abr bind yC differing off-rates.
Researchers developed a mathematical model of the neural circuits controlling mictition after spinal cord injury (SCI) and the effects of transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the spinal cord as a therapeutic intervention to alleviate bladder dysfunction after SCI. The model was based on a state-of-the-art model capturing normal storage/void functions under healthy conditions and disorders of the bladder after SCI, such as detrusor-sphinct dyssynergia and overactivity of the bladder. The effect of T on the spinal cord was modeled at single-cell based on experimental findings from patch-clamp and extracellular recordings. The model revealed mechanisms underlying amelioration of detor-sinct dyssynerg by T and low-frequency T was effective for this purpose. Insights from modeling illustrate an integrated systems approach understanding of dysfunction essential to determine neuronal basis of effects of SCI for rehabilitation and neuromodulation to ameliorate neurological disorders after SCI. The model replicated re-emergence of spinal void reflex after SCI and improved coordination between detor and urethral sphinct activity observed clinically with low-frequency T (1 Hz) and high-frequency (30 Hz) T enhanced urine storage. Neuroplasticity and complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons were necessary to replicate effects of SCI on miction and network modifications lumbar interneurons essential to understand mechanisms of T reduced bladder dysfunction after SCI. A framework for model-based analysis of neural circuits controlling miction after SCI and effects of T on spinal as therapeutic to alleviate bladder dysfunction after SCI was developed. A model of neural circuits was built on state-of-art to capture normal/void functions under healthy and disorders of bladder SCI. The effect of T on spinal was modeled single based on experimental from patchamp and extracellular recordings. The effect T at network analyzed through simulations revealed mechanisms underlying amelation det-sinct dyssy by T and low-frequency T effective.
Researchers have proposed a mathematical model to estimate fungal growth rates from indirect optical density (OD) data without the need for calibration, making it accessible to microbiology laboratories that collect OD data. The model treats OD as an observed variable distributed around a linear transformation of true fungal concentration, explicitly including calibration in the structure. The model was demonstrated to fit and predict OD time-course data for Aspergillus fumatus, a filamentous fungus, and estimated morphology-specific growth using measured data. The model outperformed reference non-parametric models in fitting and predicting OD curves, overcoming discrepancies between morphology-specific rates inferred from OD versus directly measured data. The model was used to infer hyal growth from indirect OD data and hyal extension and growth from direct measures. The estimated rates were closer to those from direct measures compared to a logistic model without calibration. A parametric models are preferred for growth and rate estimation due to explicit growth parameter, increased interpretability, and inclusion of known mechanisms. The model can be used as a foundation for investigating antifungal action using OD data by inferring growth rates in varying concentrations.
Beetles are the most species-rich group of animals, with over 400,000 described taxa, and harbor diverse karyotypes. Most species have XY chromosomes, but X0 sex determination is common in some groups. A whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confus, with a neo-sex chromosome, was generated, and eleven beetle genomes were used to reconstruct kary evolution across Coleoptera. Ancestral groups, termed Muller elements, share conserved genes across beet. The ancestral X chromosome is conserved across beet, but autosomes are added to the sex chromosomes independently. Neo-sex evolve stereotypical properties, including dosage compensation and non-random gene distribution with sex-bi expression. Beet provide a model to understand diverse forces driving sex evolution.

A phylogenetic sampling of beet suggests they are a model to study kary evolution and evolutionary forces on chromosomes. Ancestral groups are maintained across beet, allowing kary evolution study at molecular level. The X is conserved in Coleoptera, but multiple neo-chromosomes formed among closely related beet. Abundance of beet and genomic tools make Cole a valuable system to study mechanisms and forces driving sex differentiation across taxa. A chromosome assembly for Tribium confus and assemblies from eleven species were used to reconstruct sex and kary evolution in beet. RNA-seq data from tissues explored changes on neo-chromosomes in T. confus and Dendctonus ponderae, allowing evolutionary trajectory of sex in beet.
This study investigated the role of histone variant H2 Z in gene regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during DNA replication stress. H2 Z is an evolutionarily conserved histone variant that is incorporated into chromatin by the SW1 complex, a chrom-ATP dependent chrom-remodel. While H Z has been implicated in various biological functions, its role in gene regulation has remained unclear. The study found that H Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than repression during DNA replication stress, and its incorporation was necessary for proper expression of several induced genes. The SW1 complex contributed to gene defects in the Z mutant, particularly for genes involved in phosphate homeostasis. Decreases in Z enrichment at transcription start sites correlated with, but were not required for, increased expression of activated genes. The study highlights the importance of accounting for confounding effects of SW1 and examining gene expression during induction to effectively examine Z's role in regulation.
The article discusses the challenge of classifying single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) data into various cell types and identifying lineage relationships using transcriptomic profiles obtained from scRNA experiments. Due to the accumulation of large datasets and high dimensionality of data, manual annotation of single-cell transcript profiles is challenging. To overcome this, automated methods are needed. Classical approaches rely on supervised training datasets, but obtaining annotated single-cell resolution data is difficult. The authors propose partial learning framework, which assumes a set of candidate labels for each data point, a simpler setting than fully supervised. They extend state-of-the-art multi-classification methods, such as SVM, kNN, prototype, logistic regression, and ensemble methods to partial learning. They study the effect of incorporating label structure into methods, focusing on hierarchical labels observed in developmental processes. On simulated and real datasets, these extensions enable learning from partially labeled data with high accuracy, particularly a prototype-based method. Performances with partially annotated data reach fully supervised. The authors study uncertainty in partially annotated data and derive prescriptive results on effect on accuracy. Hierarchical and non-hierarchical label strategies help automated single-cell transcriptomic classification, relying less stringent annotated datasets than fully learning.

The authors propose partial learning for single-cell transcriptomics annotation, taking advantage of candidate labels. The idea consists of multiclass classification with a set labels per sample, one correct. Applications include cases with expert knowledge marker genes, C. elegans, and reference atlases providing candidate labels not single resolution. They establish partial learning for single-cell annotation, comparing implementations in simulated and experimental data. Focus on hierarchical labels in developing systems. The approach reduces annotation time by considering candidate labels per sample. Automated cell classification is relevant in era transcript data generated, quality annotation bottleneck. The authors suggest combining studies atlases using classification results as partial annotation. Tissue information can use cell types as labels.

The authors propose several classification methods for partially labeled scRNA data, describing algorithms. They evaluate performance on simulated and experimental datasets. The Prototype-Based Network (PBn) achieves high accuracy in fully supervised and partially settings. Incorporating labeled samples improves performance on supervised. Uncertainty in partially data affects performance. Hierarchical information increases in partial settings, especially low samples. Results show multiclass with accuracy partially labeled can be transcriptomic lie low manifold. The highest performing classifier is nonlinear-Based method, relationship cell identity position feature space not linear.
Researchers investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (P2) in the formation of nuclear compartments such as speckles, nucleoli, and nuclear lipidlets. They found that P2 is involved in RNA polymerase II transcription and its localization is dependent on the presence of higher-order RNA. Using mass spectrometry, they identified the RNA-dependent P2-associated (RD) proteome in human cells and found that intrinsically disordered regions (ID) with basic P2-binding motifs are prevalent in RD proteins. These ID of RD proteins exhibit phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites. The study showed that bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BR4) associates with P2 in an RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions and altered P2 levels affect the number of BR4 foci. They propose that P orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RD proteins and affects their ability to form foci via phase separation, suggesting a pivotal role in establishing a functional nuclear architecture for gene expression.
This study investigates the evolutionary basis of phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles, specifically the Scarabinae clade, through comparative genomics and developmental assays. The authors present chromosome-level genome assemblies of three dung beetle species, Onophagus taurus, O. sagarius, and Digitophagusella, and compare them to seven other Coleoptera species, identifying changes in coding and non-coding sequences associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis. Chromatin accessibility in developing horn tissues of high and low-nutrition O. taurus males and females reveals distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition and sex-responsive development, with a large proportion of recently evolved regulatory elements sensitive to horn determination. The study highlights the importance of chromatin regulation in mediating development and evolution of plastic traits, demonstrating gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals. 

 The authors identify biological pathways involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, juvenile hormone production, and embryonic transcription, motivating hypotheses for nutrition-responsive development in dung beetles. An in-depth genomic and developmental analysis of horns, secondary sexual weapons with extreme inter and intraspecific variation, suggests alternative forms of intras horn variation are instructed by regulatory architectures, corroborated by distinct sex and nutrition-responsive head OCRs and a disproportionate OCRs only in the O. taurus genome. Whole-genome alignments and comparative assays with other beetle genomes identify sequence changes associated with adaptations to dung ecology and evolution. The study provides reference genomes for three species, bolstering future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies of this group.
Researchers used a cynomolg monkey model to study the pathogenesis of Lassa fever, a viral disease caused by Lassa virus (LASV). They investigated the dynamics of LASV infection and immune responses associated with survival or death. The study found that lymphoid organs are early reservoirs for LASV replication, with the virus entering the cortical sinus of lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, viral tropism varies with disease severity, with limited dissemination to lymphoid and immune cells in non-fatal Lassa, and systemic dissemination to all organs and diverse cell types leading to fatal outcome. The results provide insight into early viral dynamics and host response to LAS infection according to disease. 

The study characterized the dynamics and tropism of two LASV strains in animals to shed light on pathogenesis and immune associated outcomes. Lymph nodes are first targeted by LAS after initial replication at inoculation site, with infected cells detected in subcortical sinus close to inoculation at 2 DPI. The virus replicates in lymph, MLNs, GALT, thymus, and spleen, confirming lymphoid organs major reservoir for LAS replication. Differences in tropism observed between strains, with macrophages infected by AV and stromal cells and neutils by Josiah. From 5 DPI, tropism differed, with Josiah disseminating to all organs, replicating in non-imm cells, strom, endothelial, and epithelial cells, while AV limited to few organs, liver, adrenal, and capillaries in brain. 

The study used cynolg monkey model reproduces different outcomes of Lassa observed in humans, with Jos and AV strains leading to fatal and non-severe disease, respectively. The results suggest T-cell activation non-specific and bystander T cells contribute to disease, previously observed in fatal infections. Limitations include subaneous route used, not natural infection via respiratory tract, and AV isolated from single patient showing fatal in humans. The study shows lymphoid organs early reservoir for LAS replication, cell tropism, dissemination, and immune infiltration differ between outcomes.
Researchers investigated the role of Importin-β in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontal dementia, and temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). They found that mutations in the Nuclear Export Mediator (NEM) gene result in Import-β-specific import defects, cytoplasmic protein mislocalization, and recapitulate phenotypic and transcriptional alterations in neurode disorders. Import-β is a nuclear receptor that mediates the transport of proteins and RNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex. The study used two mouse models, NemR86 and NemRGS, that recapitulate cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases and found Import-β-specific import block. They observed cytoplasm mislocalization and aggregation of proteins implicated in pathogenesis of ALS/AD, including TDP, Importβ, Ran1, and Ran. These findings were supported by a pathological interaction between Importβ and mutant NemR in cytoplasm accumulations. The study identified transcriptional dysregulation in genes associated with neurode disease and showed that transient inhibition of Import in mouse and human neuronal non-neuronal cells induced proteinies and transcriptional alterations seen in neurode. The results provide evidence that mislocalized and dysregulated events in multiple neurode diseases may arise from a primary defect in Importβ import. This has implications for investigating sporadic neurode forms from unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations in Importβ function.
Researchers have developed a new approach to study the mechanisms of bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria, by using CRISPR-Cas, a tool for precise genome editing. However, phages can resist CRIS-Cas by modifying their DNA with cytosine glycosylation, hindering mutagen efficiency. To overcome this, they used the enzyme NgET to temporarily reduce ph DNA modifications, enabling Cas cleavage and mutagenesis. This approach allows precise targeting and seamless mutation, exemplified by deactivating AD-ribosyltransferases crucial for ph infection. Temporarily removing modifications also elucidated the effects on T4 phage infections without gene deletions. The study presents a strategy for investigating phage epigen functions and streamlining ph with cytosine DNA modifications. Modulating the ph epigenome is valuable for synthetic biology and understanding ph infection mechanisms through mutants generation. CRIS-Cas has emerged as a valuable tool for genome engineering, but its effectiveness in ph engineering has been limited by DNA modifications. Cas-mediated targeting and double-strand breaks are prevented by modifications. The study circumvents limitations and presents a novel approach for precise ph mutagenesis based on reducing ph modifications, enhancing DNA accessibility for nucleases and mutagen efficiency. The treatment with NgET resulted in increased ph targeting and mutagen efficiency. The approach enables investigation of ph epigen functions and streamlining ph with cytos DNA, valuable for synthetic biology and understanding ph mechanisms.
The genome of living cells is constantly challenged by DNA lesions that interfere with cellular processes such as transcription and replication. A manifold mechanisms act in concert to ensure DNA repair, expression, and genome stability. Bulky DNA lesions, such as those induced by UV or DNA-damaging 4-nitquinoline, act transcription and replicational roadblocks and represent a threat to cell metabolism. When on transcribed of active genes, these lesions are handled by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision (TCER), a incompletely understood ER-path. Using a genetic screen in yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, identified histone H2 as an important to transcription and DNA integrity following irradiation. The absence of H, repair TCER is severely impaired and RNAase II reduced, leading to increase in double-strand breaks. Thus, is needed for TCER and plays a role in maintenance genome upon irradiation.

 Histone variant H was identified as new in TCER. Results support role in regulation RN I occupancy and TCER efficiency upon irradiation. Defective to damage leads sustained Ds and genome in cells. is the histone that conserved from yeast to human, while essential proper mammalian, not in yeast except conditions requiring transcriptional activation. Previous linked to DNA checkpoint, D repair, segregation, D-free resolution, and GGER in H-bearing nucleosomes at repressed. Participation in D seems conserved higher eukary, mechanisms underlying function remain unresolved. The H histone variant not linked TCER, to knowledge report H-containing located inactive with GGER. Increased at repressed M2 and relied on G-mediated histone acetylation and RadER factor. Not, function not at silent locus H normally present, pre-existing H-containing favor repressed loci. CP repair on constitutive R gene, enriched H nucleosomes revealed weak delay and strong defect in cells.
Researchers analyzed gene expression in the midgut, hindut, and Malpian tub as well as microbiome in the gut of two tissues in Drosoph melanogaster and their F hybrids from two divergent populations: one from the European range and one from the African range. Both transcript and microbiome data showed tissue and genetic-specific effects, with genetic effects on overall tissue specificity. Tissue effects were stronger than genetic effects, although the gut were more similar to each other than the Malian tub. Examination of allele expression revealed that both cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific in expressed between populations than conserved genes, trans effects were more tissue than cis. Despite variable architecture, this was robust across tissues and genetic, suggesting expression trans variation can be fine-tuned as or better than cis during divergence. Using transcript data from parental and F hybrid D melanog strains from ancestral and African in midut, hind, and Malian tub, found genetic and mode of expression highly tissue and background-specific. Previous studies using F hybrids found genetic and body or part have large effects; however, this is the first examining functionally proximate tissues. Results demonstrate even related tissues show divergent architecture among and genetic. Overall expression was similar the Malian tub and midut, despite being part excret and digestive, while gut part alimentary. Similar fold differences in proportion cis-regulated in hindut versus Malian tub or midut as reported test versus heads or ovaries. Findings yield evolution regulatory, effects tissue specificity, genetic expression, microbiome, and importance contextuality in studies.
Researchers used a population dynamics approach to estimate the date of the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. They validated their model on simulated data and applied it to Alpha variant infections in the UK, estimating the first infection at August 21, 2020 (95% interquartile range: July 23-September 5, 2020). The model was then applied to COVID-19 cases with symptom onset before January 2020, dating the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan at November 28, 2019 (95%IR: November 2-December 9, 201). Results fell within previously estimated ranges by genomic studies. The approach is generic and flexible, applicable to other contexts than COVID-19. The study contributes to the literature with estimates of the date of infection of early COVID-19 cases and SARS-CoV-2 variant. Results are compatible with previous studies using genomic data, suggesting widespread SARS-CoV-2 circulation and international spread earlier than end 2019 is unlikely. The model relies on population-level data, not genomic, and does not replace other approaches. It has limitations, including dependence on input data quality, estimates of key epidemiological indicators, and assumption of sustained epidemic ongoing. The model does not deal with extinct transmission trees and neglects multiple introductions.
Researchers have developed an agent-based model to study the pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis in the presence of non-hologous chromosomes. The model simulates the dynamics of an entire chromosome ensemble, taking into account attractive forces between homologs and repulsive forces between nonolog chromosomes. Results suggest that repulsive forces and chromosome movements are key in bringing homologs close, with repulsive interactions between nonolog chromosomes creating regions within the nucleus for homolog to pair. The model demonstrates that repulsive forces are most effective when chromosome numbers exceed a certain threshold, reducing available area per chromosome. Attractive forces come into play when homolog are sufficiently close. The model includes three processes: chromosome interactions, translation, and random motion within the nucleus. By deriving from first principles, the model avoids introducing parameters not apparent from the biological process. The model captures trajectories of all chromosomes throughout prophase I, facilitating comparison with experimental data and adjustments to species features such as chromosome number and size, and nuclear dimensions. The model computes pairwise interactions between chromosomes at short distances using a semi-dil solution. The dynamics of the center of mass is given by a system of equations, where N is the number of chromosomes and F is the force between chromosomes, obtained from the gradient of the potential. The potential is defined using the Morse potential. The model recapitulates efficiency and kinetics of homolog pairing for wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast, and can be adapted to nuclear and chromosome sets of other organisms.
This study investigated the role of microRNA-34 (miR-34) in zebrafish and its interaction with the tumor suppressor gene p53. The authors generated mi-34 mutant zebraf to determine the effects of its loss on gene expression under normal conditions at three stages of development, revealing a spectrum of transcriptomic effects. They found that mi-34 expression is partially dependent on p53 under conditions and induction by DNA damage is fully p-dependent. mi-34 has small but significant transcriptomic effects in 28 post-fertilization (pf) zebraf embryos under control and DNA conditions. Direct evidence of mi- tumor-suppressive function was provided by earlier tumor onset in mi-34 and p53 mutants compared to single p53 mutants. Overexpression of mi- induced sensitivity in zraf embryos to camptecin (C) but not γ-irradiation. mi-34 and mi-34/c genes are primarily dependent on p for induction under DNA conditions and partially on p for baseline expression. Residual induction mi- could be due other transcription factors activated DNA. Highly p motifs are located both mi- and mi-34/c, but confirmation requires future studies. Results are consistent with studies in mouse and human cell lines implicating mi in the p regulatory network. Adult analysis mi- in p-null zraf may provide information on dependence mi on p.
In the nematode C. elegans, sex determination is controlled by the master regulator OL-1 during embryogenesis. Expression of OL-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, which differs between XX hermaphrodites and males. In males, OL-1 is highly expressed, while in hermrodites OL-1 is expressed at low levels. OL- activity is known to be critical for proper C. elegans male development, but its low expression was considered minimal in hermrod development. This study reveals OL- plays a role as a regulator of developmental timing in hermrod embryogenesis. Using imaging and bioinformatics, hermrod embryos have an accelerated cell division rate and developmentally advanced transcription program when OL- is lost. Further analysis shows OL is responsible for regulating initiation of dosage on X chromosomes and sex-based transcription in hermrod. OL- mutant embryos overexpress the H3 methyltransferase MET-2 and altered H3me landscape. Some effects of OL loss were reversed by MET-2. Findings demonstrate OL plays a developmental role in embryos of both sexes and MET acts as downstream of OL in hermrod. In males, OL represses the S proteins, which regulate sex determination and dosage in herm. In herrod embryos, OL may repress dosage pathways during early embryogenesis, regulating timing of onset in herm. Immunofluorescence experiments show components of the dosage complex begin loading onto X chromosomes at gastrulation in WT, but not in OL- mutant embryos. The complex consists of 5 subunits and additional proteins. Organisms have unique mechanisms for dosage, including inactivation of one X in mammals, hyperactivation in Drosophila and birds, and repression in C. elegans through the complex. OL is the master that regulates sex and dosage in C. elegans, acting as a sensor toggled on or off by X and autos elements ratio. In hermrod, OL is repressed due to higher X ratio, while in males OL is activated due lower ratio. OL represses S-1, S-2, and S-3, leading to male determination and hermrod development. In herm, OL is repressed, leading to herm development and dosage.
Researchers have developed a computational framework called MGSurveillance (Mosquito Gene Surveillance) to optimize the placement of traps for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations to minimize the time to detect an allele of interest. The framework takes into account biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit, such as resources required by mosquitoes (e.g., food and breeding sites) and movement between these resources on a landscape, and accommodates traps with differing attractiveness. MGSurv is intended for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito surveillance. The framework is demonstrated with examples of trap placement for Aedes aegyti population in Queensland, Australia, and Anopheles gambia population on the island of São Tomé, São and Prínc. In the first example, MGSurv is used to distribute traps to minimize the time to detect an allele of interest for Ae. aegyti in the suburb of Yor Kn, northwest of Cairns, Australia. Household coordinates were sourced from OpenStreet and movement between households derived from a zero-infl exponential with daily probability 72% and mean dispersal distance 54m. Optimizing placement considered two types of traps with distinct profiles: an exponential with mean 16m and sigmoid with inflection 16 and shape 0.25. In the second example, MGS is used to distribute to minimize the time to detect an allele for An. gambiae on the island of São, Tom, Tom and Prnc. Locality coordinates were sourced from census and movement between villages from a zero-in exponential with daily probability 72 and dispersal 225km. Optimizing considered two types of traps: exponential with mean 16 and sigmoid with inflection 16 and shape 0.25.
Symbonas scillans, a 1.4 μm heterotrophic eukaryote, was initially thought to harbor an endosymbiotic bacterium due to the presence of an endosymbion in its endoplasmic reticulum. However, amplification-free metagenomics and whole genome sequencing data from two strains, RCC and RCC24, revealed no sequences from known endosymbiotic lineages. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) also verified the absence of endobacteria. Instead, numerous contigs from both strains were closely related to prasiniruses infecting green algae Ostococcus lucarin, Bathoccus prinos, and Microm pus. Using the Bp genome as a reference, a near-complete 190bp draft genome encoding prasin genes was assembled, as well as two incomplete assemblies from RCC and three draft genomes from RCC, collectively called Svs. A multi-gene tree showed Svs branched with high support with Bp, OlVs, and MpVs. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a 190nm virus-like particle similar to the endosion originally reported in S. scill. The authors conclude S scill does not harbor an endymb but is associated with viruses.
The leiom (MOD) family of actin-binding proteins play a critical role in muscle function, and mutations in three family members (MOD1, 2, and 3) result in human myopathies. Most disease-causing mutations in the MOD gene are nonsense or frameshift, predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins, however, in nearly all cases, little to no MOD protein is expressed. This study shows that nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), a cellular mechanism that eliminates mRNAs with premature codons, underlies loss of mutant protein from two MOD2 disease-causing mutations. Steric-blocking oligonucleotides were generated to obstruct the exon complex, preventing NMD of MOD transcripts, thereby restoring mutant expression. Investigation lays groundwork for therapeutic intervention in MOD-linked myopathies. MOD protein was not detected in explanted heart via western blot and RT-PCR revealed decrease in MOD mRNA levels, but no change in preRNA. Hypothesized that N underlies loss mutant expression. Two MOD disease-causing mutations (R* and LV*) are predicted to produce truncated, however, information lacking regarding, and extent, protein expressed. N is a system that detects and degrades mRNAs containing termination codons, however, also regulates levels non-mutated, functional transcripts. Mechanism involves deposition of multi-protein junction (E) upstream exon-exon during splicing. E remains bound transcript and removed by ribosome during translation, however, if ribosome at codon, SUR (SM1/9-UP1RF-e3) complex associate with ribosome, downstream ECs intact, E recruit proteins (e.g., U3 and2) promote SUR, transforming into decayucing (DEC) complex, leading degradation. This study discovered multiple MOD mutations lead to lack MOD expression through N. Developed steric oligonucleotides to inhibit N of MOD transcripts, increasing mutant-truncated protein.
Apolipoprotein E (Apo) polymorphisms modify the risk of Alzheimer's disease, with Apo4 increasing and Ap2 decreasing relative to Ap3. To investigate how Apo isoforms alter risk, we measured proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing human Apo gene isoforms 2, 3, or 4. We identified 484 proteins and tested Apo iso-dependent changes in homeostatic regulation ~270 ontologies. In the brain, Ap4 and Ap2 lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial proteins relative to wild-type Ap3. Ap4 lacks cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins, suggesting dysregulation of proteome and autagy reducing quality. Ap2 proteins of the matrix and membrane, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, had increased degradation, suggesting coordinated replacement of the organelle. In the liver, we did not observe these changes, suggesting the Apo-effect on proteasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues. Our findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover to decipher proteome mechanisms and their role in biology. Apo is a lipid transporter to many parts of the body, not just the brain. Although Ap2 protects against Alzheimer's, it increases risk for cardiovascular disease, leading to question the mechanism by which Ap2 protects Alzheimer's may be detrimental to other tissues. We analyzed liver tissue from mice in the same manner as brain. Changes Ap2/E and Ap3 proteasis were not equivalent, although trends were similar. Mitochondrial localization, transportation, and organization had proteasis trends between tissues, suggesting mitochondrial turnover reduced in liver compared to brain. Ap4/E and Ap3 proteasis in endosome, metabolism, and proteome pathways were not between tissues. However, effects Ap4 regarding mitochondria between liver and brain had several proteasis changes, suggesting some shared effects due Ap4. We propose lack global Apo effect because tissues have many apolipoproteins participating lipid transport. The brain has limited apipoproteins, primarily Ap and ApJ, which can cross blood-brain-barrier. Lipid trafficking in liver involves many apipoproteins, diluting Apo effect.
Researchers developed a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis (CRPRTRM) toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells in Drosophila. They validated the efficacy of CRTRM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue, demonstrated its orthogonal use with the Gal/UAS expression system, and simultaneous knockout of redundant genes. Using CRTRM, they discovered an essential role for SNARE components in NMJ maintenance and the canonical ESC pathway suppresses NMJ bout growth by downregulating retrograde signaling. They found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESC-mediated intra-axonal trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NMJ. The CRTR toolkit enables analysis of gene function in the NM system. Characterization of developmental mechanisms often involves loss-of-function (LO) analysis of genes, and tissue-specific mutagenesis through CRPR/Cas has emerged as a powerful approach. However, its application has been limited to small Doph tissues, including germline, sensory neurons, prothacic gland, and imaginal tissues. The Drosila neuromcular junction (NM) is a model for studying biological processes such as axon, synaptogenesis, synaptic function, and locomotion. CRPR has been used to tag endogenous at NM, but tissue-specific CR has not been applied to the NM. NMJs are synaptic connections between motor and somatic. Ax termin of the neurons release extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the space between axons and muscles. Outside nervous, EVs originate from types and carry diverse cargos of biomolecules. Vesicles function in signal transduction and cell communication and play roles in physiological and pathological processes. The researchers used CRTRM to investigate NM morphogenesis and found that the ESC pathway mediated by SN proteins is essential for NMJ maintenance. They generated Cas lines expressing in motone, glial, and somatic cells and used a negative tester to evaluate mutagen efficiency. They found that LO of SN proteins resulted in morph defects at NM. They also found that ax termin of motone rely on ESC-mediated intra-ax trafficking to release EV at NM.
In Drosophila, the lymph gland houses a pool of primed progenitors in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle, which are primed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) for differentiation. However, despite the presence of ROS, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in late larval stages. Studies show that ROS triggers the activation of JNK (c-Jun Kinase), which upregulates fatty acid oxidation (FA) to facilitate progenitor differentiation. The Drosila NF-κ transcription factor, Rel, shields the progenitor pool from the metabolic pathway that induces differentiation by curtailing the activation of JNK. ROS serves as a metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation, but its input is monitored by developmental TAK, regulated by Rel. This circuit ensures the stock of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted. The study reveals how NF-κ-like factors integrate with metabolic pathways crucially regulating cell fate transition during development. Rel is expressed in ROS-rich progenitors and wanes as cells move towards differentiation. Genetic loss of Rel leads to activation of the J-FA cascade, while sustained expression of Rel halts differentiation. ROS remains unchanged in Rel scenario. Elevating ROS in Rel background does not rescue halt differentiation. Rel prevents J activation thereby deferring differentiation. Enrichment of Rel in progenitors and decline in differentiated cells implies ROS cannot elicit differentiation due to Rel inhibition of J. The link between Rel and J is investigated, as TAK interaves pathways to Rel and J signaling. Loss of T1 in progenitors results in fewer differentiating cells and abundant progenitors. Downregulation T1 and Rel rescues differentiation and restores progenitors. Rel prevents precocious J activation via inhibiting T1 during development.
Tay-Linder syndrome (TALS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, abnormal gyral pattern, severe growth retardation, and bone abnormalities. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the RNUAT gene. A patient presenting with T features but no pathogenic variants were found in RNUAT, instead the homozygous RT c.295A variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing. After deciphering the impact of the variant on RT function, centrosome engineered RT-depleted cells and patient fibroblasts, neural stem cells (NS) derived CRPR/C9-edited pluripotent cells revealed cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities leading aneuplo, cycle arrest cell death. Cortical organoids discovered additional function RT in self-organisation NS into neuralset, observing ap-basal polarization NS. These defects contributed delay roset formation RT-mated organoids, thus impeding growth and shedding light mechanisms leading microceph.

Researchers conducted a long-term experiment to study the adaptation of Escherichia coli under prolonged resource exhaustion, a state called long-term stationary phase (LT). They sequenced hundreds of clones at 12 time points over six years and found that E. coli continuously adapts through convergent accumulation of mutations up to six years. The lineage structure of LT populations is convergent, with similar lineages arising independently across populations. They identified pairs of loci with significant association of mutations, suggesting contingency, which is frequent, with a third of converently mutated loci involved in at least one association. Results show LT adaptation is characterized by high parallelism and frequent contingency. E. coli often experiences similar phenotypic changes and convergent mutation in LTE, with populations accumulating mutations to similar loci. In the LT experiment, five populations of E. coli K12 MG5 were inoculated into rich media and not provided with external resources. They entered LT at day 11, with slow decline in viability and remain viable. Sequencing of 10 clones per population at nine time points revealed adaptation through convergent accumulation of mutations. Mutations occur to same loci and sites frequently across populations. The lineage of LT populations is convergent, with lineages defined by same RNAP mutations behaving similarly. The structure and convergence allowed identification of loci pairs with statistically associated mutations. Contingency is common, with more than a third of converently mutated loci involved in at least one. The approach has limitations, including directionality of contingencies, direct vs indirect, and only identifying pairs with convergent mutations in at least two lineages. Mutations in nonmutators occur in 88.5% within 265 loci mutated in at least two populations, which constitute 5.7% of E. coli genome. Adaptation is convergent up to six years, with reduction in fraction of mutations subjected to selection.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the male-specific (MSA) transcript, previously classified as non-coding, codes for a micropeptide (MSi) that regulates sperm usage in mated females. The MS transcript is a male version of another transcript, iab-8, produced in the central nervous system from an alternative promoter, iab-8nc. However, while MS produces a peptide, iab does not. Absence of iab translation is due to a repressive mechanism requiring unique 5' exons of iabnc. Cell and transgenic analysis show this mechanism relies on upstream reading frames in these exons preventing protein production from downstream frames. The difference between MS and iab lies in first exons, with MS starting downstream iab promoter, replacing first exons of iab with alternative. Testing translation of these transcripts by placing GFP in MSi sequence in full MS or iab cDNAs, transfecting constructs into S cells, showed GFP expression from MS but not iab. The cis-regulatory region controlling posterior genes ab-A and Abd have transcripts differing 5' ends, both spliced and polyadenylated, expressed in different tissues. The longer transcript, iabnc, is in CNS, loss leading to male and female sterility due to mi within intronic sequences. A shorter version, male-specific (MS), found in male abdomen, specifically in secondary cells of accessory gland. MS shares first exon with iab, creating same mi. Loss of mi in AG leads abnormal development and post-mating in females. Both RNAs were classified noncoding, but MS codes peptide. Using ribosome immunoprecitation and GFP-ins, MS serves template small peptide MSi. Deletion frames found MSi regulates sperm usage in fertilized females. Interestingly, iab shares ORF MSi, but GFP fusions never detected in CNS where i expressed. Here, regulation of i translation investigated using GFP constructs and transgenic. Presence upstream OR in 5 exons i prevent translation from i.
Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CD) are a group of ultra-rare multisystem disorders characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delays, with variable symptoms affecting every system in the body. Mutations in glycosylation pathways, such as N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and glycosphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor synthesis, lead to CD. Because of the ubiquity of glycosylation symptoms, patients with the same CD and same disease-causing variant show phenotypic variability, indicating genetic background and environment influence clinical presentation. Current options for CD are limited, primarily focusing on symptom management. Identifying genetic modifiers of glycos genes could lead to new therapeutic for CD patients. Protein glycos is essential for proper folding, stability, and localization, with three types: N-linkedcosylation, O-linkedcosylation, and GPI anchor synthesis. Evolutionary covariation (ERC) identifies proteins with similar evolutionary rates indicate biological functions and pathways. Using ERC, we identified evolutionary signatures between glycos proteins in same and different pathways. Genome analysis of proteins showing ERC with GPI synthesis revealed signatures with non-cosylation proteins and DNA repair proteins. We identified patterns ERC based on cellular localization of GPI synthesis enzymes. Testing top candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel modifiers of CD genes. ERC analysis disease and pathways allows prioritization of potential modifiers, providing understanding pathophysiology and therapeutic targets.
The HBV core protein (HBc) contains an N-terminal domain (NTD) for capsid assembly and arginine-rich C-terminal (CTD) for pregenomic (pg)RNA encapsidation. Phosphorylation of the HBCTD, especially at Ser162 and170, is essential for nucleation with polymerase (Pol) to initiate pg encapsation. Asids mature, the HBCT undergoes deosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in late of encapsation which remains to be determined. Using a-S170 antibody for nonosphorylated HB-Ser, a transition from phosphorylated to deosphory was observed during pg packaging. Pol-dependent deory of HBer was confirmed by substitution of single amino acid Val782 in RNase domain which abolished deory of HBer. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and protein analyses showed recruitment of host phosphat PP is dependent on Pol-Val domain. This recruitment does not HB but require Pol via RNA signal, suggesting Pol-pRNA plays a role in PP recruitment. Pol-pRNA-PP-mediated deory of HBer is essential for completion of pg encaps and appears associated with endosomes/multicular bodies (MVs). HB may play a dual role by bringing pg to phosphorylated HB and recruiting PP for completion of packaging. Findings elucidate mechanism of Pol-mediated deory of HB regulates pg encapsulation and reveal PP as potential target for antiviral development.
This study investigated the role of bacterial symbionts in the adaptation of marine organisms to environmental change, using the closure of the Isthmus of Panama as a natural experiment. The Isth of Panama created distinct conditions in the Tropical Pacific and Caribbean, offering a unique opportunity to study the evolution of closely related animals under environmental change. However, the role of symbion in this process is often overlooked. The study sequenced genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbivorous bivalves from the genera Codia and Cten (Lucinidae) on either side of the Isth to investigate how environmental conditions influenced the selection of symbion and their metabolic capabilities. Lucin sister species hosted Candidatus Thiazotro symbion, with those from the Caribbean having the potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the Tropical Pacific did not. Nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbion phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution of fixation under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing the evolutionary of nifDK operon by other lucin symbion genomes revealed the last ancestor lacked n genes and populations later acquired through HGT from Sedicola lineage. The study suggests H of n oper has facilitated diversification of globally distributed Ca Thiazro enducida clade.
Researchers have identified 9,291 TASRs from 661 vertebrate genomes, revealing a large-scale phylogenetic analysis that shows frogs and salamanders have unusually high TASR content compared to other vertebrates. Most TASRs are found in clusters, with amphibians having more clusters and genes per cluster than other vertebrates. Vertebrate TASRs have few one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, but total TASR count is stable in most lineages. TASR count is proportional to receptors expressed in extra-oral tissues. In vitro activity assays show many amphibian TASRs function as tissue-specific chemosensors detecting ecologically important xeniotics. The study found a rapid increase in TASR number along the ancestral branch to batrach (frogs and salanders) clade, with the largest TASR content among vertebrates. TASR size declined in cetans and snakes, consistent with previous work suggesting a reduction in taste receptors in these lineages associated with aquatic and fossorial lifestyles and diets. Genome size does not affect TASR count in vertebrates or amphibians. The Xenopus lavis and X. borealis lineage underwent allotetraploidy, but X. lavis and X. bore and relative X. tropical have 50 unique TASR sequences. TASRs diverged extensively after major vertebrate lineages established, with amphibians in four major clades and small groups. Bird and reptile receptors are relatively distributed, some with amphibians and mammals. The study reconstructed TASR family across species phylogeny using DupPHY. Vertebrates detect five tastes, sweet, umami, salty, sour, and bitter, playing a role in physiology and behavior. Bitter is detected by TASRs, which vary across lineages from zero in cetans to hundred in frogs. Detailed studies have been in rodents and primates. TASRs are under rapid evolution in vertebrates, with differences between close relatives like rats and mice or humans and primates.
This study investigated the role of Notch dimerization in regulating Notch signaling in the small intestine. Notch dimer-deficient (NDD) mice were more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis and developed colitis when challenged with 1% DSS. Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids showed no evidence of dimer-dependent gene regulation, but revealed impaired stem cell maintenance in vitro and an elevated epithelial immune response to symbionts, likely causing heightened sensitivity in NDD mice. Quantitative proteomic analysis in human carcinoma cells expressing NOT2DD or NOT2 revealed an unbalanced interactome with reduced interaction of NOT2 with transcription machinery but preserved interaction with HD2 interactome, suggesting cooperativity. HD2 inhibitor Valpro acid (PA) prevented intestinal consequences of DD and gamma-secretase inhibitors in mice spheroids, suggesting synergy between HD activity and differentiation program in stem cells. Not dimer-deficiency mimicked a subset of Not loss-of-function phenotypes in the intestine, including reduction of stem cells and increase Paneth cells, but goblet metaplas. Mechanistically, null hypothesis was that monomer activities of NIC remained unchanged in DD mice but dimer transcription was affected. Unexpectedly, RNAseq data did not identify differential d-dependent targets, instead overall reduction in Notch function such as proliferation and barrier. spher form N mice showed enrichment genes associated with host defense against symbts and interferon targets, consistent with elevated epithelium immunity in absence of immune cells or symbts. This response to symbts under basal conditions can explain NDD develop colitis when 1% DSS exposure gut microbiome or inference when furites colon skin.
Researchers have extended the theory of background selection to account for the effects of migration in an island model, showing that migration, in addition to selection and recombination, acts to end cross-generational association between a neutral and deleterious alleles. A property of these models is that predictions can be made under weak selection, considering weakly deleterious alleles have appreciable rate of fixation via genetic drift. They tested predictions using simulations and found it best FST and π under varying selection, recombination, and migration rates. Work provides mechanistic explanation for observed lack of effect of background on F under high migration and highlights parameter space where background theory is inaccurate. Importance of migration effect depends on magnitude of heterozygous selection coefficient, t, and migration, m. Under t >> m, effect is weak, as selection removes deleter variants prior emigration. Predictions of background are accurate without migration, given migration infrequent. Model is restricted to semi-dominance deleter mutations, but can be extended to continuous distribution of coefficients. Background can cause substantial reductions in π despite weak effects on F, particularly in metapopulations with larger effective size. Effects of background on π and π dependent on migration, which influences F directly and effective size of metop.
Researchers have proposed a federated genetic testing algorithm, FedMM, to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) while preserving privacy. FedMM uses a federated statistical approach to correct for confounding and polygenic effects among collaborating sites without sharing genetic data. The algorithm integrates multiple-level random effects and can be used in different study designs without changing the algorithm setup. The two-stage estimation is advantageous for privacy as the problem is modularized into null fitting and scoring with covariates and genotype used in different stages. FedMM uses homomorphic encryption and OTP-like protection to protect individual and intermediate information between sites and the central server. Sites ensure symmetric keys are protected against leakage and decryption at the central is assumed trusted.

 FedMM is compared to previous methods, such as Zhu et al.'s federated generalized mixed model, which only reports effect estimates and not p-values and does not model polygenic effects. FedMM achieves similar results to pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical requirements. The algorithm has challenges, such as designing studies ahead of time to collect harmonized data and covariates and phenotypes. Sites may perform meta-analysis by sharing statistics, but lose power due to heterogeneity. FedMM can improve aspects, such as sending null information unprotected, but has few parameters and unlikely to lead to membership attacks.

FedMM uses homomorphic encryption and OTP-like protection to protect individual and intermediate information between sites and the central. Sites ensure symmetric keys are protected against leakage and decryption at the central is trusted. The central gains access to phenotypes, kinship, and null parameters, but restrictions have been relieved by NIH. Sharing raw genotype-phen data is not allowed, and data from underserved populations is challenging due to stigmatization and isolation. Genetic and biomedical research is challenging in these communities. Unauthorized data usage, probing, and diverting genealogy databases are concerns. Regulations, such as HIPAA and GDPR, protect individual records, including genetic data, making high-powered GWAS difficult due to large sample sizes. Genome repositories release data with restrictions on usage and sharing. Initiatives connect distributed data while protecting privacy, such as federated learning, can comply with regulations and perform GW across silos.
Researchers have developed polygenic risk scores (PRS) to predict disease risk, including prostate cancer, by combining multiple genetic variants into a single score. However, these models have not been formally assessed for their performance in prostate cancer, particularly in diverse populations. This study benchmarks six widely used PRS algorithms, four of which adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biob and All of Us cohorts. The results show modest improvement in discriminatory ability compared to a simple method prioritizing variants, clumping, and polygenic scores. The findings highlight the importance of improving risk algorithms and sampling diverse cohorts. The study employed ancestry correction using linkage disequilibrium maps from a large publicly available source, suggesting that sample sizes may be inadequate and finer mapping is required. Inclusion of local haplotype models may improve predictive power, especially for admixed individuals. PRSx explains the most variance in logistic models but does not outperform other methods in classification on held-out data. Alternative metrics such as AUROC produce different rankings of polygenic scores. The study used 98,560 and 165,080 individuals, with 1,458 cases and 27,246 controls, with genotype data. Prior to scoring, genetic scores were lifted from hg19 to hg38 and GWAS statistics adjusted for accurate polygenic score calculation. Two methods, clumping and PRs, were applied to four sets of summary statistics. Clumping selects variants with lowest P-value in linkage disequilibrium and PRs shrinks variants to replicate genome results. The study evaluated performance of published polygenic scores in the UKob cohort and trained models using GWAS data from the EIP Prostate Cancer Meta-Analysis and UKob cohorts. Fine mapping identified an association between rs637 and prostate susceptibility. The study hypothesized that adjusting cross-population linkage disequilibrium may improve prediction in African men. Employing cl, PRs, PRsx, IMP, Poly, and XP, generated 206 scores for populations. Hierarchical clustering revealed population-specific clustering, suggesting methods may not adequately adjust ancestry. Logistic models evaluated with Nagelke pseudo-R2 showed scores for EUR explained most variance. A relative metric identified ancestry-adjusted scoring, dividing R2 by clumping R, revealed PRsx explained variance in AFR and ASN.
Researchers used a Drosophila model of DPAG1CD, a congenital disorder of glycosylation caused by mutations in the DP1 gene, to identify potential therapeutics. They screened 1,520 FDA-approved drugs and found 42 that improved the model, including acetylcholine-related, dopaminergic, and cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Notably, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the D2 receptor partially rescued the model. Loss of dopamine synthesis and recycling also partially rescued the model, suggesting that dopaminergic signaling is detrimental under DP1 deficiency. This links dopamine to glycosylation and represents a new therapeutic target for DP1CD. The researchers genetically validated other drug categories, including acetylcholine drugs, CO inhibitors, and NK1. These and analyses reveal novel biology in DP1 mechanisms and may represent new options for DP1CD. The DP1 model can be chemically or genetically manipulated to make the eye larger or smaller, validating it as a representation of the disorder. Acetylolinesterase inhibitors taken by patients improved DP1 by increasing acetyl signaling at neuromuscular junctions. However, in Doph, glutamate is the excitatory neurotransmitter and the eye is not impacted by NM signaling. Outside NM, acetyloline can bind nicotinic receptors mediate DA release. Increased acetyloline may counteract negative consequences of DA release. The researchers focused on DA signaling by reducing expression of Dop2, the Drosoph ortholog of human D2, D3, and D4. Dop2 inhibits the adenyl cyclase/cAMP pathway. Reduced expression of Dop2 improved the model, as did a heterozygous null allele. Overexpressing Dop2 decreased the model. This indicates reduction of D2 signaling improves DP1. DA can bind several receptors, including Dop2, Dop1,1, and Ec. Dop1 and Dop2 activate adenyl cycl/c signaling, opposite to Dop2. The DP1 model can be chemically or genetically manipulated to make the eye larger or smaller, validating it as a representation of the disorder.
Researchers developed a topographic variational autoencoder (topo-VA) model to investigate the neural representation of proprioception in the somatosensory cortex. Proprioception is one of the least understood senses, yet fundamental for movement control, and basic questions about limb representation in the somatosensory cortex are unclear. The model was trained on natural human movement data, not neural data, and reproduced two observations from monkey center-out reaching: 1) shape and velocity of proprioceptive fields in hand-centered coordinates, despite no knowledge of arm or hand systems, and 2) distribution of neuronal directions (PDs) from multi-electrode arrays. The model makes predictions: 1) encoding across cortex has a blob-pinwheel geometry of PDs, 2) few neurons encode a single joint. The model provides a principled understanding of sensorimotor representations and theoretical basis for neural manifolds, with applications to restoration of feedback in brain-computer interfaces and control of robots. 

The researchers combined proprioceptive stimuli with a model of neural and topographical organization of neurons in somensory cortex to develop understanding of proprioception. The topo-VA is designed to reflect information processing in cortex, hypothesizing the cortex learns efficient representation of somensory through experience, replicating as a deep network. The learns a nonlinear mapping from kinematic inputs to cortical latent space, embodying a stochastic generative model of movement-related activity. The model was trained and validated on natural human arm kinematics and emergent proprio representations in its layer, then used to generate neural responses with kinematic data from center-out task. The properties of simulated activities were compared to S1 neurons recorded from monkeys, characterizing proprio representations at two levels: spatial curves of neurons and organization of maps across cortex.
Researchers investigated the role of ethylene in plant-micro interactions, specifically in the bacterium Azospirillum brasilense, which colonizes plant roots and promotes plant growth. They identified a functional ethylene receptor, Azospillum ethylene1 (Ae1), in A. brasil, which directly binds ethylene with high affinity. Treating with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduced biofilm formation and colonization of plant surfaces. RNA sequencing and metabolomics showed ethylene causes widespread changes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, resulting in polyhydroxybutyrate accumulation. The data suggest a model where ethylene from plants alters A. brasil colonization density and metabolism, indicating the bacterium adapts to ethylene sensing. This study provides new targets for regulating beneficial plant-micro interactions. Most studies on eth in planticro associations focused on micro-induced ethylene changes or plant signaling. Direct evidence of eth binding to a receptor in microbes was found in Synechyst and Rhizophagus irregularis. A. brasil contains a putative eth receptor gene, which they named Azospillum eth response (Ae). A. brasil colonizes roots and is used to boost crop production. Inoculation with A. brasil alters plant gene expression related to eth biosynthesis and signaling. However, nothing was known about A. brasil responses to ethylene or the receptor. The researchers examined eth as a signal in A. brasil and its effects on traits, including root colonization. They found A1 is a functional eth receptor affecting carbon and nitrogen metabolism.
This study investigated the role of the IN80 protein in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. Immunolocalization of IN80 at the XY body in pachene spermatocytes suggested a role IN80 in the meiotic body. Subsequent deletion of IN80 resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes. The form of RNA polymerase II at sex chromosomes of IN80 pachene spermatocytes indicates incomplete inactivation sex-linked genes. A reduction in recruitment of initiators of meiotic sex inhibition (MSCI) argues IN80-facilitated recruitment of DNA factors for silencing sex-linked genes. This role IN80 is independent of common IN80 target H2. Instead, in absence IN80, reduction chromatin accessibility at DNA sites on sex chromosomes occurs. Data suggest a role IN80 in DNA factor localization, facilitating silencing sex genes during pachema. IN80 regulates chromatin at DSB regions of sex chromosomes, independent of histone variant H2. IN80 interacts with DS factors ATR and MDC, facilitating MDC recruitment at sex during pachema. IN80 also regulates chromatin dynamics on sex, removing H2 from chromatin. IN80 does not mediate sex gene silencing through H2. Histone modification H3me3 and Hme3me at sex promoters remain unchanged in IN80KO spermat. Chromatin accessibility is a regulator of DNA-interacting binding at chrom. IN80 regulates sex accessibility during meiotic progression. Accessibility is central to DNA repair and transcription. IN80 binds sex chromosomes at zyema and pach stages, enriched postnatal 18 pachema. IN80 sites include promoters, intergenic, and gene regions. IN80 and H2X binding correlated, IN80 enriched HX sites. Data suggest IN80 role in DSB repair and silencing sex genes. RNA analysis of INKO spermatocytes shows upregulated sex-linked genes. INKO spermatocytes display aberrant sex transcription program.
In C. elegans, the axon regeneration is activated by SVH-1, a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasmin family. SV-1 has a dual function, acting as an HGF growth factor to promote axon regeneration and a protease for larval development. The conversion of SV-1 from protease to growth factor for ax regeneration is unclear. This study demonstrates that cytidine deaminase CDD-2 plays a role in the conversion of SV-1. The codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the catalytic triad of SV-1 suppresses the c-2 defect in axon regeneration. The stem structure around His-755 in sv- mRNA is required for activation of ax regeneration by SV-1. Results suggest C- promotes regeneration by transforming SV- from protease to growth through modification of sv- mRNA. In contrast, protease and growth-active forms of SV-1 act in the same AD neuron, regulating larval development and ax regeneration, respectively. C-mediated inactivation of SV-1 prote activity does not occur during larval stage. C- expression is essential for conversion of SV- from prote to growth during regeneration. Forced- expression at larval stage does not lead to editing of sv mRNA, suggesting enzymatic activity may be activated by ax injury. The cytidine site in sv mRNA is within stem structure, important for recognition by factors. Similarly, sv- mRNA has His- codon within stem structure. Genetic analysis suggests stem structure of sv- is recognized by C-. AB- has AU-binding activity and C- possesses RNA-binding with AU-rich templates. Biochemical evidence C- catalyzes sv- in animals. Ax injury to motor neurons induce C-dependent sv-editing. However, sv- and- are expressed in AD neurons, distant from motor neurons. The question remains how SV- in AD neurons is transported to motor neurons.
Researchers used zebraf fish to study the impact of genetic modification on collective behavior in biological systems. They genetically modified the fish to lack the col11a gene, which causes early onset osteoarthritis and vertebral defects. The mutants exhibited compromised vertebral properties, bent bodies, and took longer to change direction. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutant fish showed more collective motion than wildtype. A simple active matter model captured the behavior of both types, with mutants modeled as self-propelling agents with higher orientational noise. This demonstrates the possibility of tuning biological systems by changing characteristics at the level of constituents, like colloids and de novo. The Vicsek model with modified orientational noise explained the difference between mutant and wildtype, with mutants having lower orientational noise. The study links macroscopic collective behavior to microscopic individual properties, showing the utility of this approach to relate genetic traits to physiological changes.
Researchers have developed a computational model to simulate the formation of capillary networks in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The model combines mechanical and chemical cues to predict endothelial cell migration, morphology, and biog deformation, and VEG transport. The results show that capillary networks develop when mechanical and chemical coupling work together, with morphology driven by soluble and bound VEG, respectively. Soluble VEG induces morphological changes, while bound VEG provides orientational signals. The model demonstrates cells gather from scattered to cords and then to a network, consistent with experiments. The model is valid for short-term incubation and may be used for transplantation to promote neovascularization around surgical sites. Previous studies omitted bound VEG or chemical mechanisms, which could not reproduce biog experiments. This study bridges mechanical and chemical stimulation in capillary development. The model uses cell-based CPM to predict endothelial migration and continuum-based PDE to quantify biog deformation and VEG dynamics. The results agree with literature, considering endothelial secreting and intaking VEG. The model shows correlation between biog deformation and cellular formation, agreeing with observations. Capillary development relies on biog deformation, bound VEG, and bound VEG gradient. The network is well-developed when mechanical and chemical work together.
In the nematode Caenorhabitis elegans, five TGF-β ligands play a role in survival against bacterial pathogens, with multiple ligands acting nondundantly in the response. The BMP-like ligands DB-1 and T-2 function independently, while T-2/B and T-3, a TGF/Activ-like ligands, function together. Structural modeling suggests T-2 and T-3 can form heterodimers. T-2 and T-3 lack the conserved cystine responsible for disulfide linking dimers. The DB-1/BMP receptor and Smad transducers function in the response to bacterial pathogens, while components of the TGF/Activ pathway do not play a major role. The multiplicity of T- family ligands, receptors, and Sm signal transducers support diverse outcomes through combinator interactions. Biochemical and computational approaches are useful, but must be complemented by in vivo analyses. C elegans has five T- ligands and two T signaling pathways, providing a system to study T- functions in an intact organism. Critically, T- mechanisms are conserved. The response to gram-negative bacteria Serratia marces and Photorhabus lumcens shows specificity of ligand responses. DB-1 has a significant role in response to S. marces, while T-2 has a more significant role in response to P. lumens. The T-like lig D- is regulator of the dauer pathway, preventing entry into the dauer larval stage. The BMP lig DB- activates the BMP pathway, playing a role in development. T- and- have been classified as BMP or T-like, but not fully associated with either pathway. Previous work demonstrated DB- functions in innate response to pathogenic bacteria by inducing antimicrobial genes. Here, DB- is one of four T- ligands with a role in immune to gram-negative pathogens. Multiple T- ligands have a significant reduction in survival compared to control. Two BMP ligands, DB- and T-, act independently. In contrast, T- and T- have a non-additive relationship, suggesting they act together in response.
This study investigates the role of the epigenetic modifier N-terminal acetylase 4 (Nat) in the DNA damage response (DDR) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nat is shown to acetylate the alpha-amino group of serine 1 on histones H4 and H2, and is implicated in the response to DNA damage. Initially, cells lacking Nat exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulate more breaks than wild-type cells. Upon DNA damage, NAT expression is elevated and the enzyme is specifically recruited to double-strand breaks. Deeper into its effects on the damage cascade, Nat-deleted cells exhibit lower levels of damage-induced H2ASph (H2) accompanied by diminished binding of checkpoint protein Rad9 surrounding double-strand. Consistently, Mec1 recruitment to double-strand breaks, critical for H2ph deposition and Rad retention, is impaired in Nat cells. Consequently, Mec-dependent phosphorylation of effector Rad, indicative of damage activation, is reduced. Importantly, the effects of Nat in the cascade are mediated by its-terminal acetylase activity towards histone H. This study points to a novel link between histone-terminal acetylase Nat and DDR, associating a hist-modifying activity in genome integrity.
Researchers introduce Orchard, a novel algorithm for reconstructing cancer phylogenies from bulk DNA sequencing data. Phylogen depict the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells in cancer, offering insights into development and treatment strategies. Existing methods become inaccurate with more than 30 mutations or fail to recover a phylogeny. Orchard samples from a factorized approximation of the posterior over phylogen, a result derived in this paper. Each factor corresponds to a distribution for adding a new mutation to a built phyeny. It optimizes each factor, generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogen culminating in a complete tree containing all mutations. Evaluations demonstrate Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art methods reconstructing more plausible phylogen across 90 cancers and 14 B-proitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias. Orchard accurately reconstructs phylogen using up 1,000 mutations. Large phylogen reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying somatic mutations and variations among cancer subpopulations. 

Orchard uses allele frequency to build large and accurate trees, derived an approximation to the tree, and adapts Anstral Gumb-Top sampling to efficiently sample without replacements. Results show Orchard reliably matches ground-truth baselines on reconstruction with up 300 and 100 samples. Orchard can recover larger trees simulated data, reconstructing 100-node trees in 26 hours. Its ability to reconstruct large trees motivates a strategy using tree structure to guide inference and clone trees. Introduce a phylog-aware clustering infers clones and trees from mutation. Orchard outperforms Pair and CAL on problems with 30 or fewer mutations, being 5-10x faster, and on problems more than 30. Achieves greater accuracy and scalability by sampling a factor approximation of the tree. Each factor represents a distribution for adding a new to a built, generating sequences larger culminating a complete. Uses Gumb Softax to sample for each, enabling complete without replacement.
Researchers have developed Immugen, a modular language model for predicting immunogenicity of CD8+ epitopes, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on pMHC immunogenic prediction and integrates T cell receptor (TCR) information. The model comprises a pM encoding module trained on multiple pHC tasks, an optional T encoding, and a context-specific immunogenic prediction head. Immugen outperforms compared models on pHC immunogenic prediction with a 7% increase in average precision and improved performance with T context integration. The phased training approach allows for integration of multiple pHC-specific tasks in the model, providing a useful embedding for downstream immunogenic modelling. pHC stability was found to be an important feature for improved performance, aligning with previous work showing its relationship to CD+ reactivity. The model's architecture is extendable to additional pre-trained embeddings and features such as T sequences. Predictors of immunogenic have been developed using pHC models as basis, but current models show reduced performance on new data due to low training volumes and biased datasets. T specificity is relevant to immunogenic prediction, especially for personalised therapy, and integrating it into models would take advantage of new datasets. Immugen's performance is analysed for interpretability, highlighting areas of weakness and biases in existing models and datasets.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and gene-based analysis of 230 fast-growing feathered chickens to identify genes related to meat lightness and redness. They mapped a 6.24 QTL region on chromosome 15 (G15: 629.34-630.58 kb) and found that protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma 1 (PPP1CC) was associated with meat color (P = 8.65E-08). Mendelian randomization analysis validated the causal relationship between PPP1 expression and lightness (P < 2.9E-12). Inducible skeletal muscle-specific PPP1 knockout (PPPCKO) mice showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin in limb muscles, and myofiber shifted from slow-twitch to fastwitch. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed inhibition of PPP1 decreased slow-twitch myiber and myof-type genes and enhanced glycolysis. A plasm reporter assay showed SNP rs520 (C > T) in PPP1 intron regulated transcription. Differences in meat phenotypes, myoglobin, and rs520 variant expression were detected between fast-growing and local chickens. PPP1 was identified as the causative gene for color and a novel target for meat improvement.
Researchers have developed a new method called super-resolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) to identify the subunits of a ganglion cells' receptive field in the retina. This method combines stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and computed tomography (CT) to efficiently locate subunits in a short recording time, making it ideal for online and closed-loop investigations of receptive field structure. The technique was tested on a model and primate ganglion cells, validating its feasibility. Previous approaches to infer subunits were based on ganglion responses to spatiemporal white stimuli, which evoke weak responses, requiring long recordings. STR uses targeted stimuli to characteristics of subunits, reducing recording time. The method was tested on a realistic model with elliptical subunits and varying overlap, and a Poisson process for spiking to reflect real ganglion variability. A tomographic variation of the super-resolution stimulus was introduced to evoke stronger responses and sample the receptive field efficiently. Experiments were performed on primate ganglion cells using electrophys recordings and a multielectrode array, projecting stimuli onto retinal photoreceptors. Responses to spatiemp white stimulus identified On and Off cells, expected to have pronounced sub structure due to spatial nonlinearities. Both types displayed biphas filtering of space, autocorrelation, and nonlinearities. Off cells had an average receptive diameter of 111 ± 9 μm and On cells 138 ± 11m, consistent with dendritic field sizes. The Ricker stimulus was adjusted to target Off cells, which have stronger nonlinearities in macaque retina. The polarity was flipped, using black and whitebands, excitatory and suppress, respectively.
Researchers have developed a novel statistical method called CRPR-DR (Dose-Response) to analyze chemical-genetic interactions (CGI) data from CRIS interference (CRi) experiments. The method incorporates both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation to capture the non-linear interaction between them. CRPRDR was applied to a Mycobacterium tuberculosis dataset to identify genes interacting with antibiotics. The approach can be generalized to non-CGI datasets, as shown by analyzing a CRi dataset for E. coli on different carbon sources. CRPRDR's performance is competitive with the best related methods, but less noisy datasets generate more interactions, likely including false positives, whereas CRDR maintains precision in empirical and simulated data. The method selects top 20% of sgRNAs by empirical efficiency to build a model predicting sgRNA strength, but advocates selecting sgRNAs with a diversity of efficiencies, as the most synergistic sgRNAs are not always the strongest or weakest but in the middle range. CRDR extends previous work by showing effects of drug and sgRNA can be accommodated in the same model. Ideally, interacting genes exhibit synergistic behavior with drug, where depletion of target induces excess or enrichment of mutants in presence of inhibitor, and effect is concentration-dependent. The method can be applied to other treatments inducing sigmoidal responses, such as E. coli growth on different carbon sources. CRDR has three requirements: CRi library with multiple sgRNAs per gene, at least 5RN per gene for sensitivity, and tuning CRi to deplete target to intermediate levels.
Researchers developed a community detection method called the weighted corrected stochastic block model (SBM) that does not assume genes are organized into assortative modules. Instead, the SB attempts to use all information in the co-expression network to separate genes into hierarchically organized blocks. Using RNA gene expression data from Drosophila melanogaster, the SB found ten times as many groups as competing methods, and several of these groups were not modular. The functional enrichment of non-modular groups was as strong as modular. This shows the transcriptome is structured more complex than thought, and the assumption of modularity is not the main driver of structuring gene-expression. The SB is different from other methods that attempt to find assortative modules and can capture alternative organizations. It uses a general measure of similarity to find gene groups that are not assortative but have biological interpretation. The SB can capture assortative pattern if present, but is general enough to capture other organizations. The method was compared to widely used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WNA) that relies on modularity. The SB found more groups, including non-modular, and the functional enrichment of non-mod groups as strong as modular. This highlights the need to incorporate sources beyond modularity when exploring biological networks.
Researchers investigated the role of cytoplasmic poly ( )-binding protein PAB in yeast, which is involved in post-transcriptional control, including translation, initiation, termination, and mRNA decay. They used mass spectrometry, RNASeq, and RiboSeq to analyze the abundance of components of the yeast proteome and transcriptome in cells lacking the P1 gene. Results showed drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, defects in translation initiation and termination, and stabilization of specific mRNAs in P1 cells, partly due to reduced levels of initiation factors, decapping activators, and components of deadenylation complex, and loss of P's direct role. Cells devoid of P1 manifested a nonsense codon readthrough indicative of a defect in termination. The study demonstrated the pleiotropic effects of P1 deletion on post-transcription regulation. Biochemical, structural, in vitro, and in vivo studies identified P's roles in cytoplasmic deadenylation, translation, and termination, but its transcript-wide roles were difficult to define. High-throughput approaches explored transcript-wide effects of P depletion in mammalian cells, but not yeast. Consistent with mammalian, deletion of yeast P resulted in changes in transcriptome, minimal changes in translation efficiency. The proteome was also changed, with significant reduction in ribosomal proteins, suggesting global translation decrease, yet most mRNAs unchanged. The study provided first evidence for transcript-wide termination defect. Gene analyses showed upregulated proteins in metabolic pathways, downregulated in ribosome, translation, and RNA-binding. The mutation led to reduction in levels of ribosomal, initiation, and decay factors. The study explored phenotypes of decay, translation, efficiency, and termination upon P deletion, focusing on analyses p1p1 cells relative p1 cells, and considered changes direct or indirect effects of P1. P has regulatory roles in decay, and asked how absence impacts levels of mRN substrates of dec activators, D1, Pat/L1, and Up factors N pathway. Approximately half mRN showed changes in p1p1 relative p1 cells. Targets of decay pathways followed expected phenotypes upon P deletion, tendency to stabilize, suggesting direct role in regulation. However, depletion some factors cannot be ruled as indirect stabilization. P promotes initiation by association 40 ribosomal subunit and e4 complex with mRNA cap through interaction e4. Initiation defects expected when P deleted. The study analyzed rib profiling WT, p1, p1, and p1p1 cells. Consistent with expectation, ribosomes found mostly in coding region, 3- periodic, and predominantly in main frame. However, observed accumulation at canonical start and 5-UT region in p1p1, indicating possible initiation defect. Determined deletion affected all mRN equally, assessed change efficiency each p1 p1 and p1. ~500 mRN show increases or decreases, most do not significant changes.
Researchers have proposed a new mechanism for generating slow brain rhythms, such as those seen in slow-wave sleep or pathological conditions like seizures and spreading depolarization, which are accompanied by oscillations in extracellular potassium concentration. This mechanism is based on the interplay between fast-spiking dynamics and one-dimensional slow dynamics of extracellular potassium, mediated by the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase. Using bifurcation analysis of the system, they reveal that this coupling suffices to generate a hysteres loop around a bistable region that emerges from a saddle-node bifurcation, a common feature of class I excitable neurons. Depending on the strength of the Na+/K+-Pase, bursts are generated from pump-induced bifurcation, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolar block. The researchers suggest that transitions between these dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting Na+/Pase activity. A minimalistic model outlining the sodium-potassium pump's contribution to burst dynamics can contribute to better understanding pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes and inform therapeutic strategies. The mechanism applies to any neuron with class I excitability and demonstrates the sufficiency of Na+/Pase for generation of slow rhythmic bursting across a set of neuronal types.
Researchers developed the COPS (Clustering for Omics-driven Patient Stratification and robust evaluation of clustering results) package to evaluate and compare single and multi-omics clustering methods for disease subtyping. Current frameworks often overlook clustering stability and prognostic relevance, and do not allow for comparison between data-driven and pathway clustering. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity-based, kernel approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway integration, some of which are not accessible through R and correspond to new approaches. The framework was applied to multiomics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Unlike previous studies, the approach contrasts data and knowledge-driven multi-clustering methods and incorporates cross-validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using ARI, survival analysis via Cox models including covariates, and stability of results. The study highlights the importance of assessing multi-clustering using multiple criteria, from stability to prognostic relevance, and providing ways to compare metrics to select the optimal approach for disease discovery in novel datasets. Emphasizing multi-objective evaluation, the Pareto efficiency was used to gauge the equilibrium of metrics in each case study. Network Fusion, Integrative Non-Matrix Factor, and Multiple Kernel-Mans with linear Pathway Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with different outcomes in several studies.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the SoxC protein SEM-2 plays a crucial role in embryonic development, specifying the sex myoblast (SM) fate in the postembry mesoderm lineage. A novel loss-of-function SEM-2 allele with a proline to serine change in the C-terminal of the conserved DNA-binding domain was identified. Detailed analyses of mutant animals harboring this mutation uncovered new functions of SEM-2 in the lineage. SEM- functions antagonistically with LET-381, the C. elegans Fox/Forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the lineage. Additionally, SEM- is essential for the proliferation and diversification of the lineage. SEM directly regulates the expression of hl-8, which encodes a basic-helix-helix transcription factor and plays critical roles in patterning the lineage. The data suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. The study identified interactions in the regulatory network underlying C. elegans postembry development add to the understanding the structure-function relationship of So proteins.
