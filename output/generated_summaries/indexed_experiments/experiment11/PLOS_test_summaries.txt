Researchers have developed a stochastic model to capture the dynamics of Gambian human trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) at a health area level of approximately 10,000 people. This is the first time a stochastic model has been fitted directly to data, allowing for quantification of uncertainty in results. The model uses a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methodology to fit to data from 16 health areas in Mosango zone, Kwu province. Spatial heterogeneity in cases is reflected in results, predicting Kinamba II, with a third of the zone's cases, will have the latest year for elimination of transmission (ET) under current strategies. Fitting a deterministic version of the model using MCM has faster computation times than stochastic, but produces indistinguishable posteriorisation. This suggests using deterministic fits for health area expansion, but stochastic for projections to capture parameter and stochastic variation in reporting and elimination estimations.

A particle MCM algorithm was used to fit a stochastic model to historical AT screening case data, which is complex and computationally intensive compared to traditional MCM. However, it accounts for variations in infection dynamics with realism and allows fitting multiple parameters in a reasonable time. Previous work used parameters from deterministic models to make projections in stochastic variants, shown to be a good approximation. Deterministic and stochastic models produce similar results for health data, but diverge in future projections to elimination. Stochastic models are suited for low infections, expanded to small-scale health area modelling, capturing heterogeneity and focal nature of AT infections.

Mathematic models have a role in quantifying progress towards elimination of ET of AT. Cases have declined due to detection and treatment in endemic regions, but target ET requires estimating real infections and understanding transmission. Spatial distribution is dependent on factors such as vector density, parasite, human settlements, and work locations. Distribution is heterogeneous and confined to geographic regions with few cases in between. Factors such as diagnostics and treatment availability impact distribution. Times of infection are approximately three years without treatment.

A stochastic model was fitted to health areas of 10,000 people in DRC, capturing local variation and defining intervention areas. Small population with prevalence <1% used stochastic to capture uncertainty. Deterministic would require proxy threshold for elimination. The zone Mosango, Kwu province was used to fit a stochastic model to 16 health areas. A mechanistic model can be fitted to health data, providing detailed projections for scenarios. Similarity in stochastic and deterministic models validates previous studies, but stochastic remains for elimination and uncertainty.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Tumor microenvironments ( TMEs ) contain vast amounts of information on patient’s cancer through their cellular composition and the spatial distribution of tumor cells and immune cell populations. Exploring variations in TMEs between patient groups, as well as determining the extent to which this information can predict outcomes such as patient survival or treatment success with emerging immunotherapies, is of great interest. Moreover, in the face of a large number of cell interactions to consider, we often wish to identify specific interactions that are useful in making such predictions. We present an approach to achieve these goals based on summarizing spatial relationships in the TME using spatial K functions, and then applying functional data analysis and random forest models to both predict outcomes of interest and identify important spatial relationships. This approach is shown to be effective in simulation experiments at both identifying important spatial interactions while also controlling the false discovery rate. We further used the proposed approach to interrogate two real data sets of Multiplexed Ion Beam Images of TMEs in triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer patients. The methods proposed are publicly available in a companion R package funkycells.

    In this paper, we present a novel method for the analysis of data-rich TME spatial data. We consider the case in which we compare TME and meta data or clinical data from two different patient groups, and develop a model to identify significant differences between these groups in the distribution of cell phenotypes, protein antigens, or a mixture thereof. In addition, the model aims to predict which group a new patient is in using their TME and meta data. Our model employs a combination of spatial statistics and functional data analysis and is applicable to marked point processes in general. Benefits of the model include general applicability, with few tuning parameters, and easily visualised and interpreted output. We find our model to be robust to the choice of the tuning parameters. The model demonstrates a powerful ability to identify important variables while maintaining good predictive power. It is also resistant to overfitting and manages false discovery rate. We evaluate our approach on simulated data, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for marked spatial point patterns with known interactions. Our approach is then applied to TNBC and lung cancer data obtained from multiplexed ion beam imaging. For the TNBC data, we compare two groups of tumors that are separated into “compartmentalised” and “mixed” groups based on the degree of tumor-immune cell interactions. This separation of tumors gives two groups with explicit differences in their TMEs, making a useful data set for the demonstration of our model. The model demonstrates good predictive accuracy, and identifies expected specific cell relationships, and interactions of interest. The lung cancer data shows our model can also detect lack of differences in cell relationships. Throughout this paper we have assumed homogeneity of the underlying spatial point processes in defining the K functions used in the model

. In this paper, we present a general framework for analyzing and identifying useful spatial relationships in the TME through predicting an outcome of interest. The method we propose uses a novel combination of spatial statistics and functional data analysis, in conjunction with methods in ensemble machine learning. The application of functional data analysis to spatial point pattern data is a recent development [31–35]. Our approach begins by producing K functions for the different cell-cell, ( or alternatively marker-marker ), interactions within images. After performing dimension reduction using functional principal components analysis [36], these data are combined with non-functional patient meta-data, such as age or sex, and a modified random forest model is used to predict the patient outcome. Motivated by [37], in order to evaluate the predictive power of the spatial interactions, “knock-off” point patterns that mimic the spatial data in the TME are generated, via permutation, independently of the responses. The importance of specific spatial interactions in predicting the response are evaluated by comparison to the predictive power of the knock-off spatial patterns. This approach overcomes the challenge of distinguishing important spatial interactions among many potential interactions of interest, i. e. it controls the false discovery rate. It also lends itself to the generation of easy-to-interpret plots showing which interactions are useful in predicting the response. Moreover, it grants high power for even a relatively few number of cells due to the robustness of the K functions, and high power even with small sample sizes. Small sample sizes are a relatively common obstacle for this type of data. To our knowledge the method we propose is the first to evaluate for the importance of spatial interactions in the TME that may vary over distance with a large number of potential cell interactions

Recent advances in cancer treatment, such as immune checkpoint inhibition and other cancer immunotherapies, have sparked a growing interest in studying the cellular composition and spatial organization of the tumor microenvironment ( TME ). The latest innovations in imaging technologies allow for single cell resolution of specific proteins, facilitating in-depth study of the spatial arrangement of cell types within the TME. A wide variety of technologies are available for this purpose, each with different benefits and trade-offs [1–7]. For a review of the available technologies see [8]. In comparing TME data, different spatial relationships between cell types, e. g. between tumor cells and specific immune cell populations, and/or individual proteins, often appear predictive of patient outcomes and may guide therapeutic interventions; see for example [9]. Comparisons between cancer subtypes, e. g. hormone-positive versus hormone-negative breast cancers, or lung squamous cell carcinoma vs lung adenocarcinoma, may provide novel insight into tumor biology and guide the development of treatments. A further goal is to identify specific spatial relationships observed in particular patient’s tumor that are useful in predicting an outcome, such as patient survival or response to therapy. Recent results demonstrate that TME data can be used for such prediction in a variety of tumor types [10, 11]. We consider such prediction problems for data sets generated from tumors imaged with Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging ( MIBI ) by means of the MIBIscope in this paper. The MIBIscope uses ion-beam ablation and time-of-flight mass spectrometry to detect up to approximately 40 protein markers on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tissue. Thus, it provides comprehensive data on cell characteristics and their localisation at a single-cell resolution of around 250–400nm [12, 13]

. Such data collected on the TME can be considered as marked spatial point patterns [14–16]. The cell locations can be considered as points within the pattern, with cell phenotypes and/or protein markers giving the “marks”. An example of such a point process generated from a tumor imaged using MIBIscope is shown in Fig 1a [12]. Existing methods developed to study cellular interactions in the TME have exploited cell neighborhood analysis in which the spatial relationship between a cell of interest and its neighboring cells can reveal particular cell-cell interactions associated with a disease state or changes associated with response to therapy; see e. g. [17]. Pairwise cell-to-cell distance calculations over iterations of randomized permutations has also been used to identify relevant cell-cell interactions [18]. However, the substantial number of cell types present in the TME leads to a very large number of potential pairwise interactions creating a major challenge in finding interactions that may be meaningful and statistically significant in predicting outcomes of interest. There is ongoing interest in applying spatial statistics methods to similar biological data sets, e. g. [19–21]. A common method of analysing spatial point patterns, such as those that arise in TME imaging, is to consider Ripley’s K function [22–24]. The K function describes the distribution of inter-point distances in a given point pattern, giving an indication as to whether points in the pattern ( e. g. cells ) are clustered or dispersed with respect to one another. The K function, along with other summary functions from spatial statistics, has previously been employed in the analysis of the TME [25–31]. An example of a K function showing the relative distribution of a specific immune cell type around tumor cells within a MIBIscope image from a triple negative breast cancer patient is shown in Fig 1b

. We apply the proposed methods to two MIBIscope data sets; a data set of triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) patients, and a data set consisting of both lung squamous cell carcinomas ( LUSC ) and lung adenocarcinomas ( LUAD ). Regarding the TNBC data, our method was accurately able to identify clustered versus dispersed tumors when compared to [12], and was additionally able to identify important cell spatial interactions in making that determination. Our method also indicated that there did not appear to be measurable differences in the spatial arrangement of tumor and immune cell types, as measured by homogeneous K functions, between the LUSC and LUAD groups. Whilst the methodology presented here is motivated by, and applied to, MIBIscope data, it can be applied to similar data generated by other technologies, e. g. OPAL, Phenocycler Fusion, Merscope, Xenium and Cosmx [43–49]. Furthermore, the methodology can easily extend beyond two-dimensions to higher-dimensional images, another area of active research [50]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the section Materials and methods, we give a detailed description of the data we consider and the methods to analyze them, including sub-sections on how we fit a modified random forest in this setting, and how we evaluate the statistical significance and uncertainty in measuring the variable importance of spatial interactions of cell types as encoded by K functions. In the Results section, we present the results of applying our method to the TNBC and lung cancer data. In the Discussion, we discuss the implications of our results and limitations of the method.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Abnormally strong neural synchronization may impair brain function, as observed in several brain disorders. We computationally study how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure co-emerge, in particular, during ( de ) synchronization processes and how they are affected by external perturbation. To investigate the impact of different types of plasticity mechanisms, we combine a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with different synaptic weight and/or structural plasticity mechanisms: ( i ) only spike-timing-dependent plasticity ( STDP ), ( ii ) only homeostatic structural plasticity ( hSP ), i. e., without weight-dependent pruning and without STDP, ( iii ) a combination of STDP and hSP, i. e., without weight-dependent pruning, and ( iv ) a combination of STDP and structural plasticity ( SP ) that includes hSP and weight-dependent pruning. To accommodate the diverse time scales of neuronal firing, STDP, and SP, we introduce a simple stochastic SP model, enabling detailed numerical analyses. With tools from network theory, we reveal that structural reorganization may remarkably enhance the network’s level of synchrony. When weaker contacts are preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning, synchrony is achieved with significantly sparser connections than in randomly structured networks in the STDP-only model. In particular, the strengthening of contacts from neurons with higher natural firing rates to those with lower rates and the weakening of contacts in the opposite direction, followed by selective removal of weak contacts, allows for strong synchrony with fewer connections. This activity-led network reorganization results in the emergence of degree-frequency, degree-degree correlations, and a mixture of degree assortativity. We compare the stimulation-induced desynchronization of synchronized states in the STDP-only model ( i ) with the desynchronization of models ( iii ) and ( iv ). The latter require stimuli of significantly higher intensity to achieve long-term desynchronization. These findings may inform future pre-clinical and clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive stimulus modalities aiming at inducing long-lasting relief of symptoms, e. g., in Parkinson’s disease.

   . Incorporating all three in a computational study thus poses the challenge of maintaining such distinct timescales while keeping the network model computationally less costly so that a detailed analysis of the network dynamics may be conducted. Here, we combine the LIF neuron model with a standard additive STDP rule and introduce a stochastic SP rule that adds and eliminates synaptic contacts based on the firing rate of a postsynaptic neuron and the weight of the contacts. The network model maintains the distinction between the timescales of neuronal activity and plasticity mechanisms. The stochastic SP method is computationally fast and we compare it with a prevailing method introduced in Ref. [61], referred to as Butz and van Ooyen SP ( BvOSP ) in this study, which is neuroscientifically informed but computationally costlier [20]. We show that our stochastic SP method produces network dynamics similar to those by BvOSP. We aim to study the effect of the two distinct plasticity mechanisms ( synaptic weight and structural ) on the dynamical states of the network and to understand the co-evolution of network activity and structure ( synaptic reorganization ). As shown computationally, stimulus responses of neural networks with STDP may significantly differ from stimulus responses in networks with fixed coupling strength, i. e., fixed synaptic weights [21, 23, 24, 33, 62, 63]. STDP may cause a multistability [64, 65], and properly designed stimuli may move networks from one attractor to another, qualitatively different attractor, in this way causing long-term stimulus effects that persist after cessation of stimulation [21, 23, 24, 33, 62, 63]. In general, stimulus-induced reshaping of adaptive systems may have various applications in various fields of applications [66]

Different implementations of adaptive neuronal networks with synaptic plasticity, both weight and structural plasticity, have been used to study either the properties of emergent network structures in the equilibrium [46, 47, 106] or the resulting synchronization dynamics [20, 50–53]. Synchronization is an emergent phenomenon arising from the interaction of the nodes and the structure of a network. Thus, it is essential to capture the complex interactions between neuronal dynamics and synaptic plasticity during transitions to and in steady ( de ) synchronized states in plastic neuronal networks. Previously, synchronization was studied using simpler models of SP with phase oscillators that preserved the number of contacts and preferentially connected the oscillators that either had similar average frequencies [51] or were more out-of-phase [50], which led to stronger clustered or global synchrony, respectively. Recently, synchronization was studied with detailed neuron models combined with synaptic weight and SP models [20, 52, 53]. However, these studies either did not capture the interaction of synaptic weights and structural change by excluding weight-dependent pruning [20, 52] or imposed homeostatic constraints on the node degrees rather than employing an average activity-based hSP rule [53]. In the present study, we captured the interactions of neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and structural changes while maintaining distinct timescales of the three by employing STDP that connected neuronal spiking and synaptic weight change, hSP that connected average neuronal activity ( firing rate ) and structural change, and weight-dependent pruning that captured the interaction of synaptic weight and structural dynamics. A neuroscientifically informed SP model, BvOSP [61], has been successfully used in many studies, for example, to generate networks from unconnected neurons and study their reorganization [49, 61, 83]

Neurons form networks that are plastic in nature. The spiking dynamics of neurons, the weight ( transmission efficiency ) of the synaptic contacts, and the structure of the networks can change with time [1–4]. The plastic nature of neuronal networks enables learning and memory [5, 6], stabilization of networks in spontaneous and experience-induced conditions [7, 8], and recovery and rehabilitation after stroke and injuries [9–11]. Alterations in neural plasticity may support pathological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) [12, 13] and epilepsy [14]. Models of plastic neuronal networks are used to study the functioning of specific brain areas in healthy and disordered conditions and to develop therapeutic stimulation methods [15–20]. Plastic networks of leaky integrate-and-fire ( LIF ) model neurons have been used to design and validate effective stimulation methods such as coordinated and random reset ( CR and RR ) stimulation [21–24], which leverage the synaptic weight plasticity to induce therapeutic effects. The weight of a synaptic contact can change depending on the exact timing of the spikes of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons [25, 26]. This mechanism is termed STDP [26–28]. Networks of LIF neurons with STDP can display bistablily by residing in either a synchronized or a desynchronized state [21–24], which mimic the pathological and physiological states, respectively, in the subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) and Basal Ganglia of patients with PD [29–31]. Stimulation can be employed to counteract abnormal synchrony and induce long-term desynchronization [24, 32–34]. In the case of Alzheimer’s Disease ( AD ), the desynchronized spiking and decoupling of neurons is observed during disease progression [35, 36]. The re-synchronization of the fast-spiking interneurons restores the gamma oscillations in the hippocampus, reducing the impairment of cognitive function in AD patients [37]

. Higher values of the average node degree may cause cluster states. It indicates that high connectivity does not necessarily favor the synchronized activity of neuronal networks with STDP-only, in agreement with a previous study [107]. This is also in agreement with pre-clinical evidence. For instance, in Parkinsonian mice, an increase in cortico-STN coherence was accompanied by a substantial ( 50%-75% ) decrease in the number of cortico-STN synapses [108]. We examined how the heterogeneous networks evolved with hSP-only. hSP has been used to automatically generate networks that evolve to attain a target activity level [49, 81, 82]. We generated networks using BvOSP and stochastic SP separately from completely unconnected neurons that built contacts in order to reach a given target firing rate, fT. The neurons with a natural firing rate below fT could build new incoming contacts while the ones with higher rates could not. Consequently, a sufficiently large fT led to a sufficiently large average node degree that enabled the network to settle in a synchronized state while a lower target allowed only for desynchronized or partially synchronized states. Our stochastic SP method, thus, offers a simpler way to generate networks with the desired level of activity and synchrony. Next, we developed networks from unconnected neurons using STDP+SP ( Pw > 0 ) and STDP+hSP ( Pw = 0 ) and compared their transition to synchronized states as a function of network density with networks generated using hSP-only and the random networks with STDP-only. The network developed from scratch using hSP-only required the highest average node degree to achieve synchrony, while the network with STDP-only could get synchronized with a much smaller average node degree. The smallest average node degree was required by the networks with STDP+SP and STDP+hSP to reach a synchronized state

. The convergence to steady state is determined using Eq 19, where nmin is set to 60, and nmax is set to 1000, and the time step-size is set to 0.01. The networks with ST+SP and STDPSP converged to a synchronized state faster than the networks with h-only and ST-only. The networks with ST+ and ST converged to a synchronized state faster than the networks h-only and ST. The networks with ST+ and ST converged to a synchronized state faster than the networks h and ST. The networks with ST and ST converged to a state faster than the networks h and ST. The networks ST and ST converged to a state faster than the h and ST. The networks and ST converged to a faster than h ST. The networks ST converged to faster than h.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Some animals can regenerate large missing regions of their nervous system, requiring mechanisms to restore the pattern, numbers, and wiring of diverse neuron classes. Because injuries are unpredictable, regeneration must be accomplished from an unlimited number of starting points. Coordinated regeneration of neuron-glia architecture is thus a major challenge and remains poorly understood. In planarians, neurons and glia are regenerated from distinct progenitors. We found that planarians first regenerate neurons expressing a Delta-encoding gene, delta-2, at key positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Planarian glia are specified later from dispersed Notch-1-expressing mesoderm-like phagocytic progenitors. Inhibition of delta-2 or notch-1 severely reduced glia in planarians, but did not affect the specification of other phagocytic cell types. Loss of several delta-2-expressing neuron classes prevented differentiation of the glia associated with them, whereas transplantation of delta-2-expressing photoreceptor neurons was sufficient for glia formation at an ectopic location. Our results suggest a model in which patterned delta-2-expressing neurons instruct phagocytic progenitors to locally differentiate into glia, presenting a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of numbers and pattern of cell types.

    Functional nervous system regeneration requires both neurons and glia to be de novo produced and functionally integrated together with the correct pattern. How pattern formation for these two different cell types is coordinated in regeneration is unknown. We uncovered a mechanism by which the regenerative patterning process for neurons is leveraged for regenerating the pattern for glia. Specific neuron classes are regenerated in proper numbers and in key positions in the nervous system that activate expression of a Delta-encoding gene, delta-2. Delta then locally interacts with non-neural Notch-1+ mesoderm-like progenitors, triggering local formation of glia from these progenitors. Ongoing Delta expression in neurons is also required to constitutively maintain the glia state in neighboring glial cells, further supporting the long-term coordination of these cell types ( Fig 4C ). Whereas neuron-glia choices have been found to be regulated by Notch from a common progenitor in animal development, this work shows that this same pathway can regulate glia specification and differentiation through interaction between mature neurons and an unrelated class of phagocytic progenitors. This raises the possibility that Notch has a deeply conserved role in glia specification, regardless of the progenitor source. How the precise numbers and positions for interacting cells produced from different progenitors can be matched is an important problem in regeneration. In the case of neurons and glia, the exact number and position of certain neuron classes can be variable animal-to-animal, or even between the left-to-right sides of the animals ( e. g., see Fig 3G and 3I ). Furthermore, glia are produced by a progenitor class that must differentiate at a variety of distinct positions

. These observations raised the possibility that delta-2 acts in neurons and that notch-1 acts in phagocytic progenitors during the regeneration of glia. This hypothesis presents an attractive candidate solution to the challenge of coordinated regeneration between neurons and glia, where contact between Delta-2 on neurons and Notch-1 on phagocytic progenitors could specify those progenitors to choose the glia fate and differentiate. Inhibition of abundant neural transcription factors ( TFs ), like coe and sim decreased glia numbers in the neuropil [11], and the inhibition of the TFs ovo and soxB1-2, which are required for the specification of eye cells and pkdl-1+ dorsal midline neurons, respectively [11, 48], was previously shown to decrease numbers of glial cells in those locations without affecting regeneration of other glial subsets ( S3D Fig and [11] ). Indeed, we found that delta-2 was expressed, among other neuronal subsets, in photoreceptor neurons ( PRNs ) in the eye, in pkdl-1+ cells at the dorsal midline and in neuronal clusters expressing the TFs coe and sim ( Fig 3E ), and that estrella+ glial cells were tightly associated with these delta-2+ neuronal classes ( Fig 3E ). delta-2 was strongly expressed in the neuronal cluster 44 ( Figs 3F and S3C ) which also expressed the TFs six1/2-2 and zfp-3 and the marker dd_17258 ( Fig 3F and S2 Table ), but this cluster did not express notch-1 ( Fig 3F ). dd_17258+ neurons are present in the head rim, highly concentrated at the auricles, and are presumptive sensory neurons [3]. We validated delta-2 co-expression with dd_17258 by FISH and showed that estrella+ cells were tightly associated with this class of neurons ( Fig 3G ). We observed that some ets-1+; SMEDWI-1+ phagocytic progenitors existed in close proximity to delta-2-expressing neurons ( opsin+ photoreceptors and dd_12758+ sensory neurons, S3E Fig )

. By having the final fate choice for glia be determined in migratory post-mitotic phagocytic progenitors, local signals from neurons interacting with these progenitors can solve these challenges, resulting in precise local coordination of pattern. The modular nature of this coordinated regeneration mechanism could also readily facilitate evolution of new configurations of glia in the nervous system, by any particular neuron population acquiring or losing expression of delta-2 and having access to dispersed phagocytic progenitors. This mechanism uncovers a novel approach for integrating glia with neurons in a regenerating nervous system, solving the challenge of specifying glia in proper numbers and locations utilizing a Delta-Notch glia-specification signaling process.

. The coordinated regeneration model also predicts that if patterned neurons are required for local differentiation of glia, then delta-2+ neurons should be regenerated and patterned before glia, and glia should appear where delta-2+ neurons form. This hypothesis is consistent with previous observations [11] and was further assessed here ( Fig 3H and 3I ). We analyzed the regeneration time course of Arrestin+ PRNs and sensory dd_17258+ neurons together with estrella+ glial cells in head blastemas following head amputation. For both of these neuronal classes, neurons were first observed within three dpa, whereas glia were first observed at five dpa ( Fig 3H and 3I ). Differentiated glial cells were always observed in tight association with these delta-2-expressing neurons, despite variability in the precise pattern of neurons, further supporting the hypothesis that interaction between delta-2-expressing neurons and notch-1+ phagocytic progenitors is required for glia differentiation. Inhibition of either six1/2-2 or zfp-3 resulted in significant decrease in the numbers of dd_17258+ cells in head blastemas ( 10 dpa ), indicating that these TF genes were required for specification of these cells ( Fig 4A ), and consequently this region of the nervous system expressing Delta-2. Accordingly, there was a significant decrease in the number of estrella+ cells in the head rim of six1/2-2 and zfp-3 RNAi animals ( Fig 4A ), but glia in other regions of the nervous system were not compromised ( Figs 4A and S4A ). In cases where sparse dd_17258+ neurons were still able to regenerate under these RNAi conditions, glial cells associated with them were observed. Moreover, the TF genes six1/2-2 and zfp-3 were not expressed in glial cells, ruling out a direct role of these genes in the specification of glia ( S4B Fig )

In animal regeneration certain cell types might need to form in correct relative numbers and positions, a problem referred to here as coordinated regeneration. For example, neurons and glia for certain contexts need to be regenerated in a coordinated architecture, even if they arise from different progenitors. We address this problem of coordinated regeneration of neurons and glia in planarians. Planarians are freshwater flatworms that belong to the Spiralian superphylum [1] and are capable of whole-body regeneration and constant tissue turnover. These processes involve a proliferating population of stem cells called neoblasts. Neoblasts are heterogeneous, being comprised of multiple fate-specified classes with distinct gene expression signatures [2–4]. Most differentiated cell types have a corresponding subset of progenitors within the neoblast compartment [3, 4]. Many invertebrates and vertebrates share multipotent progenitors that can give rise to neurons and glial cells ( Fig 1A and [5–9] ). Planarian glia have been established to be specified from “cathepsin+” or phagocytic progenitors, which are distinct from neuron progenitors [4, 10–12]. This phagocytic neoblast class also produces multiple subsets of other phagocytic cells, including pigment cells. Interestingly, these progenitors have transcriptome similarity to muscle progenitors ( shared PLOD1 and FoxF-1 expression ), indicating they have a mesoderm-like identity [3, 4]. Even though most glia in other organisms have been described to be of neuroepithelial origin ( ectoderm ), phagoc progenitors in planarians are of mesoderm origin [3,4, 10, 12]. Neurons and gl in planarians have been shown to be regenerated from distinct progenitors [4,10,12], but the mechanism of coordinated regeneration of these cell types is poorly understood. In this study, we found that planarians first regenerate neurons expressing delta-encoding gene, delta-2 at key positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Plan glia are specified from Notch-1-expressing meserm-like phocytic progenitors. Inhibition of delta-2 or notch-1 reduced gl in planarians, but did not affect the specification of other phocytic types. Loss of delta-2-expressing neurons prevented differentiation of gl associated with them, whereas transplantation of delta-2-express photoreceptors was sufficient for gl formation at ectopic. Our results suggest a model in which patterned delta-2-express neurons instruct phoc progenitors to differentiate into gl, a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of numbers and pattern of cell types

The authors of this study aimed to investigate the mechanism of coordinated regeneration of neurons and glia in planarians. They found that planarians first regenerate neurons expressing delta-encoding gene, delta-2 at key positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems, and glia are specified from Notch-1-expressing mes-like phytic progenitors. Inhibition of delta-2 or notch-1 reduced gl in planarians, but did not affect the specification of other phytic types. Loss of delta-2-expressing neurons prevented differentiation of gl associated with, whereas transplantation of delta-2-express photore neurons was sufficient for gl formation at ectopic. Their results suggest a model in which pattern delta-2-express neurons instruct phytic progen to differentiate into gl, a mechanism for regeneration of numbers and pattern of cell.

    Title: 
    Abstract: New HIV vaccine approaches are focused on eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies. We characterized early gamma-delta ( γδ ) T cell responses starting from pre-acquisition and during acute HIV infection ( AHI ) in participants previously characterized for neutralization breadth development. We found significant differences in γδ T cell surface marker expression in participants that developed neutralization breadth compared to those that did not. Activation of γδ T cells occurred within the first weeks of HIV acquisition and associated with viral load. Expression of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells and CD57 on Vδ2 T cells were found to be significantly higher in broad neutralizers during AHI, and associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later. In addition, the levels of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells was associated with early production of founder virus Env-specific IgM. Thus, γδ T cells may promote development of neutralization breadth, which has implications for HIV vaccine strategies.

   . Here, we investigated γδ T cells prior to HIV-acquisition and during acute HIV infection ( AHI ) in RV217 individuals previously identified as ‘broad’ and ‘non-broad’ neutralizers, and determined their relationship with viral replication as well as bNAb elicitation. We found that Vδ2+ T cells were significantly reduced during early AHI and their loss was associated with viral load. On the contrary, Vδ1 T cells expansion occurred only during chronic HIV infection ( CHI ), and was not associated with viral load. Expression levels of CD16 on Vδ1+ T cells as well as CD57 on Vδ2+ T cells during AHI were higher in participants that developed breadth and were significantly associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later. Furthermore, levels of CD16 expression on Vδ1+ T cells were associated with early founder Env specific IgM production. Our results suggest that γδ T cells might be important for early promotion of B cell engagement following HIV-1 acquisition and subsequent development of neutralization breadth.

The frequency of Vδ2+ T cells was lower at day 18 post first HIV-1 positive test in the participants that developed neutralization breadth, probably reflecting the higher peak VL in those participants. CD16 levels on both Vδ1+ and Vδ2+ T cells as well as CD57 levels on Vδ2+ T cells were found to be higher on participants that developed neutralization breadth. These differences were specific to γδ T cells as we did not observe differences in CD16 nor CD57 levels at any time points on conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells or NK cells between participants who developed neutralization breadth and those who did not. Due to the small number of participants included in our study, it will be important to confirm these findings in larger cohorts. However, the prospective cohort allowed us to show that expression of these two markers was not modulated by HIV-1 and that significant differences were already present pre-HIV acquisition for CD16 and CD57 levels on Vδ2+ T cells. Infections with HCMV and malaria have been reported to increase expression of these markers by γδ T cells [48, 62]. In our cohort, the levels of antibodies against PfCSP c-term, indicative of exposure to malaria sporozoite, showed a positive association with CD16 expression on Vδ1+ T cells, suggesting that malaria exposure might contribute to the phenotype of γδ T cells associated with the development of neutralization breadth, but other unidentified factors might also be important. The distribution of expression level of the markers identified in this study and the associated quantiles were based on a subset of participants that met pre-specified criteria and may differ from that of the general population. This potential limitation is inherent in studies based on selected subsets, but we believe that our results provide valuable biological insights. The mechanism by which γδ T cells could promote the development of neutralization breadth remains to be investigated

. CD16 expression by Vδ1+ T cells was associated with B cell engagement during AHI, suggesting that these cells might promote the initial founder-specific naïve B cell response to HIV-1. One possibility is that γδ T cells could differentiate into antigen presenting cells following engagement of CD16 with opsonized target cells [26]. Since neither CD16 nor CD57 expression by Vδ2+ T cells was associated with B cell engagement during AHI, it is possible that these cells have a different mechanism of action compared to Vδ1+ T cells. Vδ2+ T cells may be involved in B cell differentiation pathways after the initial interaction between the founder Env and naive B cells. In support of this hypothesis, treatment with phosphoantigens and IL-2 to activate and expand Vδ2+ T cells during chronic SIV infection increased titers of Env-specific antibodies [63]. Additional studies could benefit from incorporating tissue sample, such as lymph nodes, analysis for γδ T cell responses when evaluating factors that influence the development of neutralization breadth. Understanding the mechanism by which γδ T cells promote the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies could help develop strategies targeting these cells to improve vaccine induced humoral immune responses, especially the induction of broad and potent neutralizing antibody to HIV-1 Env. In conclusion, we have shown that loss of Vδ2+ T cell occurs early during AHI and is associated with VL while expansion of Vδ1+ T cells occurs later during CHI and is associated with CD4 T cell activation. Importantly, we observed higher levels of CD16 and CD57 on γδ T cells in participants that developed neutralization breadth. Levels of CD16 on Vδ1+ T cells were associated with early founder Env specific IgM levels, suggesting that CD16+ Vδ1+ T cells may promote B cell engagement with Env during AHI.

Previous cross-sectional studies in PLWH suggested a role for γδ T cells in disease progression. Furthermore, γδ T cells are known to have the capacity to regulate B cell responses. In this study, we evaluated the frequency and phenotype of γδ T cells longitudinally starting from pre-HIV acquisition and during untreated AHI in participants with or without neutralization breadth [16], allowing us to evaluate the contribution of γδ T cells to initial control of viral replication and to the promotion of humoral immune responses. Vδ2+ T cells were depleted from peripheral blood as early as day 18 post first HIV-1 RNA positive test and their frequency was inversely associated with VL, suggesting a direct impact of HIV-1 on these cells. The reduced frequency of Vδ2 T cells in PLWH has been suggested to results from both direct infection [52] and indirect mechanism involving CCR5 and α4β7 signaling [53]. On the contrary, expansion of Vδ1+ T cells was observed only during CHI and was not associated with VL but with sCD30, a marker of T cell activation. Accordingly, Vδ1+ T cell frequency during CHI was associated with conventional CD4, but not CD8, T activation. Taken together, this suggests that similar factors might be driving the expansion of Vδ1+ T cells and CD4 T cell activation during untreated CHI. Microbial translocation has been associated with immune activation during CHI [54] and was suggested to be responsible for the increased frequency of Vδ1+ T cells in SIV infection [55]. However, we did not find an association between sCD14 or sCD163, two markers of monocyte activation used as surrogate for microbial translocation, and Vδ1 T cells frequency during CHI. HCMV has also been reported to contribute to chronic T cell activation in PLWH [56] and to drive the expansion of Vδ1+ T cells in transplant recipients following reactivation [57, 58] and in primary immunodeficiency [59]

First, to determine the dynamics of γδ T cell responses during AHI and CHI, Vδ1+ and Vδ2+ T cells from 22 selected RV217 participants, who were previously identified as ‘broad’ ( N = 11 ) and ‘non-broad’ neutralizers ( N = 11 ) [16] ( Table 1 ) were sorted ( Fig 1A and S1 ) from PBMC samples collected at median −185 ( pre-acquisition ), 18 ( corresponding to peak VL ), 42 ( corresponding to set point VL ), and 980 days ( CHI ) following the first detection of HIV RNA in the blood. Longitudinal changes in γδ T cell frequency and expression markers were assessed. Vδ1+ T cells significantly increased by a median of 1. 1-fold and up to 2. 2-fold during CHI compared to pre-acquisition ( Fig 1B ). On the contrary, a significant decrease in Vδ2+ T cell frequency was observed at 18 and 42 days following the first HIV+ test by a median decrease of 1. 35-fold for both time points and up to 2. 2 and 2. 0-fold respectively ( Fig 1C ). As a result, the ratio of Vδ2+ to Vδ1+ T cell frequency was significantly lower during CHI compared to pre-acquisition ( Fig 1D ). While no significant differences were observed in the expression of CD16+ or CD57+ by Vδ1+ T cells or Vδ2+ T cells at any time point ( Fig 1E, F, H, I ), a significant increase in Vδ1+ and Vδ2+ T cells coexpressing CD16 and CD57 was observed during CHI ( Fig 1G ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: The spread of cancer from organ to organ ( metastasis ) is responsible for the vast majority of cancer deaths; however, most current anti-cancer drugs are designed to arrest or reverse tumor growth without directly addressing disease spread. It was recently discovered that tumor cell-secreted interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner, and blockade of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors ( IL-6R and IL-8R ) with a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, significantly reduced metastatic burden in multiple preclinical mouse models of cancer. Bispecific antibodies ( BsAbs ), which combine two different antigen-binding sites into one molecule, are a promising modality for drug development due to their enhanced avidity and dual targeting effects. However, while BsAbs have tremendous therapeutic potential, elucidating the mechanisms underlying their binding and inhibition will be critical for maximizing the efficacy of new BsAb treatments. Here, we describe a quantitative, computational model of the BS1 BsAb, exhibiting how modeling multivalent binding provides key insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects and can guide therapeutic design. We present detailed simulations of the monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors to establish how antibody properties and system conditions impact the formation of binary ( antibody-receptor ) and ternary ( receptor-antibody-receptor ) complexes. Model results demonstrate how the balance of these complex types drives receptor inhibition, providing important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design.

    In this study, we have developed a model of a bispecific antibody ( BS1 ) targeting two key cell surface receptors, IL-6Rα and IL-8RB, which were recently implicated in a synergistic pathway that drives tumor metastasis [12, 28]. Our model is comprised of a series of ODEs for each of the receptors, antibodies, and antibody-receptor complexes studied. Each association and dissociation process in the system is represented as a set of terms in the ODEs, with separate terms for the formation of binary antibody-receptor and ternary receptor-antibody-receptor complexes. Related approaches have been used in other mechanistic models of bivalent antibody binding [24, 38, 39], and below we describe the differences between those works and this. We used in vitro experimental data to estimate values for the binding parameters of the model; we observed that the simulations match the experimental results and the data constrains the parameters well. Deploying the model to simulate antibody binding to cells that express one or other or both of the target receptors, and comparing to simulations of combinations of monospecific antibodies, we gleaned insights into the mechanistic differences between these potential treatments. Once one arm of the antibody binds a cell-surface receptor, the second receptor must be within reach to allow for a second binding event. The distance between antigen-binding domains of IgG antibodies generally ranges from 6 to 12 nm [54–56], but the arms are joined by a highly flexible hinge region that can allow the arms to reach up to 17 to 18 nm when fully extended [57]. Assuming uniform receptor distribution and a surface area of 1000 μm2, there would be an average distance between receptors of around 50 nm for 105 receptors/cell or 500 nm for 103 receptors/cell. However, bispecific antibodies have been demonstrated to simultaneously engage two receptors at these receptor densities [33, 58]

. Simultaneous inhibition of the IL-6/IL-8 signaling network with tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor-alpha ( IL-6Rα, hereafter denoted IL-6R ) antibody primarily used to treat rheumatoid arthritis [13], and reparixin, a small molecule allosteric inhibitor of the IL-8 receptor ( IL-8R ) that recently completed phase II clinical trials against breast cancer [14], was found to decrease in vitro cell migration and significantly decrease in vivo metastasis without affecting rates of tumor growth [12, 15]. Collectively, these data suggest that targeting IL-6, IL-8, and their receptors is a promising approach to inhibiting tumor metastasis and cancer lethality. Monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) have been a fixture in anti-cancer therapeutic regimens over the past 20 years [16, 17] due to their target specificity, in vivo stability, modular construction, and multi-faceted actions. However, monospecific mAbs have limitations, including the emergence of acquired resistance as cancer cells mutate [18]. Bispecific antibodies ( BsAbs ), antibodies engineered to simultaneously engage two different target molecules, demonstrate great potential to overcome the shortcomings of antibody drugs [19–21]. Binding in cis, i. e., with the BsAb bridging different receptors on the same cell, confers avidity, improved tissue selectivity, and reduced off-target side effects [22–24], while also reducing the likelihood of drug resistance [25]. Additionally, concurrent binding to separate targets can prevent receptor homodimerization [26] and increase treatment potency in target tissues [27]. To study and potentially better target the IL-6/IL-8 signaling network for metastasis inhibition, Yang and colleagues recently engineered a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, against IL-6R and IL-8RB ( also known as CXCR2, hereafter called IL-8R ) [28]

. Our detailed simulations of the in vitro monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the target receptors, IL-6R and IL-8R, establish how binary ( antibody-receptor ) and ternary ( receptor-antibody-receptor ) complex formation drives target inhibition. We demonstrate that the ratio between expression levels of IL-6R and IL-8R is crucial to bispecific antibody binding in vitro and leads to significant differences in monospecific and bispecific antibody behavior. Simulations also predict necessary antibody concentrations for optimal binding, namely that the most stable antibody-receptor complex formation occurs at high receptor concentrations and intermediate antibody concentrations. Overall, our model simulations with different antibody constructs clarify the effects of binding domain affinity and target expression on receptor inhibition, providing insight that is applicable not only to our particular BsAb system, but also more broadly to bispecific antibody therapeutic design.

. Based on our current results, we hypothesize that cells that express a high concentration of only one receptor may act as “sinks” for monospecific antibodies, while the bispecific antibodies could preferentially bind to cells that express both receptors. Beyond local tissue binding, target expression on healthy cells could also impact antibody distribution and clearance from the body. Pharmacokinetic models of bispecific antibodies have previously been described [69, 70], and extending our model to include circulation of the drug and its transport into the target tissue would enable study of the full treatment dynamics for monospecific versus bispecific antibodies. The binding of bispecific antibodies is governed by the intricate relationships between inherent binding affinity, combined multivalent avidity, therapeutic concentration, and target expression. Here we presented a mechanistic, computational model for antibodies targeting IL-6R and IL-8R, comprised of a series of ordinary differential equations describing antibody binding dynamics. We fully parameterized the model from existing data, and our simulations closely match experimental data of monospecific and bispecific antibodies binding to cells expressing different levels of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors. Model results describe the system dynamics and reveal key mechanisms underlying bispecific antibody behavior. The model also predicts the consequent receptor occupancy due to the antibodies, as well as the distribution of receptors into binary ( antibody-receptor ) and ternary ( receptor-antibody-receptor ) complexes; ultimately, the impact on receptor complex formation, rather than the amount of receptor binding, is critical for therapeutic performance. We observed that the bispecific antibody studied demonstrates strong cross-linking and avidity effects, which increase receptor residence time

. While our model provides significant insight into the mechanisms of bivalent and bispecific antibody binding, expanding the model to include additional processes and other cell types has the potential to give even more insight into these treatments. Physiologically, monoclonal antibodies are ultimately eliminated from the body via receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequent intracellular catabolism [66], and higher affinity antibody binding leads to greater rates of endocytosis and degradation [67]. While receptor synthesis, internalization, and degradation were assumed to be negligible in modeling antibodies binding to cultured cells, given the importance of antibody-receptor complex internalization in determining the drug concentration profile and localization within tissues [67–69], it would be informative to extend the bivalent binding model presented here to include these processes. This modeling could in turn identify optimal bispecific design parameters to balance avidity with the rate of antibody endocytosis and elimination from the system. Additionally, as the aim of BS1 treatment is to inhibit IL-6/IL-8-driven metastasis, adding IL-6 and IL-8 secretion and binding to this system will allow us to directly model how antibody binding leads to ligand inhibition. Our simulation results showed that receptor expression is critical for bispecific antibody binding, both in terms of total receptor levels and in the relative amounts of the individual targets. As IL-6 and IL-8 are both pleiotropic immune factors, their receptors are also expressed on healthy white blood cells and other tissues. Modeling multiple cell types will allow us to study the impact of healthy cell expression on drug distribution and efficacy, as well as potential off-target effects.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Although centrosomes help organize spindles in most cell types, oocytes of most species lack these structures. During acentrosomal spindle assembly in C. elegans oocytes, microtubule minus ends are sorted outwards away from the chromosomes where they form poles, but then these outward forces must be balanced to form a stable bipolar structure. Simultaneously, microtubule dynamics must be precisely controlled to maintain spindle length and organization. How forces and dynamics are tuned to create a stable bipolar structure is poorly understood. Here, we have gained insight into this question through studies of ZYG-8, a conserved doublecortin-family kinase; the mammalian homolog of this microtubule-associated protein is upregulated in many cancers and has been implicated in cell division, but the mechanisms by which it functions are poorly understood. We found that ZYG-8 depletion from oocytes resulted in overelongated spindles with pole and midspindle defects. Importantly, experiments with monopolar spindles revealed that ZYG-8 depletion led to excess outward forces within the spindle and suggested a potential role for this protein in regulating the force-generating motor BMK-1/kinesin-5. Further, we found that ZYG-8 is also required for proper microtubule dynamics within the oocyte spindle and that kinase activity is required for its function during both meiosis and mitosis. Altogether, our findings reveal new roles for ZYG-8 in oocytes and provide insights into how acentrosomal spindles are stabilized to promote faithful meiosis.

   . Thus, it is also possible that in C. elegans oocytes, microtubule-bound ZYG-8 may regulate the association of motors with the microtubule lattice, affecting their activity. Further experiments will be crucial to understand the various ways that ZYG-8 contributes to the regulation of microtubule dynamics and spindle forces. In summary, our studies have provided new insights into the functions of a doublecortin-family protein in cell division. Moreover, our work has shed light on how forces are balanced within acentrosomal spindles, and on how the bipolar spindle structure is stabilized. Future studies aimed at elucidating the relationship between ZYG-8, motors, and microtubule regulatory proteins should be performed to better understand how they work together to create a stable bipolar spindle with properly balanced forces.

. Although it is known that force balance and microtubule dynamics must be precisely controlled in the acentrosomal spindle, the mechanisms by which this control is achieved are not well understood. Here, we provide insight into these mechanisms through analysis of ZYG-8, a conserved microtubule-associated protein. ZYG-8 contains a microtubule-binding doublecortin domain and a kinase domain [22]. Previous studies using a series of temperature-sensitive zyg-8 mutants demonstrated that ZYG-8 is required for proper spindle positioning in C. elegans mitotically dividing embryos [22, 23]. Moreover, analysis of astral microtubule dynamics demonstrated that ZYG-8 depletion led to reduced growth rates and increased nucleation rates, demonstrating that ZYG-8 modulates microtubule dynamics in mitosis [24]. In oocytes, ZYG-8 is required for anaphase B spindle elongation [25] and a recent study demonstrated that it excludes the microtubule crosslinker SPD-1PRC1 from the anaphase spindle, thus regulating spindle structure during chromosome segregation [26]. While this study also noted that there were metaphase spindle defects following ZYG-8 depletion, the question of how ZYG-8 facilitates proper spindle organization was not explored. Here, we show that ZYG-8 is required for both the assembly and stability of the oocyte spindle. Further, we demonstrate that ZYG-8’s kinase activity is required for its functions in both mitosis and meiosis, and we reveal important roles for this protein in modulating both microtubule dynamics and motor-driven forces within the oocyte spindle. Together, this work reveals new functions for ZYG-8 during meiosis and sheds light on how the proper structure of the oocyte spindle is achieved and maintained.

. This result demonstrated that BMK-1 provided the outward force that drove spindle bipolarization upon ZYG-8 depletion, and suggested that ZYG-8 may normally dampen the activity of BMK-1. Thus, we propose that ZYG-8 plays at least two important roles in C. elegans oocytes: 1 ) ZYG-8 regulates microtubule dynamics, to facilitate the proper turnover of microtubules within the spindle, and 2 ) ZYG-8 influences the activity of motors that walk along those microtubules, to tune the forces that build and stabilize the spindle. These two functions could be interconnected. For example, perhaps stabilizing microtubules enables motors to exert excess forces; therefore, by promoting microtubule turnover within the spindle, ZYG-8 would also indirectly dampen the activity of motors. However, it is also possible that these are separable functions and that ZYG-8 could regulate motors directly. Future experiments will be important to explore these possibilities. Notably, both of these proposed functions are consistent with ZYG-8’s localization pattern; ZYG-8 localizes broadly across the spindle, which would enable it to modulate microtubule dynamics at both the poles and midspindle, and it also co-localizes with BMK-1 throughout meiosis, making it plausible that it could also regulate the activity of this motor. In addition to spindle elongation, we also observed pole defects upon ZYG-8 depletion; spindles formed in the absence of ZYG-8 sometimes had fragmented or multiple poles. These defects are similar to those previously observed upon dynein depletion, which caused spindle poles to become broad and unfocused [8, 35]. This raises the possibility that ZYG-8, like dynein, may play a direct role in stabilizing acentrosomal poles. However, we do not favor this interpretation for a few reasons

In most cell types, centrosomes function to nucleate and organize a microtubule-based spindle [1]. However, oocytes of most species lack centrosomes and yet are able to form a bipolar spindle [2, 3]. In human oocytes, these acentrosomal spindles have been shown to be highly unstable; after bipolarity is achieved, the poles often split apart, and this instability leads to a high incidence of chromosome segregation errors [4]. The mechanisms by which oocyte spindles are formed and stabilized are thus important to understand. In recent years, C. elegans has emerged as a powerful model to dissect mechanisms that promote acentrosomal spindle assembly and maintenance, since rapid depletion methods have been developed that enable the removal of proteins from oocytes within minutes [5, 6]. These methods have made it possible to either deplete proteins prior to spindle formation, to probe for roles in spindle assembly, or to remove proteins from pre-formed spindles and then assess effects on the stability of the structure [7–9]. In C. elegans oocytes, assembly of the spindle begins with nuclear envelope breakdown. Microtubules initially nucleate and form a cage-like structure around the meiotic chromosomes. Subsequently, microtubule minus ends are sorted outwards to form multiple poles that eventually coalesce into two distinct poles [10–12]. Thus, to generate a stable spindle structure, forces must be produced during spindle assembly to sort microtubules outwards, and then these forces must be balanced after the spindle forms to maintain proper spindle size. KLP-18/kinesin-12, a plus-end directed microtubule motor, sorts microtubule minus ends outwards to establish bipolarity; depletion of KLP-18 results in a monopolar spindle in which microtubule minus ends coalesce into a single pole at the center with plus ends radiating outwards [10, 13]

. Thus, it is possible that ZYG-8 autophosphorylates itself to regulate its own localization or activity. Future studies will be important to reveal precisely how kinase activity contributes to ZYG-8’s functions during mitosis and meiosis. Importantly, our work also suggests that ZYG-8 may contribute to spindle organization and function in ways that do not involve kinase activity. We found that the zyg-8D604N kinase dead mutant had elongated bipolar spindles but did not display some of the other defects observed in the zyg-8 temperature sensitive mutants or following ZYG-8 depletion; zyg-8D604N spindles largely had organized poles and were not significantly bent. Thus, ZYG-8 likely has both kinase-dependent and independent functions. Doublecortin-family proteins have been shown to bind microtubules directly to regulate aspects of microtubule dynamics, including decreasing the catastrophe frequency and increasing the nucleation rate [32, 33, 56–60]. Since ZYG-8 localizes broadly throughout the spindle, it is possible that it directly modulates microtubule dynamics via its microtubule-binding doublecortin domain. Additionally, it is possible that ZYG-8 could impact motor activity via its microtubule-binding ability. In mammals, DCLK1 and its paralog DCLK2 have been shown to regulate microtule dynamics by binding to microtules [61, 62].

    Title: 
    Abstract: Circulating metabolite levels have been associated with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ), but the extent to which T2D affects metabolite levels and their genetic regulation remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigate the interplay between genetics, metabolomics, and T2D risk in the UK Biobank dataset using the Nightingale panel composed of 249 metabolites, 92% of which correspond to lipids ( HDL, IDL, LDL, VLDL ) and lipoproteins. By integrating these data with large-scale T2D GWAS from the DIAMANTE meta-analysis through Mendelian randomization analyses, we find 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2D, all spanning lipid-related classes except for Glucose and Tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites are causally affected by T2D liability, spanning almost all tested classes, including branched-chain amino acids. Secondly, using an interaction quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) analysis, we describe four metabolites consistently replicated in an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank, for which genetic loci in two different genomic regions show attenuated regulation in T2D cases compared to controls. The significant variants from the interaction QTL analysis are significant QTLs for the corresponding metabolites in the general population but are not associated with T2D risk, pointing towards consequences of T2D on the genetic regulation of metabolite levels. Finally, through differential level analyses, we find 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macrovascular, or both types of T2D complications, with only a few discriminating between complication classes. Of the 165 metabolites, 40 are not causally linked to T2D in either direction, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications. Overall, this work provides a map of the consequences of T2D on Nightingale targeted metabolite levels and on their genetic regulation, enabling a better understanding of the T2D trajectory leading to complications.

    Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is a common, complex disease, with a prevalence that is expected to increase dramatically, and for which the genetics has been largely described through genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) meta-analysis efforts [1–3]. The next step towards translating these associations into the clinic is to understand the biological mechanisms behind them. To this end, multi-omics data such as metabolite levels offer great promise, as they enable the study of molecular phenotypes closely implicated in the disease. A large number of metabolites have been associated with T2D, as highlighted in a recent study from Julkunen et al. [4], which described 230 metabolites as nominally associated with incident and prevalent T2D. Consistent associations between T2D risk and metabolites across studies mostly cover increases in various amino acid levels, especially branched-chain amino acids ( BCAAs ) [5–7], and dyslipidemia [4, 8]. However, the predictive value of metabolite profiles in T2D risk is still debated. Improved prediction of various complex traits using metabolite profiles over genetic scores has been shown[9], but this improvement is rather limited when compared to classical risk factors including age, sex and family history of disease [10, 11]. The limited prediction of metabolite profiles may be related to the uncertain causal role in modulating T2D risk, a question investigated using Mendelian randomization ( MR ) [12]. One particular example is BCAAs, for which some studies have described a causal effect of valine, leucine and/or isoleucine on T2D [13–15], while more recent evidence has shown no causal effect of BCAAs on T2D risk in the UK Biobank ( UKBB ) cohort [16]. Conversely, increasing evidence of a causal effect of T2D liability on metabolite profiles has been shown, with increased alanine levels caused by increased T2D liability being consistently reported [13, 17, 18]

. Here, we aim to address these questions and elucidate the metabolic consequences of T2D by investigating the links between metabolite profiles, genetics, and the risk of T2D and subsequent complications. For this, we considered profiles of 249 metabolites from the UKBB cohort [25] assessed through the Nightingale panel, mostly composed of lipids and lipoproteins classes ( around 92% of metabolites ), and covering additional classes such as amino acids ( 10 metabolites ), ketone bodies ( 4 metabolites ), glycolysis-related metabolites ( 4 metabolites ), and markers of inflammation ( 1 metabolite ). These levels were characterized for almost 275, 000 participants through two releases, which were here considered for discovery ( n = 117, 967 individuals ) and replication ( n = 156, 385 individuals ), or meta-analyzed when statistically appropriate. We first performed a bi-directional two sample MR analysis, using non-overlapping datasets for the SNP-exposure and SNP-outcome associations to limit potential bias [12]. Previous MR studies performed in the UKBB cohort have used only the first release of data for the 249 metabolites and were either limited to a few metabolites, or only investigated a single causal direction [16, 18, 26]. Secondly, we performed an interaction mQTL analysis to assess whether there is a different genetic regulation of metabolite levels between T2D patients and controls. Finally, we investigated how metabolite profiles are associated with T2D complications, and whether these associated metabolites overlap with the metabolites causally affected by T2D liability.

. Furthermore, metabolites were considered individually as exposure, which does not capture overall metabolic pathways. As expected, we observed similar causal effects of highly correlated metabolites belonging to the same class. It would be of interest to integrate metabolites together, for example through multivariate MR analyses [57] within each metabolite class, to assess their relative contribution in shaping T2D risk. In this study, we have here addressed the potential confounding effect of lipid-lowering medications in our MR analyses using restricted one-sample MR. It would however be interesting to use multivariate models to include variables such as BMI to better understand the biological pathways mediating causal relationships between T2D and metabolite profiles. While MR studies enable the assessment of causality between an exposure and an outcome, they are prone to false positives and based on the liability of the disease but not its occurrence. By using interaction models, we went one step further to describe the consequences of T2D occurrence on metabolite levels and their genetic regulation. We highlight that changes in metabolite profiles can be useful to better understand T2D disease progression, as exemplified by the metabolites associated with the risk of developing T2D complications. Altogether, our results enable a deeper understanding of the metabolic consequences of T2D and provide future directions for the study of the genetic regulation of molecular levels in T2D and its complications to better capture disease trajectory.

. In addition to investigating relationships between metabolite levels and T2D, we described for the first time, to our knowledge, differences in their genetic regulation between T2D patients and controls for 14 metabolites, of which four were replicated in an independent cohort. All of the significant variants identified were found to be significant mQTLs in the overall UKBB but were not associated with T2D risk [3]. These results suggest that deregulated levels of these metabolites are a consequence rather than a cause of the disease, in line with the observations from the bi-directional MR, where evidence is found in the reverse direction for two of these four metabolites. By performing an agnostic genome-wide scan to look for interaction signals, we have observed that all the interaction variants, which are mQTLs at a population-level, led to a decreased magnitude of metabolite genetic regulation in the T2D patients’ group compared to the control group. Additionally, we observed that these interactions resulted in attenuated differences in metabolite levels between cases and controls. The decreased magnitude of genetic regulation in cases might be explained by feedback mechanisms trying to restore homeostasis equilibrium following the occurrence of the disease. Further research is needed to validate this hypothesis and to further interpret these findings, which is challenged by the fact that significant metabolites correspond to percentages and not absolute values. On the other hand, our findings could be of clinical relevance, as for example the interaction variants identified for the percentages of L_LDL_PL, L_VLDL_TG and L_VLDL_FC in our study are regulators of CETP, a target of lipid-lowering drugs, which have been shown to correlate with diabetes incidence [56]

. Even though not replicated in the EstBB, glycine presented the strongest signal in the interaction QTL analysis in the UKBB, with a weaker genetic regulation in T2D patients compared to controls. A genetic dysregulation of glycine levels might, therefore, be involved in T2D complications etiology, but replication is needed in an independent cohort. Our findings also provide insights into the role of lipoprotein classes in T2D etiology. For example, TG levels have been described to be positively associated with T2D[40] and are known to positively correlate with glucose levels, a relationship that may be exacerbated in individuals with high polygenic risk scores for T2D[52]. TG levels, which we found to be causally affected by T2D liability and for some of which were associated with T2 complications, may therefore contribute to the development of T2 complications. Our study highlights the importance of lipoproteins in T2 etiology and the need to consider them in future studies of T2 risk prediction and prevention. Finally, we identified 165 metabolites associated with microvascular and macrovascular complications of T2, of which 40 are not causally linked to T2 in either direction, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications. These metabolites may serve as potential biomarkers for T2 complications and could be used to monitor disease progression. Overall, this study provides a map of the consequences of T2 on metabolite levels and their genetic regulation, enabling a better understanding of the T2 trajectory leading to complications and providing directions for the study of the regulation of molecular levels in T2 and its complications.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) colonizes humans asymptomatically but can also cause opportunistic infections, ranging from mild skin infections to severe life-threatening conditions. Resistance and tolerance are two ways a host can survive an infection. Resistance is limiting the pathogen burden, while tolerance is limiting the health impact of a given pathogen burden. In previous work, we established that collaborative cross ( CC ) mouse line CC061 is highly susceptible to Methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection ( MRSA, USA300 ), while CC024 is tolerant. To identify host genes involved in tolerance after S. aureus infection, we crossed CC061 mice and CC024 mice to generate F1 and F2 populations. Survival after MRSA infection in the F1 and F2 generations was 65% and 55% and followed a complex dominant inheritance pattern for the CC024 increased survival phenotype. Colonization in F2 animals was more extreme than in their parents, suggesting successful segregation of genetic factors. We identified a Quantitative Trait Locus ( QTL ) peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection. In this QTL, the WSB/EiJ ( WSB ) allele was present in CC024 mice and contributed to their MRSA tolerant phenotype. Two genes, C5ar1 and C5ar2, have high-impact variants in this region. C5ar1 and C5ar2 are receptors for the complement factor C5a, an anaphylatoxin that can trigger a massive immune response by binding to these receptors. We hypothesize that C5a may have altered binding to variant receptors in CC024 mice, reducing damage caused by the cytokine storm and resulting in the ability to tolerate a higher pathogen burden and longer survival.

   . With fully sequenced genomes, CC strains are ideal candidates for Quantitative Trait Locus ( QTL ) mapping [22, 23]. Crosses between CC strains have been successful in identifying genetic loci underlying susceptibility to seizure [24], and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [25], and Salmonella Typhimurium [26] infections. Host genetic variation plays role in sensitivity, tolerance and resistance mechanisms [27–30]. We created a large F2 intercross panel by crossing collaborative cross ( CC ) strains with known phenotypes with respect to MRSA USA300 infection, using a MRSA susceptible strain ( CC061 ) and a tolerant strain ( CC024 ). In our previous work we determined that parental CC061 mice rapidly lost weight and met our euthanasia criteria, while CC024 mice lost less weight and survived the study period [31]. Cytokine and gene expression patterns differed between these strains both before and after infection. In this work we demonstrate that survival in F1 and F2 generation followed a complex dominant pattern of inheritance for the CC024 phenotype. Colonization in F2 animals was more extreme than in the parental strains, suggesting successful segregation of genetic factors. We identified a QTL peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection. Several genes located in this QTL region suggest a mechanism for tolerance to MRSA infection.

. IL-10 was significantly increased in CC061 mice after MRSA infection ( Fig 2C ), while IL-1β, IL-4, IL-9, IL-18, IL-23, and IL-27 were significantly increased in CC024 mice after infection ( Fig 2C, 2D and 2E ). These differences in immune parameters suggest that the two strains differ in their immune response after infection. To understand the genetic components involved in tolerance after infection, we created an F1 population by crossing MRSA susceptible CC061 mice with MRSA tolerant CC024 mice. We infected 14 animals from the F1 generation and compared their phenotypes with those of their parents. The median survival for the F1 generation was seven days, similar to CC024 mice and significantly higher than CC061 mice ( Fig 3A ). F1 mice maintained their weight more similar to the CC024 parent, most losing less weight than the CC061 parent ( Fig 3B ). These data support a complex dominant inheritance pattern for survival in the F1 cross between CC061 and CC024 mice. Survival after MRSA infection has a genetic component and is likely linked to dominant alleles in CC024. F1 mice were bred together to generate a large panel of F2 mice to further investigate the genetic components of tolerance and susceptibility. We infected 316 F2 mice with MRSA USA300. Among the 316 mice, 175 ( 55% ) survived the 7-day study period, while the other 141 ( 45% ) met our euthanasia criteria prior to day 7. Pre-infection weight ( R = 0. 04 ) and infection dose ( R = 0. 05 ) did not correlate with survival ( S1A Fig ). In the F2 population, weight change after infection ( R = 0. 67 ) and kidney colonization ( R = -0. 57 ) correlated significantly with survival ( S1A Fig ). Survival in the F2 population was not influenced by sex ( S1B Fig ). Weight change ( P = 0. 31 ) and kidney colonization ( P = 0. 61 ) was not significantly different between the males and females in the F2 population

Host genetics plays a major role in protection against bacterial infections [43]. Infection outcome in mice is also heavily dependent on the strain of inbred laboratory mice used, suggesting strong influence of host genetics [44]. Mice lacking Nod2 ( Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 ), Myd88 ( Myeloid differentiation primary response protein ), and Tlr2 ( Toll-like receptor 2 ) are more susceptible to infection with S. aureus than mice expressing these genes [45, 46]. We investigated the genetic factors behind the tolerance to infections with MRSA USA300. We chose a susceptible strain ( C0061 ) and a tolerant strain ( CC024 ) from our previous 7 day MRSA infection screen to identify genomic regions that are involved in these phenotypes [31]. The tolerant strain, CC024, survived longer and lost less weight than CC0061, despite similar colonization, including high colonization in the kidney. After accounting for baseline strain differences, several serum cytokines differed between CC061 and CC024 mice post infection ( Fig 2C, 2D and 2E ). IL-10 is the only cytokine that was increased in the serum of CC061 mice. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by both innate and adaptive immune cells, and is a major immunoregulatory cytokine for modulating the production of several other cytokines [47–49]. Overexpression of IL-10 worsens the outcome of bacterial infections, including S. aureus infections [49]. IL-10 creates an anti-inflammatory environment by inhibiting the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [50]. IL-10 inhibits T-helper cell responses [51], and down regulates MHC class II expression [52]. IL-10 also down regulates co-stimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells [53], further decreasing T-cell activation [54]

. Complement can be activated by three pathways, which converge at the formation of C3 convertase that cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b [66]. C3b opsonizes S. aureus, while C3a activates immune cells, including macrophages and T cells [42]. C3 deficient mice are more susceptible to S. aureus infections [67, 68]. While we do not understand the mechanism underlying the baseline up-regulation of complement genes, C3 and C4b in CC024, increased expression of these immune factors may improve CC024 survival by reducing the initial pathogen load. To identify the genes needed for CC024 mice to tolerate MRSA infection despite high colonization in some organs, we generated an F2 cross between CC024 and CC061. Our data suggest that the genetic factors influencing MRSA colonization are well segregated in the F2 generation, and a complex trait controls their interaction. Survival in F2 mice ranged from 2 to 7 days post-infection, with a median of 6 days. Kidney colonization in F2 animals was roughly equivalent, irrespective of the euthanizing day. Thus, most of the F2 mice appear to be tolerant, as they survive the infection with higher bacterial loads ( Fig 4 ). Survival correlated with kidney colonization ( R = -0. 57 ) and was considered a complex trait for QTL mapping. The top candidate genes for the survival and weight change QTL in our analysis are the complement factor C5a receptors, C5ar1 and C5ar2. In the earlier stages of infection, activation of the complement system is important to clear the pathogen [41]. However, during sepsis and later stages of infection, over-activation of complement negatively impacts the immune system [69]. Among the complement factors, C5a is the most potent inflammatory mediator to increase both pro-inflammatory factors, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-8 and anti-inflammatory factors, including IL-10, IL-13, IL-4 and TGF-β [70–74]

Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) is a gram-positive bacterium that colonizes humans asymptomatically but can cause opportunistic infections ranging from mild to severe life-threatening conditions. Resistance and tolerance are two ways the host can survive infection. Resistance limits the pathogen burden while tolerance limits the impact of a given pathogen burden. In previous work, we established that collaborative ( CC ) mice are highly susceptible to Methicillin-resistant S. aureus ( MR, USA ) while CC are tolerant. To identify host genes involved in tolerance after S.us infection we crossed CC and CC mice to generate F and F populations. Survival after MR infection in the and F generations was 65 and 55 and followed a complex inheritance pattern for CC increased survival. Colonization in F animals more than their parents suggesting segregation of genetic factors. We identified Quantitative Trait ( Q ) peak on chromosome for survival and weight after infection. this Q the W/EJ ( W ) allele in CC contributed to their MR tolerant phenotype Two genes C5 and5 have high-impact in this region C5 and5 are receptors for complement C5 anaphylato that trigger a massive response by binding these. We hypothesize C5 may altered to receptors in CC mice reducing caused by cytokine storm resulting in ability to tolerate higher pathogen and longer survival

The article discusses the genetic factors that contribute to tolerance to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in mice. The researchers used a cross between two strains of mice, CC061 and CC, which were previously shown to be susceptible and tolerant to MRSA, respectively. The F1 and F2 generations were infected with MRSA, and the results showed a complex inheritance pattern of survival, with the CC mice surviving longer than the CC mice. Colonization in the F2 generation was more extreme than in the parents, suggesting segregation of genetic factors. A Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) was identified on chromosome 7 for survival and weight after infection, with the W/EJ allele in CC contributing to the tolerant phenotype. Two genes, C5 and C5, were found in this region, which are receptors for complement C5, anaphato that can trigger a massive response by binding. The researchers hypothesize that C5 may have altered receptors in CC mice, reducing the cytokine storm and allowing them to tolerate a higher pathogen and survive longer.

The article also discusses the role of host genetics in protection against bacterial infections, and how infection outcome in mice is dependent on the strain used. Mice lacking N2, Myd, and T2 are more susceptible to S. aureus than mice expressing these genes. The researchers investigated the genetic factors behind tolerance to MRSA and chose a susceptible and tolerant strain to identify genomic regions involved. The tolerant strain survived longer and lost less weight than the susceptible, despite similar colonization. Accounting for baseline differences, several cytokines differed post-infection, with IL-10 being the only one increased in the susceptible mice. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by innate and adaptive cells, and a major immunoregulatory cytokine modulating production of other cytokines. Overexpression of IL worsens the outcome of infections, including S aureus. IL-10 creates an anti-inflammatory environment inhibiting production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. IL-10 inhibits T-cell responses and regulates MHC class expression. IL-10 also regulates co-stimulatory on antigen-presenting cells, decreasing T-cell activation.

The complement can be activated by three pathways, converging at formation C convert that cleaves C into C and C. C opizes S aureus, while C activates cells, including macrophages and T. C deficient are more susceptible S aure infections. The researchers do not understand the mechanism underlying upregulation of C and C in the tolerant strain, but increased expression may improve survival by reducing path load. To identify genes needed for tolerance, an F cross was generated

    Title: 
    Abstract: The tempo and mode of adaptation depends on the availability of beneficial alleles. Genetic interactions arising from gene networks can restrict this availability. However, the extent to which networks affect adaptation remains largely unknown. Current models of evolution consider additive genotype-phenotype relationships while often ignoring the contribution of gene interactions to phenotypic variance. In this study, we model a quantitative trait as the product of a simple gene regulatory network, the negative autoregulation motif. Using forward-time genetic simulations, we measure adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both additive and network models. A key expectation from adaptive walk theory is that the distribution of fitness effects of new beneficial mutations is exponential. We found that both models instead harbored distributions with fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected. The network model also had a complex and bimodal distribution of fitness effects among all mutations, with a considerable density at deleterious selection coefficients. This behavior is reminiscent of the cost of complexity, where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. Our results suggest that the interactions emerging from genetic networks can generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness effects.

    In this study, we explored how a simple gene network might influence trait evolution during an adaptive walk scenario. Models of adaptation have traditionally relied on direct genotype-phenotype relationships [42, 95, 96], overlooking the intricate gene interaction networks that drive trait expression at different stages of development ( but see [68, 70, 71] ). Understanding how genetic networks influence adaptation is an under-explored area of research, particularly in the study of DFEs. We observed that both network and additive models exhibit similarities in key aspects of their adaptive walks, specifically the number of adaptive steps and the distribution of fitness effects among both fixations and beneficial mutations ( Figs 3 and 4 ). However, the characterization of the DFE among beneficial mutations was sensitive to the estimation method employed. Utilizing a pooling approach under the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem leads to a homogenization of the shape parameter κ, nudging the distribution towards the Gumbel domain, and thus suggesting exponential spacing between adjacently-ranked beneficial alleles [17]. The averaging effect of pooling samples can mask underlying Fréchet or Weibull behaviors in κ, effectively reducing our ability to discriminate between different extreme value distributions. In contrast, using a non-pooled approach preserves the contributions of each replicate’s unique combination of mutations to the shape parameter, improving the detection of non-Gumbel behavior. However, this is not always possible in experimental studies where the number of beneficial mutations obtained per round of adaptation is small. Under these conditions, pooling between replicates is required to reduce the risk of incorrectly rejecting a Gumbel distribution [17, 88]. We suggest that researchers should be cautious of the homogenization effect of the pooling approach when estimating the DFE among beneficial mutations

Our network approach contributes methodologically to the field and holds broad applicability to many open questions in evolutionary biology, from quantitative genetics to the mechanisms underpinning adaptability. It offers a robust framework to investigate issues such as the maintenance of genetic variation, the evolution of recombination, and the dynamics of adaptation from both standing variation and de novo mutations. We have introduced how networks can generate epistasis, with implications for the evolution of recombination, maintenance of linkage, and the trade-offs between network complexity and adaptability. Our study here shows that networks can create complex distributions of fitness effects that differ from additive expectations. While promising, it is essential to acknowledge the model’s limitations, particularly concerning its computational demands and simplifications, which future work should aim to address. Empirical validation through evolutionary experiments will be crucial in assessing our model’s real-world applicability. Expanding into adaptation by standing variation will further illuminate the role of genetic interactions during polygenic adaptation. As detailed systems models of complex traits become increasingly available, our framework can be employed to simulate the evolution of traits based on empirically-described networks. The utility of our model also extends beyond evolutionary biology, offering valuable insights for interdisciplinary collaborations that aim to integrate molecular biology, computational science, and statistical genetics. Future work should focus on leveraging this interdisciplinary potential and on exploring more complex genetic networks to better understand how gene interactions constrain evolution.

. For the network models, mutations were applied separately to αZ and βZ, while in the additive models, the mutation effect was added to the quantitative trait value. We then recalculated the phenotypic and homozygous fitness effects of the sampled mutations using the fitness effect calculation methods described above. The source code for this experiment can be found at https://github. com/nobrien97/NARAdaptiveWalk2023. To tie the mutant screen findings to a quantitative measure of adaptation, we used the mutant screen fitness effect distribution to estimate the expected waiting time to a beneficial mutation between models. We first calculated waiting times, twait for a particular simulation replicate at a given adaptive step using the equation t wait = 1 4 N μ p s > 0 ( 10 ) where N is the population size, μ is the per-locus, per-generation mutation rate, and ps>0 is the probability that a new mutation is beneficial. N is multiplied by 4 because the population is diploid, and because there were two loci contributing to the trait. ps>0 is given by p s > 0 ≈ m s > 0 m where m is the total number of mutations generated in the in silico mutation screen experiment and ms>0 is the number of mutation screen alleles with beneficial effects on fitness. Waiting times were calculated for each adaptive step and model. Comparisons between models were done using a bootstrap analysis. We sampled 100, 000 different NAR-Additive model pairs across all adaptive steps, calculating the difference between their waiting times. We then calculated the means and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) for each model’s waiting times and the difference between models ( Δtwait ). The source code for this analysis can be found at https://github. com/nobrien97/NARAdaptiveWalk2023. A flowchart describing this methodology is shown in S3 Fig

. This may not be the case: Cowperthwaite et al. [125] found that the fitnesses of simulated RNA mutations were correlated with those mutations’ wild-type genotypes, violating the Gillespie-Orr model’s assumptions. When mutations are correlated with the wildtype, the adaptive walk might be elongated, as the fitness benefit of a mutation is reduced relative to an uncorrelated beneficial allele [126]. However, work by Orr [127] showed that most results from the Gillespie-Orr model are robust to such correlations, especially those pertaining to the first step of the walk. Our study serves as an introductory venture into the evolutionary modeling of genetic networks, elucidating how they guide evolutionary trajectories. The strong selection and weak mutation assumptions improve computational efficiency and interpretability but sideline rich polygenic dynamics [36, 85]. Our simplified NAR motif offers initial insights but lacks empirical complexity, making future work with more complex architectures important. Moving forward, our focus will shift towards a spectrum of genetic architectures to better capture non-additive effects. This will include investigating other network motifs, including several feed-forward loops. By doing so, we will enrich our understanding of how topology influences evolutionary pathways [128]. This transition will require further statistical and computational innovations to maintain feasibility. Collaborations with molecular biologists will enrich our models with further mechanistic details. Rigorous validation against empirical data and existing theories will be a cornerstone in constructing more realistic models of adaptation ( e. g. [114] ). To drive these future works, we have constructed a general form of our network model in S1 Appendix

. For instance, how does the distribution of fitness effects change when non-additive GP maps are considered? Does this affect a population’s chance to adapt to a changing environment? To address these questions, we consider a simple gene regulatory network motif to motivate our approach and implement a nonlinear GP map into adaptive walk theory. At the foundation of any trait lies a complex network of interacting genes and regulatory elements which control the expression of proteins [51]. Systems biologists employ mathematical networks known as gene regulatory networks ( GRNs ) to model such systems [52]. Empirical networks harbor startling complexity: for example, consider the circadian clock network in Arabidopsis thaliana. This network is driven by a number of interacting network motifs: small, common subnetworks with particular effects on gene expression. For instance, a feed-forward loop motif in this network generates pulses of expression in PRR9/7 [53]. In addition, a negative feedback loop ( another motif ) between CCA1/LHY and PRR5/TOC1 generates a bistable switch [53]. This switch is toggled at daybreak by the aforementioned PRR9/7 feed-forward loop and again at dusk by yet another circuit [53]. Given the complexity of many GRNs, it is common to study motifs as separate units to elucidate the reasons for their repeated recruitment into so many systems [54–56]. This allows systems biologists to probe the general effects of motifs on a broad range of networks. In this study, we focus on the simplest network motif, negative autoregulation ( NAR; Fig 2 ). This motif consists of two genes: gene X activates gene Z ( indicated by the pointed arrow in Fig 2A ), while Z’s product limits its further expression ( indicated by the flat arrow in Fig 2A ). NAR motifs are highly prevalent in biological networks. Close to half of all GRNs contain at least one N motif [57, 58]. They are also found in diverse organisms from bacteria to humans [59, 60]. The N motif’s simplicity and ubiquity make it an ideal candidate to study the influence of networks on adaptation. We model the trait as the product of the N motif, where Z’s effect on X is a nonlinear function of X’s expression. The nonlinear relationship between X and Z is given by the Hill function f ( X ) = 1 1 1 + ( X / K ) n where K is the half-maximum and n is the Hill coefficient. The Hill function is commonly used to model gene regulation [61, 62] and has been applied to various biological systems [63, 64 ]. The Hill function is sigmoidal, meaning Z’s effect on X increases as X increases, but saturates at high X. The parameter n determines the steepness of the curve, with n = 1 being linear and n > 1 sigmoidal. We chose n = 2 for this study as it is a common value in GRNs [65, 66 ]. The parameter K is the concentration at which Z’s effect on X is half-maximal. We chose K = 1 for this study as it is a common value in GRNs [65, 66 ]. The Hill function can be rewritten as f ( X ) = 1 1 1 + ( X / K ) 2 = 1 1 + X 2 X 2 / K 2 = 1 + X 2 X 2 / K 2 = 1 + X 2 X 2 / K 2 = 1 + X 2 X 2 / K 2 = 1 + X 2 X 2 / K = 2 1 + X 2 X 2 / K = 2 1 + X 2 2 / K = 2 1 + 2 X 2 / K = 2 1 + 2 2 / K = 2 1 2 + 2 2 / = 2 1 2 2 2 = 2 2 2 2 = 2 2 2 2 = 2 2 2 2 = 2 2 2 2 = 2 2 2 2 = 2 2 2 2 =2 2 2 2 =2 2 2 2 =2 2 2 2 =2 2 2 2 =2 2 2 2 =2 2 2 2 =2 2 2 2 =2 2 2 =2 2 2 =2 2 2 =2 2 =2 2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =2 =
Researchers propose a novel Bayesian framework for understanding the dynamics of conductance-based neurons and synapses, suggesting they are naturally equipped to optimally integrate information. The approach posits that apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials, parametrized by local quantities such as reversal potentials and membrane conductances. They demonstrate that under these assumptions, the somatic compartment computes the corresponding posterior distribution. A gradient-based plasticity rule allows neurons to learn target distributions and weight inputs by their relative reliabilities. The theory explains experimental findings on single-cell and multi-sensory integration, illustrating simulations, and makes experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and synapticity. 

The framework interprets the physics of cortical neurons as Bayesian computations, demonstrating conduct-based models compute posterior distributions from Gaussian functions represented in dendritic compartments. Somatic dynamics derive from gradient ascent on posterior, synaptic plasticity matches posterior to target distribution. The rule accommodates relative reliabilities by scaling weights of inputs with high correlation to target potentials given presynaptic activities. Targets may be formed by periomatic input from other modalities or informed input from cortical areas. Demonstrated learning in multisens integration with modalities different reliabilities. Cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons described driven by two inputs, 'top-down' on apical predicting 'bottom' basal [39, 40]. In this framework, adapting basal conceptualized as 'dendritic prediction of somatic' [30, 41, 42]. In Bayesian view, plasticity matches bottom to top expectations. Depending on top input, can be interpreted as matching or regularization, similar to prior in variational autoencoders [43]. Supervised learning seen as predictive, neuron as nonlinear element with dendritic predicting somatic activity, with high conduct contributing more to pooled opinion.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Protein structure prediction has now been deployed widely across several different large protein sets. Large-scale domain annotation of these predictions can aid in the development of biological insights. Using our Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains ( ECOD ) from experimental structures as a basis for classification, we describe the detection and cataloging of domains from 48 whole proteomes deposited in the AlphaFold Database. On average, we can provide positive classification ( either of domains or other identifiable non-domain regions ) for 90% of residues in all proteomes. We classified 746, 349 domains from 536, 808 proteins comprised of over 226, 424, 000 amino acid residues. We examine the varying populations of homologous groups in both eukaryotes and bacteria. In addition to containing a higher fraction of disordered regions and unassigned domains, eukaryotes show a higher proportion of repeated proteins, both globular and small repeats. We enumerate those highly populated domains that are shared in both eukaryotes and bacteria, such as the Rossmann domains, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains. Additionally, we compare the sampling of homologous groups from this whole proteome set against our stable ECOD reference and discuss groups that have been enriched by structure predictions. Finally, we discuss the implication of these results for protein target selection for future classification strategies for very large protein sets.

   . In the future, we anticipate that the results herein will guide our target selection for proteins from larger ( and sparser ) data sets. We observed that a lower fraction of individual eukaryotic proteomes was well-assigned ( 57. 6 ± 5. 5% ) on average than bacteria ( 81. 1 ± 6. 9% ). Because of this difference, we more closely examined the well-assigned domains from those proteomes and enumerated the commonalities and differences among the most populated ECOD homologous groups ( Fig 3 ). Among the eukaryotes, the ARM repeats ( discussed above ), the β-β-α Zinc fingers ( BBA Zn ), the Igl domains, and the HTH domains are the most populated homologous groups ( Fig 3A ). On the other hand, the most populated bacterial homologous groups are the HTH domains, the Rossmann-fold domains, the P-loop NTPase domains, and the TIM barrels ( Fig 3B ). Common among the most populated groups in both eukaryotes and bacteria, the Rossmann-folds, the P-loops, the Igl domains, the ARM repeats, and the HTH domains are the most populated groups. When the relative domain populations are stratified by species and normalized across species and homologous groups, we can more clearly see the contribution of certain species and H-groups to the domain population ( Fig 3C ). The BBA Zn fingers ( Fig 3D ) and the RING fingers ( Fig 3E ) ( both types of Zn finger domains ) are commonly found as components of eukaryotic transcription factors, often in repeats [41], and are more enriched in mammals and zebrafish. We found a similar enrichment of zinc-binding domains in our earlier classification of the predicted structures of the human proteome [27]. The EGF-like domain ( Fig 3F ), a small disulfide-bonded pair of β-sheets, is commonly an extracellular signaling factor but is implicated in a variety of roles in the extracellular environment, which likely explains their relative lack in bacteria and fungi

. Although the principal goal of ECOD has been the classification of proteins with experimental structures, we have recently demonstrated the utility of ECOD for domain classification in both eukaryotic [27] and bacterial ( Vibrio parahaemolyticus RIMD ) proteomes. In both cases, ECOD, combined with a recently developed structural domain parser ( DPAM ) for AlphaFold models [29, 30], classified the available residues into either domains or low-confidence and disordered regions. The resulting domains from these proteomes suggested biological insights for their respective organisms, and they were made available on the ECOD website. The flood of protein predictions after the release of AlphaFold, and the observed domain content relative to unstructured or low-confidence regions, prompted us to examine the behavior of our domain classification more closely on the broadest selection of whole proteomes. Among the available models, there is a breadth of structure quality, arising from multiple potential causes: 1 ) lack of structural context for multimeric complexes 2 ) biological disorder within proteins 3 ) conformation changes, 4 ) genome annotation, and 5 ) error in structure prediction. We suggest that domain classification from these structures, and positively identifying different types of regions within them, is necessary to use these predictions most effectively. Moreover, closely associating domains from predictions with experimental data, where possible, is one way to mitigate possible errors from the structure prediction algorithm. The classification of proteins into domains is one potential strategy for grappling with the size and quality of the data offered by large structure prediction efforts

Domain classification can reveal functional information by identifying homologous relationships between domains. By classifying whole proteomes, we can determine the prevalence of given homologous domain groups within different organisms as well as determine those domains previously unannotated by sequence methods. We classified domains from 48 whole proteomes from AFDB [32] using the DPAM v2 ( Domain Parser for AlphaFold Models ) domain assigner and ECOD develop285 as a reference [28, 30]. These proteomes included 16 notable model organisms such as Danio rerio and Drosophila melanogaster, as well as 32 organisms involved in diseases relevant to global health, such as Plasmodium falciparum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( S1 Table ). In total, we classified 746, 349 domains from 536, 808 proteins comprised of over 226, 424, 000 amino acid residues. By comparison, the reference version of ECOD ( develop285 ) used for classification contained 898, 379 domains from 599, 852 peptide chains in 179, 294 PDB depositions. These domains and their boundaries have been made available on the ECOD website ( http://prodata. swmed. edu/ecod/index_af2. php ) and have been deposited in a Zenodo repository [33]. DPAM classifies regions of AF2 models using sequence and structural aligners combined with the AF2 predicted aligned errors ( PAE ) to assist with determining globular regions, these regions are then assigned to ECOD using a neural network. In contrast to previous automated methods used to assign domains to ECOD, DPAM domains can be determined without necessarily containing a strong homologous link to the reference ( see Methods ). Per-residue domain classification categories for the 48 classified organisms reveal that eukaryotes contain more disordered and partially classified regions than either bacteria or ( the single ) archaea

Previous efforts using a prior version of the AF2 inference model ( v1 ) and a smaller selection of 21 proteomes have found that in a large percentage ( 92% ) of models, these proteomes can be partitioned into domains and assigned to the existing CATH hierarchy [31]. This work also featured manual assignment of difficult-to-assign human domains, as well as classification of domains into closely related sequence families. The division of predicted models into easily classified domains, domains with more distant or difficult-to-recognize homology, or regions that are unstructured or have no domains whatsoever will continue to be a useful strategy for grappling with these large structural datasets. Here we classify the domains from 48 whole proteomes available in the AFDB. These proteomes include a wide selection of model organisms such as zebrafish, fruit flies, and E. coli. They also include numerous organisms that cause diseases such as malaria, leprosy, and bacterial pneumonia. We examine the varying population of homologous groups among predictions from whole proteomes and the experimentally characterized protein universe. We also examine the differing classification between eukaryotes and bacteria in these predicted examples. The widespread access to proteins that were previously difficult or unamenable to structural classification dramatically diminishes the gap between structural and sequence classification. Finally, we illustrate those homologous groups that are enriched by domains and use well-known sequence domain annotations to estimate the degree to which structure prediction of proteins and classification of their domains has expanded our knowledge of previously unknown domains.

Protein domains are independent evolutionary units that convey function and fitness either singly or in concert. The study of domains and their homology is a powerful tool for studying protein function [1–3]. Homologous domains can share function, and the propagation of functional annotation from experimentally characterized proteins and their domains to their homologous yet hypothetical or uncharacterized domains can lead to biological insights [4–7]. Protein domain classifications determine and organize these homologous domains [8] and either 1 ) sequence classifications such as Pfam [9], CDD [10], or SUPERFAMILY [11] that partition protein sequence into domains and derive their taxonomy principally by sequence similarity measures or 2 ) structure classifications such as SCOP [12, 13], CATH [14], or ECOD [15] that use structural similarity to determine more distant homology ( at the cost of access to fewer proteins ). The advent of highly accurate structure prediction software may upset this traditional division. The outstanding performance of AlphaFold [16, 17] and RoseTTA [18] has enabled the prediction of protein structure from sequence with high accuracy. The AlphaFold, in particular, has been used to predict the structure of thousands of proteins [19, 20] and has been used to predict the structure of the human proteome [21, 22]. In addition, AlphaFold has been used to predict the structure of proteomes [23, 24, 25] and has been used to predict the structure of the proteome of bacteria [26]. The AlphaFold has also been used to predict the structure of the proteome of eukaryotes [27, 28] and has been used to predict the structure of the proteome of archaea [29, 30 ]. In this study, we use AlphaFold to predict the structure of 48 proteomes in the AlphaFold Database ( AFDB ) and classify the resulting structures into domains using the Evolutionary Classification of Domains ( EC ) from experimental structures as a basis for classification. We classify 746, 349 domains from 536, 808 proteins of over 226,424, 000 amino acid residues and examine the populations of homolog groups in eukary and bacteria. We find that eukotes have a higher proportion of disordered regions and unassigned domains than bacteria. We also find that eukotes have a higher proportion of repeated proteins, both globular and small. We enumerate the highly populated domains shared in both eary and bacteria, such as Rosann, TIM barrels and P-loop domains. We compare the sampling of homolog groups from this proteome against our EC reference and discuss that have been enriched by predictions. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for protein selection for future classification of large sets.

    Title: 
    Abstract: BK polyomavirus ( BKPyV ) is a major cause of kidney transplant failure, for which there are no antivirals. The current model is that BKPyV expresses TAg ( large T antigen ) early during infection, promoting cells to enter S phase where the viral DNA can access the host replication machinery. Here, we performed a single-cell analysis of viral TAg expression throughout the cell cycle to reveal that robust TAg expression required replication of the host DNA first. By using inhibitors that only affect host and not viral replication, we show that both TAg expression and viral production rely on an initial S phase. BKPyV is known to promote cellular re-replication, where the cell re-enters S phase from G2 phase ( without passing through mitosis or G1 phase ) to prolong S phase for viral replication. Thus, BKPyV infection results in cells with greater than 4N DNA content. We found that these subsequent rounds of replication of the host DNA relied on canonical host cell cycle machinery and regulators despite BKPyV infection. Together, these findings suggest a model for polyomavirus replication, where robust viral TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase and that BKPyV primarily replicates during host re-replication. Having a better understanding of the molecular events that are required for BKPyV production will help identify effective therapeutic targets against BKPyV.

    Using single-cell techniques, our studies revealed that BK polyomavirus depends on the host cell cycle for TAg expression and viral production. Our data contrasts with the model where TAg is expressed early and pushes cells into the initial S phase for viral replication. Instead, our data supports a new model whereby BKPyV requires an initial host S phase to replicate, which aligns better with the other small DNA tumor viruses such as papilloma- and adenoviruses [23, 46]. While our data agree that TAg expression is observed before the viral capsid proteins, the cells robustly expressing TAg were in late S/G2 rather than G1 even at early times post-infection. Additionally, inhibiting host replication did not result in the accumulation of TAg expression in the G1/early S phase population, but prevented robust TAg expression all together and reduced viral titers; demonstrating that TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase. If host replication was inhibited after infected cells had already reached the 4N DNA content and TAg was expressed, host replication was no longer required for maintaining TAg expression or viral production. Proteasome inhibition failed to increase TAg expression suggesting that the increase of BKPyV TAg in G2/M is not due to a shift in protein stability, as has been reported for the related MCPyV [36]. Furthermore, TAg expression was not the result of genome amplification during an initial S phase, since infecting with up to 80-fold more virions per cell still did not result in TAg+ cells in G1/early S phase. Since re-replication is rare in uninfected RPTEs and activation of the DDR is known to prevent DNA replication, we expected to find evidence of aberrant host origin licensing and firing. Instead, canonical origin licensing and firing mechanisms were required for re-replication and displayed an expected distribution of activity across the cell cycle

BK polyomavirus ( BKPyV ) is a small, double-stranded DNA virus that persistently infects the kidneys of approximately 180% of adults worldwide [1, 2]. Although BKPyV reactivation is asymptomatic in healthy individuals, it causes graft loss in kidney transplant patients and is associated with increased risk of bladder cancer [3–5]. Despite the prevalence of BKPyV and the severity of complications, there are currently no specific treatments for BKPyV reactivation [6, 7]. While BKPyV relies on the host replication machinery to replicate the viral DNA, it provides its own helicase, large tumor antigen ( TAg ) [1]. BKPyV replication using TAg and host replication machinery activates a cascade of kinases known as the DNA damage response ( DDR ), which prolongs S phase and is necessary for robust viral replication [8, 9]. Following viral replication, BKPyV expresses the structural proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3, which encapsidate newly synthesized genomes to produce infectious virions [1, 10]. While other DNA tumor viruses prevent host DNA replication through DDR activation, BKPyV uses DDR activation to induce and maintain host re-replication [8, 11, 12]. Importantly, the re-replication phenotype of the host DNA is also found in kidney biopsies from transplant patients with uncontrolled BKPyV reactivation, in which enormous, TAg+ nuclei are observed [13]. Given this requirement of host re-replication and the evidence of re-replication in vivo, a mechanistic understanding of how BKPyV induces re-replication is required. Human DNA replication is temporally separated into two steps: origin licensing and origin firing [14]. During origin licensing in M and G1, the hexameric helicase components, MCM2-7, are recruited in a sequence-independent manner to origin recognition complexes ( ORC ) bound to the cellular DNA [14, 15]

. Together, these findings change our understanding of the BKPyV life cycle to include the requirement of an initial S phase for robust TAg expression and viral production ( Fig 6 ). Our new model shares similarities with other small DNA tumor viruses while accounting for a major difference in BKPyV, which expresses the viral helicase and cell cycle regulatory domains in a single protein. Many DNA tumor viruses encode proteins that promote S phase by inhibiting pRB ( the S-phase E2F transcriptional repressor ), unwind viral DNA for replication, and inhibit p53 ( a DDR-responsive protein that can block DNA replication ) [47]. While the polyomavirus TAg performs all three functions ( pRb inhibition, DNA unwinding, and p53 inhibition ), other DNA tumor viruses use different proteins to perform these functions. By using multiple proteins, this allows for differential expression at specific stages of the viral life cycle or host cell cycle [48, 49]. While it was surprising that robust TAg expression depended on a G2 environment, it is similar to papillomaviruses where the E1 helicase is robustly expressed in G2 [46]. Although, we cannot rule out the possibility that low levels of TAg are sufficient to promote S phase by inhibition of pRb, we posit that low TAg levels are unlikely to promote S phase given that the human genome contains 20, 000 to 30, 000 E2F1 binding sites [50]. Thus, low levels of TAg expression would be insufficient to bind up all the pRB for the initial S phase and replicate the viral genome. Another possibility is that an alternative splice variant drives an initial S phase and TAg is preferentially expressed only after reaching G2. Indeed, mRNA splicing regulation is known to vary across the cell cycle [51] and the TAg variant, truncated large T antigen ( truncTAg ), contains the pRb binding domain that could drive an initial S phase induction [52]

DNA viruses often induce expression of host S phase proteins for viral replication [11]. Importantly, induction of S phase is typically coupled with cell cycle arrest to block concurrent host replication: decreasing competition with the host cell for replication resources. For example, adenoviruses and papillomaviruses arrest cells in G2 by blocking mitosis [22, 23], while herpesviruses arrest cells at the G1/S boundary [24]. BKPyV infection is unusual in that the host DNA is re-replicated and maintained re-replication is required for viral replication [8]. To achieve induction into S phase and subsequent re-replication, the current model for BKPyV infection ( Fig 1A ) supposes early TAg expression first causes S phase entry for viral replication. Since viral replication activates the DNA damage response, mitosis is blocked and the cell undergoes re-replication. Importantly, loss of the re-replicating population drastically reduces viral titers even if the number of initial S phase cells is maintained [8]. To analyze the cell cycle profiles of mock and BKPyV infected RPTEs, we used a combination of 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine ( EdU ) pulse labeling and DNA content to generate single-cell cell cycle plots ( Fig 1B ). Cells were fixed and imaged at 24, 36, 48, and 72hpi, which revealed that there was no difference in the cell cycle profile between the mock and BKPyV-infected cells at 24hpi ( Fig 1B and 1C ). Later timepoints, however, showed an increase in S phase in the BKPyV-infected cells, which was largely attributed to an increase in re-replicating cells ( Fig 1B and 1C ) as demonstrated by the significant increase in the DNA content ( mean DNA intensity ) of the S phase cells ( Fig 1D ). Given the small size of the viral genome ( 5

. Since TAg is not known to require either kinase to activate its helicase activity [35], inhibiting these kinases should prevent host, but not viral, replication. As with SCF inhibition, early inhibition of Cdc2 did not result in the accumulation of TAg in the G1/early phase but prevented robust TAg expression and reduced viral titers ( Fig 2A ). In contrast, inhibition of C2 did not prevent TAg expression but reduced viral titers ( Fig 2 ). Inhibiting both C1 and C2 resulted in reduced TAg and viral titers ( Fig 2 ), demonstrating that both kinases are required for TAg expression and viral production. Inhibiting C1 and C2 did not result in the accumulation of TAg in the G/early phase ( Fig 2 ) suggesting that TAg is not the result of genome amplification during initial S. Inhibiting C1 and C did not increase TAg in the G/M phase ( Fig 2 ) indicating that the increase in TAg in G/M is not due to a shift in protein stability as reported for MCPV [36]. Inhibiting C1 and C did not result in TAg in the G phase ( Fig 2 ) suggesting that TAg is not the result of genome amplification during initial S. Inhibiting C and C did not result in TAg in the phase ( Fig 2 ) indicating that TAg is not the result of genome amplification during S. Inhibiting C and C did not result in T in the phase ( Fig 2 ) indicating that TAg is not the result of genome amplification during S. Inhibiting C and C did result in T in the phase ( Fig 2 ) indicating that TAg is the result of amplification during S. Inhibiting C and C did result in T in the phase ( Fig 2 ) indicating TAg is the result of amplification during S. Inhibiting C and C did result in the phase ( Fig 2 ) indicating TAg is the result of amplification S. Inhibiting C and C did result in the ( Fig 2 ) indicating TAg is the result of amplification S.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) have emerged as a powerful tool for identifying gene-trait associations by integrating gene expression mapping studies with genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ). While most existing TWAS approaches focus on marginal analyses through examining one gene at a time, recent developments in TWAS fine-mapping methods enable the joint modeling of multiple genes to refine the identification of potentially causal ones. However, these fine-mapping methods have primarily focused on modeling quantitative traits and examining local genomic regions, leading to potentially suboptimal performance. Here, we present FABIO, a TWAS fine-mapping method specifically designed for binary traits that is capable of modeling all genes jointly on an entire chromosome. FABIO employs a probit model to directly link the genetically regulated expression ( GReX ) of genes to binary outcomes while taking into account the GReX correlation among all genes residing on a chromosome. As a result, FABIO effectively controls false discoveries while offering substantial power gains over existing TWAS fine-mapping approaches. We performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of FABIO and applied it for in-depth analyses of six binary disease traits in the UK Biobank. In the real datasets, FABIO significantly reduced the size of the causal gene sets by 27. 9%-36. 9% over existing approaches across traits. Leveraging its improved power, FABIO successfully prioritized multiple potentially causal genes associated with the diseases, including GATA3 for asthma, ABCG2 for gout, and SH2B3 for hypertension. Overall, FABIO represents an effective tool for TWAS fine-mapping of disease traits.

   . In addition, correlated gene expression may be observed for pairs of genes located outside local LD blocks, again leading to potential correlation among GReX across genomic regions. Moreover, focusing solely on GReX of genes located within local genomic regions thus may miss causal genes located in other genomic regions that also contribute to the trait of interest [14, 15], potentially leading to unnecessarily increase in residual error variance and subsequent loss of power. Therefore, modeling multiple genes on an entire chromosome may be advantageous in capturing GReX correlations that are not captured by modeling small genomic regions individually, thereby potentially increasing the power of TWAS fine-mapping. Here, we introduce a novel TWAS fine-mapping method called FABIO ( Fine-mApping of causal genes for BInary Outcomes ) that effectively addresses the aforementioned limitations. FABIO relies on a probit model to directly relate multiple GReX to binary outcome in TWAS fine-mapping. Additionally, it jointly models all genes located on a chromosome to account for the correlation among GReX arising from cis-SNP LD and expression correlation across genomic regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FABIO through comprehensive simulations. We also applied FABIO to analyze six binary disease traits in the UK Biobank dataset, where FABIO was able to narrow down a small set of causal genes, with the set size 27. 9–36. 9% smaller than those yielded by current TWAS fine-mapping methods. Notably, FABIO prioritized multiple candidate genes previously validated for their association with the respective diseases, such as GATA3 for asthma; ABCG2 for gout; and SH2B3 for hypertension. Putative causal genes identified by FABIO were further validated through enrichment analyses, with disease-associated pathways highlighted in asthma and hypertension

Transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) have gained significant popularity in the field of genetics as they are capable of integrating gene expression mapping studies with genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) to uncover potentially causal associations between genes and traits [1–3]. However, the traditional approach of conducting marginal TWAS analyses, which examine one gene at a time, has important limitations. In such analyses, the focus is solely on testing the marginal association between genetically regulated expression ( GReX ) of a single gene and a trait of interest. This approach overlooks the fact that neighboring genes often exhibit correlated expression levels and share cis-SNPs that are in close linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) with each other [4, 5]. Consequently, genes detected through marginal TWAS may not necessarily be causal but rather represent tag genes in the region. To overcome the limitation of marginal TWAS analysis, several statistical methods for TWAS fine-mapping, including FOCUS ( fine-mapping of causal gene sets ) [4] and FOGS ( Fine-mapping Of Gene Sets ) [6], have been developed [7–9]. These TWAS fine-mapping methods can prioritize associated genes by jointly modeling multiple genes within a specific region of interest. The TWAS fine-mapping methods begin by constructing GReX prediction models using data from eQTL mapping studies [2, 10]. The constructed prediction models are then used to impute GReX in GWAS, enabling the association testing between GReX and the trait of interest at the locus level. Different TWAS fine-mapping methods employ distinct modeling frameworks. Specifically, FOCUS, a Bayesian method, specifies a sparsity-inducing prior on gene effect sizes on the outcome trait and uses Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) for modeling inference

FABIO is described in the Materials and Methods section, with technical details provided in the S1 Text and a method schematic shown in Fig 1. Briefly, FABIO is a TWAS fine-mapping method that aims to identify genes whose GReX is associated with a binary trait of interest. Different from existing TWAS fine-mapping approaches, FABIO explicitly models the binary nature of the outcome trait through a probit model, and simultaneously models all genes on an entire chromosome to account for the GReX correlation both within and between LD blocks, which also reduces the residual error variance to enhance the precision of TWAS fine-mapping. We develop an efficient MCMC algorithm for model inference, making FABIO scalable to large biobank scale datasets. We performed comprehensive simulations to evaluate the performance of FABIO and compared it mainly with two existing TWAS fine-mapping methods FOCUS and FOGS. We also compared FABIO with two recently published methods GIFT and cTWAS in the baseline simulation due to their heavy computational demand. The simulation details are provided in the Materials and Methods section. Briefly, we obtained genotype data from 373 individuals in GEUVADIS and 50, 000 individuals in UK Biobank. We focused on 770 genes residing in 50 randomly selected LD blocks on chromosome 1 and obtained cis-SNPs for these genes for simulations. For each gene in turn, we used the genotype data of the cis-SNPs from GEUVADIS to simulate the gene expression level in the gene expression mapping study. We also used the genotype data from the same set of cis-SNPs in UK Biobank to construct the GReX underlying these genes, selected some genes to be causal, and simulated a binary outcome trait of interest in the GWAS. Afterwards, we applied different methods to perform TWAS fine-mapping to identify the causal genes

In this study, we have presented FABIO, a novel TWAS fine-mapping method tailored for binary outcomes. Unlike existing approaches, FABIO not only incorporates a probit model to capture the binary nature of disease traits but also jointly models all genes on the same chromosome to account for GReX correlation across genes in different LD blocks. As a result, FABIO produces reasonably calibrated test statistics and achieves high power. Through comprehensive simulations and real-world applications to six disease traits in the UK Biobank, we have illustrated the benefits of FABIO. FABIO employs a probit link function to model the relationship between GReX and binary outcome traits. The probit link function introduces a latent variable known as the liability score, which determines the disease status of each individual. Specifically, when the liability score exceeds a certain threshold, then the individual is classified as having the disease. The liability score is then related to a set of explanatory variables for association analysis. A common alternative approach to modeling binary outcomes is to use the logistic link function within generalized linear models. The logistic link function models the probability of disease for each individual based on the explanatory variables. Consequently, the disease probability varies across individuals depending on the underlying explanation variables. Although the interpretation and inference algorithms differ between these two binary outcome modeling approaches, they often produce similar association results in most application settings [38]. Indeed, in our simulations, we verified that FABIO retains reasonable power even when there are model misspecifications, such as using a logistic regression to generate binary outcomes

We consider a genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) performed on n individuals for a binary trait of interest. We denote y as an n-vector of binary phenotypes measured on the n individuals. Our goal is to identify genes whose genetically regulated expression ( GReX ) is associated with the outcome trait through TWAS fine-mapping. Different from the existing TWAS fine-mapping methods [4, 6], we aim to jointly model all genes on the same chromosome while explicitly accounting for the binary nature of the outcome trait. To do so, we examine one chromosome at a time. For the chromosome of focus, we denote G as an n × p GReX matrix constructed for p genes on the chromosome for the same set of individuals. These GReX are assumed to have already been constructed using standard software such as PrediXcan [2]. With the constructed GReX, we consider a probit model linking the GRe to the binary outcome y. The probit model introduces a latent variable known as the liability, which determines the disease status of each individual. When the liability exceeds a certain threshold, then the individual is classified as having the disease. The liability is related to a set of explanatory variables for analysis. We model the liability as a linear combination of the GRe. The probit model can be written as, where is the liability, is the vector of GRe, is the vector of coefficients, and is the intercept, and is the standard deviation of the liability. The probit function is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. The prob model can be rewritten as, where is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal, is the vector of GRe, is the vector of coefficients, is the intercept, and is the standard deviation of the liability. The prob model can also be written as, where is the cumulative distribution of the standard normal, is the vector G, is the vector of coefficients is the intercept, and the standard of the liability. The prob model can be written as, where the cumulative of the standard is the vector, the G is the vector coefficients the is the intercept and the standard the liability. The model can be written as where the of the is the vector the G the is coefficients the intercept the and the liability.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Misfolded proteins are usually refolded to their functional conformations or degraded by quality control mechanisms. When misfolded proteins evade quality control, they can be sequestered to specific sites within cells to prevent the potential dysfunction and toxicity that arises from protein aggregation. Btn2 and Hsp42 are compartment-specific sequestrases that play key roles in the assembly of these deposition sites. Their exact intracellular functions and substrates are not well defined, particularly since heat stress sensitivity is not observed in deletion mutants. We show here that Btn2 and Hsp42 are required for tolerance to oxidative stress conditions induced by exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Btn2 and Hsp42 act to sequester oxidized proteins into defined PQC sites following ROS exposure and their absence leads to an accumulation of protein aggregates. The toxicity of protein aggregate accumulation causes oxidant sensitivity in btn2 hsp42 sequestrase mutants since overexpression of the Hsp104 disaggregase rescues oxidant tolerance. We have identified the Sup35 translation termination factor as an in vivo sequestrase substrate and show that Btn2 and Hsp42 act to suppress oxidant-induced formation of the yeast [PSI+] prion, which is the amyloid form of Sup35. [PSI+] prion formation in sequestrase mutants does not require IPOD ( insoluble protein deposit ) localization which is the site where amyloids are thought to undergo fragmentation and seeding to propagate their heritable prion form. Instead, both amorphous and amyloid Sup35 aggregates are increased in btn2 hsp42 mutants consistent with the idea that prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress conditions in the absence of sequestrase activity. Taken together, our data identify protein sequestration as a key antioxidant defence mechanism that functions to mitigate the damaging consequences of protein oxidation-induced aggregation.

   . Its name derives from the finding that it is upregulated in response to loss of BTN1, which encodes an ortholog of a human Batten disease protein implicated in progressive neurodegeneration and early death. Despite the established roles for Hsp42 and Btn2 as cellular sequestrases, their exact intracellular functions have remained elusive, especially since no growth defects have been observed in deletion mutants including a lack of sensitivity to heat stress [3, 16, 17]. In this current study we have investigated the roles of the Hsp42 and Btn2 protein sequestrases in maintaining proteostasis during oxidative stress conditions. Oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide exposure is known to inhibit translation whilst increasing protein misfolding and aggregation [18, 19]. We show that the levels of protein oxidative damage formed in response to oxidative stress are similar in wild-type and sequestrase mutants, but protein aggregation is elevated suggesting that the Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases normally act to sequester oxidatively damaged proteins as part of the cells antioxidant defence system. In agreement with this idea, we show that btn2 hsp42 mutants are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide stress implicating a functional role for protein sequestration in oxidant tolerance. Together, our data show that the Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases act to protect against widespread amorphous and amyloid protein aggregation during oxidative stress conditions.

. This was significantly increased following hydrogen peroxide exposure for both sequestrases suggesting that Btn2 and Hsp42 play a role in triaging aggregated proteins formed during oxidative stress conditions ( Fig 3B ). Since Hsp104 appears to be required to protect against protein aggregation during the response to oxidative stress, but its cellular concentrations remain unaltered during these stress conditions, we hypothesised that Hsp104 may become limiting in btn2 hsp42 mutants. To test this idea, HSP104 was over-expressed under the control of the constitutively active TDH3 promoter [14] in wild-type and btn2 hsp42 mutant strains. Whilst overexpression of HSP104 did not affect the hydrogen peroxide tolerance of the wild-type strain, the hydrogen peroxide sensitivity of the btn2 hsp42 mutant was improved ( Fig 3C ). This suggests that Hsp104 can become limiting in sequestrase mutant during oxidative stress conditions that promote protein misfolding and aggregation. To further confirm that overexpression of Hsp104 rescues the oxidant sensitivity of btn2 hsp42 mutants by protecting against the toxicity of protein aggregate accumulation in the absence of sequestrase activity, we directly examined protein aggregation in wild-type and sequestrase mutants. Insoluble protein aggregates were separated from soluble proteins by differential centrifugation and any contaminating membrane proteins removed by detergent washes [24, 26, 27]. Low levels of protein aggregation were detected in the wild-type strain during non-stress conditions which were increased in response to hydrogen peroxide exposure ( Fig 3D ). Protein aggregation was decreased by overexpression of Hsp104 under both non-stress and oxidative stress conditions consistent with the function of hsp104 as a disaggregase. Protein aggregation was strongly increased in the btn2 hsp42 mutant and again Hsp104 overexpression reduced the cellular levels of protein aggregation

. Despite the established roles for Hsp42 and Btn2 in protein sequestration during heat stress, their exact intracellular functions have remained elusive since they are not required for heat tolerance. Growth defects have been observed in mutants lacking the Btn2 and Hsp42 sequestrases by genetically limiting the capacity of Hsp70 [16]. This suggests that sequestering unfolded proteins into defined deposit sites prevents titrating Hsp70 away from its essential chaperone functions in protein folding. The induction of Btn2 and Hsp42 expression in Hsp70 mutants may therefore act to counter limitations in Hsp70 capacity [16]. The finding that mutants lacking Btn2 and Hsp42 are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide stress, but not heat stress, suggests a more direct functional requirement for these sequestrases during stress conditions that promote protein oxidation. Hydrogen peroxide stress is known to inhibit translation whilst increasing protein aggregation [18, 19]. All amino acids in proteins are potential targets of oxidation. They can be directly damaged on amino acid sidechains and backbone sites as well as through targeted oxidation of specific residues such as cysteine and methionine in proteins [54, 60]. Such modifications can significantly alter protein structure by affecting side-chain hydrophobicity, protein folding and amino acid interactions, often resulting in unfolding and protein aggregation. This contrasts with heat stress which is a well-characterized denaturing stress that causes protein unfolding and is generally reversible at non-extreme temperatures [61, 62]. Hence, it is possible that the mechanistic differences in protein misfolding and aggregation caused by heat and oxidative stress accounts for the differential requirements for sequestrases during these different stress conditions

. The irreversible nature of many types of protein oxidation may also require sequestration as a strategy to prevent protein aggregates from accumulating at non-specific sites as we observed in btn2 hsp42 mutants. The sequestration of misfolded proteins is thought to protect the proteome against an overload of protein misfolding. Refolding from the aggregated state can be mediated by disaggregases including the AAA+ family Hsp104 together with Hsp70 and Hsp40 family members [16, 21, 63, 64]. We found that Hsp104 co-localization with Btn2 and Hsp42 is increased in response to hydrogen peroxide exposure. However, Hsp104 localization, but not protein levels, was altered under these conditions suggesting that Hsp104 may become limiting in btn2 hsp42 mutants in the face of widespread protein oxidation. In agreement with this idea, we found that overexpressing Hsp104 improved oxidant tolerance in btn2 hsp42 mutants. Increasing Hsp104 levels in a wild-type strain did not affect oxidant tolerance indicating that Hsp104 levels are normally sufficient to protect against an oxidative stress when sequestrases are active. We found that Hsp104 suppressed the high levels of protein aggregation formed in the btn2 hsp42 mutant following ROS exposure consistent with the idea that the Hsp104 disaggregase normally acts to resolve spatially sorted protein aggregates that are formed following oxidant exposure. CytoQ and INQ have primarily been characterized using model fluorescently labelled misfolded reporters and little is known regarding the in vivo substrates of Btn2 and Hsp42. Several studies have identified specific aggregates that require Hsp42 or Btn2 activity for nucleation. For example, Hsp42 is required for the formation of cytosolic granules, termed MitoStores, which are formed in response to mitochondrial dysfunction in yeast and act to store various proteins including mitochondrial precursor proteins until the stress is relieved [65]

. Hsp104 overexpression also appeared to cause alterations in the protein aggregates detected in the btn2 hsp42 mutant particularly under oxidative stress ( Fig 3D ). Western blotting was used to confirm that Hsp104 is similarly overexpressed in wild-type and btn2 hsp42 mutants ( Fig 3D ). Taken together, these data indicate that Btn2 and Hsp42 are required to protect against protein aggregation caused by oxidative stress conditions in a mechanism that requires the Hsp104 disaggregase. Most studies that have examined protein misfolding and aggregation in sequestrase mutants have relied on model PQC reporter substrates and little is known regarding the in vivo substrates of these chaperones. We identified the Sup35 termination factor as an in vivo substrate of Btn2 and Hsp sequeases. Sup35 is involved in termination of translation and has been implicated in the formation of the [PSI] prion which is an amyloid form of Sup35 [66, 67]. We found that Btn2 and Hsp suppress the formation of the [PS] prion in response to hydrogen peroxide ( Fig 4 ). The absence of sequease activity leads to accumulation of the [PS] pr which is consistent with the idea that prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress in the absence of sequease. In contrast, amorph and amyloid Sup35 aggregates were increased in btn2sp mutants consistent with the idea that prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress in the absence of sequease. The [PS] pr is a well-characterized amyloid form of Sup35 that forms in response to oxidative stress [66, 67] and is associated with protein misfolding and aggregation [68, 69]. The role of Btn and Hsp in suppressing [PS] pr formation is consistent with the idea that these sequeases act to prevent protein misfolding and aggregation during oxidative stress. The absence of seque activity leads to accumulation of the [PS pr which is consistent with the idea that prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress in the absence of seque. In contrast, amorph and amyloid Sup35 aggregates were increased in btn2sp mutants consistent with the idea that prion formation occurs multiple intracellular during oxidative stress in absence seque. The [PS pr is a well-character amyloid form Sup that forms in response oxidative stress and is associated with proteinfolding and aggregation. The role of Btn and H in suppressing [PS pr is consistent with the idea theseque act to prevent misolding and aggregation during oxidative stress. The absence seque leads to accumulation of [ pr which is consistent with the idea prion forms multiple intracellular during oxidative in absence seque. In contrast, amorph amyloid Sup aggregates were increased in btnsp consistent with the idea prion forms multiple intracellular oxidative in absence. The [PS is a well-character amyloid Sup that forms in response oxidative and is associated with proteinfolding. The role of Btn and in suppressing [ pr is consistent with these act to prevent mis and aggregation oxidative. absence leads to accumulation pr which is consistent the pr forms multiple intracellular oxidative in absence.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Glioblastoma ( GBM ) invasion studies have focused on coding genes, while few studies evaluate long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ), transcripts without protein-coding potential, for role in GBM invasion. We leveraged CRISPR-interference ( CRISPRi ) to evaluate invasive function of GBM-associated lncRNAs in an unbiased functional screen, characterizing and exploring the mechanism of identified candidates. We implemented a CRISPRi lncRNA loss-of-function screen evaluating association of lncRNA knockdown ( KD ) with invasion capacity in Matrigel. Top screen candidates were validated using CRISPRi and oligonucleotide ( ASO ) -mediated knockdown in three tumor lines. Clinical relevance of candidates was assessed via The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) and Genotype-Tissue Expression ( GTEx ) survival analysis. Mediators of lncRNA effect were identified via differential expression analysis following lncRNA KD and assessed for tumor invasion using knockdown and rescue experiments. Forty-eight lncRNAs were significantly associated with 33–83% decrease in invasion ( p<0. 01 ) upon knockdown. The top candidate, LINC03045, identified from effect size and p-value, demonstrated 82. 7% decrease in tumor cell invasion upon knockdown, while LINC03045 expression was significantly associated with patient survival and tumor grade ( p<0. 0001 ). RNAseq analysis of LINC03045 knockdown revealed that WASF3, previously implicated in tumor invasion studies, was highly correlated with lncRNA expression, while WASF3 KD was associated with significant decrease in invasion. Finally, WASF3 overexpression demonstrated rescue of invasive function lost with LINC03045 KD. CRISPRi screening identified LINC03045, a previously unannotated lncRNA, as critical to GBM invasion. Gene expression is significantly associated with tumor grade and survival. RNA-seq and mechanistic studies suggest that this novel lncRNA may regulate invasion via WASF3.

    To efficiently identify novel lncRNAs in GBM that affect the invasive ability of malignant cells and determine possible therapeutic targets, we developed a CRISPRi-based invasion screen. Here we report the first large-scale CRISPRi screen on lncRNAs implicated in glioblastoma invasion. Our results identified LINC03045 as significantly associated with in vitro glioma cell invasion across 3 tumor lines. Multiple methods of lncRNA knockdown further validated the functional role of LINC03045 via CRISPRi-based and ASO-based knockdown in all three lines. Patient gene expression analysis of TCGA, and GTEx raw transcriptional data revealed that LINC03045 expression was associated with tumor grade and patient survival, as well as widespread changes in global gene expression data, including oxidative phosphorylation and RNA processing. Finally, gene expression analysis following LINC03045 KD revealed that WASF3, a factor evaluated for tumor cell invasion in multiple studies, could be a possible mediator of LINC03045 function [30, 31]. Mechanistic studies supported the role of WASF3 as a lncRNA mediator, with WASF3 KD paralleling invasion loss seen with LINC03045 KD in both 2D Matrigel and 3-dimensional invasion modles. Finally, WASF3 rescue experiments confirmed that WASF3 overexpression restores loss-of-invasion from lncRNA KD. The CRISPRi invasion screen of 2, 307 loci identified 45 hits that affect GBM invasion. Upon evaluation of these candidate hits, LINC03045, a previously unannotated and poorly studied lncRNA, was noted to be significantly associated with invasion. Functional genomic methods such as CRISPR ( and CRISPRi ) screens have gained significant popularity in recent years due to the ability demonstrated here to quickly and efficiently identify potential therapeutic targets [14, 19]

. While prior manuscripts have notably focused on the role of coding genes affecting glioma invasion [32], the body of literature characterizing the role of lncRNAs in GBM pathogenesis has only just begun to grow in recent years and have primarily focused on the role of lncRNAs in GBM proliferation and progression [33–37]. Prior studies on lncRNAs in GBM invasion, however, remain scarce, and our study uniquely addresses the role of lncRNAs specifically in GBM invasion, suggesting that noncoding RNAs play a significant functional role in this phenotype. Knockdown of our candidate lncRNA via multiple methods, including via both CRISPRi and ASO, revealed similar decreases in tumor invasion while not affecting tumor proliferation. While our knockdown models demonstrated 40–70% decrease in lncRNA expression, we did notice relatively dramatic phenotypic changes in invasion of over 80% in the Matrigel invasion after a knockdown of less than 40%. Part of the observed effect is likely variability. However, essential genes in certain processes have been previously noted to show exaggerated phenotypes with small changes in gene expression, which could play a role in the observed changes in our results [38]. In addition, because lncRNAs have been commonly characterized as extremely abundant and specific to a small subset of cells [39], another possible explanation is that gene expression was particularly abundant in an aggressive, invading, lncRNA-rich subpopulation is capable of demonstrating invasion at 24 hours during the assay. Under this assumption, it is possible a more modest 40% knockdown of the highest expressing cells can more significantly affect the 24 hour invasion phenotype. LncRNAs represent challenging experimental and therapeutic targets. CRISPR/Cas9 or CRISPRi-based drugs carry inherent clinical challenges of non cell-specific effects for treating diseases

. Despite the rapidly emerging use of these functional screens to identify novel genetic targets, few studies have specifically identified novel candidate lncRNAs targeting glioma. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR ) is a technology that has allowed for genome-wide screens of gene function [19–26]. This technology has been valuable in the identification of both coding and non-coding genes that are involved in various cellular phenotypes. Due to the nature of non-coding RNAs, standard CRISPR knockdown may not effectively limit lncRNA function, as small deletions do not typically reduce lncRNA-induced effects [20, 23, 27]. CRISPRi ( CRISPR interference ) circumvents this challenge, repressing transcription of the lncRNA at the nucleus via fusion of a catalytically inactive Cas9 ( dCas9 ) with a repressive KRAB domain [28]. We have previously successfully utilized these CRISPRi screens to assess in vitro and in vivo GBM proliferation [19, 29]. CRISPRi screens simultaneously repress multiple genetic targets, with each cell receiving specific individual lncRNA repression. These pools of lncRNA cellular perturbation are then selected for those cells displaying a phenotype of interest. Association of the specific lncRNAs knocked down in remaining selected cells then identifies the lncRNAs that are most closely associated with the selected phenotype. Here, we developed a CRISPRi-based invasion screen to identify lncRNAs that affect the in vitro invasive capacity of glioma cells. In this screen of 2, 307 candidate lncRNAs, we sought to identify specific lncRNAs associated with glioma cell invasion. We further assess the clinical association of candidate lncRNAs with tumor grade and patient outcomes while also evaluating potential mechanisms by finding associations of candidate lncRNAs with potential coding genes affecting GBM invasion.

To screen for and identify lncRNAs affecting in vitro glioma cell invasion, we utilized an invasion screen with CRISPRi as a tool for gene knockdown. Repression of transcription occurred when CRISPRi recruited the Cas9 protein fused to a KRAB repressor ( dCas9-KRAB ), which is guided and targeted to transcriptional start sites ( TSS ) by single guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) [19]. A GBM cell line ( U87 ) was successfully tranduced with a custom plasmid to express dCas9-KRAB ( U87-dCas9-KRAB ) fused to blue fluorescent protein ( U87-dCas9-KRAB-BFP ), and sorted by FACS to a pure population of U87-dCas9-KRAB. Transduced cells were successfullly infected with lentivirus that contained a U87-specific CRISPRi library derived from CRinCL ( Addgene #86542, a gift from Jonathan Weissman ). This library was comprised of sgRNAs targeting 2, 307 lncRNA, with 10 sgRNAs per lncRNA, and 247 negative control sgRNAs, for a total of 23, 564 sgRNAs. U87 cells stably expressing dCas9-KRAB were infected such that there was 1, 000X coverage per sgRNA, and we selected for infected cells using puromycin ( Fig 1A ). A low infection efficiency ( MOI < 0. 3 ) was utilized to decrease chances of cells being infected by more than one sgRNA. Cells were then seeded in Matrigel-coated Boyden chambers for 24 hours at a density of 5 x 105 cells per chamber, with serum-free medium in the top chamber and 10% FBS in the bottom. After 24 hours, cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet and counted. Cells that invaded through the Matrigel were counted as invasive cells. Cells that did not invade were counted as non-invasive. Invasion was calculated as the ratio of invasive to non-invasive cells ( I / N ratio ). Cells with I / N ratio > 0. 5 were considered invasive. The I / N ratio was calculated for each sgRNA to determine which lRNAs were associated with invasion. The top 48 lRNAs with I / N ratio > 0. 5 were selected for further validation via CRISi and oligonucleotide (AS )-mediated knockdown in three glioma cell lines ( U87, U251, and U343 ). CRISi oligonucleotides were designed to target lncRNA regions with high conservation across the three lines. AS oligonucleotides were transfected into cells 24 hours prior to Matrig invasion assay. Cells were then seeded in Matrig-coated Boyden chambers as above. After 24 hours, cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet and counted. Cells that invaded through Matrig were counted as invasive. Cells that did not invade were counted as non-invasive. Invasion was calculated as the ratio of invasive to non-invasive ( I / N ) ratio. Cells with I / N ratio >0. 5 were considered invasive. The I / N ratio was calculated for each oligonucleotide to determine which lRN were associated with invasion. CRISi oligonucleotides were designed to target lRNA regions with high conservation across the three lines. AS oligonucleotides were transfected into cells 24 hours prior Matrig invasion. Cells were seeded in Mat-coated Boyden chambers above. After 24, cells were fixed and stained with violet and counted. Cells that invaded Matrig were counted as invasive.

Researchers investigated how the brain assigns probabilistic models to sequences of auditory stimuli using electroencephalographic (EEG) data from participants exposed to a sequence generated by a stochastic chain. A new clustering procedure was introduced to group EEG signals by their law, indicating the brain uses recurrent auditory stimulus occurrences to build a model. The brain identifies statistical regularities in sequences and organizes them to classify and make predictions, but how it proceeds is still an open question. Previous studies proposed Bayesian inference, probabilistic tree models, and context models to represent regularities in sequences. However, each assumed a particular class of models used by the brain, leaving the identification of actual models used by the brain open. This study used a new clustering procedure on EEG data from participants exposed to sequences driven by a context, showing the brain uses the occurrence of a strong beat in a stochastic sequence to select a model. Entrainment, a phenomenon where neurons synchronize with regular auditory occurrences, is a possible mechanism to model the sequence. Results indicate the prefrontal cortex uses the occurrence of strong to chunk auditory in larger scales, with seconds between each occurrence. The clustering procedure groups EEG by dissimilarity based on Kolmogorov-Snov distance, retrieving partitions similar to the expected by the occurrence of strong. The brain selects a partition of the past sequence with four, defined by the occurrence of strong, indicating it identifies structural aspects to estimate next amidst stochasticity. A partition with four elements is an economical representation, encoding temporal dependencies in electrodes over prefrontal cortex. Results for R and L F E P are similar to expected, with slight lateralization when removing central electrode 11. Occipital electrodes did not correspond to partition determined by strong, but strings in strong assigned same cluster.

    Title: 
    Abstract: While single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) is a popular method to analyze gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution, it harbors shortcomings: The failure to account for cell-to-cell variations of transcriptome-size ( i. e., the total number of transcripts per cell ) and also cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression. This is particularly a problem when analyzing highly heterogeneous solid tissues/organs, which requires cell dissociation for the analysis. As a result, there exists a discrepancy between bulk RNA-seq result and virtually reconstituted bulk RNA-seq result using its composite scRNA-seq data. To fix this problem, we propose a computationally calculated coefficient, “cell type-specific weighting-factor ( cWF ) ”. Here, we introduce a concept and a method of its computation and report cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs. Their fidelity is validated by more accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data of diverse solid organs using the scRNA-seq data and the cWFs of their composite cells. Furthermore, we also show that cWFs effectively predict aging-progression, implicating their diagnostic applications and also their association with aging mechanism. Our study provides an important method to solve critical limitations of scRNA-seq analysis of complex solid tissues/organs. Furthermore, our findings suggest a diagnostic utility and biological significance of cWFs.

   . 2 for 100, 300, 500 signature genes ), and the skeletal muscle ( < 0. 1 for 100, 300, 500 signature genes ). These low Pearson correlation coefficients suggest that the transcriptome-size of individual cell-types varies, resulting in the large gaps. These results fail to satisfy the above-described major premise; hence, the differential transcriptome size-variations and/or the cryptic gene expression are unrepresented in the scRNA-seq data of the solid organs. To solve this problem, we developed an algorithm to compute such unrepresented factors ( Fig 2 ). The concept of the algorithm is schematically described in Fig 2 and as follows: In the real scRNA-seq data analyses, the total transcript counts per cell ( i. e., the transcriptome-size ) of the real scRNA-seq data are normalized ( i. e., the total counts per cell are equal among all composite cell-types of the organs ). This results in the loss of a factor representing the putative differences of the transcriptome-size and/or the cryptic gene expression across cell-types. This factor is computed as the cell type-specific weighting-factor ( cWF ) ( indicated as w1, w2, w3, etc. in the Fig 2 ). Using this algorithm, we computed cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 organs as follows: We calculated at least 100 cWFs for each virtual-cell/cell-subject of each cell-type and made them follow Gaussian distribution, instead of one cWF per cell-type. Based on this concept, we developed a model as follows: my=∑jwjxj ( j∈Cm ) ( 1 ) where y∈ℝn, wj≥0 and xj∈ℝn denote the normalized whole-organ RNA-seq counts vector, the cWF for each cell subject j, and the normalized scRNA-seq counts vector for each cell subject j, respectively. The n is the total number of the signature genes for the organs. In this study, 100, 300, and 500 signature genes were selected according to the ranking on the basis of ‘Mean Decrease in Gini’ values calculated by the RF analyses

Since the advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) technologies early this century, this method is becoming one of the essential tools in biomedical fields [1]. While scRNA-seq provides useful information of cellular composition and gene expression at single cell resolution, it has limitations. It is well-known that the total number of RNA molecules per cell, also known as transcriptome-size, varies from-cell-to-cell [2–4]. However, in scRNA-seq analyses, the transcripts are sequenced in individual cells and their transcript-counts are normalized, allowing the comparison of the relative abundance of each transcript-species across individual cells/cell-types [5–9]. This internal normalization process of the analyses cancels out the putative transcriptome size-variations among different cells, concealing potentially important functional differences among the cells. This differential transcriptome-size can be determined by counting the library depth of the cells and/or by including normalizing spike-in RNA in the samples [2, 3, 10, 11]. Alternative, it can be quantified by PCR-based methods [12, 13]. However, these approaches are applicable only to culture cells, blood/immune cells, and cancer cells which are relatively uniform cell types and do not require cell dissociation. In contrast, they are not applicable to solid tissues/organs composed of highly heterogeneous cell types. Individual cells can be dissociated from solid tissues/organs and then analyzed by scRNA-seq. However, the cell-dissociation and subsequent harvesting and/or purification steps induce cryptic gene expression [14]. Due to such limitations, it is difficult to measure and compare the absolute transcript-counts of each gene in individual cells of the complex solid tissues/organs such as the heart, brain, kidney, etc. Furthermore, the differential transcriptome-size has biological importance

First, the major premise is as follows. If the transcriptome size differences and the cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression ( abbreviated as “cryptic gene expression” hereafter for convenience ) are corrected in the conventional scRNA-seq, the bulk ( i. e., tissue/organ ) RNA-seq should be the sum of gene expression of each composite cell-type weighted by cell-type ratios. We evaluated this premise. The synthetic whole-organ data were constructed from single-cell transcript counts combined according to the experimentally determined fraction of each cell-type in the organ. Briefly, the synthetic whole-organ RNA-seq data are calculated as the sum of the normalized transcript counts weighted by the known ratios of the composite cell-types of the organs, using the signature genes for distinguishing the cell-types for each organ ( see “Datasets”, “Data preprocessing”, “Calculation of reference cell-type ratios”, “Selection of signature gene sets” at the bottom of this section for the details ). The signature genes were determined by the random forest ( RF ) classifier. These synthetic data for 10 organs ( brain, fat, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, skin, skeletal muscle, spleen ) were then compared to the corresponding real whole-organ RNA-seq data ( Fig 1 ). The comparisons were performed by calculating their Pearson correlation coefficients. The result shows low Pearson correlation coefficients ( < 0. 75 ) for most of the organs ( brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, skin, skeletal muscle ) regardless of the number ( 100, 300, 500 ) of the top-ranked signature genes used. Particularly low coefficients are found with the brain ( < 0. 6 for 100, 300, 500 signature genes ), the fat ( < 0. 5 for 300, 500 signature genes ), the heart ( < 0. 4 for 300, 500 signature genes ), the pancreas ( < 0. 3 for 100, 300, 500 signature genes ), the skin ( < 0

In this study, we report a computational method to calculate cWFs, coefficients to offset the lack of the representation of transcriptome size variations and differential cryptic gene expression among different cells of solid organs ( Fig 2 ). Using this method, we computed and describe cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 organs ( Fig 3 ). We show that they indeed account for the relative variations of the transcriptome-size of the cells and their differential cryptic gene expression by demonstrating their requisite role for accurately reconstituting and deconvolving the whole-organ RNA-seq data using their composite scRNA-seq data weighted by the corresponding cWFs ( Figs 4–6 ). We also show that they recapitulate the experimentally-determined total mRNA content-differences, using PBMC data ( Fig 7 ). Furthermore, we show that cWFs differentially change among diverse cell-types across various organs over the course of aging and can be used to effectively predict aging progression in the aging mouse model ( Figs 8–10 ). These results suggest a possible role of differential transcriptome size-change in the aging mechanism. The results also indicate their possible diagnostic applications as biomarkers for aging progression and/or aging associated diseases. Despite the usefulness of cWFs, some limitations must be noted. While our method is effective for the organs consisting of heterogeneous cell-types, it is ineffective for a relatively homogenous organ such as the liver consisting of predominantly hepatocytes ( >95% ) ( Figs 3, 5, S4, and S5 ). Another limitation could be the requirement of both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data of the organs and the tissues of interest. Our method requires both of these datasets for the target organs/tissues to infer the cWFs of the composing cell-types. However, this may become less of a limiting factor as the availability of such data is exponentially growing

. The reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data using scRNA-se data and cWF of composite cells is shown in figs 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,30,31,33,34,36,37,39,41,43,45,47,49,51,53,57,61,65,69,73,77,81,85,89,93,97,101,105,109,113,117,121,129,137,145,153,161,169,177,185,193,201,209,217,225,241,249,257,273,281,297,313,329,345,361,381,413,437,473,505,557,609,641,733,837,913,1013,1095,1197,1201,123,125,127,131,135,139,143,147,151,159,167,175,183,191,199,207,223,239,255,271,299,307,335,363,391,419,467,503,559,637,733,837,1013,1095,119,123,127,135,143,151,159,167,175,191,207,223,239,255,271,299,307,335,363,391,419,467,503,559,637,733,837,101,109,119,123,127,135,143,151,159,167,175,191,207,223,239,255,271,299,307,335,363,391,419,467,503,559,637,733,837,101,109,119,123,127,135,143,151,159,167,175,191,207,223,239,255,271,299,307,335,363,391,419,467,503,559,637,733,837,101,109,119,123,127,135,143,151,159,167,175,191,207,223,239,255,271,299,307,335,363,391,419,467,503,559,637,733,837,101,109,119,123,127,135,143,151,159,167,175,191,207,223,239,255,271,299,307,335,363,391,419,467,503,559,637,733,837,101,109,119,123,127,135,143,151,159,167,175,191,207,223,239,255,271,299,307,335,363,391,419,467,503,559,637,733,837,101,109,119,123,127,135,143,151,159,167,175,191,207,223,239,255,271,299,307,335,363,391,419,467,503,559,637,733,837,101,109,119,123,127,135,143,151,159,167,175,191,207,223,239,255,271,299,307,335,363,391,419,467,503,559,637,733,837,101,109,119,123,127,135,143,151,159,167,175,191,207,223,239,255,271,299,307,335,363,391,

    Title: 
    Abstract: Mendelian randomization ( MR ) is a statistical approach using genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR ( MVMR ) extends this to estimate the direct effect of multiple exposures simulatiously. MR and MVMR can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic genetic variants in the set used as instrumental variables, violating one of the core IV assumptions. Genetic variants that give outlying estimates are often considered to be potentially pleiotropic variants. Radial plots can be used in MR to help identify these variants. Analogous plots for MVMR have so far been unavailable due to the multidimensional nature of the analysis. We propose a radial formulation of MVMR, and an adapted Galbraith radial plot, which allows for the estimated effect of each exposure within an MVMR analysis to be visualised. Radial MVMR additionally includes an option for removal of outlying SNPs which may violate one or more assumptions of MVMR. A RMVMR R package is presented as accompanying software for implementing the methods described. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the radial MVMR approach through simulations and applied analyses. We highlight how outliers with respect to all exposures can be visualised and removed through Radial MVMR. We present simulations that illustrate how outlier removal decreases the bias in estimated effects under various forms of pleiotropy. We apply Radial MVMR to estimate the effect of lipid fractions on coronary heart disease ( CHD ). In combination with simulated examples, we highlight how important features of MVMR analyses can be explored using a range of tools incorporated within the RMVMR R package. Radial MVMR effectively visualises causal effect estimates, and provides valuable diagnostic information with respect to the underlying assumptions of MVMR.

    Radial MR and MVMR approaches facilitate the assessment of pleiotropic associations between genetic variants and phenotypes using GWAS summary data. Conducting analyses within a radial framework allows for outliers to be effectively visualised, and MVMR analyses allow for the direct effects of multiple exposures to be estimated simultaneously. Radial MVMR builds upon both these existing methods, providing a means for visualising MVMR approaches absent until this point, and an approach of outlier identification and removal in a MVMR framework. We propose that the radial MVMR approach be used to assist in communicating key findings as a visual aid, and also as a sensitivity analysis for identifying pleiotropic bias using adjusted heterogeneity statistics. When implementing the Radial MVMR approach it is crucial to consider the underlying assumptions of MVMR. Instruments selected should be sufficiently strong so as to overcome substantial weak instrument bias, estimated using the conditional F-statistic. Specific to Radial MVMR, the correction of individual ratio estimates is reliant upon unbiased estimates of the direct effect of each exposure. As demonstrated in the simulation study, if the majority of the SNPs have pleiotropic effects in the same direction the outlier adjusted Radial MVMR estimates will still be biased. As previously emphasised, care should be taken to consider identified outliers and phenotypic associations which could plausibly form horizontal pleiotropic pathways. If a majority of instruments have direct effects upon an outcome, and the distribution of such direct effects is similar, it is likely that SNPs satisfying the MVMR assumptions will be identified as outliers. As a consequence, the removal of such SNPs would result in estimates converging toward the biased estimate produced by such pleiotropic SNPs

. MVMR can be used to obtain pleiotropy robust effect estimates when the mechanism by which the pleiotropy is acting is understood and measured. However, often it is unclear what the mechanism by which pleiotropic effects are acting, or many potential effects are thought to be present. A range of pleiotropy robust methods have been proposed for MVMR [11–13], however these do not focus on the identification of the SNPs contributing to heterogenetiy in MVMR. The multidimensional nature of MVMR means that it cannot be visualised in scatter plots as simply as MR. This makes visual inspection of outliers, or comparison of effects challenging. In this paper we present a Radial MVMR approach which allows for visualisation of the effects obtained in MVMR and identification of SNPs that are outlying based on their association with all of the exposures. We then show how Radial MVMR can be used to prune outliers and so obtain results that are not influenced by outlying SNPs. We illustrate the method through a simulation across a range of levels of balanced and unbalanced pleiotropy. To demonstrate the application of Radial MVMR we present an applied example evaluating the effects of low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ), high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ), and triglycerides on coronary heart disease ( CHD ). We illustrate how univariable MR estimates for each of the exposures are biased by pleiotroic effects via the other exposures considered. We then show how the application of Radial MVMR can be used to visualise the MVMR results and to obtain more robust effect estimates through the identification and removal of SNPs which contribute more to heterogenetiy in the MVMR results than would be expected by chance. Throughout we perform all analyses using the RMVMR R package for the R software environment, which has been developed to facilitate the application of radial MVMR analyses. The RMVMR R package is available from https://github. com/WSpiller/RMVMR.

. We used these to estimate the direct effect of each exposure in a single model with radial MVMR, estimate exposure specific heterogeneity statistics and conditional F-statistics to test instrument strength. We finally applied pruning to remove any SNPs that contributed more to the heterogeneity statistics than would be expected by chance and re-estimated the radial MVMR model without them included. Results from all of the analyses conducted are presented in Table 4. The results given in Table 4 highlight how failure to account for the other exposures and potential pleiotropy can give potentially misleading results. Each of the univariable Radial results are attenuated towards the null once the other exposures are accounted for in the Radial MVMR estimation. Radial MVMR estimates for each exposure are shown in Table 4, showing the effect of each lipid fraction to be directionally consistent, though smaller in magnitude, compared to univariable estimates. Assuming that the observed heterogeneity in univariable analyses is the result of omitting one or more lipid fractions, performing a correction for each observation and re-evaluating heterogeneity using radial MVMR should show evidence of a substantial Q-statistic decrease. Table 4 shows a substantial decrease in observed heterogeneity when fitting the radial MVMR model, though HDL and LDL still show evidence of significant global heterogeneity using a Q-statistic p-value threshold of p < 0. 05. When SNPs that contributed more to the heterogeneity statstic than would be expected by chance were removed effect estimates remain directionally consistent with the initial radial MVMR analysis. The effect estimates obtained were of smaller magnitude for HDL and LDL, and the effects of all exposures are estimated with greater precision

Mendelian randomization ( MR ) is a methodological framework in which genetic variants- often single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) - are used as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding [1, 2]. MR analyses are often performed using summary data from publicly available genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ), reflecting the ease with which such data can be accessed in contrast with individual-level data [3]. The extent to which MR causal effect estimates are unbiased is largely determined by three key assumptions. SNPs serving as instruments must be robustly associated with the exposure of interest ( IV1 ), there must be no confounding of the SNPs and the outcome ( IV2 ) and there must be no effect of the SNPs on the outcome that does not act via the exposure, i. e. no horizontal pleiotropy ( IV3 ) [4]. If all of these assumptions are satisfied for every SNP then the causal effect estimated by each SNP should differ only due to statistical chance. Heterogeneity in the per-SNP causal effects estimates is often taken to be an indication of violation of the IV assumptions and potential evidence of pleiotropic effects biasing the estimates obtained for some SNPs. SNPs that contribute to this heterogeneity by more than would be expected by chance are often considered to be outliers and their role in any potential pleiotropic effects investigated further. [5, 6] Radial MR has previously been proposed as a method for MR that allows for visualisation and removal of outliers, as measured by the SNPs that contribute more than expected by chance to heterogeneity in the analysis [7]. Multivariable MR ( MVMR ) is an extension to standard MR estimation which allows for the inclusion of multiple exposures, estimating the direct effect of each exposure on the outcome of interest, conditional on the other exposures included in the model [8–10]

. Importantly, the conditional F-statistic for each exposure remains at a similar level to the initial radial MVMR analysis, limiting the extent to which differences in estimation are the result of bias due to weak instruments being used after pruning. Removing SNPs which exhibit heterogeneity does not necessarily imply that estimates will be less biased. If the majority of SNPs exhibit pleiotropic effects in a similar direction and magnitude, it is likely that the estimates will remain biased after removal of such SN. This is demonstrated in the simulation study, where the majority of SN have pleotropic effects in the same direction the adjusted RadialMR estimates will be biased. Therefore, care should be taken to consider outliers and phenotypic associations which could plaus form pleotropic pathways. If a majority of instruments have direct effects on the outcome and the distribution of such effects is similar, it is likely that SN satisfying the MRM assumptions will be identified as outliers. As a consequence, removal of such SN would result in estimates converging toward biased produced by pleotropic SNs. MR can be used to obtain pleiotropy robust estimates when the mechanism by which pleiot is acting is understood and measured. However, often is unclear the mechanism by which pleotropic are acting or many effects thought to be present. A range of pleiot robust methods have been proposed for MR [11–13], however do not focus on identification of SN contributing to heterogeneity in MRM. The multidimensional nature of MRM makes it cannot be visualised in scatter plots as MR. This makes inspection of outliers or comparison challenging.

The final answer is: 

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the effect of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVM) extends this to estimate the direct effect of multiple exposures simultaneously. However, MR can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic variants used as instrumental variables, violating one of the core assumptions. Variants that give outlying estimates are considered potentially pleiotropic. Radial plots can be used in MR to help identify these. Analog plots for MVM have been unavailable due to the multidimensional nature of the analysis. We propose a radial formulation of MVM and an adapted radial plot which allows the effect of each exposure within M analysis to be visualized. Radial M includes an option for removal of SNPs that may violate one or more assumptions of M. AVM package is presented as software for implementing the methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the radial approach through simulations and analyses. We highlight how outliers can be visualized and removed through Radial. We present that removal decreases bias in estimated under forms of pleiotropy. We apply to estimate the effect of lipids on coronary disease (CHD). In combination with examples, we highlight features of M analyses can be explored using tools within the package. Rad effectively visualizes causal estimates and provides valuable information about the assumptions of M.

Radial and M approaches facilitate assessment of pleotropic associations between genetic and phenotypes using GWAS data. Conducting within a framework allows outliers to be visualized, M allow direct effects multiple to be estimated. Radial builds upon existing, providing means visual M approaches absent, and approach identification in framework. We propose the approach to aid in communicating findings and sensitivity identifying bias using heterogeneity statistics. When implementing, consider the assumptions. Instruments should be strong to overcome weak bias, using statistic. Radial correction relies on unbiased estimates of each exposure. If majority SN have pleotropic in direction, adjusted estimates will be biased. Care

    Title: 
    Abstract: Animal behavior spans many timescales, from short, seconds-scale actions to daily rhythms over many hours to life-long changes during aging. To access longer timescales of behavior, we continuously recorded individual Drosophila melanogaster at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days at a time in featureless arenas on sucrose-agarose media. We use the deep learning framework SLEAP to produce a full-body postural dataset for 47 individuals resulting in nearly 2 billion pose instances. We identify stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion and use the resulting ethograms to explore how the flies’ behavior varies across time of day and days in the experiment. We find distinct daily patterns in all stereotyped behaviors, adding specific information about trends in different grooming modalities, proboscis extension duration, and locomotion speed to what is known about the D. melanogaster circadian cycle. Using our holistic measurements of behavior, we find that the hour after dawn is a unique time point in the flies’ daily pattern of behavior, and that the behavioral composition of this hour tracks well with other indicators of health such as locomotion speed and the fraction of time spend moving vs. resting. The method, data, and analysis presented here give us a new and clearer picture of D. melanogaster behavior across timescales, revealing novel features that hint at unexplored underlying biological mechanisms.

   . abdominal grooming ), and have a temporal resolution that can quantify individual steps. We use techniques of compositional data analysis [20] to characterize the dynamics of this behavioral repertoire across time of day and over the days of the experiment. We recapitulate many previously known characteristics of the D. melanogaster circadian cycle, and find distinct daily patterns in all measured behaviors, including grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion speed. We see an overall decline in the difference in behavior between day and night hours across days in the experiment as flies weaken and die, similar to the known weakening of circadian rhythms with age. Additionally, we find a general decline in proboscis extension and locomotion speed as the fraction of time spent in an idle state increases across days. We identify the hour after dawn as ethologically unique, and show that this time point appears to track the general behavioral health of the flies. Our high-resolution data also reveals a difference in behavioral patterns during the morning and evening peaks of activity, primarily appearing in the grooming component of behavior. Overall, we find that our data captures both expected and novel patterns of D. melanogaster behavior across multiple 24-h periods. Our findings, particularly with regards to the ethological distinction between the morning and evening, offer a new window into the hourly and daily patterns of D. melanogaster activity, and represent a significant step forward in our ability to quantify the inherently multi-timescale structure of animal behavior.

. While in this study we cannot distinguish between feeding and sleep associated proboscis extensions, we hypothesize that the increased bout duration during night hours is associated with a deep sleep mode that flies are achieving more frequently at night. As flies age and die in our experiment, their proboscis extension bout length decreases, perhaps revealing an age- or stress-related attenuation of deep sleep. By investigating locomotion speed specifically during locomotion bouts, we find that locomotion speed, in addition to the fraction of time spent locomoting, has a daily pattern that matches the pattern of activity found in previous circadian studies. It has been found that different aspects of grooming, such as behavior frequency and behavior duration, can be controlled by different mechanisms [16]. While the study presented here does not carry out the necessary genetic and lighting perturbations, it would be interesting to see if locomotion time and locomotion speed are independently controlled mechanisms that together contribute to the typical morning and evening peaks of behavior in D. melanogaster. With compositional data analysis techniques, we identified the hour after lights on as a unique time point in the daily pattern of behavior, with increased levels of all three measured grooming modalities. It is ethologically distinct from the evening hours, possibly due to the difference in the underlying neurogenomic control mechanisms [7, 36]. While the overall difference between day and night behaviors decreases constantly across days, the hour after dawn retains a consistent behavior pattern until Day 4. Day 4 is also when other behavior indicators, such as locomotion speed and overall non-idle time begin to decline. In future work, we will investigate how behavior in the hour after dawn is related to overall health, lifespan, and sleep quality in D. melanogaster

. Note that this lifespan is shorter than conventional assays, likely due to the nutrient-limited sucrose-based food source used to reduce fungal growth [23] and higher-than-optimal temperatures. To extract postural information from our data, we used SLEAP, a deep-learning-based framework that can infer animal posture based on user-generated training data [19] ( See Methods for details ). We tracked a 14-point skeleton comprised of the head, eyes, thorax, abdomen, wing tips, tarsi, and proboscis of each individual ( Figs 1B and S2 ). We limited our subsequent behavior analysis to time points when the flies were on the bottom of the arena ( as opposed to the walls or ceiling ), as this gave the highest quality tracks ( S3 Fig ). In order to quantify discrete, stereotyped behaviors, we modified the MotionMapper pipeline [11] to parallelize more steps and optimize use for postural data instead of raw images ( S4 Fig ). We identified seven well-defined behaviors: idle, proboscis extension, fore grooming ( of the eyes or forelegs ), hind-grooming ( of the abdomen or hindlegs ), wing grooming, locomotion, and altered locomotion ( often involving slipping or limping ). In addition to these well defined behaviors, ~ 15% of all time points represent unstereotyped postural dynamics, which we exclude from later analyses. The remaining seven well-defined behaviors form a subcomposition which can be analyzed in a compositional data analysis framework [20]. Because we are using limb tracking rather than general peripheral or sub-locomotion levels of movement as in other pipelines [16, 17], we are able to distinguish different types of grooming and proboscis extension as unique behavioral categories, and dis-aggregate true grooming bouts from other sources of sub-locomotion levels of movement such as twitching, fidgeting, and single steps

Uncovering the temporal structure of behavior has long been a topic of theoretical interest and experimental challenge [1–4]. Animals carry out sequences of behaviors on many timescales, from the short timescales of the individual movements required for grooming, eating, and social communication to the longer timescales of hunger, arousal, diurnal cycles, mating seasons, and the aging process. The specifics of these behavior sequences determine much of what we can characterize about an animal, such as its health, reproductive fitness, and that idiosyncrasy of action that we might call ‘personality. ’ These behavior sequences also give us indirect ways to assess the internal processes of the animal, such as neural activity, gene expression, and other internal states like hunger or fatigue. An important aspect of animal behavior is how different timescales interact, from hours to days to lifespans. Investigating these interactions requires a model organism with a broad variety of behaviors but a short lifespan, to allow us to capture the breadth of all the timescales it might inhabit. Drosophila melanogaster have a rich set of behaviors, many of which are spontaneous and can occur in simple, isolated environments. Over the course of a 24-h light/dark cycle D. melanogaster have varying activity levels across hours, with particular peaks of activity in the morning and evening [5, 6] that are controlled by distinct populations of neurons [7]. As D. melanogaster age their circadian cycles break down [8], and their activity over different hours loses a defined pattern. Investigating the precise details of how the behaviors of hours become the behaviors of days become the behaviors of lifespans requires high-resolution data that covers the many timescales over which animal behavior varies. Historically, taking long-timescale data covering days or weeks of an animal’s life has required balancing continuity, throughput, and dimensionality

. melanogaster. Our data addresses several limitations of the high-quality ethological data currently available. Previous work on the temporal structure of behavior has found correlations extending beyond the length of the available high-resolution data, typically 30-60 minutes [48, 49]. The data presented here extends these time scales by more than two orders of magnitude. This dataset is also the first to continuously capture high dimensional, high-resolution behavioral data across a diurnal cycle, allowing us to investigate how changes in internal state related to time of day affect behavior. By recording when flies feed ( as measured by proboscis extension ), this data may also provide new insights into the effects of hunger and satiety. We provide both high-resolution recordings and our postural tracking output to facilitate further data analysis. The analyses presented here leverage only a fraction of the resolution and dimensionality provided by our data, and we hope this 100-fold increase in the amount of high-quality ethological data available will give rise to yet more tools and techniques. Finally, aging/dying in our experiments was significantly accelerated due to nutrient limitation. Future work with new arenas, food sources, and improved environmental control can extend this type of high-resolution behavioral recordings to cover a broad range of lifespan.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Protein tyrosine phosphatases non-receptor type ( PTPNs ) have been studied extensively in the context of the adaptive immune system; however, their roles beyond immunoregulation are less well explored. Here we identify novel functions for the conserved C. elegans phosphatase PTPN-22, establishing its role in nematode molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. Through a non-biased genetic screen, we found that loss of PTPN-22 phosphatase activity suppressed molting defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in the conserved NIMA-related kinases NEKL-2 ( human NEK8/NEK9 ) and NEKL-3 ( human NEK6/NEK7 ), which act at the interface of membrane trafficking and actin regulation. To better understand the functions of PTPN-22, we carried out proximity labeling studies to identify candidate interactors of PTPN-22 during development. Through this approach we identified the CDC42 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor DNBP-1 ( human DNMBP ) as an in vivo partner of PTPN-22. Consistent with this interaction, loss of DNBP-1 also suppressed nekl-associated molting defects. Genetic analysis, co-localization studies, and proximity labeling revealed roles for PTPN-22 in several epidermal adhesion complexes, including C. elegans hemidesmosomes, suggesting that PTPN-22 plays a broad role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues. Localization and proximity labeling also implicated PTPN-22 in functions connected to nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation, particularly within the germline, as nearly one-third of proteins identified by PTPN-22 proximity labeling are known P granule components. Collectively, these studies highlight the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying novel gene functions.

    In this study we identified PTPN-22, a conserved tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type, as an effector of C. elegans molting. Specifically, loss of PTPN-22 catalytic activity alleviated molting defects in nekl mutant backgrounds with partial-to-moderate loss of function. An appealing model is that the NEKLs and PTPN-22 may exert opposing effects on one or more common substrates or may act on distinct components within a discrete complex or pathway. Along those lines, we previously identified a mutation affecting PAA-1/PPP2R1, a conserved serine/threonine PP2A phosphatase subunit, as a suppressor of nekl defects [41]. Nevertheless, whereas PP2A could directly reverse NEKL-mediated phosphorylation at serines and threonines, PTPN-22 is predicted to target specifically phosphotyrosines and may thus oppose NEKL functions more indirectly. We previously showed that NEKL-2 and NEKL-3 have overlapping but distinct roles in several steps of membrane trafficking including cargo uptake from apical and basolateral membranes along with transit through the endosomal system [38, 40]. Additionally, we showed that the NEKLs inhibit actin filamentation, co-localize at endosomes with CDC-42, and negatively regulate CDC-42 activity [42]. CDC42 is a well-studied member of the Rho family of GTPases that promotes actin polymerization within a variety of cellular contexts including multiple roles within the membrane trafficking system. Effectors of CDC42 include conserved members of the WASP and TOCA family of proteins, which together with the Arp2/3 complex promote the extension and branching of actin filaments [96–100]. CDC42 activity is itself tightly controlled by upstream regulators including RhoGEFs, such as DNBP-1 family proteins, as well as GTPase-activating proteins ( GAPs )

. To determine if loss of PTPN-22 catalytic activity is critical for its suppression of nekl molting defects, we mutated the active site cysteine residue ( C306 ), equivalent to C227 in human PTPN22, using CRISPR/Cas9 methods [19, 46]. We observed that ptpn-22 ( C306S ) suppressed nekl-2; nekl-3 molting defects by ~50% ( Fig 1B ), indicating that it is the loss of PTPN-22 phosphatase activity that leads to the suppression of nekl-2; nekl-3 molting defects. Although mammalian members of the PTPN22 family have been studied extensively in the context of the adaptive immune system, those findings did not suggest an obvious mechanism by which C. elegans PTPN-22 might functionally interact with NEKL proteins in the context of molting. We therefore took a non-biased approach to identify potential partners and targets of C. elegans PTPN-22 by mapping its in vivo ( proximate ) interactome using biotin-based proximity labeling methods. Proximity labeling ( also referred to as BioID ) methods can be effective for detecting high-affinity binding partners as well as weak or transient interactors, including the substrates of protein kinases and phosphatases [47–55]. Additionally, proximity labeling can provide insights into tissue expression, subcellular localization, and cellular functions. In proximity labeling, a protein of interest is fused to an Escherichia coli–derived biotin ligase, BirA, and the resulting fusion protein is expressed in cells using either a native or heterologous promoter. In the presence of ATP, BirA converts non-reactive biotin into biotinoyl-5′-adenylate, which reacts with lysine residues on nearby ( in proximity ) proteins to form covalent linkages to biotin ( Fig 2A ) [56, 57]

. Whereas lin-35 and rrf-3 mutants showed increased RNAi sensitivity to these five genes relative to N2 controls, ptpn-22 mutants failed to exhibit a consistent pattern of hypersensitivity ( S5 Fig ). Taken together, our genetic and localization data suggest that PTPN-22 plays a positive role in the function of C. elegans hemidesmosomes. Nevertheless, we failed to detect gross changes in the localization pattern of CeHD components ( MUP-4, IFB-1A, and LET-805 ) in ptpn-22 null mutants ( S6A Fig ), consistent with the viability and normal morphology of ptpn-22 mutants. As such, PTPN-22 could play a role in fine-tuning CeHD function, assembly, or stability. Given that CeHDs are extensively remodeled during molting cycles, we were curious if loss of ptpn-22 might contribute to nekl molting suppression in part through its effects on CeHDs in addition to its implicated interactions with DNBP-1. As a test for this, we carried out partial RNAi knockdown of the hemidesmosome proteins mup-4 and let-805 in nekl-2; nekl-3 worms but failed to observe any mitigation of the molting-defective phenotype ( S6B Fig ). These results suggest that the role of PTPN-22 at CeHDs may be distinct from functions linked to the NEKL–MLT pathway. Previous studies have indicated the involvement of mammalian PTPN22 in suppressing T lymphocyte–specific integrin activation to regulate integrin-mediated cell adhesion [31, 32]. Correspondingly, Phyp7::PTPN-22::TurboID proximity labeling studies showed enrichment of the α subunit of integrin PAT-2/ITGA2B/ITGA5 ( ~5-fold ) and epithelial junction protein DLG-1/DLG1 ( ~4. 3-fold ) ( Figs 5A and S7A and S4 File ) [78, 89]. To explore a potential role for C. elegans PTPN-22 in integrin function and other adherens junctions beyond CeHDs, we conducted RNAi enhancement tests to assess ptpn-22 genetic interactions with pat-2 and dlg-1

. Given indications of a functional interaction between PTPN-22 and DNBP-1, we tested for genetic interactions between PTPN-22 and DNBP-1 by assaying for potential enhancement of nekl-2; nekl-3 suppression when both PTPN-22 and DNBP-1 were simultaneously inhibited. Our results suggested a significant increase in the percentage of suppressed nekl-2; nekl-3 worms when both PTPN-22 and DNBP-1 were inhibited as compared with the loss of single proteins including putative null mutations ( S4C Fig ). Overall, our genetic results suggest that PTPN-22 and DNBP-1 are unlikely to be fully dependent on each other for their activities and also suggest that PTPN-22 may affect molting through one or more additional targets. Consistent with at least some functional independence, alteration of the N-terminal proline-rich domain of PTPN-22 ( PR. 1; P26PPPLPTSNP35 to AAAALATSNA, referred to as PR. 1 mut ), which is predicted to disrupt binding to the SH3. 3 domain of DNBP-1, did not lead to strong suppression of nekl-2; ne-3 molting ( S Fig 5B ).
Researchers used a comprehensive dataset from the WorldWide Antimal Resistance Network (WWARN) on the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch 13 (K) gene, associated with artem resistance, and a Bayesian geostatistical model to produce spatio-temporal predictions of artem resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion. The maps show an expansion of the K mutation across the region from 2000 to 202, with the most change occurring between 2010 and 2015. The model provides insights into spatial and temporal trends of artem resistance not possible with data alone, enabling improved decision support on a fine spatial resolution. The study predicts the first spatio-temporal and extents of artem resistance at the subcontinent level, providing critical information for malaria elimination in Southeast Asia. The maps provide estimates of resistance for locations with no data, guiding prioritization of surveillance and policies to prevent further resistance. The work advances earlier predictions of K prevalence over the Greaterong Sub from 200 to 202 based on a comprehensive dataset of K studies in the region, illustrating the expansion of artem resistance in the last 10 years and increase in east and north Myanmar border Indian States. The results are consistent with earlier modelling and data on the spread of artem resistance. The identification of mutations in the K protein associated with artem resistance allows monitoring on a large scale, with almost 200 candidate genotypes established and a refined set of K alleles with slow clearance.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Function-to-find domain ( FIIND ) -containing proteins, including NLRP1 and CARD8, are vital components of the inflammasome signaling pathway, critical for the innate immune response. These proteins exist in various forms due to autoproteolysis within the FIIND domain, resulting in full-length ( FL ), cleaved N-terminal ( NT ), and cleaved C-terminal ( CT ) peptides, which form autoinhibitory complexes in the steady state. However, the detailed mechanism remains elusive. Here, we found that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 form two conserved autoinhibitory complexes involving NT-CT interactions and FL-CT interactions, but with distinct mechanisms. Specifically, the Linker3 region located between LRR and FIIND in murine NLRP1b ( mNLRP1b ) plays an essential role in forming the NT-CT autoinhibitory complexes, while the ZU5 of rat NLRP1 ( rNLRP1 ) and CARD8 mediates their NT-CT interaction. In addition, we explored the involvement of the cellular protease dipeptidyl peptidases 9 ( DPP9 ) in these complexes, revealing differential interactions and the significance of domain structure. Besides the FL-DPP9-CT complex, DPP9 interacts with NTs of mNLRP1b, rNLRP1, and CARD8 through their ZU5 subdomains, forming NT-DPP9-CT complex; however, DPP9 cannot bind to NTs of hNLRP1. Further functional assay indicated that although DPP9 is involved in the NT-CT complex of rodent NLRP1 and CARD8, it does not influence the inhibitory activity of NT on CT. Our study enhanced the understanding of the regulatory functions of FIIND-containing proteins in inflammasome autoinhibition and activation and underscored the complexity of their interactions within the immune response.

    NLRP1 and CARD8 are the sole mammalian proteins containing FIIND domain and they exist in three forms at steady state: full-length protein ( FL ), cleaved N-terminal peptide ( NT ), and cleaved C-terminal peptide ( CT ). This diversity arises due to autoproteolysis occurring between ZU5 and UPA subdomains within FIIND ( Fig 1A–1C ). hNLRP1 forms two distinct autoinhibitory complexes in which both hNLRP1FL and hNLRP1NT interact with hNLRP1CT, effectively preventing the assembly of the inflammasome mediated by hNLRP1CT [8]. The Linker1 region, located between PYD and NACHT of hNLRP1, is critical for forming these autoinhibitory complexes [8]; however, this region is not conserved in NLRP1 paralogs or CARD8. Consequently, we investigated whether other NLRP1 paralogs, such as mNLRP1b and rNLRP1, as well as CARD8, are capable of forming similar autoinhibitory complexes. In alignment with hNLRP1, co-immunoprecipitation assay conducted in HEK293T cells demonstrated that N-terminal Flag-tagged mNLRP1bNT, rNLRP1NT, and CARD8NT can interact with their corresponding C-terminal HA-tagged CT counterparts ( Fig 1D–1F ). In addition to the NT-CT interaction, cleavage-resistant mutants—mNLRP1bS984A, rNLRP1S969A, and CARD8S297A also interacted with their corresponding CT, consistent with previous reported interactions ( Fig 1G–1I ). These findings suggest that the formation of these two different complexes is a common feature shared by both CARD8 and NLRP1 paralogs. Next, we assessed whether these complexes influenced the activation of the NLRP1 or CARD8 inflammasome. Both NLRP1CT and CARD8CT were capable of triggering the secretion of mature IL-1β in HEK293T cells expressing ASC, caspase-1, and pro-IL-1β ( Fig 1J ). In contrast, the expression of the corresponding cleavage-resistant forms of NLRP1 or CARD8 inhibited IL-1β maturation, preventing the activity of the corresponding CT ( Fig 1J )

The formation of distinct autoinhibitory complexes involving FIIND-containing proteins, such as NLRP1 and CARD8, represents a highly regulated mechanism in controlling inflammasome activation. Our findings demonstrate that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 form two conserved autoinhibitory complexes, including NT-CT and FL-CT interactions, but with distinct molecular mechanisms. Both the NT and FL proteins bind to CT and restrict CT’s activity for inflammasome assembly and activation. The FIIND domain of FL proteins forms a relatively conserved ternary complex with the cleaved CT and the cellular protease DPP9 [22–24], while NT utilizes different domains or regions to interact with and inhibit CT ( S4F Fig ). Specifically, hNLRP1NT employs its Linker1 region ( between PYD and NACHT domains ) to bind to hNLRP1CT [8], whereas mNLRP1bNT utilizes Linker3 ( between LRR and FIIND ) to interact with mNLRP1bCT. Both rNLRP1NT and CARD8NT exploit the ZU5 subdomain for their corresponding CT interactions. The UPA subdomain in the CTs mediates interactions with Linker1 ( hNLRP1NT ), Linker3 ( mNLRP1bNT ), or ZU5 ( rNLRP1NT and CARD8NT ), involving in the inflammasome assembly through self-oligomerization. Consequently, the deletion of Linker1 from hNLRP1 or Linker3 from mNLRP1b not only abolishes NT-CT interaction but also results in spontaneous inflammasome activation. Although NLRP1 homologs exhibit low sequence identity in the N-terminus between humans and rodents, they all can form NT-CT autoinhibitory complexes. Notably, mNLRP1b demonstrates high polymorphism in mice, with five different allelic variants. Only the allele1 possesses the NLRP1bNT-NLRP1CT complex, attributed to a 61-amino-acid insertion in Linker3, precisely at the binding site for mNLRP1bCT. This could help explain why mNLRP1b from C57BL/6J mice ( allele2 ) exhibits higher basal inflammasome activity compared to mNLRP1b from Balb/C mice ( allele1 ) [30]

. Similarly, NLRP1NT or CARD8NT also exhibited an inhibitory effect on IL-1β secretion ( Fig 1K ). Given that CARD8 inflammasome activation does not depend on ASC [20, 21], we focused on using ASC to evaluate NLRP1 inflammasome activation. All CTs from hNLRP1, mNLRP1b, and rNLRP1 induced the formation of ASC spikes in HEK293T cells stably expressing GFP-ASC, while expression of their corresponding cleavage-resistant NLRP1FL or NLRP1NT inhibited ASC spike formation ( S1A–S1D Fig ). These results demonstrate that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 exist in a steady state characterized by the formation of NT-CT and FL-CT autoinhibitory complexes, suggesting a conserved regulatory mechanism among these FIIND-containing proteins. Previous structural studies have shown that the host protease DPP9 forms a ternary complex with FIINDFL and UPA of hNLRP1, rNLRP1, and CARD8, effectively preventing UPA-mediated oligomerization and subsequent inflammasome activation [22–24]. However, these studies primarily focused on the FIIND domain or utilized proteins with significant deletions of their N-terminal domains [22–24]. As a result, it remains unclear whether other regions of NLRP1 or CARD8 contribute to DPP9 interaction or to the formation of autoinhibitory complex. Our prior research has demonstrated that NT-CT complex of hNLRP1 does not contain cellular DPP9 and the DPP8/9 inhibitor VbP only activates hNLRP1FL-DPP9-hNLRP1CT complex, not hNLRP1NT-hNLRP1CT complex [8]. This prompted us to investigate the role of DPP9 in the NT-CT and FL-CT complexes of mNLRP1b, rNLRP1, and CARD8. In contrast with the behavior observed with hNLRP1, the cleavage resistant mutants of mNLRP1b ( S984A ), rNLRP1 ( S969A ), and CARD8 ( S297A ) showed similar binding affinity to DPP9 as the respective wild-type proteins, suggesting the autocleavage within the FIIND domain is not necessary for the interaction between DPP9 and rodent NLPR1 or CARD8 ( Fig 2A–C ). Moreover, D9 binds to NT of mLR1,NLR1, and CARD through their Z5 subdomains, forming NT-D9-CT complex ( Fig 2D–F ), whereas D9 cannot bind to NT of hLR1 ( Fig 2G ). These findings indicate that D9 interacts with NT of rodent NLR1 and CARD8 but not human NLR1, and that the interaction is independent of autocle within the FI domain. Further, we found that D9 is involved in the NT-CT complex of rod NLR1 and CARD8 but does not influence the inhibitory activity of NT on CT ( Fig 2H–J ). These results suggest that D9 plays a role in the NT-CT complex of rodent NLR1 and CARD8 but is not essential for the inhibitory activity of NT on CT. Overall, our study enhances the understanding of the regulatory functions of FI-containing proteins in inflamome autoinhibition and underscores the complexity of their interactions within the immune response.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Defects in protein homeostasis can induce proteotoxic stress, affecting cellular fitness and, consequently, overall tissue health. In various growing tissues, cell competition based mechanisms facilitate detection and elimination of these compromised, often referred to as ‘loser’, cells by the healthier neighbors. The precise connection between proteotoxic stress and competitive cell survival remains largely elusive. Here, we reveal the function of an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi localized protein Rer1 in the regulation of protein homeostasis in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium. Our results show that loss of Rer1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α. Clonal analysis showed that rer1 mutant cells are identified as losers and eliminated through cell competition. Interestingly, we find that Rer1 levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression that causes overgrowth, albeit under high proteotoxic stress. Our results suggest that increased levels of Rer1 provide cytoprotection to Myc-overexpressing cells by alleviating the proteotoxic stress and thereby supporting Myc-driven overgrowth. In summary, these observations demonstrate that Rer1 acts as a novel regulator of proteostasis in Drosophila and reveal its role in competitive cell survival.

    In this study, we present compelling evidence supporting the role of Rer1 as a regulator of proteostasis in Drosophila. We show that Rer1 is localized to the ER and cis-Golgi compartments and loss of Rer1 activates PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α, indicating the onset of proteotoxic stress in the ER. These observations are consistent with the proposed function of Rer1 as a regulator of ER proteostasis [73]. Moreover, studies in yeast, worms and mouse cerebral cortex have shown that absence of Rer1 induces ER stress and activates the UPR pathways [43, 74], suggesting a well-conserved function of Rer1 across species. Our results show that proteotoxic stress induced by Rer1 deficiency creates loser cells that are eliminated via cell competition. This is in line with recent studies that have implicated mutations in genes, for example, RNA Helicase Hel25E, E3 ubiquitin ligase Mahjong and Rp mutations, in causing proteotoxic stress and subsequent elimination of mutant cells via cell competition [11, 12, 15, 16, 49, 56]. Interestingly, our results show that despite both rer1–/–and RpS3+/–cells exhibiting increased p-eIF2α, rer1 mutant cells outperform RpS3+/–cells when juxtaposed. Several potential reasons for the difference in their fitness can be envisaged. First, RpS3+/–cells, that are also rer1+/–, may experience higher stress levels than rer1–/–cells, potentially rescuing later from their loser fate. Second, different downstream pathways may be activated by stress originating in the cytoplasm of RpS3+/–cells as compared to stress in the ER of Rer1-deficient cells. Third, the differential effect of p-eIF2α on translation was observed in RpS3+/–and rer1–/–cells. Our data shows that, despite having higher p-eIF2α, rer1–/–cells do not show reduction in translation

. We observed that the expression of rer1-RNAi in the posterior compartment led to an increase in the levels of DHE as compared to the control anterior compartment, indicating high oxidative stress ( S6A–S6D Fig ). Altogether, these results suggest that loss of Rer1 increases both proteotoxic and oxidative stress in cells. Four kinases, namely, PERK, GCN2 ( general control nonderepressible 2 ), PKR ( protein kinase R ) and HRI ( heme regulated inhibitor ) are known to sense cellular stress and cause phosphorylation of eIF2α, however, in Drosophila only PERK and GCN2 are conserved [58]. Studies suggest that phosphorylation of eIF2α via PERK is due to ER stress [59, 60], whereas the phosphorylation via GCN2 is due to amino acid starvation [61, 62]. Thus, to further dissect the mechanisms of eIF2α phosphorylation upon loss of Rer1, we depleted PERK or GCN2 in rer1–/–cells, using the MARCM approach ( see material and methods ), and analyzed p-eIF2α levels. We observed that knockdown of PERK in rer1–/–clones reduced the levels of p-eIF2α, while GCN2 depletion did not show any significant change ( Fig 4A–4D, compare Fig 4B”’, 4C”’ and 4D”’; quantified in Fig 4E ). Consistent with this, we observed that the expression of PERK-RNAi in the posterior compartment caused reduction in the p-eIF2α, in both control and rer1-RNAi expressing discs ( S7A–S7B and S7D–S7E Fig ). Whereas coexpression of GCN2-RNAi and rer1-RNAi did not alter p-eIF2α levels ( S7F Fig ), although expression of GCN2-RNAi alone showed mild reduction ( S7C Fig ). Altogether, these results show that loss of Rer1 caused ER stress leading to PERK-mediated phosphorylation of e-IF2α. We also noticed that depletion of PERK, but not GCN2, significantly increased the size of the rer1–/–clones ( quantified in Fig 4F ), indicating that higher levels of p-eIF2α may have a negative effect on the survival of rer1–/–cells

. Mutations in the rer1 gene were first described in yeast, where it was identified in a screen as a factor required for proper transport of Sec12p between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi [36]. Later studies have shown that Rer1 is also required for the assembly of multisubunit protein complexes, for example, the tetrameric γ-secretase complex, yeast iron transporter and skeletal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) [37–42]. Rer1 is also known to regulate ER homeostasis, and therefore loss of Rer1 has been shown to induce ER stress in yeast and worms [43]. Despite the fact that Rer1 is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals, its function in the development of organisms remains largely unknown [43–45]. By creating a rer1 loss-of-function mutant, we show that rer1 is an essential gene in Drosophila. Furthermore, we found that loss of Rer1 creates proteotoxic stress in the developing wing epithelium, and when surrounded by wild-type cells, the clonal population of rer1 mutant cells attained the loser fate and were eliminated specifically via the process of cell competition. We have also analyzed the role of Rer1 in Myc-induced overgrowth and Rer1 levels were found to be upregulated upon Myc-overexpression. More importantly, we found that loss of Rer1 is sufficient to suppress Myc-induced overgrowth. In summary, our results demonstrate that Rer1 is an essential protein for proper maintenance of protein homeostasis and competitive cell survival in a developing tissue.

. More importantly, the Dcp-1 staining could now be observed in the RpS3+/–cells at the boundary ( Fig 2D’–2D” see blue arrows; quantified in Fig 2F ), demonstrating that the activation of cell death in rer1–/–could be reversed by reducing the fitness level of the neighbors ( Fig 2G–2H ). Thus, the boundary cell death in rer1–/–clones observed in otherwise normal background is due to higher fitness of the surrounding wild-type cells. Altogether, these results show that the loss of Rer1 created loser cells which are eliminated via cell competition. Studies have shown that Rer1 is localized dynamically between the ER and cis-Golgi compartments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [52, 53] and mammalian cells [40, 44], where it functions in protein quality control processes [45]. However, its localization and function in Drosophila remains unknown. Utilizing the GFP-rer1 genomic rescue construct, we observed that GFP-Rer1 colocalized with both ER ( Calnx ) and Golgi ( Golgin-245 ) markers in the wing epithelial cells ( S4A–S4B Fig ), affirming its conserved localization. Next, we wondered if the loss of Rer1 also affected protein homeostasis in flies. Thus, we analyzed the level of phosphorylated eIF2α ( p-eIF2α ), which is a well-established marker of proteotoxic stress [54]. Consistent with the proposed function of Rer1 [43], higher levels of p-eIF2α were observed in both rer1–/–clones ( Fig 3A–3C ) and RNAi-mediated depletion of Rer1 ( S5A–S5F Fig ) compared to the control regions, indicating activation of the UPR pathways. The increased level of p-eIF2α in rer1/–clones was confirmed by western blotting ( Fig 3–D ) and quantified in Fig 3E. Moreover, we observed that p-eIFα was localized to the ER ( Fig 3–F ), consistent with the proposed function of R1 as a regulator of ERostasis [73]. We also observed that p-eIFα in rer1/–clones was not localized to the cytoplasm ( Fig 3–G ), indicating that the stress is ER-specific, not cytoplasmic. The localization of p-eIFα in rer1–clones was confirmed by co-staining with the ER marker Cal ( Fig 3–H ) and quantified in Fig 3I. These results show that loss of R1 leads to ER stress and activation of the UPR, consistent with proposed function of R1 as a regulator of ERostasis [73].

    Title: 
    Abstract: Loss of function mutations in the checkpoint kinase gene CHEK2 are associated with increased risk of breast and other cancers. Most of the 3, 188 unique amino acid changes that can result from non-synonymous single nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) of CHEK2, however, have not been tested for their impact on the function of the CHEK2-enocded protein ( CHK2 ). One successful approach to testing the function of variants has been to test for their ability to complement mutations in the yeast ortholog of CHEK2, RAD53. This approach has been used to provide functional information on over 100 CHEK2 SNVs and the results align with functional assays in human cells and known pathogenicity. Here we tested all but two of the 4, 887 possible SNVs in the CHEK2 open reading frame for their ability to complement RAD53 mutants using a high throughput technique of deep mutational scanning ( DMS ). Among the non-synonymous changes, 770 were damaging to protein function while 2, 417 were tolerated. The results correlate well with previous structure and function data and provide a first or additional functional assay for all the variants of uncertain significance identified in clinical databases. Combined, this approach can be used to help predict the pathogenicity of CHEK2 variants of uncertain significance that are found in susceptibility screening and could be applied to other cancer risk genes.

   . The same study also showed that a CHEK2 missense variant leading to S428F within the kinase domain does not complement, while a missense variant leading to P85L in the SCD has wildtype-like activity. Additionally, rad53 complementation assays using the DNA damaging agent, methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ) have been performed to evaluate the functional impact of over 100 germline missense variants detected in familial breast cancer patients or selected from the ClinVar database [33–35]. Over 2, 700 CHEK2 missense variants, however, have not been tested in a functional assay, including most of the VUS in the ClinVar database. To test the ability of all possible CHEK2 coding SNVs to complement a rad53 mutant, we conducted a version of deep mutational scanning ( DMS ) [36, 37]. This technique, also known as a multiplex assay of variant effects ( MAVE ) [38], has become a valuable tool to evaluate the impact of genetic variants on protein function and has been used in several studies to characterize human protein variants based on their function in yeast [39–43]. To carry out a DMS screen. we made a comprehensive library of CHEK2 coding variants using error-prone PCR, screened the library en masse for rad53 complementation, then used next generation sequencing ( NGS ) to identify complementors in the selected yeast. This resulted in testing 4, 885 of the 4, 887 possible CHEK2 SNVs, including all but one of the 3, 913 possible codon changes ( stop, synonymous, or non-synonymous ). This large-scale functional assay of CHK2 variants evaluated the impact of almost every possible SNV in the open reading frame of CHEK2, providing data to aid in the classification of CHEK2 VUS.

. The SNVs that were evaluated represented all but one of the 3, 913 possible unique coding outcomes, including 195 stop codons, 530 synonymous changes, and 3, 187 non-synonymous changes ( S2 Table ). The average RCS for all variants was -0. 94 ( range -7. 30–5. 20 ). To begin to test the assertion that loss of CHEK2 function correlates with screen depletion, we constructed 30 variants and tested them individually for rad53 complementation. We found that the 9 variants that did not fully complement rad53 in individual assays were more depleted in the screen ( ave. RCS -3. 64, SD = 1. 12 ) than were the 11 variants that fully complemented rad53 in individual assays ( ave. RCS -0. 76, SD = 1. 10 ) ( Fig 1 ). These results suggest that depletion in the screen can be used as a predictor of variant function. To see how well the screen results correlate with previous annotations of pathogenicity, we looked at SNVs in ClinVar [35]. ClinVar currently has information for 1, 418 CHEK2 SNVs, including 98 that are annotated as being pathogenic or likely pathogenic, 1, 268 that are variants of uncertain significance ( VUS ), and 58 noted as having conflicting information regarding pathogenicity; ClinVar has no information on 2, 237 of the non-synonymous SNVs that we evaluated in our screen. Consistent with the predictive power of our screen, the pathogenic variants were significantly more depleted ( mean RCS -3. 15, stdev = 1. 49 ) than the VUS ( mean RCS -1. 10, stdev = 1. 54 ) or the variants with conflicting annotations ( Fig 2 ). The VUSs as well as the SNVs that are not in ClinVar had a wider distribution of depletion values in the screen, consistent with the likelihood that only a fraction of these may be functionally defective. Most ( 92/98 ) of the CHEK2 SNVs that are considered pathogenic or likely pathogenic in ClinVar create premature nonsense ( stop ) codons in the ORF

. Standards for the clinical classification of sequence variants established by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics ( ACMG ) use multiple pieces of evidence ( family history, allele frequency, segregation and functional data, etc. ) to classify sequence variants as either pathogenic ( associated with increased cancer risk ) or benign [28]. Most variants detected in susceptibility screening, however, lack supporting evidence by statistically significant population data to classify them as either pathogenic or benign, resulting in their classification as variants of uncertain significance ( VUS ) [28]. One solution to this problem is to test individual variants using assays for protein function to determine whether each variant is damaging to protein function. Functional analysis can provide supporting evidence for clinical classification of rare variants that otherwise could not be supported by population and family data [11, 28]. Several different functional assays have been used to test individual and small sets of CHK2 missense variants identified in patients, including tests of protein stability, kinase activity toward various substrates, and activation by DNA damaging agents [22, 23, 29–32]. Another method to assay the function of CHK2 variants is to test their ability to complement a yeast RAD53 loss-of-function mutant ( rad53 ). Human CHEK2 was cloned and first tested for its ability to complement yeast rad53 in a complementation growth assay in 1998 [1]. This study also demonstrated that the CHK2 kinase defective mutant, D347A, failed to complement rad53. Yeast rad53 complementation has been used as a method for protein function assessment on several other CHEK2 pathogenic and likely-pathogenic variants. For example, the CHEK2 founder mutation, c. 1100delC was tested for complementation of yeast rad53 mutants and no complementation was observed [24]

The fact that several known loss-of-function CHK2 variants are associated with increased cancer risk leads to the expectation that any CHK2 loss-of function variant would also contribute to cancer risk. This forms the rationale for determining the functional consequences of CHK2 variants, either experimentally with functional assays or computationally with VEPs. Applying functional data, therefore, can contribute as evidence to the clinical classification system put forth by the ACMG, even for rare variants that have no segregation data [28]. The high throughput approach presented here provided a functional assay for most of the CHK2 variants that can be generated by SNVs. The screen evaluated the functional impact of 4, 885 of the 4, 887 possible SNVs in the CHEK2 ORF, which included all but one of the 3, 913 possible unique protein-coding changes. This included functional data for the 1, 268 VUS in ClinVar along with an additional 2, 237 non-synonymous variants. The data also provide additional supporting evidence for the 58 variants that have a ClinVar clinical classification as “conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity”, and for 443 missense variants that have been tested in at least one other functional assay. A problem that has emerged in using computational or experimental data to determine variant function is that the various assays or prediction methods do not always agree on the classification. There are several possible explanations for these disagreements. For some variants, the explanation lies in how different studies report variants and whether the classification systems are based on two ( tolerated or damaging ) or three ( including intermediate ) functional classes. For example, of the five variants annotated in ClinVar as “benign/likely benign”, our screen classified one ( I448S ) as functionally damaging

To construct a library of all possible CHEK2 SNVs, we used error-prone PCR ( EP-PCR ) on the CHEK2 open reading frame ( ORF ) and subcloned the mutagenized ORF into a yeast expression vector ( Methods ). Subsequent next generation sequencing of the library after introduction into yeast revealed an average SNV frequency of 0. 86 ( SD = 0. 46 ) per 1, 000 bp. The library contained 4, 887 of the 4, 887 possible CHE2 SN, including 195 stop codons, 530 synonymous, and 3,187 non-syn changes ( S Table 1 ). We then screened the library for rad53 complementation using a high-throughput method, deep mutational scanning ( DMS ) [36, 37]. DMS is a multiplex assay of variant effects ( MAVE ) [38] that has been used to evaluate the impact of genetic variants on protein function in several studies [39–43]. We used D to test the ability of all possible CHE2 SN to complement a rad53 mutant. The library was transformed into yeast and plated on selective media containing the DNA damaging agent methylmethanesulfonate ( MMS ) to select for rad complementors. The transformants were then sequenced to identify the SNs in the selected. This resulted in testing 4,885 of the 4,887 possible CHE2 SN, including all but one of the 3,913 cod changes ( stop, synonymous, non-syn ). The average for all variants was -0.94 ( range -7.30–.20 ) To test the assertion that loss of CHE2 function correlates with depletion we constructed 30 variants and tested them individually for rad complement. We found that the 9 that did not fully complement rad in assays were depleted in the screen ( RCS -3.64, SD 1.12 ) than the 11 that fully complemented rad in assays ( RCS -0.76, SD 1.10 ) ( Fig 1 ) These results suggest that depletion can be used as a predictor of variant. To see how the results correlate with previous annotations of pathogenic we looked at SN in ClinVar [35] Clin has information for 1,418 CHE2 SN, including 98 that are annotated as pathogenic or likely path, 1,268 that variants of uncertain ( V ) and 58 with conflicting information regarding pathity Clin has no information 2, of non-syn SN that evaluated our screen Consistent the predictive of our path variants were significantly depleted ( RCS-3.15, SD 1.49 ) than V ( RCS-1.10 SD 1.54 ) or variants with conflicting ( Fig 2 ) VUS as well as SN not in Clin had wider distribution values screen consistent likelihood only fraction may be function defective Most 92 of CHE2 that pathogenic likely in create premature stop codons ORF

    Title: 
    Abstract: Human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae forms multiple epigenetically and phenotypically distinct intra-populations by invertase PsrA-driven inversions of DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the colony opacity-determinant ( cod ) locus. As manifested by phase switch between opaque and transparent colonies, different genome methylation patterns or epigenomes confer pathogenesis-associated traits, but it is unknown how the pathogen controls the hsdS inversion orientations. Here, we report our finding of the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin ( TA ) system that regulates the orientations of hsdS inversions, and thereby bacterial epigenome and associated traits ( e. g., colony opacity ) by targeting pneumococcal protein synthesis. SpxA1 and TenA were found to constitute a highly conserved type II TA system in S. pneumoniae, primarily based on the observation that overexpressing toxin TenA led to growth arrest in E. coli and enhanced autolysis in S. pneumoniae, and the antitoxin SpxA1 repressed the transcription of the spxA1-tenA operon. When the transcription of tenA was de-repressed by a spontaneous AT di-nucleotide insertion/deletion in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon, TenA bound to the ribosome maturation factor RimM, and thereby reduced the cellular level of alternative sigma factor ComX ( known for the activation of natural transformation-associated genes ). Attenuation of ComX expression in turn enhanced the transcription of the invertase gene psrA, which favored the formation of the transparent colony phase-associated hsdS allelic configurations in the cod locus. Phenotypically, moderate expression of TenA dramatically reshaped pneumococcal epigenome and colony opacity. Because spontaneous variations frequently occur during bacterial growth in the number of the AT di-nucleotides in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon, this locus acts as a programmed genetic switch that generates pneumococcal subpopulations with epigenetic and phenotypic diversity. 

    Supporting Text:
   . Taken together, we propose a working model of the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin system ( Fig 7F ). Spontaneous sequence variations of the AT-rich region in the spxA1 promoter region alter the transcription of the spxA1-tenA operon and the unbalanced functional relationship between SpxA1 and TenA; the excess toxin TenA targets the ribosomes by interacting with ribosome biogenesis chaperone RimM to exert its “toxicity”, somehow reducing the cellular abundance of ComX; the reduced ComX leads to the enhanced expression of invertase PsrA and thereby shift the hsdS inversions in the cod locus toward non-hsdSA1 allelic configurations and methylomes; the resulting epigenetic variations yield phenotypical diversity in colony morphology and potentially other traits by an uncharacterized mechanism. In short, this spontaneous genetic variation in the expression of the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin system may represent a programmed mechanism of epigenetic adaptation in S. pneumoniae.

. The TenA-driven allelic loss of hsdSA1 was repeatedly verified under various tenA-overexpressed settings, such as ectopic expression of tenA under the control of spxA1 or hu promoter in the bgaA locus, deletion of spxA1, and sequence changes in the AT-rich region. At the epigenetic level, the pneumococcal strain with the hu promoter-driven tenA completely lost the 6-mA methylation of the DNA motif recognized by the HsdSA1-specific DNA methyltransferase, with more abundant methylation of HsdSA2- and HsdSA3-recognized sequences. The TenA-driven epigenomic overhaul dramatically alters various aspects of bacterial biology. This was manifested by overwhelming switch of pneumococcal colony phase from the opaque colony phase in WT strain to the transparent counterpart under multiple genetic settings in which tenA was overexpressed. While the mechanistic link between genome methylation pattern and colony phase remains to be defined, it is certain that the methylome determined by individual HsdSA shapes pneumococcal colony opacity via complex processes. A large body of literature has documented significant differences between the opaque and transparent colony phases in the amount of capsular polysaccharide [4, 55], cell wall polysaccharide [2, 4, 56], multiple proteins [57–59] and fatty acids [60]. Moreover, the O and T colony phases also differ in autolysin LytA-driven cell lysis ( autolysis ) [3, 61] and natural genetic transformation [62]. In this context, future investigations are warranted to define how TenA exerts its epigenetic impact on pneumococcal pathobiology. ComX is known for its essential role in transcriptional activation of the late competence genes for DNA uptake and processing [13, 15, 16]. This study has demonstrated that ComX is required for the stabilization of the O phase-defining hsdSA1 allele in the cod locus. Deleting one or both copies of comX led to the loss of the hsdSA1 allele in the cod locus

. However, further investigation revealed that SpxA1 and TenA have no obvious interaction in bacterial adenylate cyclase-based two-hybrid ( BACTH ) system ( S4D Fig ), although the bioinformatic analysis by AlphaFold3 [36] strongly suggested that SpxA1 and TenA form a strong molecular complex ( S4E Fig ). These lines of evidence have strongly suggest that TenA and SpxA1 form a previously uncharacterized type II toxin-antitoxin system, in which toxin TenA is transcriptionally repressed by its antitoxin SpxA1. To figure out the molecular mechanism behind the action of TenA in regulation of pneumococcal epigenetic and colony phases, we performed affinity pull-down assay with His-tagged TenA to identify potential protein ( s ) that acts as liaison between TenA and the hsdS inversions. This experiment identified 65 proteins with significant enrichment ( Figs 5A and S5 and S4 Table ). Notably, PsrA was absent from the hits, suggesting that TenA regulates the hsdS inversion without direct interaction with the invertase. The majority of the hits were associated with ribosomal structure ( 45 ) or biogenesis ( 6 ). We first tested the impact of the seven non-essential proteins out of the 14 non-ribosomal protein hits. Deleting each of the seven genes led to significantly decreased hsdSA1 allelic configuration in clonal population, except for cmbR ( Fig 5B ), indicating that these genes are associated with the hsdS inversions. This finding was consistent with significant reduction of opaque colonies in these mutants ( S6A Fig ). We next focused on ComX because it was the most enriched DNA-associated protein by TenA ( Fig 5A ). ComX is an alternative sigma factor that activates the expression of pneumococcal competence-associated genes for DNA uptake and processing by interacting with the “com box” sequence in the promoter regions of the target genes [37, 38]. There are two copies of comX ( comX1 and comX2 ) at two remote loci in the pneumococcal genome

. Each of the six HsdSA subunits drives the N6-methyladenine ( 6-mA ) methylation of a unique sequence motif that is present in many genomic loci, forming a distinct methylome [7, 9]. Phenotypically, only the pneumococci carrying hsdSA1 allele produce O colonies, while the other five hsdSA2-6-carrying variants generate T colonies [7, 9]. Each of the six hsdSA alleles defines a unique transcriptome [7]. Our recent study has shown that the orientations of hsdS inversions in the cod locus and resulting colony phases are subjective to transcriptional regulation by four two-component regulatory systems ( TCSs ) [11]. The absence of these TCSs leads to dramatic loss of hsdSA1-carrying variant and thereby O colonies in the clonal populations. Together, the epigenetic switches driven by hsdS inversions in the cod locus confer S. pneumoniae variable biological characteristics and pathogenetic identities to enhance bacterial adaptation. S. pneumoniae is capable of natural genetic transformation or the competence state to achieve genetic diversity by uptaking and recombining foreign DNA molecules into the genome. The competence state is transiently activated by the ComDE, a two-component system in response to an extracellular competence stimulating peptide ( CSP ) [12]. Exposure to CSP activates the transcription of comX, comW and other early competence genes that are responsible for further activation of the late competence genes for DNA uptake and processing [13, 14]. ComX is the alternative sigma factor that, together with ComW, activates the late competence genes for DNA uptake and processing as a part of natural transformation by binding to the “com box” sequence in the promoter regions of the target genes [13, 15, 16]. There are two identical copies of comX ( comX1 and comX2 ) at two remote loci of pneumococcal genome. The cellular level of ComX is tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms, including autoregulation [17] and posttranscriptional regulation [18]. Com is essential for pneumoccal transformation and is required for the stabilization of the O-defining hSA allele in the locus. Deleting or both copies of com led to loss of the hSA allele in the locus. Com is also required for pneumoc transformation and is required for stabilization of the O-defining hSA allele in the locus. Deleting both copies of com led to loss of the hSA allele in the locus. Com is required for pneumoc transformation and is required for stabilization of O-definingSA allele in locus. Deleting both copies com to loss of hSA in locus. Com is required pneumoc and required for stabilization of O-def hSA allele in locus. Deleting both com to loss hSA in locus. Com is required pneumoc and for stabilization of O-def hSA allele locus. Deleting both com to loss hSA locus. Com is pneum required for and stabilization O-def hSA allele locus. Deleting both com to loss hSA. Com is pneum required for stabilization O-def hSA locus. Deleting com to loss hSA. Com is required for O-def hSA locus. Deleting com to hSA Com is required.

    Title: 
    Abstract: High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences, and it is often desirable to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition. However, traditional dimensionality reduction techniques cannot accomplish this because they operate on only one dataset. Contrastive principal component analysis ( cPCA ) has been proposed to address this problem, but it has seen little adoption because it requires tuning a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions, with no way of knowing which is correct. Moreover, cPCA uses foreground and background conditions that are treated differently, making it ill-suited to compare two experimental conditions symmetrically. Here we describe the development of generalized contrastive PCA ( gcPCA ), a flexible hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems. We first provide analyses explaining why cPCA requires a hyperparameter and how gcPCA avoids this requirement. We then describe an open-source gcPCA toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of several variants of gcPCA tailored for different scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data. As a fast, robust, and easy-to-use comparison method, gcPCA provides a valuable resource facilitating the analysis of diverse high-dimensional datasets to gain new insights into complex biological phenomena.

   . Mathematically, answering these questions corresponds to finding dimensions that account for more variance in A than in B ( S1A Fig ). Recently, contrastive PCA ( cPCA ) was proposed as a method to address this problem [14]. Although cPCA is an important first step, it requires a hyperparameter α, which controls how much covariance from the second condition to subtract from the first. The algorithm must therefore iterate over multiple choices of α with no objective criteria to determine which value of α yields the correct answer. Moreover, cPCA is asymmetric, identifying the most enriched dimensions in the first condition after subtracting out the second condition as background; it cannot treat the two experimental conditions equally. Here we propose a novel solution to these problems we call generalized contrastive PCA ( gcPCA ). We first demonstrate the role the α hyperparameter plays in cPCA, then explain our strategy for eliminating it. We then describe an open source toolbox for Python and MATLAB implementing several versions of gcPCA with different objective functions that are either asymmetric or symmetric, orthogonal or non-orthogonal, or sparse or dense, tailored to suit the specific application at hand. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in the analysis of diverse biological datasets.

Investigators in the biological sciences are increasingly collecting high-dimensional datasets that are challenging to analyze, with modalities ranging from imaging to electrophysiology to single-cell RNA sequencing. Dimensionality reduction algorithms such as principal components analysis ( PCA ) and its many variants [1–5] are used widely to help simplify these datasets and facilitate analysis. PCA examines the covariance structure of the data to find dimensions that account for more variance than chance; these constitute patterns that are overrepresented in the data, such as assemblies of neurons whose activity fluctuates up and down together across time in a neural recording [6–9], or networks of genes that are up- or down-regulated together across cells in a single-cell RNAseq dataset [10, 11]. However, in many cases, the goal is to compare data collected under two different experimental conditions, which we refer to here as datasets. Since PCA and other dimensionality reduction techniques operate on only one dataset, they cannot take experimental conditions into account. The most common approach for comparing two high-dimensional datasets is linear discriminant analysis ( LDA ) [12] or its multidimensional analog, partial least squares discriminant analysis [13]. These methods find dimensions that optimally distinguish one dataset from the other, which could correspond to which neurons fire more, or which genes are upregulated, in condition A vs. condition B. However, an analogous method to compare the covariance structure of two datasets is not as well established. This addresses more subtle and detailed questions, such as which subsets of neurons exhibit increased temporal correlations in condition A than B, or which subsets of genes are more likely to be up- or downregulated together in individual cells in condition A than B

Discovering low-dimensional patterns that differ between conditions in high-dimensional datasets is a crucial analysis in many research contexts. Here we present gcPCA, a method that achieves this by examining the covariance structure of the datasets to find dimensions that exhibit the largest relative changes in variance between conditions. This work builds on the pioneering insights in the development of cPCA [14] but solves cPCA’s key problem, the requirement for the hyperparameter α. Here we showed that the function of α is to compensate for bias toward high-variance dimensions in noisy, finitely-sampled data. Further, we showed how this can be circumvented by introducing a normalization factor to penalize high-variance dimensions. Previous work [14, 15] has focused on developing and improving methods to find appropriate choices for α, but with gcPCA we chose instead to eliminate the α hyperparameter entirely. The key advantage of this approach is not merely that it is computationally cheaper than scanning a range of α’s; it is that in most real-world cases there is no way to know whether a given choice of α yields a correct solution. We wish to address a common point of confusion by reiterating how gcPCA differs from LDA or Partial Least Squares ( PLS ) regression. LDA and PLS find patterns optimally distinguishing two datasets, but gcPCA finds patterns that exhibit more within-dataset variability in one dataset than another ( S1A Fig ). As a fictitious example, LDA might find a height dimension distinguishing a university basketball team from the general public because the average basketball player is taller than the average person. In contrast, gcPCA would likely find an age/education-level dimension because those features exhibit more variability across members of the general public than across members of a university team

. Despite the simplicity of this approach, it reveals interesting phenomena in high-dimensional biological data such as hippocampal replay ( Fig 3 ) or transcriptomic heterogeneity in disease states ( Fig 4 ). gcPCA has two main caveats: first, unlike ordinary PCs or cPCs, gcPCs are not orthogonal in the original feature space, but rather in the normalized feature space. This is because gcPCA applies the normalization to the data before finding the gcPCs, which is optimal for contrasting A and B. However, our toolbox includes versions of gcPCA that are constrained to be orthogonal in feature space ( v2. 1, v3. 1, and v4. 1 ), which comes at increased computational cost because a new eigendecomposition must be performed for each gcPC. In most cases using the constraint makes little difference to the end results ( S3A-S3D Fig ), but the difference will be greater in datasets where some dimensions exhibit much more variance than others, increasing the amount of normalization required. The second caveat is that the normalization factor introduces the possibility of numerical instability if the denominator matrix is rank-deficient, meaning it has dimensions with zero ( or near-zero ) variance that create division by zero. However, the implementation of gcPCA in the toolbox automatically excludes these dimensions if they exist. One limitation of this study is that we did not establish rigorous criteria for what constitutes "noisy and finitely-sampled" data likely to benefit from penalizing high-variance dimensions ( Fig 1 ), but almost all real-world biological datasets likely qualify to some degree. There may also be situations in which cPCA’s α could be a feature, rather than a bug, if the investigator has prior knowledge that the patterns of interest will lie in high- or low-variance dimensions. Choosing an appropriate α could then intentionally bias the analysis in favor of the results of interest

. When we requested the cPCA algorithm evaluate all the dimensions ( k = 48 ), the α values identified by the automatic selection did not reveal any obvious task-related spatial structure ( Fig 3F – left, α values 0. 4 and 942. 7 ). When we requested a smaller set of dimensions ( k = 2 ), the automatic α selection returned several different values, with one of them ( α = 1. 4 ) revealing task-related structure ( Fig 3F - right ). This reveals that although the only explicit hyperparameter for cPCA is α, the automatic α selection algorithm depends on k, the number of components requested, thus constituting a second de facto hyperparameter. Another key application of gcPCA is high-dimensional omics datasets, which often compare two conditions ( e. g. disease vs. healthy ) to identify a list of features ( e. g. genes ) that differ between conditions. Sparse gcPCA is well-suited for this task because the sparsification narrows down the list of genes to the most important contributors. We therefore compared the performance of sparse gcPCA v4 to traditional sparse PCA [3, 16] in published single-cell RNA sequencing data from pancreatic beta cells biopsied from patients with type II diabetes ( T2D ) or healthy controls [20]. We first performed sparse PCA separately on each condition and plotted the cells from both conditions in both PCA spaces ( Fig 4A-4B ). Cells from different subjects tended to aggregate together, and this pattern was largely preserved in either PCA space. This is because T2D and control cells exhibited similar covariance structure, with the loadings on the top PCs highly correlated ( Fig 4D ). We then performed sparse gcPCA on the combined data and plotted the cells in gc space ( Fig 4C ). The cells from T2 and control aggregated separately, and the loadings on the gcPCs were highly correlated ( Fig 4E ). This demonstrates that gc captures the heterogeneity of T2 in single-cell RNAseq data, which sparse PCA failed to do. We conclude that gc is a valuable tool for analyzing high-dimensional data, especially when comparing two conditions, because it is fast, robust, and easy-to-use, and can be tailored to the application at hand.

    Title: 
    Abstract: B cell receptor ( BCR ) signaling is required for the survival and maturation of B cells and is deregulated in B cell lymphomas. While proximal BCR signaling is well studied, little is known about the crosstalk of downstream effector pathways, and a comprehensive quantitative network analysis of BCR signaling is missing. Here, we semi-quantitatively modelled BCR signaling in Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) cells using systematically perturbed phosphorylation data of BL-2 and BL-41 cells. The models unveiled feedback and crosstalk structures in the BCR signaling network, including a negative crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK. The relevance of the crosstalk was verified for BCR and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by global phosphoproteomics on ERK itself and known ERK target sites. Compared to the starting network, the trained network for BL-2 cells was better transferable to BL-41 cells. Moreover, the BL-2 network was also suited to model BCR signaling in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells lines with aberrant BCR signaling ( HBL-1, OCI-LY3 ), indicating that BCR aberration does not cause a major downstream rewiring.

    In this work, we established a ( semi ) -quantitative signaling network of the BCR and tested it in different B cell lymphoma cell lines. We explored how a more quantitative understanding of signaling can be used to describe a conserved B cell receptor regulated signaling network, which can be used as a starting point to quantify cell-specific, individual networks. The development of the new BCR network model allowed us to introduce so far not described links in BCR mediated intracellular signaling. Earlier described network cross talks and feedbacks were confirmed, but also new feedbacks are identified further supporting the complexity of the BCR signaling network. Thus, the well-known RAF->MEK->ERK-|RAF regulatory loop also exists in BLs and DLBCLs, whereas the negative impact of BCR mediated p38 activation onto this loop is a newly discovered crosstalk found in three BL cell lines BL-2, BL-41 and CA-46 and one DLBCL cell line HBL-1. We propose that the identified negative crosstalk from BCR mediated activation of p38 to the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway might dampen an excessive RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. Despite the discovery of feedbacks and crosstalks in ERK and p38 signaling we could not find a cellular dependency in the cell lines we studied. However, as we determined that those signaling motifs are conserved across different B cell lymphoma types it might be possible that insights of this study apply also to other B cell lymphomas. For example, a recent study described an essential dependency to MAPK activity in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia progression suggesting that insights from this study could be valuable for treatment decisions in CLL [57]. While the mechanism behind the p38 –MEK/ERK crosstalk remains enigmatic, it is clear that it is neither mediated by the ERK feedback sites nor the tested activation sites of RAF1

. Fig 2A ). When using the above-mentioned interpretation for BL-41 coefficients downstream of AKT, we note that for all 16 coefficients at least three out of four exhibit the same sign, indicating a strong overall signaling conservation. The deviating coefficients for one cell line model are the aforementioned negative impact of PI3K on AKT in BL-41 cells, a negative effect from AKT to GSK3 and a weakly positive p38->RAF crosstalk in OCI-LY3 ( whose confidence interval spans over 0 indicating unimportance of that link, cf. S2 Table ) and a missing link in ERK-> p90RSK in HBL-1 cells. Since none of these outlier links is inherent to both cell lines of DLBCL or Burkitt Lymphoma origin we are unable to assign those differences to adaptations to chronic B-cell receptor signaling. Looking for more subtle common changes between acute and chronic BCR signaling a stronger positive feedback from GSK3 and a stronger coefficient between mTOR and RPS6 for HBL-1 and OCI-LY3 is observed. This points to the fact that only subtle changes seem to occur. In summary, we quantitatively describe a conserved core network in the studied cell systems.

. In conclusion, we could demonstrate that the more generic network trained from BL-2 and BL-41 cell lines had better transfer capacity to DLBCL cell lines HBL-1 and OCILY3 than the literature network indicating that a model trained on BCR-activated B-cells is informative to be transferred to BCR-driven cancer models. Importantly, our conserved BCR network model can be applied to the situation in antigen-driven BCR activation ( BL-2/BL-41 ) and the situation, were the BCR pathway is antigen independently activated, driven by gain-of-function mutations in specific signaling molecules of the BCR pathway ( HBL-1/OCI-LY3 ). A recent study that compared primary Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and non-malignant B Cell signaling by modeling a smaller network ( 5 nodes ) using Bayesian inference learning underscores our finding by determining only a modest topology difference between the malignant and non-malignant network [61]. In here we can recapitulate this finding on a larger core network ( 16 nodes, 16 edges ) for aberrant and non-aberrant B-cell receptor driven signaling ( Fig 6 ).

. For each modeling step the model predicts unseen data better or equally well than for the previous step. This is a good indication that the model development did not lead to overfitting. Fig 1D presents the literature-derived starting network adjusted to the structure of the final BCR signaling network model for BL-2 cells with pruned links indicated in grey and novel links indicated in green ( see S2 Fig for model fit vs. data comparison ). Four of the removed links correspond to redundancies in the receptor proximal signaling structure around PI3K where removal resolved this non-identifiability. Other removed links belong to downstream signaling, decoupling JNK and IKK from Btk. Furthermore, RPS6 seems to be only regulated by AKT/mTOR and not ERK. HSP27 was not found to be regulated by p38 activity in BL-2 cells. Importantly, by extending the network, the modeling procedure discovered three novel connections that significantly improved the model fit: ( i ) a positive crosstalk from mTOR to JNK, ( ii ) a positive feedback from GSK3 to ZAP70 and ( iii ) a negative crosstalk from p38 on or above RAF/MEK/ERK. After we have established a semi-quantitative network model of BCR signaling in BL-2 cells, we aimed to assess if the final network describes BCR signaling in a general way. Thus, we performed the same perturbations experiment that was conducted on BL-2 cells on a different BL cell line, BL-41, ( Fig 2A ) and subsequently applied the same modeling strategy ( cf. Fig 1B ) to derive a BL-41 specific signaling network. Starting from the same literature network as in BL-2 cells the network was derived that was best supported by the data. We noted that the reduced chi-square statistics approached the theoretical limit of 1 during network adaptation, indicating accurate model optimization ( Fit, Fig 2B )

. We performed a profile likelihood analysis that unveiled that about half of the non-inhibitor coefficient ( path ) s ( 11 of 21, asterisks Fig 2E ) are significantly different, i. e., the 95% pointwise confidence intervals [47] do not overlap. For example, the coefficient path corresponding to the pathway from Btk via p38 to MEK is estimated to be stronger in BL-41 than in BL-2 cells. Interestingly, this coefficient path corresponds to the cross talk from p38 to RAF/MEK/ERK, and the underlying data shows that the effect is only notable in the presence of α-IgM stimulus but not when p38 inhibitor is applied without stimulation ( Fig 2F ). In summary, the BL-2 model constitutes a generic network structure that can accurately describe signaling for both BL cell lines. This finding is important as it demonstrates the existence of a signaling network core for the activated BCR in BL cells. In addition, three hitherto undescribed links in BCR mediated intracellular signaling in BL cells were unveiled to disentangle upstream wiring including the yet not fully resolved receptor proximal signaling events ( Fig 1C ). These so far undescribed network links include the strong negative crosstalk from p38 to RAF/MEK/ERK, which has been previously described in endothelial cells [48] or EGFR-activated epithelial cells [49]. For BCR activated signaling this feedback however was not yet described. Therefore, we decided to conduct further experiments to characterize the model-predicted p38-mediated dampening of MEK/ERK phosphorylation. Since the model-based findings rely on a single time point ( 30min after α-IgM treatment ), we investigated the temporal dynamics of MEK and ERK phosphorylation in BL-2 cells ( Fig 3A ). An increase in MEK and ERK phosphorylation as early as 2 min after α-Ig stimulation was observed, followed by a peak at 10 min and a decrease at 30 min. In contrast, p38 phosphorylation peaked at 10 min and remained high at 30 min. This indicates that p38 activation precedes ME/ERK phosphorylation and supports the model-predicted negative cros from p38 to ME/ERK.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The ubiquitous Notch receptor signalling network is essential for tissue growth and maintenance. Operationally, receptor activity is regulated by two principal, counterposed mechanisms: intercellular Notch transactivation triggered by interactions between receptors and ligands expressed in neighbouring cells; intracellular cis inhibition mediated by ligands binding to receptors expressed in the same cell. Moreover, different Notch receptor/ligand combinations are known to elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses, and together, these phenomena determine the strength, the duration and the specificity of Notch receptor signalling. To date, it has been assumed that these processes involve discrete ligand homomers and not heteromeric complexes composed of more than one ligand species. In this study, we explore the molecular basis of the opposing actions of the Notch ligands, DLL4 and JAG1, which control angiogenic sprouting. Through a combination of experimental approaches and mathematical modelling, we provide evidence that two mechanisms could underpin this process: 1 ) DLL4 rather than JAG1 induces efficient Notch1 receptor transactivation; 2 ) JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-dependent cis-inhibition of Notch signalling through the formation of a JAG1/DLL4 complex. We propose a new model of Notch signalling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells, which is necessary for sprouting angiogenesis.

   . Both receptors and ligands harbour multiple EGF-like repeats, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions [20], and we here recently shown that homomeric DLL4 ligand complexes could promote cis inhibition of Notch receptor activity [15]. Moreover, the fact that all Notch ligands share a common overall architecture raises the possibility of a potential biological role for heteromeric ligand complex formation, up to now, a mechanism which has not been reported. In this study, we combine experimental approaches and mathematical modelling to explore the molecular control of Notch1 receptor activity by the ligands, DLL4 and JAG1. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked role for heteromeric JAG1/DLL4 complexes, which could enable angiogenic sprouting by regulating the functional differentiation of endothelial cells into leading edge tips cells and trailing stalk cells.

. Whilst, the basic features of Notch receptor transactivation, outlined above, have been delineated in some detail, a number of fundamental issues remain enigmatic. One question relates to the precise nature and significance of cis inhibition and how it counteracts receptor transactivation. Another central question concerns how the manifold potential receptor-ligand combinations will give rise to the different signalling outputs necessary for tissue patterning. In this context, recent work has dissected, at the molecular level, the cellular responses to different ligands, which can stimulate either discrete pulses of Notch activity ( in the case of DLL1 ) or a sustained period of signalling ( in the case of DLL4 ) yielding distinct gene expression outcomes [16, 17]. At the tissue level, a classic example of the divergent roles of different Notch ligands is found during sprouting angiogenesis wherein DLL4 was shown to constrain sprouting opposed by the pro-angiogenic properties of JAG1 [18, 19]. Of significant interest, in this in vivo setting, was the notion that JAG1 functions by antagonizing the activity of DLL4, highlighting the possibility of crosstalk/competition between the ligands, though the specific molecular details have not been elucidated. In this light, other potential facets of Notch signalling merit consideration. For instance, in the absence of available evidence, is has been generally assumed that cis and trans receptor/ligand interactions are essentially monomeric in nature, and involve binding of one species of ligand and a single species of receptor rather than complexes of different receptor types, or different ligand types. There are, however, reasons to suppose that the actual picture may be more complicated

. In the context of our new model, by considering these facets of Notch signalling and endothelial sprouting, we could get not only deeper insights into normal developmental sprouting angiogenesis but also into other physiological processes, such as wound healing [19], and the pathological angiogenesis unique to solid tumours, and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [45, 46]. Indeed, regarding other Notch receptor family members, our evidence that ligand heterodimerization could play a role in Notch signalling has potentially important implications for our understanding of the control of this central signal transduction pathway more generally. For example, heteromeric Notch ligand complex formation might serve to increase the number of possible Notch receptor signalling outputs. Certainly, our reported effects are not limited to Notch1 signalling alone. In comparable assays of receptor transactivation and cis inhibition, JAG1/DLL4 heterodimers similarly controlled both Notch2 and Notch3 signalling activity ( see S9 Fig ). Since all Notch ligands share a common overall architecture, it could be of interest to investigate if other Notch ligands can form heteromeric complexes, and to decipher the possible biological consequences of these interactions. Additional mechanisms could also contribute to the overall regulation of the Notch network including signalling initiated by processing of the ligand intracellular domains [47], and a possible role for Notch receptor oligomerization/dimerization, which would add an additional layer of complexity to the system, though the precise molecular details of this remain elusive [48]. As well as angiogenesis, our results may shed light on our understanding of the patterning of other tissues. A well-characterized, ancient example is dorsal/ventral ( D/V ) boundary formation in Drosophila wing disc development

Since the discovery of the Notch receptor in the second decade of the last century, both pioneering work in in vivo model systems, as well as cell and biochemical analyses, have provided a detailed, albeit incomplete, picture of its essential roles in animal development and the basic molecular underpinnings of its function. In general outline, Notch receptors can interact with their ligands within the same cell or between cells and the net effect of these interactions determines the level of Notch receptor activation. Related to this, a currently unanswered question of central importance is how different Notch receptor and ligand combinations control this process to produce its observed effects. Given the wide range of distinct physiological phenomena which are governed by this relatively simple receptor-ligand network ( see [1–7] ), multiple additional regulatory mechanisms must operate to enable the broad repertoire of possible responses, including biomechanical forces [4, 8], post-translational modifications of both receptors and ligands [7], asymmetric cell divisions and processes which promote and control action-at-a-distance Notch signalling activities [34]. In this study, we have used simple experimental approaches coupled to mathematical modelling to address this question, specifically by considering how the JAG1 and DLL4 ligands differentially control Notch1 receptor activation, a question of fundamental relevance in light of the well-established evidence for the opposing effects of DLL4 and JAG1, which together control angiogenic sprouting [18, 19]. Consistent with previous studies [35–37], our data shows that, by comparison with JAG1, DLL4 has a significantly greater capacity to stimulate trans-activation of Notch1 receptor signalling ( see Fig 1 ). We further show that DLL4, but not JAG1, efficiently mediates Notch1 receptor cis inhibition

To test the relative Notch receptor transactivation potential of the ligands DLL4 and JAG1, we performed quantitative reporter assays. Fig 1A shows that whilst DLL4 ( and JAG2 ) efficiently promoted Notch1 transactivation, JAG1 was unable to elicit detectable Notch1 transactivation. Conversely, Fig 1B shows that JAG1 could induce transactivation of Notch2 and Notch3 suggesting that the transactivation block is specific to Notch1. To elucidate a possible molecular basis of this difference we assessed binding of the ligands to Notch receptors expressed at the cell surface. Fig 1C and 1D show that DLL4, but not JAG1, bound relatively efficiently to Notch1 ( Fig 1C ). In contrast to its lack of binding to Notch1, JAG1 efficiently associated with both Notch2 and Notch3 ( Fig 1D ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that DLL4, can bind to and effectively trigger Notch1 receptor transactivation, whereas JAG1 fails to bind to the Notch1 receptor with sufficiently high affinity to elicit robust receptor transactivation. We next explored the respective roles of DLL4 and JAG1 in Notch1 cis inhibition. Fig 2A shows that DLL4, as expected, potently blocked transactivation of Notch1 when both Notch1 and DLL4 are expressed in the same cell ( cis inhibition; see [13] ). By comparison, JAG1 could not similarly induce strong ( cis ) inhibition of Notch1 signalling ( Fig 2A ), whereas the closely related JAG2 ligand, in common with DLL4, promoted strong cis inhibition of Notch1 activity. We have previously shown that DLL4-dependent cis inhibition of Notch activity requires ligand dimerization/oligomerization ( herein referred to simply as dimerization ) [15]. In this light, we compared DLL4, JAG2 and JAG1 ligand dimerization

The Notch receptor plays a crucial role in the growth and maintenance of tissues. Its activity is regulated by two opposing mechanisms: interactions between neighbouring cells and within the same cell. Different combinations of receptors and ligands elicit distinct responses, determining the strength and specificity of Notch signalling. Researchers have assumed that these processes involve homomeric or heteromeric complexes of ligands. This study explores the molecular basis of Notch ligands DLL and JAG, which control angiogenic sprouting through a combination of experimental and mathematical approaches. The results show that DLL rather than JAG induces Notch receptor activation, and J1 blocks DLL-dependent inhibition of Not signalling through a J1/DLL complex. A new model of Not signalling is proposed that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells necessary for sprouting angiogenesis. The study highlights the overlooked role of hetereric JAG/DLL complexes in regulating the differentiation of endothelial cells into tip and stalk cells. The findings have implications for understanding sprouting in development, wound healing, and pathological angiogenesis in tumours and inflammatory diseases.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Clustering is widely used in bioinformatics and many other fields, with applications from exploratory analysis to prediction. Many types of data have associated uncertainty or measurement error, but this is rarely used to inform the clustering. We present Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty ( DPMUnc ), an extension of a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm which makes use of the uncertainty associated with data points. We show that DPMUnc out-performs existing methods on simulated data. We cluster immune-mediated diseases ( IMD ) using GWAS summary statistics, which have uncertainty linked with the sample size of the study. DPMUnc separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. We additionally consider how DPMUnc can be used to cluster gene expression datasets that have been summarised using gene signatures. We first introduce a novel procedure for generating a summary of a gene signature on a dataset different to the one where it was discovered, which incorporates a measure of the variability in expression across signature genes within each individual. We summarise three public gene expression datasets containing patients with a range of IMD, using three relevant gene signatures. We find association between disease and the clusters returned by DPMUnc, with clustering structure replicated across the datasets. The significance of this work is two-fold. Firstly, we demonstrate that when data has associated uncertainty, this uncertainty should be used to inform clustering and we present a method which does this, DPMUnc. Secondly, we present a procedure for using gene signatures in datasets other than where they were originally defined. We show the value of this procedure by summarising gene expression data from patients with immune-mediated diseases using relevant gene signatures, and clustering these patients using DPMUnc.

   . In this case, cluster variance would describe the variability of location of the latent observations which can be thought to represent the “true” locations of the objects whose location we have observed with some measured uncertainty. A variety of methods have been proposed to deal with uncertainty in observations when clustering, including calculating distance between observations accounting for uncertainty [10], clustering representative objects sampled from the distribution associated with each uncertain observation [11, 12], and adapting the likelihood by integrating over the distribution associated with each uncertain observation [13]. Within clustering approaches generally, the Bayesian methods offer some advantages, in their ability to convey uncertainty about the overall clustering, and particularly to simultaneously infer the number of clusters, K. Here, we propose to adapt a standard model for a Bayesian Dirichlet process mixture model to the setting where the data points have associated uncertainty, “Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty ( DPMUnc ) ”. Such adaptation has not been explored previously, to the best of our knowledge. We show that accounting for uncertainty can alter the clustering solution returned and demonstrate its performance on a range of simulated datasets and real applications. First, we consider clustering IMD using GWAS summary statistics, a problem where the uncertainty associated with each observation generally varies systematically with study sample size. Second, we cluster patients with IMD using gene expression data which can help identify subtypes of disease or predict response to treatment [2]. However, clustering on all ∼20, 000 genes can be computationally expensive, and may group patients by disease-irrelevant structure, such as sex or age

Grouping items by similarity has a variety of applications in bioinformatics. For example, clustering samples according to any molecular measures may help to identify subgroups of disease [1, 2]. In gene expression data, clustering the genes may be useful for inferring gene function using guilt by association and inferring regulatory relationships [3]. Clustering can also be used to cluster diseases themselves. For example, immune-mediated diseases ( IMD ) have been shown to have a shared genetic basis such that IMD can be clustered according to those shared patterns [4, 5]. Commonly used methods, such as k-means [6, 7] and mclust [8], assume that the observations being clustered are observed without error, or that any errors are identically distributed. In reality we often have not just data points themselves but also a measure of uncertainty about each observation which has the potential to improve clustering accuracy if exploited. Examples include data generated by multiple uncertain experts [9], network clustering where edges have an associated score indicating uncertainty, or the cell type annotation problem in single-cell multiomic data, where different omics layers may assign cells to different clusters. In this work, we focus on quantitative data with associated uncertainty, which may arise for example with random measurement error or the use of summary measures such as the average of three blood pressure readings. To be clear, clustering methods already capture one source of uncertainty as the cluster variance, which describes variability in the location of different objects in the same cluster. Here, when we discuss uncertainty, we will focus on uncertainty attached to each observation, which may vary between observations and/or features

. To then use them on a new dataset with more complex structure, such as a dataset with patients with a mix of immune-mediated diseases, typically requires some form of dimension reduction such as WGCNA or PCA used on the new dataset, either using just those genes from the signature [24] or using all genes [26] with the hope that one WGCNA module or variable in PCA will coincide with the signature. Our proposed method of summarising a gene expression across a signature extends the possible uses of signatures, and since the signature may be weaker on a dataset with more complex structure, it may be crucial to take the variability of the signature into account, which DPMUnc allows. In two of the nine examples we examined, ignoring uncertainty led to clusterings which did not associate with disease status. In particular, it allows us to cluster patients simultaneously according to multiple signatures. In the case of the Ferreira dataset, this led to a clearer separation of the two disease and control groups, emphasizing the potential utility of considering multiple signatures, which provide multiple views of the same data.

Taking uncertainty into account can alter clustering solutions. We illustrated with simulated data how the cluster mean inferred by DPMUnc is closer to the points that have lower uncertainty, whereas methods like mclust and k-means place the cluster mean close to the empirical mean of all the points, and also how DPMUnc shifts the latent data points towards the inferred cluster mean, which results in a smaller cluster variance. In a more complicated dataset this could have knock-on consequences, perhaps excluding more distant points from joining the cluster, or splitting one cluster into two. On a range of simulated datasets, DPMUnc out-performed existing methods and the posterior similarity values were shown to be relatively well calibrated, so that if two points have posterior similarity of p, this roughly translates to probability p that they are in the same cluster in the true clustering. We note that because DPMUnc assumes independence between features, its use is likely to be restricted to data that is relatively low dimensional. In the real data examples shown here, we assume there is limited dependence between the genetic features as these were derived using PCA and between the transcriptomic features because there is no overlap of genes between the different signatures. Our clustering of diseases by the engineered GWAS features recapitulated known divisions and relationships in the immune-mediated diseases. It also suggests further uses for clustering with uncertainty, such as clustering individuals using sets of polygenic risk scores, where the uncertainty in the PRS coefficients could be exploited rather than ignored. Gene signatures may be defined on one dataset with ideal experimental conditions, such as a timecourse study of the effect of interferon-β

. 01 ), and focused on disease traits. To avoid near duplicates, we retained only one set of results from UK Biobank ( UKBB ) by excluding the GeneAtlas analysis, and retaining the Neale analyses which had a greater representation of rarer immune traits, leaving us with 45 traits in our final dataset. We ran DPMUnc and DPMZeroUnc with 100 million iterations, saving only every 1000th iteration to avoid autocorrelation and discarding the first half of the iterations as burn-in. The genes representing each signature were identified as follows The selected signature genes are listed in full in S1 Table and were summarised for each sample by two values, the mean and the variance of the normalised expression value, with the summary measures taken across all genes in a signature. We ran DPMUnc and DPMZeroUnc with 20 million iterations, saving only every 500th iteration to avoid autocorrelation and discarding the first half of the iterations as burn-in. Whilst DPMUnc and DPMZeroUnc provide samples from a posterior distribution, it is useful to find a single summary clustering for downstream analyses. We first calculate the posterior similarity matrix ( PSM ). Each entry PSMi, j is the proportion of posterior samples in which observation i and observation j were placed in the same cluster. Secondly, we calculate the clustering of the PSM that optimises the posterior expected adjusted rand index ( PEAR ) with the true clustering ( maxpear [20] ), i. e. the clustering that seems the most compatible with the true clustering. This requires a search strategy to explore the space of possible clusters, and we use all possible clusters found via complete hierarchical clustering, using 1 − PSM as a distance matrix, using the mcclust and mcclust. ext packages in R.

 Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPM) is an extension of a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm that uses uncertainty associated with data points. DPM outperforms existing methods on simulated data and cluster immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS statistics, which have uncertainty linked to sample size. DPM separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. DPM can cluster gene expression datasets summarised using gene signatures. A novel procedure generates a summary of a signature on a dataset different from where it was discovered, incorporating variability in expression across genes within individuals.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Deep neural networks have been remarkably successful as models of the primate visual system. One crucial problem is that they fail to account for the strong shape-dependence of primate vision. Whereas humans base their judgements of category membership to a large extent on shape, deep networks rely much more strongly on other features such as color and texture. While this problem has been widely documented, the underlying reasons remain unclear. We design simple, artificial image datasets in which shape, color, and texture features can be used to predict the image class. By training networks from scratch to classify images with single features and feature combinations, we show that some network architectures are unable to learn to use shape features, whereas others are able to use shape in principle but are biased towards the other features. We show that the bias can be explained by the interactions between the weight updates for many images in mini-batch gradient descent. This suggests that different learning algorithms with sparser, more local weight changes are required to make networks more sensitive to shape and improve their capability to describe human vision.

   . For example, it has already been shown that networks can learn to be robust to certain image degradations when explicitly trained for them [6], similar to how networks can learn shape-based classification on a shape-only dataset. While each of these problems can be solved, for example by designing custom architectures [58, 59] or training on augmented datasets [60, 61], understanding how these differences to human vision arise from the learning dynamics of deep networks may point the way to unified solutions. In summary, we have used simple, artificial images to investigate why deep neural networks trained to classify images develop a bias towards surface features like color and texture, instead of using shape features. While some architectures ( for example vision transformers ) appear to be structurally unable to learn shape features, convolutional neural networks developed this bias even though they were able to learn shape-based classification. Thus, their bias arises from the learning dynamics, not from a problem with their architecture. Furthermore, by using the neural tangent kernel as an analytical tool we identified a mechanism by which the learning dynamics of mini-batch gradient descent can bias a network towards color and texture: there are groups of images for which gradients that increase the sensitivity to these features are aligned, whereas there are no such image groups for shape features. These insights open up new opportunities to improve deep network models of visual processing in the brain.

. This can be used to probe selectivity for shape and texture experimentally. However, none of these techniques is perfect, since each alteration in shape also has an effect on textures and vice versa [21]. One way to solve this issue is to use artificial images, in which shapes and textures are generated parametrically and can therefore be controlled exactly. For example, [19] generated images in which colorful patches formed simple shapes. They compared how well humans and neural networks could learn to distinguish categories that depended on different features such as shape, color of object segments, or color of a single patch. While humans relied strongly on shape, networks preferentially classified images by other features, such as color or average size. Here, we follow a similar approach but focus on the question why deep networks fail to learn shape-based classification. We design artificial image datasets in which simple shape, color, or texture features determine which class an object belongs to. We use these datasets in a series of four experiments to test the two hypotheses. First, by training and testing the networks on different feature combinations, we show that a variety of networks exhibit the same biases towards color and texture as on natural images. Second, we show that some of these networks fail to learn the classification at all when they are trained from scratch on a dataset where shape is the only available feature, indicating that there is an architectural deficiency ( hypothesis 2 ). However, even networks that are able to learn shape-based classification in isolation fail to do so when another feature ( color or texture ) is available, consistent with shortcut learning ( hypothesis 1 ). Third, to understand how this bias against shape arises during learning, we analyze the dynamics and structure of the neural tangent kernel ( NTK ) [26] of networks during training

. g., resembling elephant skin ), networks choose the class of the texture in the vast majority of cases [18]. This phenomenon of texture bias on cue conflict images has received considerable attention in the machine learning literature and several methods have been proposed to mitigate it. These include explicit training on stylized images [18], stronger image augmentations [24], and adding custom network components [25]. However, increasing shape bias on cue conflict images may not automatically lead to human-like shape processing—it is only one out of several relevant metrics [21]. As a case in point, networks trained on stylized images to have a high shape bias seem to remain unable to process global object shape [20, 22]. Although the shape bias of neural networks has been documented extensively, there is not yet a clear explanation for why it arises. However, two candidate hypotheses can be distilled from the literature: However, each of these hypotheses leaves something to be explained. In the case of shortcut learning, the original question—why networks rely on texture rather than shape—is replaced by another question: why is recognizing textures easier to learn for deep networks than recognizing shape? Conversely, if there is a deficiency in current network architectures, what is it? Which component is missing exactly and how would it enable shape processing? These questions are difficult to answer, because shape and texture are ill-defined concepts, at least in natural images. We may know intuitively what the shape of a cat is and we may be able to recognize it in an image, but since we lack a formal definition of the “cat-shapedness” of an image, we cannot test whether a network computes “cat-shapedness”. Several techniques have been used to manipulate shape and texture in natural images, such as stylization [18], use of silhouettes [17], and shape scrambling [17, 22]

. As training progresses, the network is pushed towards color-/texture-selectivity. This explanation illustrates why training on stylized images [18], using appearance-changing image augmentation [24], and avoiding very small random crops [24] can help increase the shape bias of deep networks, but still fails to make them sensitive to global shape features [22]. Essentially, gradient descent learning favours features with occurrence statistics that align well with the image class distribution. Image stylization makes textures less predictive of image class, making it more likely that the network learns other features. Appearance-changing augmentations like color distortions and blurring have a similar effect. In contrast, using larger and more central crops means that it is more likely that training images will contain boundaries of the central object, increasing the prevalence of shape features. However, the underlying learning dynamics are still the same, so the networks will learn features with favourable occurrence statistics. We hypothesise that local shape features ( for example, a specific contour on an object outline ) occur more frequently and are more straightforwardly aligned with image classes than global shape features ( for example, a specific arrangement of several object parts ), biasing the network to local rather than global features. We repeated the NTK-based analysis with spcConvNet ( Experiment 4 ), the only network architecture that learned to classify images by shape as well as color/texture in Experiment 1. We observed a lower alignment between the trained NTK and reference NTKs, which can be explained by the observation that spatial competition makes the gradients ( and in turn the NTK ) more sparse. This increased sparsity also reduced the prevalence of clusters of images of the same class with very similar gradients in the color- and texture-selective NTKs

. What do these results mean for deep neural networks as models of the brain in general and for shape-selective visual processing in particular? Deep learning models describe the brain not in terms of detailed, low-level interactions, but in terms of architectures, loss functions, and learning algorithms [3, 5]. The failure of deep networks to account for human-like shape processing raises the question which of these aspects need to be corrected: do we need a better architecture, a different loss function, or a new learning algorithm? Our results suggest that the choice of architecture is important, but that the more crucial limiting factor for current convolutional networks is the learning algorithm. An example for the importance of architecture is the contrast between vision transformers, which were unable to learn shape-based classification from scratch in our experiments, and convolutional networks, which generally succeeded to learn shape-based classification in experiment 2. However, among the convolutional networks we tested the role of architecture was less clear. In the context of shape processing, one architectural component that is often discussed is lateral recurrent connectivity [20–22]. In our experiments, recurrent connectivity did not have a major effect on shape sensitivity—the recurrent rConvNet essentially behaved like the feedforward ConvNet. This is in line with other work that found no effect [22] or at best a small advantage [21] of recurrent architectures for shape processing. There may be other compelling reasons to add recurrent connections [43, 44] and models of visual function will eventually have to account for the recurrent connectivity in cortex [5]. But our results suggest that recurrence alone does not solve the underlying problem that prevents deep networks from learning shape. We also experimented with a second biologically inspired modification to the network architecture: spatial competition

    Title: 
    Abstract: Hepatic stellate cells ( HSC ) are the source of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) whose overproduction leads to fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver functions in chronic liver diseases. Understanding the dynamics of HSCs will provide insights needed to develop new therapeutic approaches. Few models of hepatic fibrosis have been proposed, and none of them include the heterogeneity of HSC phenotypes recently highlighted by single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Here, we developed rule-based models to study HSC dynamics during fibrosis progression and reversion. We used the Kappa graph rewriting language, for which we used tokens and counters to overcome temporal explosion. HSCs are modeled as agents that present seven physiological cellular states and that interact with ( TGFβ1 ) molecules which regulate HSC activation and the secretion of type I collagen, the main component of the ECM. Simulation studies revealed the critical role of the HSC inactivation process during fibrosis progression and reversion. While inactivation allows elimination of activated HSCs during reversion steps, reactivation loops of inactivated HSCs ( iHSCs ) are required to sustain fibrosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated the model’s sensitivity to ( TGFβ1 ) parameters, suggesting its adaptability to a variety of pathophysiological conditions for which levels of ( TGFβ1 ) production associated with the inflammatory response differ. Using new experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, we validated the predicted ECM dynamics. Our model also predicts the accumulation of iHSCs during chronic liver disease. By analyzing RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) associated with liver fibrosis, we confirmed this accumulation, identifying iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression. Overall, our study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease that can be used to explore the regulatory role of iHSCs in liver homeostasis. Moreover, our model can also be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues.

   . The present study aims to decipher HSC dynamics by developing multiscale models which integrate for the first time all the HSC states during the development of fibrosis and its reversion. The multi-state combinatorial nature of the cells studied led us to choose a rule-based model ( RBM ) approach, much more appropriate for dealing with this type of network. Among these formalisms, we selected the Kappa language [20–22]. Using the Kappa language, our model describes the interactions between all cell populations and molecules such as transforming growth factor β 1 ( TGFβ1 ) which induces HSC activation and promotes secretion of type I collagen, the major component of ECM [23]. We validated the predicted ECM dynamics using new experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4 induced liver fibrosis. Importantly, simulation studies demonstrated the regulatory role of HSC inactivation loops during liver fibrosis and predicted the accumulation of inactivated HSCs during chronic liver disease. By analyzing RNA sequencing data from 102 patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) associated with liver fibrosis, we confirmed this accumulation, identifying iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression.

The present study provides two major findings. First we have demonstrated the applicability of the Kappa language to multi-scale approaches by using: tokens, to represent the quantities of molecules in a compact way, and counters to abstract the dynamics of cell-specific phenotypes. Second, we developed the first model of HSC dynamics during liver fibrosis and reversion. Thus, our model provides biological predictions for the reactivation loop, the dynamics of inactivated cells and their accumulation during fibrosis progression. These predictions have been validated either experimentally in a mouse model of CCl4-induced fibrosis, or using RNA sequencing data from patients with fibrosis.

Liver fibrosis is an excessive wound healing response induced by chronic injuries, mainly caused by viral hepatitis ( HCV, HBV ), alcohol abuse and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ). Fibrosis is characterized by an accumulation of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) which increases the stiffness of tissues, leading to severe liver dysfunction. The final stage of fibrosis, cirrhosis, leads to complications such as ascites, variceal hemorrhage, encephalopathy and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is associated with a high mortality rate worldwide [1]. Activation of hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) is the main process underlying hepatic fibrosis [2]. In a normal liver, HSCs are quiescent, store vitamin A and are located in the Disse space between hepatocytes and endothelial cells that delineate sinusoids. Upon liver injury, HSCs are activated and transdifferentiate into ECM-secreting myofibroblasts ( MFB ) that contribute to tissue repair. In chronic liver disease, the inflammatory signal persists, leading to sustained HSC activation, ECM accumulation and fibrosis [2–4]. Importantly, reversibility or regression of liver fibrosis after elimination of the inflammatory agent has been observed in experimental models and clinical studies [5, 6]. This phenomenon is associated with the elimination of myofibroblasts, involving processes of apoptosis, senescence and inactivation, but the contribution of each of these mechanisms to the repair/fibrosis balance remains unclear. Understanding the behavior of HSCs during liver injuries requires multiscale modeling approaches. Such approaches have been widely developed for modeling biological processes [7] and diseases [8, 9]. Because fibrosis is a pathological tissue repair activity that occurs in different organs, unified approaches have been proposed by including common components such as the inflammatory response and extracellular matrix remodeling [10]

We integrated information based on literature, to describe HSC dynamics during liver fibrosis and its reversion however the lack of some information led us to propose hypotheses and finally to develop three different families of models. As shown in Fig 1A, the three families share common processes involving the different states of HSCs regulated by TGFβ1. In normal liver, HSCs are maintained in a non-proliferative quiescent state ( qHSC ) and store vitamin A. Upon liver injury ( virus, toxic, etc. ), the inflammatory response leads to the production of TGFβ1 which activates qHSCs into an activated state ( aHSC ). The fully activated HSCs are characterized by a myofibroblast ( MFB ) phenotype. Upon removal of liver injury, i. e in the absence of TGFβ1 in the models, MFBs are either eliminated through apoptosis and senescence pathways ( apop_sene_MFB ) or reverted to an inactivated HSC state ( iHSC ) close to but different from the quiescent state. Upon a new liver injury, i. e in the presence of TGFβ1 in the models, the iHSCs are reactivated ( react_HSCs ). In the same way that HSCs transform into MFBs, react_HSCs transform into reactivated MFBs ( react_MFBs ) however information is lacking about the fate of these cells. To overcome this issue, we developed two families of models in which the react_MFBs are either i ) completely eliminated by the apoptosis/senescence pathways but not by inactivation, this family of models called reactMFB-wo-inactivation ( wo for without ) is described in Fig 1A1 ), or ii ) eliminated in the same way as MFBs, i. e. by the apoptosis/senescence pathways and/or the inactivation pathway, this family of models called reactMFB-with-inactivation is described in Fig 1A2 ). Similarly to react_MFB, information is lacking about the fate of iHSCs

. We also validated the prediction of COL1 dynamics using experimental data from other laboratories, including liver fibrosis models induced by dimethyl_nitrosamine [36] and thioacetamide [37]. Results are presented in ( S2A and S2B Fig ). A major observation by Kisseleva et al. [24] is that the fibrotic response is exacerbated in mice that have undergone an initial chronic aggression followed by a reversion period allowing a return to a healthy tissue phenotype. This was associated with the presence of inactivated stellate cells ( iHSCs ) which display an enhanced response to TGFβ1 when stimulated in cell culture, leading to faster and greater production of COL1 [24, 25, 38]. These iHSCs would therefore still be present in the “repaired” liver after six months of reversion. To take this into account, we calibrated our models reactMFB-with-inactivation on Kisseleva’s observations et al. [24] after the second aggression by introducing the hypothesis of a slow elimination of iHSCs. However, there is no experimental data describing the fate of these cells during aggression/reversion cycles. Using the relapse protocol described by Kisseleva et al. [24], we studied the behavior of iHSCs throughout injury-repair cycles. This protocol includes chronic injuries induced by eight CCl4 injections over one month, followed by a six-month recovery period, and then a new injury similar to the first. We repeated this cycle three times ( Fig 5 ). Our simulations show that the dynamics of α-SMA expressing cells and amounts of COL1 are consistent with Kleva’s et al [24] observations. We also predicted the accumulation of iSC during chronic liver disease and validated using RNA sequencing data from patients with NASH associated fibrosis.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Meta-analysis is used to aggregate the effects of interest across multiple studies, while its methodology is largely underexplored in mediation analysis, particularly in estimating the total mediation effect of high-dimensional omics mediators. Large-scale genomic consortia, such as the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ( TOPMed ) program, comprise multiple cohorts with diverse technologies to elucidate the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms underlying complex human traits and diseases. Leveraging the recent established asymptotic standard error of the R-squared ( R2 ) -based mediation effect estimation for high-dimensional omics mediators, we have developed a novel meta-analysis framework requiring only summary statistics and allowing inter-study heterogeneity. Whereas the proposed meta-analysis can uniquely evaluate and account for potential effect heterogeneity across studies due to, for example, varying genomic profiling platforms, our extensive simulations showed that the developed method was more computationally efficient and yielded satisfactory operating characteristics comparable to analysis of the pooled individual-level data when there was no inter-study heterogeneity. We applied the developed method to 5 TOPMed studies with over 5800 participants to estimate the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and sex-related variation in high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol. The proposed method is available in R package MetaR2M on GitHub.

   . Our findings closely align with results derived from the original individual-level data with much less computational cost, highlighting the efficiency of our method in handling the computational burden caused by large-scale studies. This is particularly applicable to mediation analysis in large-scale biobanks, such as the UK Biobank of over a half million participants with diverse ethnicity and multi-omics profiling based on different platforms. Meta-analysis can be an appealing alternative to analysis of the entire dataset at once in terms of computational feasibility [21] and evaluating potential heterogeneity across risk factors for common diseases and genomic profiling technologies, as demonstrated in our application to the FHS and MESA cohorts. The R M e d 2 measure can not only characterize the overall mediation effect, but is also applicable to individual significant mediators. As defined in [72], the R M e d 2 measure for a single mediator Mj, j = 1, …, p is: R M e d, j 2 = R Y X 2 + R Y M j 2 - R Y M j X 2, where R Y M j 2 and R Y M j X 2 are from linear regression models Y ∼ Mj and Y ∼ Mj + X, respectively. However, in the case of multiple mediators, the remaining selected mediators M ( −j ) ’s are also associated with X and Y, and possibly with Mj. Therefore, M ( −j ) ’s are exposure-outcome confounders and possibly exposure-mediator and mediator-outcome confounders [38]. To adjust for covariates and confounders, we have proposed modifying the R M e d 2 measure based on the partial R2 ( [13] [14] ) : R M e d, j | Z 2 = R Y X | Z 2 + R Y M j | Z 2 - R Y M j X | Z 2, where Z is the set of measured covariates and confounders including M ( −j ) ’s. Conceptually, the modified R M e d, j | Z 2 measures the mediating effect of Mj conditional on Z. As a proof of concept, we have applied the R M e d 2 and product measures to a single gene ( ABCG1 ) that was selected in 4 out of the 5 cohorts ( Fig B and Fig C, Table F in S1 Text )

. g., lipids ) within the TOPMed consortium develops a common analysis plan and analysts from each participating cohort executes the analysis plan and shares the summary data for meta-analysis ( [21] ). To address this unmet need in the emergence of large-scale genomic profiling, we introduce a novel meta-analysis framework, allowing for both fixed-effects and random-effects, to estimate the total mediation effect in high-dimensional settings. This framework requires only summary statistics and allows between-study heterogeneity arising from factors such as differences in high-throughput technologies ( microarray vs. RNA-sequencing ) and diverse ethnicity. Our extensive simulations show that the efficiency and coverage probability when using summary statistics are comparable to those achieved with the individual-level data in meta-analysis. Applying this innovative framework, we conducted a meta-analysis across various cohorts from the TOPMed Framingham Heart Study ( FHS ) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) to estimate the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure ( BP ) and sex-related variation in high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol. The proposed meta-analysis framework is implemented in the R package MetaR2M available on GitHub and to be submitted to R/CRAN.

Large-scale genomic consortia and biobanks have facilitated genetic and genomic research by providing data and tools to probe into complex human diseases and traits with unparalleled depth and applicability [1–3]. For instance, in our motivating example, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s ( NHLBI ) Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ( TOPMed ) project brings together over 85 cohorts consisting of more than 180, 000 participants using various high-throughput profiling technologies to elucidate the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms underlying complex human traits [4]. Advances in technology and data sharing have made individual participant data more accessible [5, 6]. However, the acquisition and analysis of such individual-level data is time-consuming, financially demanding, and limited by privacy concerns. High-dimensional mediation analysis is a crucial analytical approach focused on evaluating the mediating role of molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression, in the relationship between environmental exposure/risk factor and health outcomes [7–12]. A variance-based R-squared measure, denoted as R M e d 2, was proposed to estimate the total mediation effect in the high-dimensional setting [13, 14]. A recently developed two-stage cross-fitted interval estimation procedure for R M e d 2 enables the implementation of meta-analysis in mediation analysis due to its availability of asymptotic standard error and computational efficiency [15], as to be pursued here. Meta-analysis is a powerful tool for synthesizing the effects of interest across multiple similar individual studies [16, 17]. Established meta-analysis techniques use summary statistics to resolve the difficulties in accessing individual-level data [18–22]. Fixed-effects meta-analysis stands out as the most widely-used and robust method for combining findings from multiple genetic studies [23]

. The use of PCs is common in genome-wide association studies, where they play a key role in correcting for subtle population stratification and controlling for confounding genetic backgrounds [64]. We have recently shown that adjusting for the top PCs as covariates in high-dimensional mediation analysis can effectively reduce the conditional correlations among the mediators given X, and, thus, mitigate unmeasured confounding effects ( [15] ). For the MESA cohort, we additionally adjusted for race/ethnicity, whereas for the FHS cohorts, all subjects are White. This highlights the advantage of our proposed meta-analysis approach in addressing heterogeneity in covariates across different cohorts. When a variable, either age or sex, was considered the exposure of interest, the other was incorporated as a covariate in the model by regressing out the covariate and working on the residuals subsequently [15]. In the FHS Offspring and Third-Generation cohorts, expression profiling for 17, 873 genes/transcripts was conducted using the Affymetrix Human Exon 1. 0 ST GeneChip, derived from whole blood mRNA [65]. On the other hand, as part of the TOPMed program, RNA-seq was performed on whole blood in these FHS cohorts using the Illumina NovaSeq system profiling expression of over 40, 000 transcripts [66]. In the meta analysis, we only included non-overlapping participants between the microarray and RNA-seq platforms. As the sample size n in each cohort ranged from ∼700 to less than 2, 000 and the number of transcript p ranged from ∼17, 000 to ∼47, 000, we found that the default maximum number of variables selected by iSIS ( i. e., n/ log ( n ) [40] ) as implemented in R package SIS could be too small. Instead, we used max ( n/ log ( n ), 0. 02*p ) as the maximum number of variables selected by iSIS in simulations and real data applications

. As shown in Fig B and Fig C in S1 Text, there was zero selected gene ( mediator ) that was common to all 5 cohorts in either age-SBP or sex-HDL application, highlighting the heterogeneity in high-dimensional mediator selection and challenges in single-gene-based meta-analysis of mediation effects ( Table F in S1 Text ). On the other hand, as shown in our real data applications ( Fig 3 ), the total mediation effects captured by the R M e d 2 measure were more consistent across cohorts despite different sets of genes were selected in each cohort, highlighting the consistent biological mechanisms revealed at the transcriptomic and biological pathway levels, but not necessarily at the individual gene level. There are some similarities between our proposed R M e d 2-based mediation analysis and estimating chip-heritability in genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) [27, 28], where the heritability is the proportion of phenotypic variation explained by genetic factors. However, in mediation analysis, heritability is the proportion of the effect explained by the mediator, not the phenotypic variation [29]. The M d 2 measure can be used to evaluate the proportion of the effect of the mediator on the exposure-outcome relationship, not the proportion of the phenotypic variation explained by the mediator [30]. The M d 2 measure can also be used to evaluate the proportion of the effect of the mediator on the exposure-outcome relationship, not the proportion of phenotyp variation explained by the mediator [30]. The M d 2 measure can be used to evaluate the proportion of the effect of the mediator on the exposure-outcome, not the proportion of phenotyp variation by the mediator [30 ] The M d 2 measure can be used to evaluate the proportion of the effect the mediator on the exposure-outcome, the proportion of phenotyp variation by the mediator [30 ] The d 2 measure can be used to evaluate the proportion of the mediator the exposure-outcome, the proportion phenotyp variation the mediator [30 ] The d 2 measure can be used to evaluate the proportion the mediator exposure-outcome the proportion phen variation the mediator [30 ] The 2 measure can be used to evaluate the proportion the exposure-outcome the phen variation the mediator [30 The 2 can be used to evaluate the proportion-out the phen variation the mediator [ The 2 can be used to evaluate the phen the variation the [ The 2 can be to evaluate the the [ The 2 be to the [ The 2 to [ The 2 [ The 2 [ 2 [2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

    Title: 
    Abstract: Cancer development is driven by an accumulation of a small number of driver genetic mutations that confer the selective growth advantage to the cell, while most passenger mutations do not contribute to tumor progression. The identification of these driver genes responsible for tumorigenesis is a crucial step in designing effective cancer treatments. Although many computational methods have been developed with this purpose, the majority of existing methods solely provided a single driver gene list for the entire cohort of patients, ignoring the high heterogeneity of driver events across patients. It remains challenging to identify the personalized driver genes. Here, we propose a novel method ( PDRWH ), which aims to prioritize the mutated genes of a single patient based on their impact on the abnormal expression of downstream genes across a group of patients who share the co-mutation genes and similar gene expression profiles. The wide experimental results on 16 cancer datasets from TCGA showed that PDRWH excels in identifying known general driver genes and tumor-specific drivers. In the comparative testing across five cancer types, PDRWH outperformed existing individual-level methods as well as cohort-level methods. Our results also demonstrated that PDRWH could identify both common and rare drivers. The personalized driver profiles could improve tumor stratification, providing new insights into understanding tumor heterogeneity and taking a further step toward personalized treatment. We also validated one of our predicted novel personalized driver genes on tumor cell proliferation by vitro cell-based assays, the promoting effect of the high expression of Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 ( LRP1 ) on tumor cell proliferation.

    The PDRWH method is a novel integrated genome/transcriptome analysis approach designed to identify candidate personalized driver genes by leveraging the influence of mutated genes on biological networks across cohort samples. We hypothesize that samples with the same cancer types of cancer display higher similarity in molecular characteristics and disease mechanisms compared to samples with different types of cancer. Leveraging samples from the same cancer type, specifically those closely resembling the target sample, has the potential to improve the personalized driver genes prediction. A schematic overview of PDRWH is illustrated in Fig 1. PDRWH requires knowledge of cohort samples from a specific cancer type in TCGA, including the somatic mutation and the gene expression profiles, as well as a gene interaction network ( Fig 1A ). To ensure uniform baseline values and ranges for all genes across the cohort samples, gene expression data is normalized. Subsequently, a screening process is conducted to identify abnormally expressed genes for each sample ( Fig 1B ). PDRWH consists of three main steps. The first step involves constructing a personalized hypergraph model, where samples are represented as hyperedges, and the mutated genes as well as the abnormally expressed genes in the target sample are described as vertices ( Fig 1C ). In this model, a hyperedge in the hypergraph is capable of connecting multiple vertices ( not limited to two nodes as in a simple graph ), enabling a more complex representation of relationships between genes and facilitating a comprehensive analysis of association across the cohort samples. As depicted in S1 Fig, each hypergraph typically consists of more than 50 hyperedges ( samples ), indicating that PDRWH generates a relatively dense personalized hypergraph for most individuals

. To further support the efficiency of PDRWH by statistical significance, the enrichment p-values of predicted genes in the tumor-specific driver gene lists were evaluated using the hypergeometric test, representing the significance of tumor-specific driver genes rediscovered by PDRWH. The computational details are provided in the Methods and Materials section. From the result of S5 Fig, we can observe that PDRWH shows some variability in performance across 16 cancer types. With the exceptions of LUSC and SKCM, as many as three-quarters of the samples from each cancer type demonstrate enrichment in the tumor-specific driver gene list. For comparison, we used a naive method that randomly selected mutated genes as predicted personalized drivers as a baseline. From Fig 4A, we can find that the five personalized driver prediction methods show higher percentages of significant samples for identifying the cancer-specific driver genes than randomly chosen. In comparison to other methods, PDRWH consistently outperforms. For instance, in the case of BRCA, our method achieves significant enrichment in BRCA-specific cancer drivers for 85. 19% of the samples. Similarly, for KIRC, LIHC, GBM, and STAD, the percentages are 77. 41%, 74. 16%, 78. 67%, and 84. 86% respectively. These results indicate that a considerable number of samples support the reliable outcomes produced by PDRWH, highlighting its effectiveness in predicting tumor-specific driver genes for individuals. Assuming that the data of a particular cancer type from TCGA is sufficiently representative of the majority of samples for that cancer, the known tumor-specific driver genes should be detected in the corresponding cancer samples. For each cancer type, we collected the predicted personalized driver genes of all tumor samples and compared PDRWH with four other methods based on their overlap with the known tumor-specific cancer drivers

. As a result, it overlooks regulation information that is specific to individual patients, which could potentially lead to false positives in the results. Moreover, PDRWH focuses on prioritizing single genes, while it is well-established that genes often collaborate to drive cancer initiation and progression. Therefore, there is a clear need for computation methods to elucidate how these genetic aberrations collaborate to induce transcriptional abnormalities, and ultimately lead to the onset of cancer. Additionally, our current model primarily focuses on point mutations, including single-nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) and short insertions or deletions ( indels ), due to their prevalence, ease of detection, and potential as genetic markers for specific phenotypes that promote tumor formation. However, the impact of other somatic alterations like amplifications, genomic rearrangements, and epigenetic silencing, which are also crucial in tumorigenesis, has not been considered. Integrating information on all these alterations would improve the identification of driver genes in cancer. Despite these limitations, PDRWH has demonstrated reliable performance in inferring personalized driver genes, which is promising for discovering potential causal genetic variants that would be obscured by tumor heterogeneity. In the future, we expect that PDRWH will assist in the development of optimal personalized treatment.

. Unlike methods that rely on data from a specific sample, PDRWH integrates data from a cohort to generate personalized driver gene predictions, enabling a more comprehensive analysis of the collective information across multiple samples. Under the assumption that the impact of a potential driver gene can be determined by its effect on the genes regulated by it, PDRWH ranks potential driver genes based on the influence of mutated genes on transcriptional networks across the cohort of samples. To achieve this, a hypergraph model is proposed to effectively represent high-order relationships among genes. It captures the implicit intrinsic regulatory associations among genes within each sample by connecting a large number of mutated genes and aberrantly expressed genes in the corresponding hyperedge. Additionally, this model accurately characterizes the coexistence of mutated genes and aberrantly expressed genes across diverse samples. PDRWH quantifies the impact of each mutated gene across the group of samples by performing a generalized random walks algorithm on the personalized hypergraph. Evaluated across datasets from 16 cancer types in TCGA and benchmarked against existing driver gene prediction methods using five cancer type datasets, PDRWH consistently demonstrates superior performance in identifying both known general driver genes and tumor-specific driver genes. Notably, PDRWH excels at simultaneously identifying both common and rare driver genes. The predicted personalized driver gene profiles can not only improve tumor stratification but also provide oncologists with a reliable candidate gene list to assist in treatment decisions. To validate the effectiveness of PDRWH, we experimentally verified a predicted personalized driver gene LRP1 through in vitro cell assays.

. Among the three cohort data analysis methods ( PDRWH, PersonaDrive, and Frequency ), PDRWH exhibits superior performance, achieving an outstanding precision rate of up to 88. 4% and 76. 0% for genes ranked first in BRCA and KIRC. Although PDRWH’s precision for the top-ranked gene in KIRC is slightly lower than PersonaDrive, its superiority becomes more noticeable as the ranking advances, particularly in terms of recall and F1-score. Therefore, PDRWH excels in providing a more precise and rational prioritization of known general driver genes for individual patients. For each cancer type, we aggregated the personalized candidate driver gene rankings to create a prioritization for the cohort. This allowed us to compare the results of personalized prediction methods with those of cohort-level methods. Using the general reference driver gene list as a benchmark, we generated receiver operating characteristic curves ( ROC ) and calculated areas under the curve ( AUC ). In Figs 3 and S4, it is clear that PDRWH outperforms other tools in terms of sensitivity and specificity in identifying known driver genes in BRCA, KIRC, GBM, and STAD. Additionally, the AUC values of PDRWH are consistently at the highest level for BRCA, LIHC, and GBM, while ranked second compared to other tools in KIRC and STAD. Considering the diversity among cancer types, tumor-specific drivers hold more concern than the general drivers across different tumor types. Therefore, it is highly valuable to assess the ability of methods to accurately identify cancer-specific driver genes. To achieve this, we downloaded a set of tumor-specific driver genes from the IntOGen database as benchmarks

A novel method, PWH, was developed to identify personalized driver genes in cancer based on the impact of mutated genes on expression across a cohort of samples. PWH uses a hypergraph model to represent samples and genes, where mutated and abnormally expressed genes are vertices, and hyperedges connect multiple vertices. The method was evaluated on 16 cancer datasets from TCG and compared to existing methods. PWH outperformed individual and cohort methods in identifying known and tumor-specific drivers. It also identified both common and rare drivers. Personalized profiles improved tumor stratification and provided insights into heterogeneity. One predicted gene, LRP1, was validated in vitro assays, promoting cell proliferation. PWH integrates somatic mutation and expression data and gene networks to identify candidate drivers. It hypothesizes samples with same cancer type have similar molecular characteristics. Leveraging samples from same type improves driver prediction. The method consists of three steps: normalizing gene expression, identifying abnormally expressed genes, and constructing hypergraph. The hypergraph represents complex relationships between genes and facilitates analysis across samples. PWH generates dense hypergraph for individuals. Statistical enrichment of predicted genes was evaluated using hypergeometric test. PWH showed variability across cancer types, but most samples demonstrated enrichment in tumor-specific genes. Compared to random selection, PWH outperformed in identifying cancer drivers. For each type, predicted genes were compared to known drivers, and PWH outperformed other methods. The method focuses on point mutations, but other alterations like amplifications, rearrangements, and epigenetic silencing are crucial in tumorigenesis. Integrating these would improve driver identification. PWH demonstrated reliable performance, promising for discovering obscured drivers by heterogeneity. It assists personalized treatment development. Unlike sample-based methods, PWH integrates cohort data to generate predictions, enabling comprehensive analysis. The hyper model represents high-order relationships and captures implicit associations among genes. It characterizes coexistence of mutated and aberrant genes across samples. PWH quantifies impact by generalized walks on hyper. Evaluated in 16 cancer types and benchmarked against existing methods, PWH demonstrated superior in identifying general and tumor drivers. Notably, it identifies both common and rare drivers. Predicted profiles improve stratification and provide oncologists with candidates for treatment.
The Virtual Epileptic (VEP) is a computer-based model that combines anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities to generate spatio-temporal seizure patterns resembling those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG, allowing for evaluation of clinical hypotheses before surgery. This study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach, the SaSS, a metaheuristic algorithm capable of parallel computation to yield high-quality solutions without excessive time. Through benchmarking on synthetic data, the proposal successfully solved different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating scalability and performance against parallel solvers. Results were enhanced using Bayesian framework for hyperparameter tuning, with gains in accuracy and cost. Additionally, a scalable quantification phase was added to assess variability in estimated parameters across problems. This study has potential to improve estimation of brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, inform clinical decision-making. VEP integrates mathematical modeling of neural activity with patient-specific anatomical data to predict brain involved in seizure generation and propagation, capturing diverse dynamics and simulations resembling intracran EEG, offering a platform to optimize strategy and aid decision-making. The model relies on estimating parameters in high-dimensional space to identify network EZ/P in brain, challenging due to sparsity, stochasticity, scalability, and non-linearity in spatiemporal organization and uncertainty. Several studies have demonstrated advancements in accurate estimation of V parameters to inform decision and optimize strategies, driving the use of parallel search techniques to eliminate strong assumptions.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Tuberculosis ( TB ), the disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), remains a major health problem with 10. 6 million cases of the disease and 1. 6 million deaths in 2021. It is well understood that pulmonary TB is due to Mtb growth in the lung but quantitative estimates of rates of Mtb replication and death in lungs of patients or animals such as monkeys or rabbits remain largely unknown. We performed experiments with rabbits infected with a novel, virulent clinical Mtb isolate of the Beijing lineage, HN878, carrying an unstable plasmid pBP10. In our in vitro experiments we found that pBP10 is more stable in HN878 strain than in a more commonly used laboratory-adapted Mtb strain H37Rv ( the segregation coefficient being s = 0. 10 in HN878 vs. s = 0. 18 in H37Rv ). Interestingly, the kinetics of plasmid-bearing bacteria in lungs of Mtb-infected rabbits did not follow an expected monotonic decline; the percent of plasmid-bearing cells increased between 28 and 56 days post-infection and remained stable between 84 and 112 days post-infection despite a large increase in bacterial numbers in the lung at late time points. Mathematical modeling suggested that such a non-monotonic change in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells can be explained if the lung Mtb population consists of several ( at least 2 ) sub-populations with different replication/death kinetics: one major population expanding early and being controlled/eliminated, while another, a smaller population expanding at later times causing a counterintuitive increase in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells. Importantly, a model with one kinetically homogeneous Mtb population could not explain the data including when the model was run stochastically. Given that in rabbits HN878 strain forms well circumscribed granulomas, our results suggest independent bacterial dynamics in subsets of such granulomas. Our model predictions can be tested in future experiments in which HN878-pBP10 dynamics in individual granulomas is followed over time. Taken together, our new data and mathematical modeling-based analyses illustrate differences in Mtb dynamics in mice and rabbits confirming a perhaps somewhat obvious observation that “rabbits are not mice”.

   . In following analyses we used the average estimate s = 0. 10 for HN878-pBP10. To study the dynamics of HN878-pPB10 in vivo, we infected rabbits with aerosolized bacteria ( ∼ 500 CFU ) and measured the number of all bacteria or of plasmid-bearing cells in the lungs at different time points after the infection ( Fig 3A ). Importantly, we found similar numbers of bacteria in the left and right lungs even though there was a tendency of observing higher CFU numbers in the right lung ( S2 Fig ) ; this is similar to our recent observation in B6 mice [25]. In parallel, we also infected rabbits with original strain HN878 ( not carrying the plasmid ) ; we found similar CFU numbers in the lung with two Mtb strains suggesting that the plasmid pBP10 did not impact replication ability of the NH878 strain ( S3 Fig ). Mtb dynamics in the lungs of rabbits was not monotonic ( Fig 3B ) ; there was a large increase in the total number of bacteria from about 500 to nearly 108 in the first 28 days, then the number of bacteria declined for the next 56 days ( until 84 days ), and then the number of bacteria exploded to about 1010 CFU/lungs in one rabbit or was maintained at 107 CFU/lungs in another rabbit ( Fig 3B ). Interestingly, changes in the total number of plasmid-bearing bacteria followed that of total bacteria with initial increase, decline, and again increase in the last 28 days of infection. Change in percent of plasmid-bearing cells was also non-monotonic with decline between days 0 and 28 and days 56 and 84 but with an increase between 28 and 56 days and stable levels between days 84 and 112 ( Fig 3C ) ; the latter stable frequency of plasmid-bearing cells was contrasted with the increase in the total number of bacteria in the last 28 days of the experiment ( Fig 3B )

Tuberculosis ( TB ), a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), remains a global health threat. In 2021, 1. 6 million people died due to TB despite available effective chemotherapy [1]. The infection with Mtb results in heterogeneity of disease outcomes such as bacterial clearance, bacterial persistence, and active disease with and without lung cavitation [2–4]. Several studies suggested that between quarter to a third of the world’s population has evidence of Mtb infection [5]. While most are not at risk to develop active disease, individuals who do progress to TB seem to do so within 1–2 years after exposure [6, 7]. Studying TB progression in humans is difficult as most exposed individuals do not develop the disease, and thus, it requires dedicated long-term cohort studies ( e. g., [6, 8] ). Most of what we know about within-host Mtb dynamics early after infection comes from animal studies [9–12]. Yet, despite decades of research, the pathophysiology of TB and the replication dynamics of Mtb during acute and chronic stages of infection remains poorly understood. Earlier studies reported that Mtb can persist in non-replicating status in tissues especially under hypoxic conditions, which may help it resist antibiotic-mediated killing [13]. Studies in B6 mice, infected via aerosol with a conventional dose of Mtb ( about 100 colony-forming units, CFU ), have shown that bacterial numbers in the lung increase during acute phase of infection but become almost static during the chronic phase of infection [14–17]. This condition was defined as “static equilibrium”, where the bacteria remain viable but do not divide [14]. Another study reported that there is no marked difference in the number of CFU and the number of chromosomal equivalents ( CEQs ) supporting the hypothesis of non-replicative persistence of Mtb during chronic phase of infection [18]

. Treating Mtb-infected rabbits with antibacterial drugs revealed differential response of different lung granulomas to the drugs suggesting heterogeneity in Mtb replication in rabbits [46]. By using the RS ratio metric Walter et al. [47] elegantly showed differences in Mtb replication rates in different lung areas of C3HeB/FeJ mice that form well-circumscribed necrotic/caseating granulomas [48, 49]. Here we extend these studies by showing that even when measuring Mtb numbers in the whole lung of rabbits, along with the percent of bacterial cells carrying plasmid pPB10, we can detect and to a degree quantify heterogeneity in rates of Mtb replication and death in vivo. Our results thus may further help explain the differential response of Mtb-infected rabbits to drug treatment and may help design better treatment strategies depending on the distribution of granulomas with slow or rapidly replicating bacteria. Our work has several limitations. Estimated segregation coefficient s of the plasmid pBP10 in HN878 strain differed slightly between two culturing conditions and the plasmid loss kinetics was changing over time ( Fig 2 ). This could be due to the inherent nutritional composition of the growth media used ( i. e, full-strength versus diluted 7H9 media ). Additional experiments to measure the instability of this plasmid in more diverse growth conditions in vitro would be useful. We have used a relatively large inoculum of Mtb ( ∼ 500 CFU/rabbit ) that may be in contrast with murine studies using smaller infectious doses ( e. g., [25] ). For Mtb infection studies such as in our lab, 6–8 weeks old mice have been commonly used. Considering the lung of mice with about 150 mg in weight and ∼ 1 ml total lung capacity ( TLC ) at this age, a conventional dose of 100 CFU is a typical inoculum [25]. In comparison, rabbits used in our studies were about 2. 2 to 2. 6 kg in weight, with a lung weight of about 15 grams and a TLC of about 62 ml

To estimate stability of the pBP10 plasmid in Mtb strain H37Rv, Gill et al. [17] grew the H37Rv-pBP10 strain in vitro in different media and calculated the decline rate in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells ( slopeF ) and exponential increase rate in total cell numbers ( slopeN ) in culture over time ( see Eqs ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ). Because it is expected that the bacteria do not die in culture in vitro within the experimental time frame [17], with δ = 0, the segregation coefficient can be then calculated, for example, using Eq ( 2 ) as s = slopeF/slopeN. Clinical Mtb isolate HN878 was transformed with the replication clock plasmid pBP10 and was provided for our experiments by D. Sherman’s group ( University of Washington ). We grew Mtb strain HN878-pBP10 in complete 7H9 or 1:3 ( 7H9 ) media at 37 C and measured the percent of plasm-bearing cells at different time points ( Fig 2 ). The plasm p10 was more stable in H878 than in H37v ( s = 0.10 in H878 vs. s 0.18 in H37v ). We used the average s = 0.10 for H878BP10 to study the dynamics of H878-p10 in vivo. We infected rabbits with aerosolized bacteria ( ∼500 CF ) and measured the number of all or plasm-bearing cells in the lungs at different points after infection ( Fig 3 ). Importantly, we found similar numbers in the left and right lungs even there was a tendency of higher CF numbers in the right ( S Fig ) this similar our observation in B6 [25. In parallel, we infected with original H878 ( not the plid ) we found similar CF in the lung two M strains that the plid p10 did not impact replication of H878 ( S Fig ) M dynamics in lungs was not monotonic ( Fig 3 ) there a large in number from 500 to nearly in first 28 days then number declined next 56 days until 84 and number exploded about 101 CF/lung in one or maintained 107/l in another ( Fig 3 ) changes in plid-bearing followed total with initial increase, decline, again last 28 days. Change percent plid was nonotonic decline days and 56 84 with increase 28 and stable 112 ( Fig 3 ) latter frequency plid contrasted increase total number last 28 days ( Fig 3 ) 

Here is a clear, accurate, and formal summary of the biomedical article:

Tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a significant global health threat with 1.6 million deaths in 2021. Despite effective chemotherapy, the pathophysiology of TB and replication dynamics of Mtb during acute and chronic stages of infection remains poorly understood. In this study, researchers infected rabbits with a novel, virulent clinical M isolate of the Beijing lineage H878, carrying the plasmid p10, and found that the plid was more stable in H878 than in a commonly used laboratory-adapted M strain H37v. The kinetics of plid-bearing bacteria in lungs of M-infected rabbits did not follow a monotonic decline, with an increase in percentid cells between 28 and 56 post-infection and stable between 84 and 112 post-infection. Mathematical modeling suggested that a nonotonic change in percentid cells can be explained by a lung M population consisting of at least 2 subpopulations with different replication/death kinetics. Importantly, a model with kinetically homogeneous M population could not explain the data when run stochastically. The results suggest bacterial dynamics in subsets of granulomas, which can be tested in future experiments. The study has limitations, including estimated segregation coefficient of plid in H878 differed between culturing conditions and plid kinetics changing over time, and used a large inoculum of M that may contrast with murine studies.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Carbohydrates and glycoproteins modulate key biological functions. However, experimental structure determination of sugar polymers is notoriously difficult. Computational approaches can aid in carbohydrate structure prediction, structure determination, and design. In this work, we developed a glycan-modeling algorithm, GlycanTreeModeler, that computationally builds glycans layer-by-layer, using adaptive kernel density estimates ( KDE ) of common glycan conformations derived from data in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) and from quantum mechanics ( QM ) calculations. GlycanTreeModeler was benchmarked on a test set of glycan structures of varying lengths, or “trees”. Structures predicted by GlycanTreeModeler agreed with native structures at high accuracy for both de novo modeling and experimental density-guided building. We employed these tools to design de novo glycan trees into a protein nanoparticle vaccine to shield regions of the scaffold from antibody recognition, and experimentally verified shielding. This work will inform glycoprotein model prediction, glycan masking, and further aid computational methods in experimental structure determination and refinement.

   . Here we describe a new glycan modeling algorithm built within the Rosetta software suite, a platform that incorporates state-of-the-art applications and modules for a variety of macromolecular modeling and design tasks [36]. The new algorithm provides user interfaces for the creation of tailor-made protocols [37] [38], and includes a reliable knowledge-based energy function to evaluate models and designs [39]. We build on earlier work that enabled representing and evaluating carbohydrate structures within Rosetta [40] and in loading, representing, and refining glycans from the Protein Data Bank [41]. We expand on this foundational work through the addition of new carbohydrate-specific sampling methods, an updated conformer database employing adaptive kernel density estimates, a new framework for general analysis in Rosetta ( SimpleMetrics ), and a new algorithm for accurately modeling complex carbohydrates, the GlycanTreeModeler. We rigorously benchmark the new method on a set of diverse high-resolution crystal structures of glycans in symmetric crystal environments using the new analysis framework SimpleMetrics and a new application called rosetta_scripts_jd3, and we show that the GlycanTreeModeler is capable of recapitulating native glycan structures with high accuracy both through de novo and density-guided modeling [42]. We then applied our glycan modeling protocol with Rosetta sequence design of glycan sequons to engineer optimal new glycans onto a protein nanoparticle vaccine scaffold and evaluated changes in immune responses. We observed reduced reactivity to the underlying protein surface in immunization experiments, thus demonstrating that glycans can be computationally engineered to tailor immunogenicity of vaccines.

. 31 Å and 0. 28 Å respectively, while the mean RMSD of the glycan root ( first two sugar residues ) was. 23 Å ( Fig 4A ) ( S3 Table ). Values for PNear with lambda of 1. 0 Å were generally quite favorable, indicating high-quality funnels, with a mean of 0. 86 and median of 0. 92 ( Fig 4B ). These results show that the GlycanTreeModeler can be effective for modeling known glycans into electron density, especially with existing methods refinement [41]. The addition of glycans to exposed protein surfaces can reduce B cell receptor access to underlying surface epitopes; this approach ( called “glycan masking” ) has been used to decrease the amount of antibodies elicited against off-target epitopes of designed immunogens [12] [46] [47] [48]. Given the predictive capability of the GlycanTreeModeler to model the spatial arrangement of complex glycans, we used the algorithm in combination with RosettaScript SugarCoating methods for sequon design and computational glycosylation to iteratively design four N-linked glycans onto the outer surface of the I53-50A trimeric component of the I53-50 protein nanoparticle scaffold ( Fig 5A; details of the design approach are described in Materials and Methods in S1 Text. Designed sequences and designed glycan positions are given in S4 Table ). I53-50 was selected as a model immunogen because it is currently in clinical trials as the nanoparticle scaffold for SARS-CoV-2 [49] and RSV [50] vaccines. When glycosylated I53-50A trimers and I53-50B pentamers were mixed in vitro at equimolar concentrations, the two components self-assembled into I53-50 ( gly ) nanoparticles that display 240 glycans on the outer surface ( Fig 5A and 5B ). Biophysical characterization by negative stain transmission microscopy ( nsTEM ), dynamic light scattering ( DLS ), and size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) confirmed the formation of monodisperse particles with the known I53-50 morphology ( Fig 5B )

The GlycanTreeModeler and associated tools allow modelers to accurately model glycans of interest through de novo and density-guided modeling. The algorithm and energy function were rigorously optimized and benchmarked with glycans of varying length and complexity at a median de novo RMSD of 2. 7A. In fact, even before full optimization and release, the GlycanSampler algorithm ( previously the glycan_relax app ) was used to model glycans on HIV [52], Hepatitis C [53], vaccine candidates [54] [55], and ( with the final optimized version ) SARS-CoV-2 [56], illustrating the general utility of the algorithm and its potential to inform chemical biology. The modular nature of Rosetta and the tools created for this work allow them to be used in a variety of complex modeling and design tasks. The GlycanTreeModeler was used with previously published density tools [42] to build glycans into their crystallographic or cryoEM experimental density with sub-Angstrom accuracy. However, while the results are encouraging, a truly automated solution for glycoprotein modeling must also sample glycan chemistries, branching, and kinematics simultaneously in order to build potential glycan residues into the density of unknown glycans. Knowledge of the range of glycoforms and occupancy occurring at a glycosylation site can be obtained through mass-spectroscopy techniques [21] [57], but due to chemical and structural heterogeneity at any single glycan site, modelers will typically need to build models for multiple different glycoforms at a single site, especially for complex glycans. The tools presented here can sample and build multiple potential whole glycans at a site through the SimpleGlycosylateMover, but core Rosetta methods that also consider species and cell-type dependent glycan chemistries during the GlycanTreeModeler or end-to-end deep learning methods would be a welcome addition to the methods presented here

. Glycans are also conformationally flexible, being highly hydrophilic and typically exposed on the surface of proteins, with a large number of conformational degrees of freedom. However, as has been observed in molecular dynamics and NMR experiments, glycan conformations can be influenced by their structural environment [24]. Through the plethora of high-resolution crystallographic and cryo-EM studies, we also know that glycans can adopt stable conformations with well-defined density observed for many of the glycan residues in each tree, especially towards the root of the glycan tree, even for some unrestrained glycans [25] [26],. Presumably, these low-energy, stable conformations are occupied at higher frequency in solution. In addition, a recent QM study on glycan torsional energies showed that the QM-derived conformational preferences of glycan torsions match well with glycan structures analyzed from the protein data bank, indicating that conformational diversity is also influenced by the chemical makeup of each glycan structure [27]. Given the complex chemistry and conformational diversity involved, accurate modeling of glycans is currently a grand challenge in computational biology. Computational glycobiology tools and webapps have been developed for protein glycosylations [28], validation of carbohydrate structural chemistry [29], statistical analysis [30], and docking [31] [32], Common methods in glycoprotein modeling typically involve molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations [33] or adding glycans by manual placement and conformational tweaking into their density for structure determination [34]. Recently, a new method for automatic building of glycan structures from sequence was described [35]; this method, the CHARM-GUI Glycan Modeler, was benchmarked only up to the first and second sugar

. By combining the tools through RosettaScripts, it becomes possible to computationally design glycan sequons at ideal positions on a protein, and then build and model multiple potential glycans at a variety of sites in a symmetric manner. This general workflow was used to sugarcoat a clinically relevant nanoparticle vaccine scaffold with N-linked glycans. In vitro and in vivo testing of this glycosylated scaffold showed a decrease in the humoral immune response to the glycan-masked surface. Sugar coating therapeutics using these methods could potentially reduce off-target effects of many preclinical biologics, especially with respect to immunogenicity. Most glycans can sample a wide range of conformations in solution, as they are mostly polar, usually exposed to solvent, and have many conformational degrees of freedom. Thus, accurately predicting the lowest energy states ( and highest occupancy conformations ) for glycans is difficult. In addition, these glycans may be forced into specific conformations by their environment, as observed in molecular dynamics and NMR studies [24]. High-resolution crystallography and cryo-EM studies have shown that glycans adopt well-defined conformations for many glycan residues, especially towards the root of the glycan tree, even for unrestrained glycans [25] [26]. Presumably, these low-energy conformations are occupied at higher frequency in solution. A recent QM study on gly torsional energies showed that Q-derived conformation preferences match glycan structures from PDB, indicating conformation diversity also influenced by gly structure [27. Given the chemistry and conformation complexity involved, modeling glycans is a challenge in computational biology. Computational tools have been developed for glycosylations [28], validation [29], analysis [30], docking [31] [32, common in glycop modeling involve MD simulations [33] or manual placement and conformation tweaking into density [34]. Recently, a method for building glycan from sequence was described [35] ; this, CH-Glycan Model, was benchmarked only to second sugar. By combining Rosetta, it becomes possible to computationally design glyons at positions, then build multiple glycans at sites in a manner. This workflow was used to sugar a clinically relevant scaffold with N-linked glycans. In vitro and in vivo testing showed a decrease in humoral response to glycan-masked surface. Sugar therapeutics using these methods could reduce off-target effects many biologics, especially immunogenic.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Protein ubiquitination is usually coupled with proteasomal degradation and is crucial in regulating protein quality. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF ( Skp1-Cullin-F-box ) complex directly recognizes the target substrate via interaction between the F-box protein and the substrate. F-box protein is the determinant of substrate specificity. The limited number of identified ubiquitin ligase-substrate pairs is a major bottleneck in the ubiquitination field. Penicillium oxalicum contains many transcription factors, such as BrlA, CreA, XlnR, and Ace1, conserved in filamentous fungi that regulate the fungal development and transcription of ( hemi ) cellulase genes. Transcription factor Ace1 ( also known as SltA ) positively correlated with fungal growth and conidiation and negatively correlated with the expression of ( hemi ) cellulase genes. A ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair, SCFFbx23-Ace1, is identified in P. oxalicum. Most of PoFbx23 is present in free form within the nucleus. A small portion of PoFbx23 associates with Skp1 to form PoFbx23-Skp1 heterodimer or assembles with the three invariable core components ( Skp1, Cul1, and Rbx1 ) of SCF to form the SCFFbx23 complex. Under glucose signal, PoFbx23 absence ( Δfbx23 ) results in decreased transcription levels of the brlA gene which encodes the master regulator for asexual development and six spore pigmentation genes ( abrB→abrA→aygB→arpA→arpB→albA ) which encode the proteins in the dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin pathway, along with impaired conidiation. Under cellulose signal, transcription levels of ( hemi ) cellulase genes in the Δfbx23 mutant are significantly upregulated. When PoFbx23 is present, PoAce1 exists as a full-length version and several low-molecular-weight degraded versions. PoAce1 has polyubiquitin modification. Deleting the Pofbx23 gene does not affect Poace1 gene transcription but results in the remarkable accumulation of all versions of the PoAce1 protein. Accumulated PoAce1 protein is a dysfunctional form that no longer binds promoters of the target gene, including the cellulase genes cbh1 and eg1, the hemicellulase gene xyn11A, and the pigmentation-related gene abrB. PoFbx23 acts as a transcriptional coactivator, recognizing and activating PoAce1, allowing the latter to regulate the transcription of target genes with different effects ( activating or repressing ) under different signals.

   . reesei, and N. crassa [36, 37]. P. oxalicum can be employed as a model system to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of cellulolytic enzyme gene expression. In this study, a ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair, SCFFbx23-Ace1, is identified in P. oxalicum. The PoFbx23 recognizes and activates the transcription factor PoAce1 within the nucleus. PoAce1 is a ubiquitinated protein. In the absence of PoFbx23, PoAce1 accumulates in a dysfunctional form; only in the presence of PoFbx23 can PoAce1 bind to the promoter regions of the target gene in an active form. A model for the regulation of gene expression by PoFbx23-Ace1 is proposed.

. Under the cellulose signal, the active form of PoAce1 also binds to the promoter regions of the hemi ( cellulase ) genes and represses the target gene transcription as a negative regulator. During this process, some ubiquitinated PoAce1 is coupled with proteasomal degradation by 26S proteasome ( Fig 10, top ). In the absence of PoFbx23, PoAce1 accumulates in the cell as the UPS mediated by the SCFFbx23 complex is interrupted. Nevertheless, PoAce1 is still ubiquitination modified and degraded because UPS, mediated by the other ubiquitination system, is still present. Meanwhile, due to the absence of PoFbx23, the accumulated PoAce1 is inactive; and unable to bind to the target gene ( e. g., pigmentation-related gene abrB ) as the positive regulator under the glucose signal. The transcription of the target abrB gene is deactivated. Under the cellulose signal, the accumulated inactive PoAce1 cannot bind to the target genes as the negative regulator. The target hemi ( cellulase ) gene transcription is derepressed ( Fig 10, bottom ). From yeast to plants to mammalian cells, F-box proteins have been found to play a role as coactivators of transcription factors. The F-box protein Dsg1/Mdm30 is a transcriptional coactivator that stimulates transcription factor Gal4 turnover in yeast [59]. The Arabidopsis F-box protein UFO, a component of the SCF complex, acts as a transcriptional coactivator to regulate floral development by physically interacting with the transcription factor LFY [60]. Fbw1a, also a component of the SCF complex, together with another transcriptional coactivator p300, enhance the transcriptional activity of beta-catenin in mammalian cells [61]. It is evident that PoFbx23 recognition and binding to PoAce1 is necessary for PoAce1 to have DNA-binding activity, although we have not been able to determine whether PoAce1 exhibits its active form due to the binding of the PoFbx23-Skp1 heterodimer and/or the SCFFbx2 complex

. Therefore, even though the accumulated degraded versions of PoAce1 in the PoFbx23 deletion strain can support the UPS, the lone presence of ubiquitinated PoAce1 and its degraded versions may not be the active forms of PoAce1; PoAce1 must interact with PoFbx23 to become an active form that can bind to target genes. We have not demonstrated that PoAce1 is destroyed by Ub-mediated proteolysis, while the overwhelming majority of transcription factors studied to date are destroyed by this pathway [59]. Interestingly, PoMub1, a component of the Ubr2/Mub1 ubiquitin ligase complex, is also observed in the results of Ace1-TAP ( Table 2 ). Yeast Ubr2/Mub1 ubiquitin ligase complex was proved essential for transcription factor Rpn4 ubiquitylation and marked the Rpn4 for degradation [65, 66]. The findings raise the possibility that the Mub1/Ubr2 ubiquitin ligase complex is responsible for the ubiquitination of PoAce1 besides the SCFFbx23 complex. They also imply that quality control of transcription factors may not be confined to just one ubiquitin ligase system. The absence of the PoFbx23 leads to the downregulation of genes associated with fungal asexual development and transcription of secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes under glucose signal and the upregulation of ( hemi ) cellulase genes under cellulose signal. There could be two reasons for this phenomenon. The dysfunction of PoAce1 is the first explanation, as PoAce1 is a positive regulator for fungal growth and asexual development [29–31] and a negative regulator for ( hemi ) cellulase genes [26–28]. Along with the PoFbx23 and PoSkp1 of the SCF complex, PoAsh1 ( PDE01581 ), a histone methyltransferase whose protein abundance ranks fifth in the TAP-MS result of Ace1-TAP also caught our attention. Ash1 localizes in the nucleus and is responsible for mono- and dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 36 ( H3K36me1 and H3K36me2 ) [67]. P

. P. oxalicum H3K36me1 is a repression marker for ( hemi ) cellulase gene expression [43]. A recent study has shown that T. reesei Ace1 interacts with protein methyltransferase TrSAM and inhibits cellulase gene expression [68]. Activated PoAce1 by SCFFbx23 may inhibit the expression of cellulase genes by recruiting PoAsh1. FBPs have also been shown to recruit histone methyltransferases in filamentous fungi. The FBP DCAF26 of N. crassa recruits histone methyltransferase DIM-5 and regulates H3K36 methylation to perform its epigenetic function [69]. Given the high abundance of PoFbx23 proteins in the TAP-MS result of PoAce1 ( Table 2 ), some of the proteins in the TAP-MS result may have interactions with PoFbx23 in addition to interacting with PoAce1 protein. Whether PoAsh1 is recruited by PoAce1 or is targeted for ubiquitination by PoFbx23 remains to be addressed in future studies. In addition to the dysfunctional PoAce1 as the first explanation, we cannot exclude the second explanation—the role of PoFbx23 itself, as well as the role of PoFbx23 with other substrates, because losing a fungal F-box protein can result in a pleiotropic phenotype, especially when the FBP has multiple targets [16]. The substrate targets of FBPs can be transcription factors, enzymes in metabolic pathways, structural proteins, and inhibitors and/or activators of various biological processes [70]. There are at least 20 F-box proteins in P. oxum, and many of them are conserved in other filamentous fungi.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The basement membrane ( BM ) is an essential structural element of tissues, and its diversification participates in organ morphogenesis. However, the traffic routes associated with BM formation and the mechanistic modulations explaining its diversification are still poorly understood. Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium relies on a BM composed of oriented BM fibrils and a more homogenous matrix. Here, we determined the specific molecular identity and cell exit sites of BM protein secretory routes. First, we found that Rab10 and Rab8 define two parallel routes for BM protein secretion. When both routes were abolished, BM production was fully blocked; however, genetic interactions revealed that these two routes competed. Rab10 promoted lateral and planar-polarized secretion, whereas Rab8 promoted basal secretion, leading to the formation of BM fibrils and homogenous BM, respectively. We also found that the dystrophin-associated protein complex ( DAPC ) and Rab10 were both present in a planar-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins. DAPC was essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards the Rab10 route. Moreover, we identified a dual function for the exocyst complex in this context. First, the Exo70 subunit directly interacted with dystrophin to limit its planar polarization. Second, the exocyst complex was also required for the Rab8 route. Altogether, these results highlight important mechanistic aspects of BM protein secretion and illustrate how BM diversity can emerge from the spatial control of distinct traffic routes.

   . However, it has been suggested that BM fibrils act as a cue for actin fiber orientation at the basal domain of follicle cells that would be the main mechanical effector of elongation [26]. Nonetheless, BM fibrils nicely illustrate how BM diversification can elicit a morphogenetic mechanism. BM fibrils are generated from newly synthetized BM proteins that accumulate in the lateral pericellular spaces between follicular cells before being inserted in the BM into an oriented manner by the directed egg chamber rotation [25]. Rab10 overexpression leads to an increased lateral accumulation of BM proteins and of BM fibrils, suggesting its implication in the formation of these fibrils [25]. BM fibril formation requires dystroglycan ( Dg ), a membrane receptor for BM proteins, and dystrophin ( Dys ), an F-actin interacting protein [26]. Dg and Dys are the two core components of the evolutionarily conserved dystrophin-associated protein complex ( DAPC ) [27]. In mutant Dys or Dg follicles, the BM is devoid of BM fibrils. Moreover, epistasis experiments with Rab10 suggest a functional link between these actors [26]. However, how DAPC participates in BM fibril formation remains to be elucidated. In this study, we analyzed the routes leading to BM formation in the follicular epithelium. Genetic evidence indicates that Rab8 and Rab10 define two parallel routes, forming homogenous BM and BM fibrils, respectively. Analyses of BM protein secretion in single cells revealed that this diversification is due to Rab10-driven lateral and planar polarized secretion, while Rab8 promotes basal secretion. We also found that the DAPC is part of the same cell compartment as Rab10 and influences the planar polarization of Rab10-dependent secretion. Moreover, we found that the exocyst complex is required the formation of homogenous BM.

. The fact that Rab8 and Rab10 share a similar function ( BM protein secretion ), but with a different output ( homogenous vs fibrillar BM ), in a highly tractable system for genetics and imaging, offers a unique opportunity to thoroughly investigate their molecular and mechanistic specificities. On the basis of the present results, we propose the co-existence of parallel secretory routes orchestrated by these Rab proteins with different cell exit sites defined by cell polarity axes as the basic mechanism to explain BM diversification during development.

. Moreover, the longitudinal view of the epithelium suggested the presence of a proper basement membrane, but on the apical side. However, the planar view indicated that apically secreted BM proteins assembled in aberrant discontinuous structures, as observed in other genotypes leading to apical BM secretion ( S1C Fig ) [28]. It has been previously shown that the apical secretion observed in the Rab10 KD can be suppressed by Rab11 KD, suggesting that Rab11 may define a cryptic route for BM protein secretion [23]. We tested this hypothesis by knocking down all three genes ( Rab8, Rab10 and Rab11 triple KD ). In this condition, apical secretion was completely blocked, and BM proteins were in big intracellular blobs ( Fig 1G and 1I ). Notably, basal secretion was not restored, indicating that Rab11 did not compete with any other route besides Rab8 and Rab10 ( Fig 1G and 1H ). Altogether, these data indicate that Rab8 and Rab10 define the proper path for BM secretion in a partially redundant manner, and that no other route towards the basolateral side of the follicular epithelium exists. Considering the important role of BM in epithelial architecture, we wondered whether completely reversing BM secretion towards the apical domain ( as observed in the Rab8-Rab10 double KD ) or lack of BM secretion ( Rab8, Rab10 and Rab11 triple KD ) could affect epithelial polarity. Therefore, we checked the localization of atypical protein kinase C ( aPKC ), an essential actor of the apical domain definition commonly used as a marker of this domain, Discs large protein ( Dlg ), known to be located at the lateral cortex, and E-cadherin protein ( Ecad ) accumulated at the zonula adherens [29]. We observed no difference between control and Rab8-Rab10 double KD ( S1D Fig )

. In this context, Rab10 was not recruited to the lateral cortex and was still planar polarized, whereas Dg was still located at the whole cell periphery ( Figs 5P, 5Q, 5S and S4H–S4I ). Thus, Dys is required for Rab10 recruitment by Dg. Interestingly, Rab10 delocalization induced by Dg OE allowed us to test specifically the role of the planar-polarized lateral secretion versus unpolarized secretion from the whole lateral periphery. We analyzed BM protein secretion in Dg OE follicle cells. FF quantification revealed a slight increase following Dg OE ( S4J–S4L Fig ). However, probably as a direct consequence of Rab10 redistribution all around the cells, we noticed the presence of very long and intense fibrils that remained trapped between the lateral domain of the follicle cells in the axis of cell migration ( Figs 5U and S4L ). As recently reported in another genetic context affecting BM secretion routes and where similar lateral fibrils were described, their presence disrupted the cell geometry ( Fig 5T and 5U and [28] ). Altogether, these data underly that BM protein secretion planar polarization is required to maintain the epithelial structure. They also show that Dg is sufficient to reorient the Rab10 route. To understand how Rab10 and the DAPC could be connected, we noticed that the exocyst subunit Exo70 was identified as a Dys interactor using a large scale two-hybrid proteomic approach [35]. Exocyst is an octameric complex, very conserved from yeast to humans. It is usually involved in the subcellular targeting of exocytosis by tethering vesicles to a specific location on the plasma membrane, but it can also participate in vesicle transport or docking [36, 37]. A physical interaction between Dys and the exocyst complex could be likely because this complex has been functionally linked with Dys and Rab10 in other contexts [38–42]

. However, when we overexpressed Rab10 in a Dys null mutant, FF was not rescued, indicating that Dys presence is obligatory for BM fibril formation ( Fig 5A–5D ). Nonetheless, the absence of BM protein apical secretion in the Dys mutants indicated that they behaved differently than a Rab10 loss of function ( Fig 5G, 5H and 5J ). We hypothesized that DAPC recruits vesicles containing BM proteins for the Rab10 route and that in its absence, all BM proteins use the Rab8-dependent route, leading to the exclusive formation of homogenous BM. In this scenario, Dys loss should completely suppress the apical secretion observed in Rab10 KD cells and block BM formation in the absence of Rab8. As apical secretion was not suppressed in Dys null mutant follicles upon Rab10 KD, and even slightly increased, we excluded this hypothesis ( Fig 5G and 5I ). However, apical secretion was strongly increased in Dys null mutant follicles upon Rab8 KD, although it was not sufficient to block basal BM formation ( Fig 5G, 5K and 5L ). We interpret this result as the consequence of the competition between the Rab8 and Rab10 routes in a genetic context where the Rab10 route is affected, ultimately leading to more BM proteins transported by the Rab8 route. Moreover, in this genetic combination ( Dys null mutant + Rab8 KD ) there is no FF rescue ( Fig 5A and 5D–5F ). Thus, in the absence of Dys, a significant amount of BM is secreted by the Rab8 route. We conclude that DAP is required for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient the secretion towards the Rab10 route, and that the exoc complex plays a dual role in this context. First, it interacts with Dys to limit the planar polarization of Rab10. Second, it is required for the Rab8 route.
Researchers developed a machine learning model to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) using a multi-task learning (MTL) approach. The model, named language-based universal model (LB), was trained on Env sequences with neutralization data and fine-tuned with Env sequences with non-bnAb and bnAb data. The LB's performance was comparable to Gradient Boosting Machine (GB) and Random Forest (RF) models, with improvements over both methods. Unlike other methods, the LB does not require aligning Env sequences, an advantage given the incredible variability of Env. The model was trained to predict in vitroAb resistance, not validated with clinical outcomes, relying on correlations between in vitro to in vivo. A systematic comparison between methods requires testing different preprocessing, feature selection, and learning algorithms. The LB was compared to RF and GB models because boosting and trees underlie published methods not using neural networks. The most subtypes in sub-Saharan Africa are A, C, and circulating recombinant forms (CR). The model's performance is expected to increase with the size and diversity of training data, chosen small architectures due to computational requirements and data availability. The model addresses key challenges in HIV-1 research, developed with code available at https://github.com/ia/LBUM. The framework is a starting point for designing immunotherapies, potentially relevant to other infectious diseases treated with monoclonal antibodies. The model mitigates bias from underrepresented subtypes and allows learning patterns of co-resistance between antibodies, providing tools to predict epitopes and select optimalAb combinations.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disease characterized by aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow. The effects of treatments for MM vary between patients, highlighting the importance of developing prognostic models for therapeutic decision-making. Most previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the fact that dysfunction of pathways is associated with disease development and progression. This study considered two strategies to construct predictive models taking pathway information into account: pathway score method and grouplasso using pathway information. The former converted gene expression to sample-wise pathway scores for fitting. Three methods for pathway calculation (ssSEA, GS, GS, and z-scores) and 14 sources providing pathway information were implemented in microarray data for MM (GSE324) and obtained a candidate with best performance in validation. The model was compared with gene-based and published models in external data. Also, effects of missing values on prediction were investigated. Results showed grouplasso incorporating pathway information (Vax) was more competitive than gene in both internal and external validation. Immune information including V pathways seemed more predictive for MM. Vax outperformed previously published models. The model was more resistant to missing values, and presence <5% would not deteriorate its accuracy using missing imputation. Pathway-based models using grouplass were competitive to gene-based for MM. These were documented in R package (https://github.com/ShStatMM), where missing imputation method was integrated for future validation.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Mitochondrial hyperfission in response to cellular insult is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death. Thus, there is a critical need to understand the molecular mechanisms coordinating and regulating the complex process of mitochondrial fission. We develop a nonlinear dynamical systems model of dynamin related protein one ( Drp1 ) -dependent mitochondrial fission and use it to identify parameters which can regulate the total fission rate ( TFR ) as a function of time. The TFR defined from a nondimensionalization of the model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k + M k - where M is the total concentration of mitochondrial fission factor ( Mff ) and k+ and k− are the association and dissociation rate constants between oligomers on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The variable μ can be thought of as the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers. Though the nondimensionalization of the system results in four dimensionless parameters, we found the TFR and the cumulative total fission ( TF ) depend strongly on only one, μ. Interestingly, the cumulative TF does not monotonically increase as μ increases. Instead it increases with μ to a certain point and then begins to decrease as μ continues to increase. This non-monotone dependence on μ suggests interventions targeting k+, k−, or M may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission mechanism. Thus understanding the impact of regulatory parameters, such as μ, may assist future therapeutic target selection.

    Under extreme metabolic or environmental stress, mitochondria can enter a state of hyperfission which leads to lower functioning, smaller mitochondria and an increase in programmed cell death [7, 8]. However, a total inhibition of fission through deletion of key mitochondrial fission proteins also has negative effects [11]. Thus there exists a need to understand the molecular mechanisms which fine-tune mitochondrial fission to preserve mitochondrial function without deleting key players. With a nonlinear dynamical system, sensitivity analyses, a nondimensionalization of the system, and a bifurcation analysis we begin to understand how certain parameters affect the total fission rate ( TFR ) which is the number of fission events per second. These parameters include the association ( k1 ) and dissociation ( k−1 ) rates between Drp1 and Mff, the total concentration of tetrameric Drp1 ( T ) and Mff ( M ), the association ( k+ ) and dissociation ( k− ) rates between Drp1-Mff oligomers on the OMM, and the fission rate ( f ( i ) ). Through this investigation, we found the number of fission events per second, the TFR ( Eq ( 15 ) ) depends strongly on k+, k−, and M. Individual variations in these three parameters cause the TFR curve to transition from damped oscillations that reach a steady-state to sustained, stable oscillations. Oscillations have been observed in variables associated with mitochondrial dynamics such as ATP production, Ca2+ levels, and mitochondrial membrane voltage [30–32]. Our model suggests the TFR as a function of time may oscillate as well. Like the TFR, the cumulative TF, which is the total number of fission events over a set time, depends heavily on k+, k−, and M. The largest cumulative TF values occur when k+ and M are large ( Fig 7 ). For k−, the range is more nuanced with the largest cumulative TF values occurring when k− is between 0. 1 and 1 ( Fig 7 )

. The receptor Mff is essential for recruiting Drp1 to mitochondria [17], and over-expression of Mff increases mitochondrial fission while over expression of MiD49 and MiD51 inhibits fission [13, 20]. For these reasons, the nonlinear dynamical systems described below focus on Drp1 and Mff interactions. Drp1 oligomerizes to form a chain like structure, an oligomer, which wraps around the mitochondria leading to a fission event. While Drp1 recruitment, oligomerization, and interaction with outer mitochondrial membrane receptors is known to occur [13, 18, 19], the specific contributions of these processes to the fission rate is incompletely understood. Therefore there is a need to understand the molecular mechanisms coordinating mitochondrial dynamics. We develop a nonlinear dynamical system for a Drp1-dependent fission mechanism and use parameter sensitivity analyses, bifurcation analysis, and a nondimensionalization of the model to identify which parameters have the greatest effect on the total fission rate ( TFR ) as a function of time. The TFR is the number of fission events per second. We will refer to our nonlinear dynamical system as the Fission Model. The TFR defined from the nondimensionalization of the Fission Model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k + M k -, where M is the total concentration on Mff; k+ and k− are the association and dissociation rate constants, respectively, between oligomers and single Drp1-Mff complexes on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The parameter μ can be thought of as the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers. Even though the nondimensionalization of the system results in four dimensionless parameters, we found the cumulative total fission ( TF ), which is the total number of fission events over a set time period, depends strongly on only one of them, μ. Thus we identify μ to be a key regulatory parameter for Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission.

The lack of information in the literature about the association and dissociation rate constants between Drp1 and Mff ( k1, k−1 ), oligomerization on the OMM ( k+, k− ), and the rate of mitochondrial fission ( f ( i ) ) motivated our investigation of how different parameter choices affect the total fission rate with the goal of identifying regulatory parameters which fine tune mitochondrial fission. The total fission rate ( TFR ) is the total number of fission events per second, and it has units nM/s. Thus the TFR as a function of time is T F R ( t ) = a ∑ i = 26 30 C i ( t ) ( 15 ) where a is the fission rate from Eq ( 9 ) with units 1/s. The initial conditions for the numerical solutions assume the total concentration of Drp1 tetramers ( T ) begins in the unbound cytosolic pool, and the total concentration of Mff ( M ) is in the unbound pool on the OMM which implies the initial concentration of oligomers of any size, Ci for 1 ≤ i ≤ 30, is 0. The parameter values for the numerical solutions and the TFR curve shown in Fig 4 are listed in Table 1. The values in Table 1 were chosen so that the qualitative behavior of the numerical solutions in Fig 4A allowed for an investigation of the oligomerization process. The model focuses on the oligomerization process in order to better understand how changes upstream of a fission event affect the number of fission events per second. The numerical solutions exhibit damped oscillations that appear to reach a steady-state ( Fig 4A ). These oscillations are a consequence of the cyclic nature of the system caused by Mff returning to an unbound state after a fission event. Notice the numerical solution curves for various oligomer sizes oscillate in sync with the solution curve for Mff. This is because the availability of Mff to bind with Drp1 dictates the concentration of C1 and by extension, the systems oscillations. The numerical solutions for larger oligomer sizes, e. g

Mitochondrial fission is the process of a mitochondrion dividing into two daughter organelles. The Fission Model presented here is a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( ODEs ) which focus on Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission following cellular injury when the concentration of Drp1 in the cytosol is increased. The mechanism our model approximates begins with the recruitment and binding of cytosolic Drp1 tetramers with Mff anchored to the OMM via its hydrophobic C-terminal transmembrane domain. Since Drp1 exists in a predominately tetrameric form in the cytosol [14], the model focuses on the recruitment of Drp1 tetramers. Fig 1B shows GFP tagged Drp1 encircling the mitochondria, which illustrates the recruitment phase of the mechanism. Fig 1D shows red mitochondria encircled with a cyan ring structure where the cyan color is from the overlay of green Drp1 and blue Mff. This illustrates Drp1-Mff interactions on the OMM. The model tracks the concentration of these Drp1-Mff complexes as they build oligomers of various sizes. Once an oligomer reaches a sufficient size, which will be discussed in more detail later, a fission event occurs. After a fission event, Drp1 tetramers and Mff proteins instantly return to their respective unbound pools within the model ( Fig 2 ). The Fission Model is a common pool model and represents the fission activity of an entire cell. Therefore, the concentration of Mff on the OMM is the concentration across all mitochondria. The model focuses on the oligomerization process in order to better understand how changes upstream of a fission event affect the number of fission events per second. The solutions of the F Model exhibit damped oscillations that appear to reach a steady ( Fig 4 ). These oscillations are a consequence of the cyclic nature of the system caused by M returning to unbound after a fission. Notice the solutions for oligomer sizes oscillate in sync with the solution for M. This is the availability of M to bind Dr1 dictates the concentration C and extension the oscillations. The solutions for larger oligomer sizes e. g, 10, 20 exhibit sustained oscillations while smaller oligomer sizes exhibit damped oscillations ( Fig 4 ). The oscillations have been observed in variables associated with mitochondrial dynamics such as ATP, Ca2 levels, and membrane voltage [30–32]. Our model suggests the TFR as a function of time may oscillate as well. The cumulative fission, which is the total number of fission over a set, depends heavily on k, k, and M. The largest cumulative values occur when k and M are large ( Fig 7. For k the range is nuanced with largest cumulative values occurring when is between 0. and 1 ( Fig 7. The M is essential for recruiting Dr1 to mitochondria [17] and overexpression increases fission while expression of Mi49 and Mi51 inhibits fission [13,20]. For these reasons the dynamical systems below focus on Dr1 and M interactions. Dr1 oligomerizes to form a chain structure anomer which wraps around mitochondria leading to fission. Dr1 recruitment oligomerization and interaction with outer membrane is known [13,18,19] but specific to fission is incompletely understood. There is a need to understand molecular coordinating dynamics. We develop nonlinear dynamical for Dr1-dependent fission and use sensitivity, bifurcation, and nondimensional to identify which have greatest effect the fission as function. The fission defined nondimensional undergoes Hop bifurcation bifurcation parameter = + k M - where is total concentration M k and k are association dissociation constants between oligomers Dr1-M on outer membrane. can thought maximum rate disassembling oligomers. though nondimensional system four parameters found cumulative depend only one. Thus identify to be key parameter Dr1-dependent fission.

    Title: 
    Abstract: CRISPR-based gene drives offer promising prospects for controlling disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests. A significant challenge for successful suppression-type drive is the rapid evolution of resistance alleles. One approach to mitigate the development of resistance involves targeting functionally constrained regions using multiple gRNAs. In this study, we constructed a 3-gRNA homing gene drive system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyrosine decarboxylase 2 ( Tdc2 ) in Drosophila suzukii, a notorious fruit pest. Our investigation revealed only a low level of homing in the germline, but feeding octopamine restored the egg-laying defects in Tdc2 mutant females, allowing easier line maintenance than for other suppression drive targets. We tested the effectiveness of a similar system in Drosophila melanogaster and constructed additional split drive systems by introducing promoter-Cas9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency. Our findings show that genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene drive alleles, and the position effect profoundly influences Cas9 activity. Furthermore, this study highlights the potential of conditionally rescuing the female infertility caused by the gene drive, offering a valuable tool for the industrial-scale production of gene drive transgenic insects.

    Our research demonstrated the robust use of the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic tool to construct fGD systems targeting the haplosufficient female fertility gene Tdc2 in both the agricultural pest SWD and the model insect D. melanogaster. The gene drive study on SWD, an economic pest, is highly meaningful. Currently, many researchers are gradually shifting their focus from model organisms to application species and back for further exploration. However, the fGD system implemented in SWD did not exhibit high super-mendelian homing efficiency, so it could not spread through the population in cage trials. Three factors might have contributed to this outcome. First, sequence polymorphism in gene drive modified organisms can greatly influence the efficacy of gene drive element spread in the population and thus may have negatively affected our drive [3, 6, 23]. Second, the efficiency of the Cas9 and/or gRNA expression system may have been low, perhaps due to position effects that neighboring genetic elements surrounding the transgene insertion site suppress Cas9 expression. Third, the fitness cost of the drive was moderate, too high to be overcome by the low drive efficiency. In D. melanogaster, we initially employed two Cas9 promoters that had previously shown good expression, but this did not improve homing efficiency. However, introducing Cas9 protein from another genomic source greatly increased the efficiency of the gene drive system, indicating that position effects may partially account for our SWD results. Using gene drive to manage invasive pest SWD is a promising and innovative approach, but as a species with a high level of genetic polymorphism [24, 25], such genetic background may have a significant impact on the effective spread of gene drive through populations [3, 6]

Gene drive is a novel genetic engineering tool for controlling disease transmitting vectors and agricultural pests. Specifically, CRISPR/Cas9-based gene drive has broad application prospects due to its high specificity and flexibility. It functions by biasing the inheritance of specific genes to ensure their widespread transmission across successive generations. Current CRISPR-based gene drives consist of three key components: a Cas9 endonuclease gene, one or multiple gRNAs, and a marker gene. Once the target site on a homologous chromosome is cleaved, the gene-drive element is inserted into the double-stranded break ( DSB ) through homology-directed repair ( HDR ), utilizing the drive-bearing homologous chromosome as a template for repair [1]. If this process of directional gene conversion, also known as homing, is highly efficient, the drive allele will be inherited in a manner that surpasses typical Mendelian inheritance patterns ( >50% ). Under ideal conditions, the gene drive elements will eventually spread throughout the population. In fact, Anopheles mosquitoes engineered with CRISPR-based gene-drive have achieved close to 100% inheritance of the desired allele across successive generations [2]. However, the emergence of resistance alleles through end-joining can inhibit the drive, blocking recognition by the gRNAs and potentially maintaining gene function [3–6]. It should be noted that in this research we use the term "resistance" broadly refer to alleles formed by end-joining repair, causing mutations that prevent their cleavage by the drive. In some lab experiments, resistance to CRISPR/Cas9-based homing drives arise rapidly, especially when using a single gRNA [3, 4, 7]. Thus, a homing suppression drive targeting a female fertility gene can slow down the development of resistance alleles because any sequence alternation, including in-frame indels, would incur substantial fitness costs [2]

. suzukii nanos promoter. It was effective at population suppression in mathematical simulations with continuous releases of more modest size ( 1:4 ) [12]. This study reports the development of a novel CRISPR-based homing gene drive system targeting the Tdc2 gene with the previously untested vasa promoter in SWD. We demonstrated conditional rescue of the Tdc2 mutant phenotype by feeding octopamine and showed moderate levels of gene drive efficiency that specifically target the Tdc2 locus. We also conducted additional experiments in D. melanogaster to further characterize this drive system. These findings suggest potential applications of Tdc2-targeting gene drives for SWD population management, paving the way for more effective and sustainable pest control strategies.

. Unlike D. melanogaster, the female SWD Tdc2 null mutants are still able to lay small numbers of viable eggs, and we did not explore the reason for this. We suspect that the insertion of a large gene drive cassette in the Tdc2 locus might impact neighboring Tdc1 expression and partially rescue the Tdc2 phenotype, potentially allowing the issue to be solved with drive design adjustments such as reversing the orientation of some genes within the drive. Another plausible explanation is that the function of Tdc2 is not fully conserved between these two fly species, implying that SWD Tdc2 might not be an optimal target gene due to the observed incomplete sterility. As gene drive elements propagate throughout the population, they can trigger the emergence of resistance alleles due to the end-joining repair, thereby impacting the efficiency of the gene drive. Nonfunctional resistance alleles can impede the spread of the gene drive, especially if they arise from maternally deposited Cas9 and gRNAs. The presence of functional resistance alleles would have an even more significant impact. Comprehensive studies have shown that simultaneous targeting with several gRNAs improves cleavage efficiency and reduces resistance alleles in cage trials [14, 15]. To mitigate the formation of functional resistance alleles, we employed three gRNAs to target the Tdc2 gene, inducing nonfunctional mutations at the desired sites. This design likely reduced the selective pressure for resistance by minimizing the formation rate of functional resistance alleles. The key characteristic of our gene drive systems is that the phenotype of female sterility can be rescued by feeding of octopamine, which is inexpensive. In certain gene drive systems that aim to induce female infertility by targeting haplosufficient genes, it is impossible to reverse the infertility phenotype in drive homozygous females [6]

. Because the drive itself causes recessive female sterility, another important technical aspect of this approach is how to keep large-scale rearing for area-wide releases with a homing suppression element that would otherwise crash due to female sterility. Intriguingly, previous studies in Drosophila melanogaster have unveiled the potential of a specific target gene, tyrosine decarboxylase 2 ( Tdc2 ). This gene encodes an enzyme involved in the synthesis of octopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a vital role in various physiological processes, including egg laying [8]. A single point mutation in the active site of Tdc2, disrupting the production of octopamine in the nervous system, results in female sterility due to impaired oviductal contractions and egg retention in homozygous females, while heterozygotes are normal [9]. More importantly, this characteristic can be restored through octopamine feeding, indicating that Tdc2 is a potential target for gene drives and enabling conditional rescue of the homozygous drive phenotype [9]. Drosophila suzukii, also known as spotted wing drosophila ( SWD ), is a major agricultural pest. Female SWD have specialized serrated ovipositors, which can lay eggs directly into ripe fruits with soft skins such as strawberries and grapes. The sterile insect technique ( SIT ) has been successfully employed for the widespread suppression of pests, including SWD, by releasing a substantial excess of sterile males in a repeated manner at a ratio of at least 10:1 [10, 11]. Due to the high costs of implementing SIT over large areas, genetic suppression through gene drive technology may be a more favorable option for controlling SWD populations. Targeting the female-specific exon of the dsx gene, a recently created CRISPR/Cas9-based split gene drive ( sGD ) system in SWD showed 94–99% transmission rates with a line that expressed Cas9 with two nuclear localization sequences from the D. suzukii nanos promoter

    Researchers developed a CRISPR-based gene drive system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyros decarboxylase 2 (T2) in Drosoph suuk, a fruit pest. The system exhibited low homing efficiency in the germline, but feeding octamine restored egg-laying in T2 mutant females, allowing for easier maintenance of the drive. A similar system was tested in Dros melanogaster, and additional drives were constructed by introducing Cas9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency. Genetic polymorphisms in wild populations limited the spread of gene alleles and influenced Cas activity. The study highlights the potential of rescuing female infertility caused by the drive, offering a tool for industrial-scale production of gene transgenic insects.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The brain is not only constrained by energy needed to fuel computation, but it is also constrained by energy needed to form memories. Experiments have shown that learning simple conditioning tasks which might require only a few synaptic updates, already carries a significant metabolic cost. Yet, learning a task like MNIST to 95% accuracy appears to require at least 108 synaptic updates. Therefore the brain has likely evolved to be able to learn using as little energy as possible. We explored the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks. Based on a parsimonious energy model, we propose two plasticity restricting algorithms that save energy: 1 ) only modify synapses with large updates, and 2 ) restrict plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. In biology networks are often much larger than the task requires, yet vanilla backprop prescribes to update all synapses. In particular in this case, large savings can be achieved while only incurring a slightly worse learning time. Thus competitively restricting plasticity helps to save metabolic energy associated to synaptic plasticity. The results might lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a better match between artificial and biological learning. Moreover, the algorithms might benefit hardware because also electronic memory storage is energetically costly.

   . We examine how this energy measure can be reduced while maintaining overall learning performance. Our study is inspired by experimental observations that despite common fluctuations in synaptic strength, the number of synapses undergoing permanent modification appears restricted. First plasticity is spatially limited, e. g. during motor learning plasticity is restricted to certain dendritic branches [12]. Second, plasticity is temporally limited, e. g. it is not possible to induce late-phase LTP twice in rapid succession [13, 14]. This stands in stark contrast with traditional backprop which updates every synapse on every trial and, as we shall see, can lead to very inefficient learning. We use artificial neural networks as a model of neural learning. While neural networks trained with back-propagation are an abstraction of biological learning, it allows for an effective way to teach networks complex associations that is currently not matched by more biological networks or algorithms. Biological implementations of back-propagation have been suggested, e. g. [15], but it is likely that these are less energy efficient as learning times are typically longer. In artificial neural network research there is a similar interest in limiting plasticity, but typically for other reasons. Carefully selecting which synapses to modify can prevent overwriting previously stored information, also known as catastrophic forgetting [16]. Randomly switching plasticity on and off can help regularization, as in drop-out and its variants [17]. Communication with the memory systems is also energetically costly in computer hardware. Strikingly, storing two 32-bit numbers in DRAM is far more expensive than multiplying them [18]. Recent studies have started to explore algorithms that reduce these costs by limiting the updates to weight matrices [18, 19].

Experiments have shown that already simple associative learning is metabolically costly. For neural networks that learn more complicated tasks, energy costs can according to our model become very high, in particular when networks are large. For instance, macaque V1 has some 150 million neurons and some 300 × 109 synapses [37]. Extrapolating Fig 1, if plasticity were distributed over all these synapses ( as backprop prescribes ), the number of synaptic updates would be some 105 times larger than required. The M1 energy, which increases less steeply with network size, would still be some 700 times larger, Fig 5. Thus large networks are powerful, but without restrictions the metabolic cost of plasticity could become very large. We have introduced two approaches to reduce costs. First, restrict plasticity to a subset of synapses. This is most efficient when the plasticity on input and output side of a neuron are coordinated, so that when inputs of a neuron are modified then so are its outputs. Such effects have indeed been observed in experiments, although the precise rules appear complex [38–40]. Second, express plasticity only in synapses with large updates. This is also consistent with neuroscience data, where typically a threshold for plasticity induction has been observed. Our study suggests the presence of a competitive algorithm in which only a certain fraction of synapses is modified. Biophysically, the competition on the neuron level could naturally follow from resource constraints. These strategies can be combined with our earlier work on synaptic caching. Finally, it also possible to skip over uninformative samples during learning, leading to even further saving [41, 42]. Future studies could include how the saving algorithms should be automatically adapted dependent on task difficulty or network architecture

Energy availability is a vital necessity for biological organisms. The nervous system is a particularly intensive energy consumer. Though it constitutes approximately 2% of human body mass, it is responsible for roughly 20% of basal metabolism—continuously consuming some 20W [1, 2]. Energy requirements of neural signaling are now widely seen as an important design constraint of the brain. Sparse codes and sparse connectivity ( pruning ) can be used to lower energy requirements [3]. Learning rules have been designed that yield energy efficient networks [4, 5]. However, learning itself is also energetically costly: in classical conditioning experiments with flies the formation of long-term memory reduced lifespan by 20% when the flies were subsequently starved [6]. Moreover, starving fruit flies halt long-term memory formation; nevertheless forcing memory expression reduced their lifespan [7]. We have estimated the cost of learning in fruitflies at 10mJ/bit [8]. These costs are not restricted to flies. In mammals there is physiological evidence that energy availability gates long lasting forms of plasticity [9]. Furthermore, in humans there is behavioral evidence for a correlation between metabolism and memory [10, 11]. Given this evidence, we hypothesize that biological neural plasticity is designed to be energy efficient. Including energy constraints could lead to computational learning rules more closely resembling biology, and a better understanding of observed synaptic plasticity rules. As precise metabolic cost models for plasticity are not yet available, we aim at algorithmic principles rather than energy efficient biophysical mechanisms. We introduce an abstract energy measure that assumes the energy is solely used by the synaptic updates. Costs for synaptic transmission and global costs independent of the number of synapses are ignored ( see Discussion )

. Samples were presented in a random order. Because batching would require storing synaptic updates across samples, which would be biologically challenging, the training was not batched and the synaptic weights were updated after every sample. We did not find substantial energy savings when using adaptive learning schemes such as ADAM. As such schemes would furthermore be hard to implement biologically, we instead fixed the learning rate. Every 1000 samples training was interrupted and performance on a validation data set was measured. As a reasonable compromise between performance and compute requirements, networks were always trained until a validation set accuracy criterion of 95% was achieved. Our approach requires a model of the metabolic energy needed for learning. It is currently not known why the metabolic cost of some forms of plasticity is so high, nor is it known which process is the main consumer. In flies persistent, protein synthesis dependent memory is much more costly than protein synthesis independent forms of memory. One could presume that protein synthesis itself is costly, however it has also been argued that protein synthesis is relatively cheap [20]. After all, also in the absence of synaptic plasticity there is substantial protein turnover. Examples of other costly processes could be transport of proteins to synapses, actin thread-milling, synaptogenesis. In addition, there might be energy costs that are not related to synaptic plasticity, such as replay ( see Discussion ) ; we ignore those here. Furthermore, more biophysical energy models would require spiking networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which is out of the scope of the current study. Instead, we propose a generic model for the metabolic energy M of synaptic plasticity under the following assumptions: Under the assumption of spatial and temporal independence, we still require an expression how much modification of a single synapse costs

. As a result, energy scales sub-linearly with network size ( M 0 ∝ N h T ∝ N h 0. 75 ). The accumulated synaptic change energy M1 also increases for larger networks albeit less steeply, Fig 1d. Despite a fixed learning rate, the size of individual weight updates is smaller in larger networks, Fig 1c, bottom, see also [32]. In summary, in large networks individual synapses 1 ) take fewer and smaller steps, and 2 ) the final individual weights are smaller. We find an approximate square root relation between energy and size, M 1 ∝ N h 0. 43, Fig 1d. The above result shows that while large, over-dimensioned networks learn a bit faster, training them uses far more energy—restricting plasticity might save energy. To examine this we first only allow plasticity in a random subset of synapses using a random binary mask. Mask elements were drawn from a Bernoulli distribution. We first used a different random mask for every trial, also known as ‘Dropconnect’ [17]. In this case learning simply slowed down and masking did not save energy; also using a different mask specific for each output class did not save energy. Next, the mask was fixed throughout training. Now both energy measures strongly reduced, Fig 2a, green curves. The optimal mask density was estimated from a validation set. We also found that the mask can be learned from the data, Fig 2b, green. The mask can also be learned from a validation set, Fig 2, blue. The mask can also be learned from a combination of training and validation, Fig 2, red. The mask can also be learned from a combination of training and validation, Fig 2, blue. The mask can also be learned from a combination of training and validation, Fig 2, red.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Organelles and endosymbionts have naturally evolved dramatically reduced genome sizes compared to their free-living ancestors. Synthetic biologists have purposefully engineered streamlined microbial genomes to create more efficient cellular chassis and define the minimal components of cellular life. During natural or engineered genome streamlining, deletion of many non-essential genes in combination often reduces bacterial fitness for idiosyncratic or unknown reasons. We investigated how and to what extent laboratory evolution could overcome these defects in six variants of the transposon-free Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1-ISx that each had a deletion of a different 22- to 42-kilobase region and two strains with larger deletions of 70 and 293 kilobases. We evolved replicate populations of ADP1-ISx and each deletion strain for ~300 generations in a chemically defined minimal medium or a complex medium and sequenced the genomes of endpoint clonal isolates. Fitness increased in all cases that were examined except for two ancestors that each failed to improve in one of the two environments. Mutations affecting nine protein-coding genes and two small RNAs were significantly associated with one of the two environments or with certain deletion ancestors. The global post-transcriptional regulators rnd ( ribonuclease D ), csrA ( RNA-binding carbon storage regulator ), and hfq ( RNA-binding protein and chaperone ) were frequently mutated across all strains, though the incidence and effects of these mutations on gene function and bacterial fitness varied with the ancestral deletion and evolution environment. Mutations in this regulatory network likely compensate for how an earlier deletion of a transposon in the ADP1-ISx ancestor of all the deletion strains restored csrA function. More generally, our results demonstrate that fitness lost during genome streamlining can usually be regained rapidly through laboratory evolution and that recovery tends to occur through a combination of deletion-specific compensation and global regulatory adjustments.

   . Different outcomes have been reported, however, after evolving strains of E. coli [18] and Bacillus subtilis [14] with cumulative engineered deletions comprising ~20–30% of their genomes. The E. coli strain wholly recovered fitness lost in minimal medium, primarily through rewiring metabolic and regulatory networks [18]. The B. subtilis strain exhibited more limited fitness recovery [14]. In light of these results, questions still remain about the impact of large deletions on an organism’s fitness and how and whether laboratory evolution can recover lost fitness after this type of genome reduction. Previously, we engineered strains of the metabolically versatile and naturally competent bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1-ISx with deletions of large genome segments that each encoded ≥17 nonessential genes [23]. In this study, we evolved replicate populations of eight reduced-genome strains of Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1-ISx in complex and defined medium laboratory environments. Deletions in these strains were constructed without examining the functions or expression levels of the genes being removed, which resulted in substantial fitness defects in some cases. Nevertheless, evolution restored fitness, at least partially, in most instances. Whole-genome sequencing revealed examples of both deletion-specific and shared genetic targets that recurrently evolved mutations in different populations. The most widespread mutations affected genes in a post-transcriptional global regulatory network. They appear to recapitulate or phenocopy a transposon insertion in the csrA gene in A. baylyi ADP1 that was removed during construction of the transposon-free ADP1-ISx progenitor strain. However, even in these cases, the effects of mutations within this network on gene function varied with the deletion strain and environment in which they evolved

. Because the ADP1-ISx deletions studied here did not differentiate the targeted genes by any criteria beyond essentiality when they were planned and constructed, the deletions that did not recover growth likely contained some of these types of genes. Further streamlining of A. baylyi genomes to include these deletions and others that could not be constructed [23] would require debugging, for example, by adding back any "irreplaceable" genes that are needed to restore viability and fitness in ways that evolution on laboratory timescales cannot achieve. Despite encountering some limitations, the overwhelming result of our study is that evolution is useful for mechanistically probing why there are fitness defects after specific gene deletions and for recovering the fitness of reduced-genome strains. Thus, it should be considered a critical component of strain engineering campaigns that are creating the next generation of simplified, efficient, and more predictable chassis organisms for biotechnology applications. Given that microbes that naturally evolve extremely reduced genomes generally become less robust [1], it remains to be seen how far these endeavors that seek to build, remodel, and evolve streamlined genomes can be pushed, whether their goals are to optimize microbial cell factories or understand the essential genetic architectures of cellular life.

We examined fitness recovery of Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1-ISx strains engineered to have reduced genomes during ~300-generation evolution experiments in complex and defined growth media. Several of the engineered single deletions significantly decreased fitness in one or both media. Following evolution, most of the resulting strains had gained fitness, but two failed to show significant recovery in one of the two environments ( MGD9 in LB and MGD4 in MS ). In these cases, the engineered deletion seems to have eliminated one more genes with a function that cannot be fulfilled by mutations altering the expression and activities of the remaining genes, at least through evolutionary pathways that were accessible in this short experiment. In the more common cases where adaptation was able to recover lost fitness and even surpass the fitness of the ancestral strains, certain genes were recurrently mutated in specific environments and in specific deletion strain backgrounds, likely because these mutations compensate for lost functions. In the defined medium ( MS ), mutations in RNase D ( rnd ) were overwhelmingly common, whereas mutations in a variety of pathways were overrepresented in the complex medium ( LB ). The strongest associations were between the AbsR28 small RNA and MGD6 in LB, rpoD and MGD12 in LB ( and a pre-existing rpoD mutation in MS ), znuC or znuB and MSD1 in LB, and ACIAD2087 and MSD2 in LB. Other significant associations included enrichment of mutations in a putative small RNA located in the recD/ACIAD0400 intergenic region in MSD1 in LB and various genes involved in natural competence in MGD12 in MS. A. baylyi ADP1 has been evolved in the laboratory in several prior experiments [28–30]. Mutations in genes involved in competence ( comC, comN, pilB, pilD, pilF, pilR ) and extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis ( ACIAD0085, galU, and pgi ) are similar or identical to those observed previously [29]

Previously, we created Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1-ISx [13] by deleting all transposable elements from the genome of the laboratory strain ADP1 [24]. Then, we examined possibilities for additional genome streamlining by attempting to construct 55 multiple-gene deletion ( MGD ) strains from ADP1-ISx [23]. Each of the 18 MGD strains that were successfully constructed has a single contiguous stretch of nonessential genes removed. For this study, we selected six of these MGD strains ( MGD4, MGD6, MGD9, MGD12, MGD15, and MGD17 ) with deletions ranging in size from 21. 8 to 41. 7 kb that removed from 17 to 47 genes ( Fig 1A ). We also examined a retained genome region ( RGR ) strain with a partially successful deletion, leading to loss of only six genes ( RGR7 ), as an additional wild-type-like control, and two multiple-segment deletion ( MSD ) strains ( MSD1 and MSD2 ) that were created by combining or expanding deletions in the original MGD strains. Strain MSD1 had the most-reduced genome, with a total of 293. 5 kb and 268 genes removed, including a ribosomal RNA operon. MSD2 has a deletion of 69. 8 kb that expands upon one of the original MGD segments ( MGD11 ). It removes 67 genes. To examine how the large deletions affected bacterial fitness, we constructed a GFP-expressing variant of ADP1-ISx. Then, we performed co-culture competition assays comparing this reference strain to each MGD strain and the ADP1-ISx progenitor in a complex medium ( LB ) ( Fig 1B ) and a defined minimal succinate medium ( MS ) ( Fig 1C ). The six MGD ancestor strains had fitness defects of 17. 0% on average and up to 49. 3% relative to ADP1-ISx in LB. The fitness defects were 10. 0% on average and as high as 39. 9% in MS

. Prior evolutionary studies of reduced-genome E. coli observed changes in translation rather than post-transcriptional regulation [18], and there was little fitness recovery for reduced-genome B. subtilis strains in a complex medium [14], suggesting that mutations in different global processes may be more beneficial in different organisms with different sets of genes deleted. Future work constructing a minimal A. baylyi genome could progress by combining the deletions we describe into a single strain. Some deletions, such as those in MGD1 and MSD1, could not be added back into the genome because they were not viable. Adding genes to restore viability and fitness would require debugging, for example, by adding genes that are needed to restore viability in laboratory timescales cannot be achieved by evolution. Despite some limitations, this study demonstrates that evolution can recover lost fitness after large deletions, and that this should be considered in strain construction of next-generation, efficient and predictable chassis for biotechnology applications.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Precise regulation of gene expression is essential to understand a wide range of biological processes. Control over gene expression can be achieved using site-directed recombinases and endonucleases. However, their efficiency is variable and dependent on the genomic context. Here, we develop a self-cleaving ribozyme-based tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebrafish. Using an in vivo reporter strategy, we first show that inserting the T3H48 self-cleaving ribozyme in an intron enables rapid pre-mRNA cleavage, with up to 20-fold reduction in expression, and that this ribozyme displays superior activity compared with other ribozymes. We then inserted the T3H48 ribozyme in the second intron of the albino gene using a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and observed a pigmentation phenotype similar to that in the mutant. Using a base-editing strategy to inactivate the ribozyme, we also show that this phenotype is reversible, illustrating the specificity of the approach. In addition, we generated a Flippase- and Cre-activatable version of the T3H48 ribozyme, called RiboFlip, to control the mRNA levels of the albino gene. RiboFlip activation induced mRNA knockdown and also recapitulated the albino mutant phenotype. Furthermore, we show that a Cre- and Dre-controllable Gal4/UAS reporter in the RiboFlip cassette can label knocked-down cells independently of the expression of the target gene. Altogether, we introduce the RiboFlip cassette as a flexible tool to control endogenous gene expression in a vertebrate model and as an alternative to existing conditional knockdown strategies.

   . The zebrafish emerged several decades ago as an alternative and powerful vertebrate genetic model [16]. Most genetic tools involving site-directed recombinases and endonucleases have been successfully implemented in zebrafish [17–19]. Moreover, the zebrafish model allows the efficient screening of genetic tools because of its external fertilization and rapid early development. Here, we use the zebrafish model to establish a self-cleaving ribozyme-based system to knock down gene expression in vivo. We first use a GFP reporter assay to assess the efficiency of several self-cleaving ribozymes in reducing pre-mRNA levels and find that the T3H48 hammerhead ribozyme ( T3H48-HHR ), when placed in an intron, causes a 20-fold reduction in eGFP mRNA. Next, we show that inserting the T3H48-HHR in the second intron of the albino ( alb ) /slc45a2 gene recapitulates the pigmentation phenotype of the alb mutant [20]. Using a base-editing strategy to inactivate the ribozyme, we show that this phenotype is reversible, illustrating the specificity of the approach. Furthermore, we created a Flippase- and Cre-inducible T3H48-HHR cassette called RiboFlip, which we also inserted in the alb gene. We show that RiboFlip induction also leads to a pigmentation phenotype similar to that of the mutant. Together, these new approaches broaden the genetic toolbox available for functional genomics in vertebrates.

Self-cleaving ribozymes are already used to control the expression of transgenes and endogenous genes in multiple models [6–8, 10–15]. However, modulating the expression of an endogenous locus in a vertebrate model has never been achieved. In our study, we used T3H48-HHR in zebrafish to modulate the mRNA levels produced from a reporter transgene as well as the alb gene. We also used CRISPR/Cas9 knockin strategies to insert an inducible T3H48-HHR cassette called RiboFlip and show that this system can trigger conditional gene knockdown of the endogenous alb gene. Ribozymes are usually inserted in UTR regions to mediate efficient knockdown throughout the lifetime of mRNAs. As the pre-mRNA is accessible only before splicing, intronic insertions induce lower cleavage rates [6]. However, we reasoned that the improved cleavage rate of T3H48-HHR could induce efficient pre-mRNA cleavage. Intronic cleavage could increase the number of potential landing sites to insert the ribozyme and avoid the destabilization of the mRNA when fused with a drug-inducible aptamer [10]. We first assessed the efficiency of T3H48-HHR in mediating pre-mRNA cleavage using a reporter strategy. Although this approach led to lower cleavage rates than expected [14], it induced a robust loss of reporter expression. Further work should assess whether UTR cleavage leads to stronger degradation in vertebrate models in vivo. Surprisingly, the insertion of three copies of T3H48-HHR did not increase the cleavage rate. We hypothesize that the secondary structure of the ribozyme, which is essential for cleavage, was altered by this array. Additional insulating sequences [12] should be assessed to maintain a high cleavage rate in ribozyme arrays. We then evaluated the ability of T3H48-HHR to recapitulate mutant phenotypes using alb as a model. We inserted the ribozyme in the second intron of the alb gene, in a CRISPR site previously used to induce large deletions [24]

. In addition, we wanted to investigate whether the T3H48-HHR insertion, rather than its cleavage, could be responsible for the pigmentation phenotype. To this aim, we converted the active T3H48-HHR ribozyme insertion in the alb gene to an inactive version using the ABE-Ultramax ( Umax ) base editing strategy [25] ( Fig 2g ). We found that this conversion very efficiently rescued the pigmentation phenotype in albHHR/b4 embryos ( Fig 2h-k ). Altogether, these data show that the T3H48 ribozyme can induce the cleavage of an endogenous mRNA target in zebrafish. Spatiotemporal control of the T3H48-HHR and related ribozymes has been achieved in C. elegans [11] and with the use of AAV vectors [15]. However, ribozyme activation in vivo in the endogenous locus of a vertebrate has never been attempted. Here, we designed a cassette called RiboFlip, that allows the activation of T3H48-HHR using Flippase ( Flp ), and the dual activation of T3H48-HHR and a 5XUAS:TagBFP using Cre ( Figs 3a and S3a ). We strategically positioned two different FRT and LOX sites in a head-to-head orientation. This positioning allows the stable inversion of the cassette after Flp or Cre recombination: a first round of recombination will invert the cassette and a second round will excise one recombination site, leaving heterotypic sites on both sides unable to recombine [17, 26–28]. We inserted this cassette in the same intron of the alb gene as in Fig 2a, using CRISPR/Cas9 knockin [29]. We refer to the obtained Pt ( alb:alb-RiboFlip-OFF ) bns697 allele as albR-OFF hereafter. We found that both Flp- and Cre-activation of albR-OFF lead to the flipping of the cassette ( S4a Fig ), alb mRNA knockdown ( Fig 3b ), and pigmentation defects ( Fig 3c-e ). We refer to the obtained Pt ( alb:alb-RiboFlip-Flp-ON ) bns732 and Pt ( alb:alb-RiboFlip-Cre-ON ) bns733 alleles as albR-Flp-ON and albR-Cre-ON respectively hereafter

. Moreover, we found that eGFP fluorescence intensity was strongly reduced in embryos injected with the active T3H48-HHR compared with those injected with the inactive version, in contrast to the mCherry signal, which was comparable between all injected embryos ( Fig 1c, d ). Altogether, these data show that the T3H48-HHR is an efficient ribozyme for gene knockdown in zebrafish. Robust reduction in transgenic mRNA levels after ribozyme cleavage has already been shown in other models [9, 10, 12]. Here we investigated whether integrating T3H48-HHR in an endogenous locus could induce phenotypes similar to those observed in the mutant. We targeted the alb gene, whose downregulation leads to strong pigmentation defects [20, 23]. We integrated the active T3H48-HHR in the second intron of the alb gene using CRISPR/Cas9 knockin [18] using an already described CRISPR site [24] ( Figs 2a and S2a ). We flanked the ribozyme with a double CAA insulating sequence ( S1b Fig ), a shorter one than that used in Fig 1 in order to fit it into a 120 bp ssODN donor [18]. We refer to the obtained Pt ( alb:alb-T3H48-HHR ) allele as albHHR hereafter. We found that albHHR/HHR embryos display a 13. 6-fold reduction in alb mRNA levels at 24 hpf ( Fig 2b ) and a pigmentation similar to that of the alb mutant ( Fig 2c, d ). The pigmentation of albHRHR/HHR was indistinguishable from that of alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb alb

    Title: 
    Abstract: Segmentation is required to quantify cellular structures in microscopic images. This typically requires their fluorescent labeling. Convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) can detect these structures also in only transmitted light images. This eliminates the need for transgenic or dye fluorescent labeling, frees up imaging channels, reduces phototoxicity and speeds up imaging. However, this approach currently requires optimized experimental conditions and computational specialists. Here, we introduce “aiSEGcell” a user-friendly CNN-based software to segment nuclei and cells in bright field images. We extensively evaluated it for nucleus segmentation in different primary cell types in 2D cultures from different imaging modalities in hand-curated published and novel imaging data sets. We provide this curated ground-truth data with 1. 1 million nuclei in 20, 000 images. aiSEGcell accurately segments nuclei from even challenging bright field images, very similar to manual segmentation. It retains biologically relevant information, e. g. for demanding quantification of noisy biosensors reporting signaling pathway activity dynamics. aiSEGcell is readily adaptable to new use cases with only 32 images required for retraining. aiSEGcell is accessible through both a command line, and a napari graphical user interface. It is agnostic to computational environments and does not require user expert coding experience.

    We describe aiSEGcell, a user-friendly software to segment nuclei from only BF images without the need for fluorescent nuclear labeling. Previous research has demonstrated that neural networks can detect nuclei and other cell organelles in transmitted light images under optimized conditions [12, 13, 15]. We now show that nuclear segmentations in BF are also feasible in challenging common experimental conditions like low magnification, and time lapse imaging of e. g. small non-adherent primary murine and human hematopoietic cells imaged in microfluidic and other culture devices. Notably, we prove that these segmentations are so similar to manual segmentation that they retain biologically meaningful information even when using the segmentation as the basis for quantification of difficult and noisy reporters like biosensors for cell signaling dynamics. By freeing up a fluorescent channel, aiSEGcell facilitates the exploration of additional fluorescent markers or the reduction of phototoxicity and required imaging times. We demonstrate that aiSEGcell can thus add biological information to an experiment previously constrained due to e. g. poor fluorophore markers in an existing transgenic mouse model. More specifically, we explore the effect of NfκB signaling dynamics on the differentiation of mGMPGM and correct for the cell cycle as a potential covariate. Other signaling pathways like ERK in mESCs change their response dynamics depending on CC phases [23]. In contrast, here we find that cell cycle progression does not affect NfκB signaling responses to TNFα stimulation in mGMPGM cells. At a broader level, we show how aiSEGcell enables new experimental workflows and its utility in jointly investigating multiple signaling pathways, differentiation markers, and control variables

. Previous research has shown that neural networks can automatically detect nuclei and other sub-cellular structures in high magnification bright field ( BF ) images [12, 13]. Moreover, U-Net has been suggested as a well-suited model architecture for this purpose, potentially even for low magnification imaging [14–16]. However, it is uncertain whether nuclei can be accurately segmented under challenging typical imaging conditions optimized for speed and cells’ health and not for perfect images, such as low magnification BF microscopy. Furthermore, actively maintained, user-friendly software for segmenting nuclei in BF is not available. Consequently, widespread experimental adoption remains elusive. Here, we present “aiSEGcell” a user-friendly software to segment nuclei in BF images accessible even to users with no prior coding experience. We demonstrate its utility even in challenging prevalent conditions, including low magnification live time lapse imaging of primary cells. This includes small hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells lacking prominent and large cell compartments like cytoplasm, also in microfluidic and other culture devices. More specifically, we quantify both technical performance metrics and the preservation of biologically meaningful information such as live single cell signaling dynamics. We show that our trained instance of aiSEGcell is transferable to unseen experimental conditions and adaptable to other use cases, like novel cell types, only requiring 32 images for retraining. Finally, we demonstrate aiSEGcell’s benefits by quantifying an additional fluorescence channel in an experimental setting where the number of biomarkers is limited by their spectral properties. aiSEGcell is accessible through a command line interface ( CLI ) or a graphical user interface ( GUI ), a napari plugin, tested by users with varying coding experience in different computational environments [17]

. This is further accentuated in notoriously difficult to train neural networks implemented in complex frameworks that are subject to frequent changes [38, 39]. Therefore, it is crucial to release scientific software that is well documented and accessible to programming novices [3, 5, 20, 40]. For the first time, we introduce a software for segmenting nuclei in BF images, proven to work across various computational environments and user coding proficiency levels. We release aiSEGcell with already trained models to segment nuclei and whole cells in BF. The software is available as CLI and GUI versions for easy accessibility. Importantly, aiSEGcell utilizes a generic image segmentation approach not limited to BF microscopy [16]. Hence, users can retrain an existing aiSEGcell model or train a new aiSEGcell model to segment other objects in different 2D image modalities, for example fluorescently labeled blood vessels or cell organelles in electron microscopy, etc., further enhancing its utility in a wide range of applications.

Conventional cell segmentation approaches use fluorescence to mark cells and cell compartments for segmentation ( Fig 1a ). In contrast, aiSEGcell omits fluorescence markers for segmentation and directly segments BF images ( Fig 1b ). We selected U-Net as the model architecture [12, 14] for aiSEGcell and trained it on 9, 849 BF image and segmentation mask pairs ( >600, 000 nuclei ) of live primary murine hematopoietic cells, like macrophages, stem and progenitor cells, at 20x magnification ( D1 ) [16]. To highlight the need for user-friendly software that segments nuclei in BF, we compared aiSEGcell to widely used nucleus segmentation software Cellpose and StarDist [19, 20]. Available pretrained models for nucleus and BF segmentations were not suitable alternatives to the specialized BF nucleus segmentation of aiSEGcell ( S1 Fig and S1 and S2 Tables ). We evaluated aiSEGcell on a second data set ( D2 ) comprised of 6, 243 image-mask pairs ( >300, 000 nuclei ) derived from five independent imaging experiments with experimental settings similar to D1. Cell morphologies included round cells and more complex shaped cells with protruding pseudopodia. In addition, cell sizes varied by an order of magnitude ( Table 1 ). aiSEGcell segmented nuclei in BF images across morphologically distinct cells and different scales ( Figs 1c and S2a ). We quantified segmentation quality using an adapted version of the F1-score that counted inaccurately predicted objects ( e. g. intersection over union = 0. 4 ) as one error instead of as both, false positive ( FP ), and as false negative ( FN; see Materials and methods ). Therefore, the image-wise average adapted F1-score with an intersection over union ( IOU ) threshold of 0. 6, denoted as F1avg0. 6, more appropriately represented the observed segmentation quality [21]. aiSEGcell nuclear segmentations in BF were quantitatively similar to nuclear marker derived segmentations ( ground truth; F1avg0

. Therefore, we selected 999 cells from D2 that aiSEGcell segmented accurately ( i. e. high IOU ) and 951 cells from D2 that aiSEGcell segmented poorly ( i. e. low IOU ). Next, we extracted 21 conventional shape and intensity features that describe the nucleus, the whole cell, and the cell neighborhood given the corresponding segmentation masks ( S9 and S10 Figs and S15 Table ). Taken individually, extracted features were not indicative of whether a cell was segmented accurately or not ( S11 Fig ). However, training a random forest to classify if a cell is segmented accurately or not ( test accuracy = 0. 85 ) revealed that features associated with the nucleus of a cell were more important than features of the whole cell or the cell neighborhood ( S12 Fig ) [27]. We visually confirmed the importance of nuclear features in BF images by directly interpreting aiSEGcell segmentations with Grad-CAM [28] ( S13 Fig ). Removing a fluorescence channel dedicated to image segmentation enables one or even several additional fluorescent markers and thus improved experimental workflows. For example, reporters like GFP are common in transgenic mouse models and are not optimized for multiplexing ( i. e. overlapping with cyan and yellow channel ). Thus, removing the need for imaging GFP enables the use of both cyan and yellow channels. To illustrate the possibility of analyzing additional biological information in the fluorescent channel freed up by aiSEGcell, we replaced the previously used H2BmCHERRY nuclear marker [25] by virally transducing with fluorescently tagged proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) to enable live cell cycle phase detection. We isolated lineage unbiased mGMPs ( mGMPGM ) from an existing GFPp65 reporter mouse line and utilized D1-trained aiSEG to quantify cell cycle progression and NfB signaling in response to TNα stimulation ( Figs 3 and 4 ). We found that cell cycle progression does not affect NfB signaling to TNα in mMP cells ( Figs 3 and 4 ). In contrast, ERK signaling in mES cells changes depending on cell cycle phase [23]. Our results demonstrate the utility of aiSEG in jointly investigating multiple signaling pathways, markers, and variables.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments is a central challenge for efficient behaviour. We asked whether humans address this challenge by relying on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features. One such property is the rate of change of features, given that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. Hence, we asked whether humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast. To test this idea, 295 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward. Across two experiments and one preregistered replication, participants accrued more reward when a bandit’s relevant feature changed slowly, and its irrelevant feature quickly, as compared to the opposite. We did not find a difference in the ability to generalise to unseen feature values between conditions. Testing how feature speed could affect learning with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature, and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes. The larger the improvement in participants’ performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates. These results provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning.

    Causal processes tend to evolve on a slower timescale than noise [31]. To investigate whether humans employ a slowness prior to identify potentially relevant features during reinforcement learning, we tested participants in a decision-making task with stimuli composed of one reward-predictive and one reward-irrelevant feature. Participants learned the value of stimuli faster when the reward-predictive feature changed slowly and the irrelevant feature changed quickly, compared to when the opposite was the case. After learning, participants could generalise the learned values to new stimuli equally well in both conditions. By comparing models with different structures for the learning rates, we showed that participants adjusted their learning to the speed of the features. Specifically the learning rates for the relevant features mediated the behavioural effect, suggesting that the observed behavioural differences between conditions were being driven by increased learning from the slow feature and decreased learning from the fast feature. Our study extends research on the slowness prior to humans and suggests that it aids learning task states, in a reinforcement learning domain. Our work relates to a broader discussion of how the human brain solves representation learning problems [27, 30]. Previous work has shown how representation learning can be implemented in parallel to reinforcement learning by using feedback signals to guide selective attention [57, 58], or through replay mechanisms during offline periods [59, 60]. Although these approaches represent flexible mechanisms that allow on-the-fly adaptation to the current environment, it is unlikely to be feasible in environments with hundreds of possible signals to attend to [3, 6, 29]. Our results suggest that for this reason representation learning mechanisms during RL are supplemented with inductive biases

. Based on our behavioural findings above, all considered models sought to ( a ) reflect participants’ learning from outcomes, ( b ) account for learning about which stimulus feature is relevant and which is not, ( c ) incorporate generalisation between stimuli of similar appearance, and ( d ) reflect participant’s tendency to explore by accepting many stimuli when uncertainty is high. Our major aim was to test whether the learning process differed depending on whether participants learned about slow or fast-changing features, i. e. in slow vs fast blocks. To this end, we formulated a set of four models that embodied alternative hypotheses about how feature speed could affect learning, as described below ( see Fig 4 ). All models used linear function approximation and a Kalman filter to account for participants’ generalisation and exploration behaviour, respectively ( see Fig 4 and Methods ). Briefly, each stimulus was converted into a 30-dimensional feature vector xt that indicated which colour and shape stimulus on trial t had ( one entry for each of the 15 possible shapes and 15 colours ). To reflect feature similarity across the circular stimulus space, a von-Mises distribution was centered around the true stimulus features, such that activation of node i was determined by its distance from the node assigned to the true feature t: x t, i = e c o s ( d t, i ) κ ∑ i = 1 360 e c o s ( d t, i ) κ ( 1 ) where dt, i is the distance between node i and t in radians and κ determines the width ( a. k. a. concentration ) of the von-Mises distribution

. Despite its simplicity, the task itself posed a considerable challenge to participants, as indicated by their end-of-learning performance, which still left room for improvement. Consequently, the task contained the necessary elements to test our hypothesis and provides a controlled test bed for looking at dimensionality reduction. Our winning model, the four learning rate model, assigned learning rates to the features based on their speed and relevance from the first learning trial of the block. While it is reasonable to assume that participants in experiment 2 and the replication knew the speed of the features based on the preceding observation phase, they could not yet have known which feature was relevant. The models gradually learn the feature relevance through the feature weights, but the structure of the learning rates anticipates the outcome of this learning process. Nonetheless, the fact that a model with this assumption fits best and participants’ accuracy increased within the first learning trials in a block, lead us to believe that participants quickly developed a sense for the relevance of the features. We chose this approach for its computational simplicity, but it remains a potential avenue for future research to set up models which do not assign relevant and irrelevant learning rates a priori, but infer these assignments through learning. It is for instance possible that the dynamics of learning rates are influenced by a number of additional factors, such as volatility or the size of prediction errors [69–71]. In addition, participants might learn a belief about which feature is relevant to determine learning rates [72]. Overall, the results of our experiments suggest that participants were able to learn the values of stimuli better when the relevant feature changed slowly

A remarkable amount of information is reaching our senses at any given time, yet often only a small subset of it is relevant to our current goal. Determining which aspects of our environment are relevant is therefore a crucial challenge for learning goal-directed behaviour. But addressing this challenge is hard. The space of possibilities is often too large to be explored fully within the time limits we need to consider, and yet limiting attention to only a subset of features risks ignoring relevant information [1, 2]. One approach to this problem is to not learn every problem anew, but instead use knowledge of properties that have been relevant in the past as a starting point, in the form of so-called priors, also known as inductive biases [3–7]. Here, we study the role of one such prior in human learning, namely a bias to focus learning on slowly changing features in our environments, and their potential association to rewards. Analogous to the concept of a ‘prior’ in Bayesian statistics, priors are pre-existing beliefs about the underlying structure of an environment, based on generalised past experiences or evolutionary transmission [3, 8]. Previous research has shown that priors can expedite the learning process by focusing information processing on what is common across many environments [4, 9, 10]. The resulting decision-making biases are numerous [10–13] and can for instance be observed in the form of adaptive heuristics that reflect constraints on time or resources [14], or in the form of visual illusions that reflect the simplifying assumptions of our visual system, such as that light tends to come from above [15]. Studying useful priors for representation learning is also an active field of development in artificial intelligence [8, 16–18], in particular for reinforcement learning ( RL ), where knowledge about which actions maximise reward and minimise punishment is acquired through a trial-and-error process [19]

. We refer to the feature that predicted reward as the relevant feature and the feature that did not predict reward as the irrelevant feature ( Fig 1B ). For each block one position in the relevant feature space was chosen as the maximum reward position. Maximum reward positions were at 10°, 100°, 190°, or 280° in the feature space. Each of these reward positions was used once for colour-relevant and once for shape-relevant blocks, in random order. The closer the relevant stimulus feature was to the maximum reward position, the higher the stimulus reward. The stimulus reward was calculated as the absolute distance between the relevant feature position and the maximum reward position, subtracted from the maximum possible distance of 180°. The resulting value was re-scaled from the angular distance range ( 0–180° ) to the reward range ( 0–100 coins ). We manipulated feature speed, by controlling the trial-to-trial variability of the two features. Within each block, one feature had low variability across trials ( e. g. participants see relatively similar shapes from trial to trial ), while the other feature had high variability ( e. g. participants see relatively distinct colours from trial to trial ). We refer to these as the slow and fast feature, respectively ( Fig 1A ). The slow feature was sampled using a Gaussian random walk centred on 0°, with a standard deviation of 30°. The fast feature was sampled randomly, while preventing the smallest step-size ( 24° ) from occurring. Within each block, the 15 feature positions ( see Materials ) repeated three times, resulting in a total of 45 trials per block. Participants were instructed to learn the value of the stimuli by trial-and-trial, with the goal to maximise the total reward over the block. After each block, participants could generalise the learned values to a new stimuli with the same features, but different positions ( see Fig 1C ). We tested two experiments, one preregistered, with a total of 295 participants. In the first experiment, we found that participants accrued more reward when the slow feature was relevant and the fast feature irrelevant, compared to the opposite. In the second experiment, we found no difference in generalisation between the two conditions. We modelled the learning with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models and found that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature and adjusted their learning to the relevance and speed of the feature. The larger the improvement participants’ performance for slow compared to fast, the more they adjusted their learning rates. Our results provide evidence that human learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach learning 

The final answer is: 

The study investigated whether humans rely on a prior knowledge of common properties of reward-predict features to address the challenge of identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments. One such property is the rate of change of features, that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. The study found that humans learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast. Participants accrued more reward when a bandit's relevant feature changed slowly and its feature quickly, compared to the opposite. The results provide evidence that human learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach learning. The study extends research on slown prior humans and suggests it aids learning states in a reinforcement domain. The work relates to broader discussion on how the brain solves learning problems.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Patients with ER-negative breast cancer have the worst prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes, often experiencing rapid recurrence or progression to metastatic disease shortly after diagnosis. Given that metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in most solid tumors, understanding metastatic biology is crucial for effective intervention. Using a mouse systems genetics approach, we previously identified 12 genes associated with metastatic susceptibility. Here, we extend those studies to identify Resf1, a poorly characterized gene, as a novel metastasis susceptibility gene in ER- breast cancer. Resf1 is a large, unstructured protein with an evolutionarily conserved intron-exon structure, but with poor amino acid conservation. CRISPR or gene trap mouse models crossed to the Polyoma Middle-T antigen genetically engineered mouse model ( MMTV-PyMT ) demonstrated that reduction of Resf1 resulted in a significant increase in tumor growth, a shortened overall survival time, and increased incidence and number of lung metastases, consistent with patient data. Furthermore, an analysis of matched tail and primary tissues revealed loss of the wildtype copy in tumor tissue, consistent with Resf1 being a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis revealed a potential role of Resf1 in transcriptional control through association with compound G4 quadruplexes in expressed sequences, particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis. These results suggest that loss of Resf1 enhances tumor progression in ER- breast cancer through multiple alterations in both transcriptional and translational control.

    Among breast cancer subtypes, the ER- subtype, which comprises about 15% of all cases, is associated with the most unfavorable outcomes [1]. Patients with this subtype experience relapse and progression to metastatic disease, typically within the first few years following the diagnosis of the primary tumor. In contrast to the more prevalent Luminal or HER2-amplified tumors, there are currently no available targeted therapies for ER- breast cancer [32]. This limitation confines the treatment options for these patients to standard chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy [32]. Consequently, further investigations into the advanced stages of ER- breast cancer, particularly its progression to overt metastatic disease, is essential to pinpoint potential targets to reduce the mortality associated with this breast cancer subtype. Here, we have exploited the genomes of two different strains of mice that exhibit significantly different tumor phenotypes[8] to identify and characterize RESF1 as a novel tumor suppressor for ER- breast cancer. Previous genetic analysis of an [FVB/NJ ( MOLF/EiJ x PyMT ) ]N2 backcross mapping population revealed an association of 5 genes whose expression correlated with the metastatic burden on the distal end of mouse chromosome 6. Subsequent analysis validated the nearby circadian rhythm gene, Arntl2 [8], as a bona fide metastasis susceptibility gene. In this study, Resf1 was selected for analysis because it was significantly associated with metastatic disease after quantitative trait locus analysis and is located near the maximum of the genetic susceptibility association peak. Unpublished studies have not supported the candidate gene, Etfbkmt, as a metastasis-associated factor. The remaining 2 candidate genes in the genetically defined region, Fgfr1op2, and Slco1a5, have not yet been evaluated for their role in metastatic disease

. As described above, Resf1 is a poorly characterized gene, producing a 1521 amino acid product that is encoded primarily by a single exon. The gene and the intron-exon structure are conserved across species; however, the primary amino acid sequence shows substantially more sequence divergence between species than the average gene ( 44% identities compared to an average of ~85% for mouse versus human ). In addition, RESF1 contains only a single large protein domain of unknown function, and structural algorithms suggest the protein is highly unstructured. Since disordered protein domains are thought to be stabilized by post-translational modifications or interactions with binding partners [33] [34], RESF1’s secondary or tertiary structure may be more critical to protein function than the primary sequence. Further analysis will be required to investigate the validity of this hypothesis. Unexpectedly, attempts to validate Resf1 specifically as a metastasis susceptibility gene revealed conflicting results. Expression analysis in the human breast cancer METABRIC data set and in the autochthonous PyMT x MOLF/EiJ backcross tumor samples indicated that lower expression of Resf1 was associated with worse outcomes. This interpretation was supported by the experimental cross between the Resf1 gene trap and the PyMT mouse, where animals with reduced Resf1 expression had higher incidence of metastatic disease and increased numbers of pulmonary metastases. The orthotopic allograft spontaneous metastasis assays in multiple cell lines from two different species, however, suggested that decreased Resf1 was associated with suppression of metastatic disease. Because this gene-trap animal has not been extensively characterized and single-gene tumor expression studies can be confounded by amplifications or deletions that include additional genes that might influence the phenotype, we incorporated a second CRISPR-mediated Resf1 KO animal into the study

. Intriguingly, our RNA-seq data suggest potential opposing roles at different sites, with higher Resf1 expression levels in metastases compared to primary tumors in FVB/PyMT mice. These opposing roles at the primary and secondary sites are similar to what is seen for TGFβ, which can be either a tumor suppressor or metastasis-enhancing molecule [37]. The association of RESF1 with cardiovascular disease was identified in an exome-wide association study of 1, 482 patients with cardiovascular disease and 5, 774 healthy controls. Neither study, however, included any mechanistic analysis of this gene, so the potential overlap of these phenotypes with a role in breast cancer metastasis is currently unknown. Protein structure and domain homology analysis, protein-protein interaction, and cellular localization studies are often employed to elucidate protein function. However, existing data for RESF1 are either unavailable or conflicting. For example, previous studies [28, 29] reported that RESF1 localizes to the nucleus. In contrast, the Human Protein Atlas Project generated antibodies from two non-overlapping antigens that, when used for immunofluorescent staining, detect RESF1 primarily in the nucleolus. Here, we performed transient transfections to express epitope-tagged RESF1 in HEK293 cells and detected RESF1 in the nucleoplasm. Since transient transfections can nonspecifically target other compartments in the cell, attempts were made to stably transduce Resf1 constructs into six different mouse mammary tumor cell lines. Evidence of stable transduction was observed in only one cell line, at a level insufficiently low for further molecular analyses ( S12A and S12B Fig ), suggesting there is an upper limit for RESF1 for cell viability in tissue culture conditions

. By breeding this model to a variety of inbred strains of mice to mimic human population diversity, we previously demonstrated that genetic backgrounds significantly influence the ability to progress to metastatic disease [7]. Subsequent mapping crosses, coupled with various “-omic” technologies, revealed polymorphic candidate genes associated with metastatic progression. In one cross involving the Japanese-derived MOLF/EiJ mouse strain, five genes on the distal end of mouse chromosome 6 were implicated in the progression of ER-negative ( ER- ) breast cancer, including the circadian rhythm transcription factor Arntl2 [8]. In this study, we expand upon these previous findings and provide evidence that an additional gene within this interval, Retroviral silencing factor 1 ( Resf1 ), is a potential tumor suppressor and metastasis modifier in ER-negative breast cancer.

. This model was generated by lentiviral gene trap construct integration into the first exon of Resf1, resulting in the expression of an EGFP-cre fusion and the truncation of the Resf1 message ( www. mmrrc. org/catalog/sds. php? mmrrc_id=34574 ). qRT-PCR analysis of mammary tumor tissue from wildtype and gene trap x FVB/MMTV-PyMT littermates confirmed a reduction of Resf1 mRNA ( Fig 3A ). Tumor weight and lung metastases of the gene trap x PyMT F1 mice were collected and assessed at the humane endpoint. The Resf1 gene trap mice developed significantly larger primary tumors and significantly more lung metastases than wildtype littermate control mice, even when normalizing metastasis counts to account for the larger tumors ( Fig 3B–3D ). Furthermore, the incidence of metastases in the gene trap mice was significantly higher than in the control mice ( 67% vs. 36%, p = 0. 05, Fisher’s exact test; Fig 3E ), consistent with the poor survival observed in human patients with lower RESF1 expression. The role of RESF1 in metastatic disease was further explored by using orthotopic transplants for spontaneous metastasis assays. We attempted to generate cell lines with stable Resf1 overexpression but were unsuccessful, suggesting that there is a threshold beyond which Resf1 expression negatively impacts cell viability. Therefore, subsequent efforts focused on shRNA-mediated knockdown ( KD ) of Resf1. Resf1 was knocked down via stable shRNA transduction of 4 constructs into 6DT1 and Mvt1, both mouse cell lines syngeneic to FVB/NJ [13] ( Fig 4A and 4E ). Resf1 KD was confirmed by qRT-PCR ( Fig 4B ) and western blot ( Fig 4C ) in both cell lines. Orthotopic transplants of the KD cells resulted in increased metastases compared to controls ( Fig 4D and 4 ), consistent with the hypothesis that Res1 acts as a metastasis suppressor in ER- breast cancer.

    Title: 
    Abstract: During meiosis, programmed DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) are formed by the topoisomerase-like enzyme, Spo11, activating the DNA damage response ( DDR ) kinase Mec1ATR via the checkpoint clamp loader, Rad24RAD17. At single loci, loss of Mec1 and Rad24 activity alters DSB formation and recombination outcome, but their genome-wide roles have not been examined in detail. Here, we utilise two strategies—deletion of the mismatch repair protein, Msh2, and control of meiotic prophase length via regulation of the Ndt80 transcription factor—to help characterise the roles Mec1 and Rad24 play in meiotic recombination by enabling genome-wide mapping of meiotic progeny. In line with previous studies, we observe severely impacted spore viability and a reduction in the frequency of recombination upon deletion of RAD24—driven by a shortened prophase. By contrast, loss of Mec1 function increases recombination frequency, consistent with its role in DSB trans-interference, and has less effect on spore viability. Despite these differences, complex multi-chromatid events initiated by closely spaced DSBs—rare in wild-type cells—occur more frequently in the absence of either Rad24 or Mec1, suggesting a loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation in both. Mec1 and Rad24 also have important roles in the spatial regulation of crossovers ( COs ). Upon loss of either Mec1 or Rad24, CO distributions become more random—suggesting reductions in the global manifestation of interference. Such effects are similar to, but less extreme than, the phenotype of ‘ZMM’ mutants such as zip3Δ, and may be driven by reductions in the proportion of interfering COs. Collectively, in addition to shared roles in CO regulation, our results highlight separable roles for Rad24 as a pro-CO factor, and for Mec1 as a regulator of recombination frequency, the loss of which helps to suppress any broader defects in CO regulation caused by abrogation of the DDR.

    Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that produces haploid cells for sexual reproduction. Integral to meiosis is the process of genetic recombination, which is initiated by programmed DNA double-strand breaks catalysed by the topoisomerase II-like enzyme, Spo11 [1]. Meiotic recombination is monitored by the DNA damage response ( DDR ) in a similar manner to DNA lesions arising within vegetative cells, likely due to the potentially dangerous nature of DSBs. In the generalised pathway, DNA damage leads to the activation of Tel1ATM ( Ataxia Telangiectasia-Mutated ) and Mec1ATR ( Rad3-related ) checkpoint kinases ( Human orthologues are indicated with superscript text ), via the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2NBS1-complex and Rad24RAD17 ( reviewed in [2] ). Rad24RAD17 is the loader of the Ddc1RAD9-Rad17RAD1-Mec3HUS1 ( “9-1-1” ) checkpoint clamp, that binds to the ssDNA/dsDNA junctions that arise following resection of DNA ends [3]. Tel1ATM and Mec1ATR modulate downstream targets via Rad53CHK2 [4], causing cell cycle arrest and the modulation of transcription [5]. Notably, in mammalian cells, RAD17 and ATR have both overlapping and distinct functions in the DDR. RAD17 is required for the recruitment of RAD9 after DNA damage, a function that it performs even in the absence of ATR [6]. Conversely, ATR can localize to sites of DNA damage independently of RAD17, and can also be activated by other factors such as RPA-coated ssDNA [7], suggesting separable and complementary roles for ATR and RAD17. In meiosis, Spo11-DSBs initiate homologous recombination and are therefore essential for the generation of crossovers ( COs ) between homologous chromosomes. In most organisms, including mammals and S

We report here the impact that loss of the DNA damage response proteins Mec1 and Rad24 has on many aspects of meiotic recombination ( Fig 9 ). Rad24 is known to be important for activating Mec1 via its role in loading the 9-1-1 clamp in response to ssDNA produced by the resection of DSBs [2]. Thus, as examined here, it is not surprising that in some aspects of meiotic recombination the effects of rad24Δ are similar to those of mec1-mn. For example, both Mec1 and Rad24 limit total recombination frequency ( Fig 2B–2D ), and prevent the formation of multi-DSB events ( Fig 4 ) —supporting the prevailing view that the Mec1 pathway mediates DSB interference in trans [32]. The more extreme phenotype of mec1-mn is likely explained by the fact that Rad24 is not the only activator of Mec1 [7, 82–84]. However, in many other cases the phenotypes of mec1-mn and rad24Δ are less similar, indicating separable roles for the two proteins. For example, the rad24Δ mutant is more dependent upon extension of prophase length to maintain high levels of recombination ( Fig 2B–2D ) and spore viability ( Fig 1C ) than mec1-mn. In general, the patches of genetic change arising per recombination event ( event length ) were also larger upon RAD24 deletion than in the mec1-mn strains ( Fig 5D–5G ), perhaps in part due to small differences in the extent of hyper-resection observed in these two strains [16]. Indeed, Rad24 may enact its role in regulating resection distance by loading the 9-1-1 clamp, which may act as a barrier or inhibitor to resection [85]. Alternatively or additionally, the effect on resection may be because Rad24 and Rad17 are involved in activating Mec1, which may then prevent resection by deactivation of Exo1 [86]. In vegetative cells, the 9-1-1 complex inhibits resection by promoting the recruitment of Rad9 near DSBs [87]; however, this may not be the case for meiotic DSBs, because Rad9 is not required for checkpoint activation in meiosis [10]

. In plants, both RAD1 and HUS1 promote accurate DSB repair during meiosis, in particular suppressing nonhomologous end-joining [100] and ZMM-independent CO formation between heterologues [101]. Due to the interplay between various aspects of meiotic recombination regulation, it is somewhat difficult to ascertain which, if any, of these defects are distinct from a generalised abrogation of ATR function. By contrast, building on the work of Shinohara et al [37, 38], our results highlight separable roles for Rad24 as a pro-CO factor, and for Mec1 as a regulator of recombination frequency—functions that are clearly specialised for the meiotic system. Moreover, given the essential role that COs play in chromosome segregation and fertility in most sexually reproducing organisms, it will be of great interest to clarify whether the DDR checkpoint clamp and/or loader play similar roles across other species as they do in S. cerevisiae.

. In most organisms, including mammals and S. cerevisiae, the organism utilised in the work presented here, such recombination-dependent interactions facilitate homologue pairing during leptotene-zygotene, full alignment and connection via the synaptonemal complex at pachytene, and subsequent reductional chromosome segregation at the meiosis I nuclear division [8]. In S. cerevisiae meiosis, similar to the vegetative DDR pathway, the 9-1-1 clamp complex, its loader Rad24, and the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex act as damage sensors [9], with ssDNA, produced by the resection of Spo11-DSBs, activating Mec1 [10]. By sensing ongoing recombination activity and unrepaired DSBs [10, 11], Mec1 acts as a molecular rheostat to modulate the progression of meiotic prophase via the Mek1 kinase, a paralogue of Rad53 ( CHK2 in mammals ) that regulates the activity of Ndt80 [12, 13], the transcription factor required for exit from meiotic prophase [14, 15]. Due to this transient checkpoint activation, Mec1 is able to prolong the stage during which Spo11-DSB formation can occur [12, 13, 16], and both Mec1 and Rad24 promote CO formation and suppress ectopic ( non-allelic ) recombination [17–19]. The interaction between Mec1 and the 9-1-1 complex also contributes to other Mec1 functions such as phosphorylation of the meiosis-specific chromosome axis protein, Hop1 ( HORMAD1/2 in mammals [20] ), which is important for the maintenance of homologue bias and chiasma formation [21, 22]. In mammals, ATR localises to meiotic chromosomes [23] and is a key regulator of meiotic events. ATR deletion in male mice causes fragmentation of the chromosome axis, and ATR is required for synapsis and loading of recombinases RAD51 and DMC1 [24, 25].

    Title: 
    Abstract: Establishing suitable in vitro culture conditions for microorganisms is crucial for dissecting their biology and empowering potential applications. However, a significant number of bacterial and fungal species, including Pneumocystis jirovecii, remain unculturable, hampering research efforts. P. jirovecii is a deadly pathogen of humans that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients. Despite the major impact of Pneumocystis on human health, limited progress has been made in dissecting the pathobiology of this fungus. This is largely due to the fact that its experimental dissection has been constrained by the inability to culture the organism in vitro. We present a comprehensive in silico genome-scale metabolic model of Pneumocystis growth and metabolism, to identify metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder growth in vitro. We utilise recently published genome data and available information in the literature as well as bioinformatics and software tools to develop and validate the model. In addition, we employ relaxed Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement Learning approaches to make predictions regarding metabolic fluxes and to identify critical components of the Pneumocystis growth medium. Our findings offer insights into the biology of Pneumocystis and provide a novel strategy to overcome the longstanding challenge of culturing this pathogen in vitro.

   . To identify metabolic requirements and imbalances that prevent the growth of this major fungal pathogen in vitro, we have developed, for the first time, a comprehensive in silico genome-scale metabolic model ( GEM ) of Pneumocystis growth and metabolism. Our study focuses on the mouse-specific fungal pathogen, Pneumocystis murina with a view to empowering, in the future, experimental comparisons with growth in murine models of infection. Genomic comparisons suggest only minor metabolic differences between P. murina and the human and rat pathogens, P. jirovecii and P. carinii [20]. GEMs are mathematical representations of an organism’s metabolic reactions based on genome annotation data and experimentally obtained information [21, 22]. GEMs are often used in combination with Flux Balance Analysis ( FBA ) [23], which is a computational method to predict metabolic fluxes across the network to achieve a certain optimisation objective. Potential objectives include maximising growth or reducing resource consumption. This powerful approach has been successfully applied to metabolic engineering, strain development, drug discovery, enzyme functional predictions, phenotypic characterisations, interspecies interactions modelling and the understanding of human diseases [24–26]. Furthermore, metabolic modelling has been used to design and optimise the composition of culture media. For instance, GEMs have been successfully applied to formulate in vitro growth media for bacteria such as Lactobacillus plantarum [27] and Bacteroides caccae [28]. In addition, GEMs have been used to design minimal growth media for the lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis [29], a potentially beneficial gut microbe Faecalibacterium prausnitzii [30], and for the human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus [31], Neisseria meningitidis [32], and Helicobacter pylori [33]

We have developed, for the first time, a genome-scale metabolic model for Pneumocystis. In order to do so, we reviewed and improved the current Pneumocystis genome annotation by incorporating relevant information from the literature and utilising established bioinformatics tools and then organised this information into a well-defined GEM network. We used literature assumptions and available software tools to generate a biomass equation and validated our metabolic model by utilising in vitro growth culture medium conditions proposed by Merali et al [16]. By employing a relaxed Flux Balance Analysis ( FBA ) approach, we calculated biomass flux values to confirm that our metabolic model is a powerful tool to investigate biological questions that cannot be fully explored through conventional bioinformatics and experimental approaches. Moreover, using the model, we made novel predictions regarding Pneumocystis growth and metabolism. In particular, we analysed Merali’s growth medium and identified its critical components as well as suggested how to supplement it to enhance Pneumocystis growth. We have also demonstrated that our model can replicate drop-off and gene knockout experiments, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool in the development of new antifungal drug targets. Specifically, our model can be used to predict the likely impact of inhibiting specific metabolic targets upon fungal growth. Finally, by employing a Reinforcement Learning approach, we propose how to simplify Merali’s medium to achieve a minimal growth culture medium. Reconstructing metabolic networks can be a challenging process for organisms with incomplete genome annotations, low sequence homology to other organisms and/or unique pathways [78]. As a result, incomplete reconstructions may occur and the quality of the constraints used to build the model may be compromised, which limits the efficacy and precision of the FBA approach [79, 80]

. The remarkable nature of Pneumocystis, with its extremely reduced genome and dependence on the host for both nutrients and a stable environment [47], requires special attention in the model development process. Since the pathogen possesses certain nutrients transporters and retains an endocytosis pathway, it has the potential to scavenge nutrients from the host [20]. This implies that the metabolic network of Pneumocystis may exhibit genuine gaps that reflect the pathogen’s reliance on its host. These gaps should not be filled automatically during the reconstruction process, as this could lead to inaccurate predictions. The FBA approach, however, can be used to predict how these “actual” metabolic gaps may be complemented to promote the growth of the fungus in vitro. In addition to the supplementation of nutritional requirements that have been predicted bioinformatically, some of which have been tested already [19], FBA is capable of predicting how nutrient supplementation might be applied to address metabolic imbalances created, for example by loss of energetic or redox homeostasis. This will help to identify the growth phenotypes of Pneumocystis under specified media conditions and suggest ways to supplement the nutrient requirements of the pathogen. The FBA approach, although well-established, has limitations [81]. For example, it cannot predict nutrient concentrations, since it does not incorporate kinetic parameters. Additionally, in its classical form, FBA is only applicable to determine fluxes at a steady state. Moreover, FBA does not take account of regulatory effects such as enzyme activation by protein kinases or gene regulation, nor does it consider stress response or signalling pathways, and so its predictions may not always be accurate. To improve the accuracy of FBA predictions, the integration of regulatory and signalling network information into the metabolic model is likely to be useful

. In recent years, the development of GEMs for fungi has significantly advanced our understanding of fungal metabolism and its application in various biotechnological and medical fields. Key examples include GEMs for filamentous fungi [34], industrially important fungi [35], anaerobic gut fungi [36], human pathogens [37, 38] and yeasts [39–41]. In this paper we describe the development of a GEM reconstruction for Pneumocystis metabolism. We review and refine the current Pneumocystis genome annotation using available information in the literature together with well-established bioinformatics tools, and then organise these data into a well-defined GEM network. We then use literature-based assumptions and available software tools to describe a process of biomass production by defining a biomass equation. To validate the model, we utilise in vitro growth culture medium conditions designed by Merali et al [16], which have been reported to support Pneumocystis growth. By extending this with relaxed Flux Balance Analysis ( FBA ), we show how the model can be used to make important predictions regarding metabolic flux to identify critical components of the Pneumocystis growth medium. Finally, we propose how to optimise Merali’s culture medium composition by using a Reinforcement Learning approach.

To develop a metabolic model for Pneumocystis, we followed a well-established protocol for generating a high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction proposed by Thiele and Palsson [22]. The procedure generally consists of the following key steps. Firstly, a draft reconstruction is created. Next, a biomass equation is defined. Finally, the reconstruction is translated into a mathematical format, and the resulting model is verified, evaluated and validated using published information about the organism’s phenotypes under various environmental conditions. A schematic representation of this process is shown in Fig 1A. To generate a high-quality draft reconstruction for Pneumocystis, we used the most recent version of the genomic sequence [20]. In order to gain a more accurate picture of the metabolites and nutrient transport functions in Pneumocystis, we reviewed these data and, where necessary, refined them using available information in the literature including recently published RNA-Seq data [42] ( see Materials and Methods ). Finally, to achieve the most accurate results possible, we performed re-evaluation and manual curation of the entire draft reconstruction and the associated network content. We then used the brick GENA ( Genome-Based Network Analysis ) of Constellab platform ( see Materials and Methods ) to organise these data into a well-defined genome-scale metabolic network for Pneumocystis using CHEBI [43], BRENDA [44], and RHEA [45] databases to define gene-protein-reaction associations. The schematic representation of the draft reconstruction process is shown in Fig 1B. To define a biomass equation for Pneumystis, we used literature-based assumptions and available tools to formulate a biomass equation. This was validated using the in vitro culture medium proposed by Meral et al [16], which has been reported to support Pneumyst growth. By employing a relaxed Flux Balance ( F ) approach, we calculated biomass values to confirm that our model is a powerful tool to investigate biological questions that cannot be fully explored through conventional bioinformatics and experimental approaches. Moreover, using the model, we made predictions regarding Pneumyst growth and metabolism. In particular, we analysed Meral’s medium and identified critical components as well as suggested how to supplement it to enhance Pneumyst growth. We also demonstrated that our model can replicate drop and knockout experiments, highlighting its potential in the development of new antifungal targets. Specifically, our model can predict the impact of inhibiting metabolic targets upon growth. By employing a Reinforcement approach, we propose to simplify Meral’s medium to achieve a minimal culture medium.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) /transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif ( TAZ ) induces cell proliferation through nuclear localization at low cell density. Conversely, at extremely high cell density, the Hippo pathway, which regulates YAP/TAZ, is activated. This activation leads to the translocation of YAP/TAZ into the cytoplasm, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Various cancer cells have several times more YAP/TAZ than normal cells. However, it is not entirely clear whether this several-fold increase in YAP/TAZ alone is sufficient to overcome proliferation inhibition ( contact inhibition ) under high-density conditions, thereby allowing continuous proliferation. In this study, we construct a three-dimensional ( 3D ) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway. Herein, a significant innovation in our approach is the introduction of a novel modeling component that inputs cell density, which reflects cell dynamics, into the Hippo pathway and enables the simulation of cell proliferation as the output response. We assume such 3D model with cell-cell interactions by solving reaction and molecular dynamics ( MD ) equations by applying adhesion and repulsive forces that act between cells and frictional forces acting on each cell. We assume Lennard-Jones ( 12-6 ) potential with a softcore character so that each cell secures its exclusive domain. We set cell cycles composed of mitotic and cell growth phases in which cells divide and grow under the influence of cell kinetics. We perform mathematical simulations at various YAP/TAZ levels to investigate the extent of YAP/TAZ increase required for sustained proliferation at high density. The results show that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels of cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells, enabling cells to continue proliferating even under high-density conditions. Finally, this mathematical model, which incorporates cell-cell interactions and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway, may be applicable for evaluating cancer malignancy based on YAP/TAZ levels, developing drugs to suppress the abnormal proliferation of cancer cells, and determining appropriate drug dosages. The source codes are freely available.

    In this study, we performed 3D multicellular simulations combining MD methods with reaction network models of the Hippo pathway, which is known to regulate cell proliferation by inhibiting YAP/TAZ activity. Our approach effectively simulated cell division and growth, preventing cell overlap by assigning exclusive domains to each cell with LJ ( 12–6 ) potential with a softcore character, and integrating cell cycle dynamics, particularly the M and G1 phases. We introduced a novel modeling component that inputs cell density, reflecting cell dynamics, into the Hippo pathway simulation. This innovation allowed us to simulate cell proliferation as an output response, providing a more detailed and dynamic representation of how intracellular signaling modulates cell division decisions. To investigate whether the elevated levels of YAP/TAZ observed in cancer tissues are sufficient to sustain chronic proliferation, we developed models representing time evolutions of normal and cancerous tissues. Our 3D simulations revealed that while normal tissues exhibited cell cycle arrest and suppression of exponential growth, cancer tissues with YAP/TAZ levels twice as high demonstrated continuous exponential proliferation. These findings suggest that increased YAP/TAZ alone can bypass contact inhibition under high-density conditions, contributing to unchecked proliferation in cancer cells. Our model’s integration of cell dynamics and intra-cellular dynamics could position it as a tool for evaluating cancer malignancy, exploring therapeutic interventions targeting YAP/TAZ, and optimizing drug dosages.

We explored the effects of increased YAP/TAZ levels on cell proliferation in cancer cells. YAP/TAZ play a role in the cell nucleus and are restrained by the activated Hippo pathway under high-density conditions, causing them to be retained in the cytoplasm and ultimately stopping cell growth. Many cancer cells have significantly higher YAP/TAZ expression compared to normal cells [12, 22, 23]. However, it remains uncertain whether this increase in YAP/TAZ expression can override the inhibitory effect of the Hippo pathway and maintain cell growth. We developed a computational model using MD simulations to investigate this type of chronic proliferation maintenance. This model mimics cell interactions driven by external factors such as adhesion, repulsion, and friction. This study focuses on a model that integrates cell dynamics, which affect cell density, and intra-cellular dynamics, which influence YAP/TAZ levels. Our goal was to understand how increased YAP/TAZ levels in cancer cells affect their proliferation under high-density conditions. Using this model, we monitored the changes in nuclear YAP levels ( X2i ) over time in normal tissues. After 100 h, the minimum X2i fell below the threshold ( Xth ) required for nuclear YAP levels to support proliferation. Additionally, in normal tissues, we observed exponential cell proliferation for 100 tens of hours, followed by cell cycle arrest in the central region of the cell population ( Fig 5A and 5B ), reducing exponential growth ( Fig 6 ). In contrast, in cancer tissues, despite a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ expression compared to normal tissues, cell cycle arrest was rarely observed in the central region ( high-density conditions ) of the cell population ( Fig 5C and 5D ). Instead, exponential cell proliferation continued for up to 200 h ( Fig 6 ). Fig 7 shows time evolutions of the total number of multi-cells of cancer and normal tissues with ( X 1 0, X 2 0 ) = ( 0. 1, 0

. Some methods use cell elasticity and adhesion [25], and potential forces with arguments such as exponential functions [26, 27] to model cell-cell interactions. Previous studies on cells using MD methods includes cases without proliferations [28], reactions and diffusions [29], dynamics of two-species particle systems [30], mitotic cone formations [31], multiparticle collisions in aqueous solutions [32], and 3D models with cell growths and divisions in the context of tumor invasions [25]. However, these studies often did not directly address the intricate molecular signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and their interactions with mechanical forces at the multicellular level. Additionally, previous models did not incorporate the dynamic feedback mechanisms of the Hippo pathway on cell proliferation and survival, especially under high cell density conditions. This study investigated whether an increase in YAP/TAZ levels is sufficient to induce sustained chronic cancer proliferation. We conducted cell proliferation simulations using a 3D model that considered cell proliferation and cell-cell interactions to achieve such investigations based on reaction networks representing normal and cancerous tissues. We combined MD models with a reaction network model of the Hippo pathway, which controls cell proliferation by inhibiting YAP/TAZ. We mimicked normal and cancerous tissues using different initial concentrations of YAP/TAZ molecules. While previous studies used the Lennard-Jones ( LJ ) potential for modeling intermolecular forces in MD methods [33], we used the LJ potential for the adhesion and repulsion of multiple cells, which have softcore characteristics, avoiding sudden increase when the cells are close [34]. Our approach uniquely integrates the Hippo pathway signaling dynamics with cell-cell interactions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the regulation of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis

. In this study, we calculated 3D spatiotemporal patterns of normal and cancerous tissues, including cell survival or cell cycle arrest. We added external factors, such as adhesion, repulsion, and friction, based on kinetic equations to describe the motion of an agent representing each cell. Here, we calculated multicellular time evolutions by solving reaction equations coupled with the MD method, where we built models to incorporate the factors of cell growth and division. Herein, a significant innovation in our approach is the introduction of a novel modeling component that inputs cell density, which reflects cell dynamics, into the Hippo pathway and enables the simulation of cell proliferation as the output response. In addition to the standard MD model, we introduce the cell cycle as a factor to reflect the dynamics of life in this model. We also solved the equations of motion of cells that undergo repeated growth and division and obtained temporal evolutions of the positions of multicellular cells. By integrating the molecular signaling of the Hippo pathway with cell mechanics and cell cycle dynamics, our study offers new insights into the mechanisms driving cancer proliferation and presents a newly and more dynamic model compared to previous research.

The Hippo pathway has recently attracted attention as a molecular target for anticancer drugs and regenerative medicine [1]. This unique pathway senses cell contacts and mechanical stimulation, supports organ size control and cell differentiation, and acts as a potent tumor suppressor gene [1]. The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling cascade that controls organ size and tumorigenesis [2–4]. In mammals, the Hippo pathway involves two kinases: MST1/2 and LATS1/2. Under low-density conditions, MST1/2 and LATS1/2 remain inactive, allowing co-activators Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif ( TAZ ) to interact with transcription factors, such as TEAD1-4, in the nucleus, thereby inducing the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. In contrast, MST1/2 is activated first under high-density conditions, leading to the phosphorylation of LATS1/2, which in turn phosphorylates Y/TA. Phosphorylated Y/TA is translocated to the cytoplasm, where it is retained by 14-3-3-3 proteins, inhibiting its interaction with TEAD-4 and preventing the transcription of pro-proliferative genes. In cancer cells, the Hipp pathway is often dysregulated, leading to increased Y/TA levels and uncontrolled proliferation [5, 6]. However, it is unclear whether increased Y/TA alone is sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effect of the Hipp pathway under high-density conditions, enabling continuous proliferation. Our study aimed to investigate this using a 3D model of cell incorporating the Hipp-Y/TA pathway and cell-cell interactions. We found that a twofold increase in Y/TA levels in cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells, enabling them to proliferate under high-density conditions. This model may be useful for evaluating cancer malignancy based on Y/TA levels, developing drugs to suppress abnormal proliferation, and determining drug dosages.
Researchers have developed a new framework, called the Free Landscape of Stickers (FELS), to study the role of low-complex domains (LCD) in biomolecules in phase separation and material properties. The framework uses a continuous "stickiness" energy scale, rather than an explicit sequence alphabet, to understand how LCD sequences govern condens dynamics and material properties. By varying the complexity of sequences, researchers found that periodic patterns promote elasticity, while random sequences exhibit viscosity. Minimum periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condens, avoiding transitions to glass or solid states. The energy framework explains recent findings on prion domains and predicts alterations in condens viscoelasticity. The study provides a unifying perspective on sequence-encoded properties, where features of landscapes are conserved while sequences are variable. Using FELS, researchers can dissect the complexity of LCD, quantified by periodicity and disorder, impacting dynamics and material properties of condens. By employing Wasserstein distance, sequences are varied from periodic to random, demonstrating that a handful of energy features capture visco trends in experiments. Periodic LCDs display local structure and inhomogeneities, while random sequences are homogeneous and viscous, with an order of magnitude difference in visc moduli compared to periodic sequences. Phase diagrams and dynamical properties corroborate rheological trends, with periodic elastic and viscosity increasing with periodicity. Structurally, interactions in periodic LCD result in oscillatory decay correlations. Selfan analysis reveals high periodicity drives glassy states.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The development of ectodermal organs begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that progressively invaginates into the underlying mesenchyme as the organ takes its shape. Signaling by secreted molecules is critical for epithelial morphogenesis, but how that information leads to cell rearrangement and tissue shape changes remains an open question. Using the mouse dentition as a model, we first establish that non-muscle myosin II is essential for dental epithelial invagination and show that it functions by promoting cell-cell adhesion and persistent convergent cell movements in the suprabasal layer. Shh signaling controls these processes by inducing myosin II activation via AKT. Pharmacological induction of AKT and myosin II can also rescue defects caused by the inhibition of Shh. Together, our results support a model in which the Shh signal is transmitted through myosin II to power effective cellular rearrangement for proper dental epithelial invagination.

   . As cell-cell connections normally persist between adjacent basal and suprabasal cells during invagination [11], losing such connections at a large scale due to the presence of a cyst could disrupt tissue force transmission in MyoII mutants and further add to the invagination phenotype after E13. 5. In the absence of myosin IIA and IIB, our analysis found that cell-cell adhesion through adherence junctions is disrupted in the invaginating incisor epithelium. While loss of MyoII did not affect the expression of total E-cadherin, it significantly reduced the amount of homophilically bound E-cadherin and membrane-localized β-catenin in the suprabasal layer. The weakened adhesion would then eventually contribute to impaired tissue integrity and the formation of cysts. Our results thus demonstrate the importance of MyoII in maintaining robust cell-cell adhesion in the stratified dental epithelium. This is also consistent with prior findings showing that MyoII-generated cellular forces are essential for the maintenance and the growth of adherence junctions in cultured cells [67, 68], and deletion of myosin IIA and/or IIB results in mislocalized E-cadherin and defective adhesion in mouse embryos [34, 69]. Maintaining adequate intercellular adhesions is also important for collective cell movement, such as during convergent extension [70]. In this context, adhesion provides the anchoring needed to organize actin assembly and actomyosin tension at the tricellular interface, where cell crawling and cell-cell junction shortening are integrated to achieve effective cell intercalation [38]. Similarly in the developing incisor, where we have observed convergent extension cell movement in the suprabasal layer, strong actin accumulation was detected at the tricellular region. However, with reduced adhesion in the E13. 0 Myh9/10epi-cko mutant incisors, tricellular actin also became delocalized and effective cell interaction was compromised

. Future studies will determine the precise role of cell-cell adhesion and the relative contribution by adherence junctions, tight junctions, and desmosomes in regulating cellular rearrangement during these processes. In the mouse molar placode, Shh is required for the narrowing of the dental epithelium at the neck region and for proper invagination [10, 45]. Here, we show that Shh signaling does so in part through promotion of MyoII activity. Inhibition of Shh signaling perturbs both invagination and cell-cell adhesion, which are also observed in MyoII mutant incisors and can be rescued upon forced MyoII activation. Based on these data, we propose that Shh signaling from the initiation knot controls early tooth development by activating MyoII in the tooth bud, which in turn promotes cell-cell adhesion and persistent cell movement to drive convergent extension and invagination of the incisor epithelium. However, as there is a slight, although not statistically significant, reduction in Shh signaling from the Myh9/10epi-cko enamel knot at E14. 5 ( S4O, S4P Fig ), it remains possible that MyoII can modulate or propagate Shh signaling at later stages. While Shh is better known for its role as a morphogen to pattern developing tissues and to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation [72], our results resonate with studies showing that Shh also plays an important role in controlling cell adhesion, cell arrangement, and tissue shape changes during morphogenesis. For instance, Hh signaling is required to maintain strong cell-cell adhesion via cadherins in several epithelial systems, including the larynx epithelium, neuroepithelium, and endothelial cells [73–76]. Hh also functions in several epithelial monolayer models, including the Drosophila eye imaginal disc and the mouse neural fold, to activate actomyosin contractility at the apical surface and promote apical constriction, facilitating epithelial bending and remodeling [77–79]

. In the absence of MyoII, cells moved more randomly, and the epithelium could not efficiently narrow to drive invagination. Finally, we also noticed that as control tooth germs invaginated, suprabasal cells became aligned around the forming enamel knot at E13. 5. However, Myh9/10epi-cko cells are more disorganized and showed reduced coherency in cell orientations ( S7 Fig ). MyoII is therefore critical for organized cellular movement and arrangement during epithelial invagination. We next investigated the upstream signal that activates MyoII activity in the invaginating incisor. Between E12. 5 and E13. 5, Shh is a key signaling molecule expressed in the initiation knot signaling center of the developing tooth, and Hedgehog signaling activity can be readily detected in the entire dental epithelium, as assessed using the expression of its target gene Ptch1 ( Fig 6A ) [42–44]. Importantly, previous studies have shown that deletion of Shh resulted in a shallower tooth germ with a wide neck region [45], and blockade of Shh activity by cyclopamine in cultured explants similarly inhibited molar invagination [10]. The phenotypic resemblance of Shh and Myh9/10epi-cko mutants thus prompted us to hypothesize that Shh functions upstream of MyoII to control tooth invagination. To test this, we treated cultured E12. 5 mandibles with cyclopamine or control vehicle ethanol for 24 hours and then examined phenotypic changes in the incisor epithelium ( Fig 6B ). Inhibition of Hh signaling, as expected, downregulated Ptch1 expression ( S8A, S8B, S8D Fig ), but it also attenuated the levels of pMLC ( Fig 6C–6D’ and 6G ) and active RHOA ( S9A–S9B’, S9D Fig ), a small GTPase that activates MLC through Rho-associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) [16]

. Actomyosin tension transmitted through cell-cell adhesion can then organize cells into specific tissue shapes [17, 18]. MyoII is composed of six subunits: two essential light chains, two regulatory light chains, and two heavy chains. Specifically, three isoforms of MyoII heavy chains are present in mice: IIA, IIB and IIC, which are encoded by Myh9, Myh10, and Myh14, respectively [19, 20]. These three isoforms play both distinct and overlapping functions to regulate cell motility, arrangement, and adhesion during morphogenesis [21–24]. Interestingly, genetic mutations in regulators that function upstream to control actomyosin activity, including GTPase-activating proteins ( GAPs ) and small Rho GTPases, have been recently linked to dental anomalies in humans [25–29]. However, whether MyoII is required in the epithelium to control its invagination and shape is not understood, and how its activity may be integrated with upstream biochemical signals during tooth development is also to be addressed. In this study, we investigate the functional requirement of MyoII in controlling the dynamic cellular organization in the developing mouse incisor bud. By combining explant culture and in vivo genetic studies, we found that MyoII is essential for tooth development and epithelial invagination. It does so by strengthening cell-cell adhesion at adherens junctions and by enabling efficient and persistent convergent cell movement in the suprabasal layer, where cells at the periphery of the tooth bud move towards the midline. Finally, we uncovered that Shh signaling acts through PI3K/AKT to activate MyoII. The Shh-PI3K/AKT-MyoII axis thus promotes proper cell-cell adhesion and cell movement to propel incisor invagination.

. The formation of the enamel knot in the incisor epithelium, as assessed by its marker Shh, was also not affected ( S1E–S1G Fig ). MyoII thus appears to promote tooth invagination without affecting proliferation and the establishment of the enamel knot signaling center. To more concretely test if incisor epithelial invagination depends on the tissue-autonomous function of MyoII within the epithelium or its non-tissue-autonomous role in the mesenchyme, we next turned to explant cultures. In the absence of mesenchymal cells, My9/10i-cko incisors failed to invaginate ( Fig 7A ). However, in the presence of wild-type mesenchyme, My9/10-cko incisors invaginated normally ( Fig 7B ). These results indicate that MyII in the epithelium is not sufficient to drive invagination and that mesenchymal MyII is required for incisor invagination.
Researchers have developed a novel transfer learning-based graph convolutional network, scGCN, to integrate and analyze large-scale single-cell multi-omics data. scGC combines different types of measurements, even when unpaired, and achieves higher accuracy in label transfer and visualization compared to other methods. It captures cell characteristics and provides a holistic view of cell functions and communication. scGC is an end-to-end and hypothesis-free framework for integrating single-cell multiomics with accuracy and robustness. The method combines omics autoencoders with convolution networks and transfer, allowing integration of different omics with different distributions. It models regulatory interactions across om layers, inferring relationships between types even when unpaired. Single-cell technologies have revolutionized studying complex systems at a cellular level, but exponential growth demands leveraging existing datasets for reliable annotations. scGC addresses this by adapting scRNA-se and scAC-se as a domain problem in transfer learning, exploring kernels for adapting representations between embeddings. It accurately transfers cell annotations across datasets, tissues, species, and molecular layers, identifying new subtypes, and reannotating cell in scACq more accurately. scGC is scalable on large datasets, providing insights into biological systems at single-cell level. It can be adapted to other omics, such as protein, histone, and methylation data. GC has advantages over methods, exploring MK-MD-based adaption, propagating information, and capturing complex patterns. It currently focuses on classification, but can be used for trajectory, cell interaction, and time-series analysis.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Proteins with nuclear localization sequences ( NLSs ) are directed into the cell nucleus through interactions between the NLS and importin proteins. NLSs are generally short motifs rich in basic amino acids; however, identifying NLSs can be challenging due to the lack of a universally conserved sequence. In this study, we characterized the sequence specificity of an essential and conserved NLS in Mcm3, a subunit of the replicative DNA helicase. Through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 ( AF3 ) modeling, we demonstrate that the precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mcm3 through optimal interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs the nuclear import of Mcm3, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the MCM complex and poor cell growth. Our results provide a structure-guided framework for predicting and analyzing monopartite NLSs, which, despite lacking a single consensus sequence, retain key characteristics shared between the NLSs of Mcm3 and the SV40 large T antigen.

    AF3 is the latest tool capable of predicting protein-protein interactions [43]. Here, we utilized this tool to model the interaction between importin alpha and Mcm3’s NLS variants. Our analysis demonstrates that the NLSs of Mcm3 and SV40 share similar contacts with Kap60 ( Figs 6A, 6B and S7B ). Specifically, K768 of Mcm3 and K128 of SV40 occupy P2 [4], while R769 of Mcm3 and K129 of SV40 occupy P3 with regard to their contacts with Kap60; these basic residues are needed for optimal cell growth ( Figs 1 and 2 ). Additionally, basic residues at P1 and P5 play a supporting role for optimal nuclear localization, likely by contributing to the binding between Kap60 and P2 or P3 of the NLS [4, 15, 16, 18]. In contrast, P4 is often occupied by a non-basic residue in monopartite NLSs [5, 7]; structural studies of the SV40 and c-Myc NLSs suggest that P4 does not interact specifically with importin alpha, thus P4 may be less critical for nuclear import [4, 15]. In support of the essential role of P2 and P3 mediated interactions, mutations of Mcm3 at P2 or P3 result in defective nuclear import, reduced chromatin association, and impaired cell growth. These findings underscore the structural and functional parallels between the NLS of Mcm3 and SV40, highlighting the central role of P2 and P3 mediated interactions with Kap60. Previously, the K/R-K-X-K/R motif ( where X can be any residue ) was proposed as a possible consensus for a monopartite NLS [1, 4, 44]. However, our findings suggest that this consensus model may be overly simplistic. For example, variants of Mcm3’s NLS such as Mcm3R771A ( 764KSPKKRQAV772 ) can still localize to the nucleus, as indicated by their normal cell growth ( Fig 1 ). Similarly, other NLSs, such as that from V-Jun ( KSRKRVL ), also deviate from this proposed consensus sequence [1, 6, 45]. Instead, we propose that AF3 offers a new approach to evaluate monopartite NLSs

. In contrast, all growth-impaired GFP-Mcm3 mutant fragments with mutations in Mcm3764-771 do not localize to the nucleus in both G1 and M phases ( Figs 4B and S3 ). Together, these findings suggest that mutations within the conserved motif of Mcm3’s NLS disrupt its nuclear localization, leading to the observed growth defects of these mutants. As previously reported, the absence of Mcm3 in the cell nucleus during the G2/M phase could be attributed to a leucine-rich nuclear export signal ( NES ) motif ( Mcm3834-842 ) [8]. This is supported by the constitutive nuclear localization signal observed in both full-length and C-terminal fragments of Mcm3 lacking this NES ( Mcm3Δ781-884 ) ( S4A and S4B Fig ). Defective import of Mcm3 into the cell nucleus may compromise MCM loading in cells, leading to severe growth defects ( Figs 1 and 2 ). To test this hypothesis, we examined the chromatin association of MCM in cells arrested in the G1 or the G2/M phase ( Fig 5A ) [39, 40]. We found that MCM subunits were specifically enriched in the chromatin fraction of cell arrested in the G1 phase but not the G2/M phase ( Fig 5B, with S5A Fig confirming cell cycle arrest ). This cell-cycle dependency suggests that the chromatin-bound MCM likely represents loaded MCM complexes. This is further supported by the finding that the amount of chromatin-bound MCM in G1 cells is reduced by the partial inactivation of Cdc6 ( Fig 5B, with S5A Fig confirming cell cycle arrest ), validating that this approach specifically detects loaded MCM complexes. Next, we utilized this assay to evaluate MCM-chromatin association in the growth-impaired mcm3 mutants described in Figs 1 and 2 ( Fig 5C and 5D, with S5B–D Fig confirming cell cycle arrest ). In each sample, wild-type GFP-Mcm3 displays robust chromatin association among the cells analyzed. By comparison, all growth-impaired mcm3 mutants exhibit a significantly reduced amount of chromatin-bound Mcm3

. Although these NLSs, like the SV40 NLS, are rich in basic residues, sequence variations among them raise questions about whether they interact with importin alpha in a similar manner [4, 15]. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mcm3, a subunit of the Mini-Chromosome Maintenance ( MCM ) complex [21–24], has a monopartite NLS ( 764KSPKKRQRV772 ) that resembles the SV40 NLS but has yet-to-be fully characterized [8, 9]. In addition to the sequence similarity, several lines of evidence suggest that this sequence acts as a functional NLS for Mcm3. First, the SV40 NLS was shown to functionally substitute for Mcm3757-779, providing strong support for the role of this Mcm3 fragment in controlling nuclear import [8, 9]. Second, fusion of Mcm3755-781 with galactosidase was sufficient to direct its nuclear localization [9]. Third, fluorescence microscopy of a GFP-tagged, shorter fragment of Mcm3766-772 resulted in a modest nuclear localization signal in live cells [8], suggesting that the flanking sequences of this Mcm3 NLS are needed for optimal NLS activity. Despite these findings, the sequence specificity of Mcm3’s NLS remains to be determined. Further characterization of Mcm3’s NLS will not only help elucidate its cell cycle dependent nuclear import and subsequent loading, but also refine predictions of other putative NLSs that may exist in many nuclear proteins. Since the nuclear import of Mcm3 and its subsequent chromatin loading are essential for cell growth [8, 9], we performed mutagenesis studies to identify specific basic residues within Mcm3’s NLS that are critical for its function. To understand the effects of these mutations, we used AlphaFold 3 ( AF3 ) to model the binding between Mcm3’s NLS and Kap60, the importin alpha in yeast [4, 25].

The nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ), a short motif rich in basic amino acids, controls the import of many nuclear proteins [1–13]. Two types of NLS have been identified: monopartite and bipartite [1–3, 11–13]. A monopartite NLS consists of a single, continuous stretch of basic amino acids, including lysine and arginine [1–3, 11, 13]. The NLS from SV40’s large T antigen ( 126PKKKRKV133 ), which contains five contiguous basic residues, is a classic example of a monopartite NLS [11]. In contrast, a bipartite NLS is characterized by two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a short spacer region, as seen in proteins such as nucleoplasmin and many others [1–3, 12, 13]. Both monopartite and bipartite NLSs function by interacting with proteins in the importin family, which are key transport receptors that recognize and guide NLS-containing proteins through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus [1, 14]. Structural studies have provided substantial insights into the interaction between NLSs and importin alpha, revealing that this binding involves both hydrophobic and charge-charge interactions, with multiple basic residues in the NLS contacting negatively charged residues on importin alpha [4, 15–18]. This is supported through genetic studies, which illustrate that mutating Lys-128 in the SV40 NLS to non-basic residues significantly impaired nuclear import [11, 19, 20], whereas mutating it to arginine disrupts nuclear import without affecting growth [11, 20]. Despite these findings, predicting NLS can be challenging due to the lack of a universally conserved sequence.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Ataxin-2 ( ATXN2 ) is a gene implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type II ( SCA2 ), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and Parkinsonism. The encoded protein is a therapeutic target for ALS and related conditions. ATXN2 ( or Atx2 in insects ) can function in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability and in the assembly of mRNP-granules, a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ). Previous work has shown that the LSm ( Like-Sm ) domain of Atx2, which can help stimulate mRNA translation, antagonizes mRNP-granule assembly. Here we advance these findings through a series of experiments on Drosophila and human Ataxin-2 proteins. Results of Targets of RNA Binding Proteins Identified by Editing ( TRIBE ), co-localization and immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that a polyA-binding protein ( PABP ) interacting, PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2 may be a major determinant of the mRNA and protein content of Ataxin-2 mRNP granules. Experiments with transgenic Drosophila indicate that while the Atx2-LSm domain may protect against neurodegeneration, structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions both support Atx2-induced cytotoxicity. Taken together, the data lead to a proposal for how Ataxin-2 interactions are remodelled during translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute differently to the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation as well as to neurodegeneration.

   . Across species, Ataxin-2 has three conserved regions: a Like-Sm ( LSm ) domain, an LSm-associated domain ( LSm-AD ) and a PAM2 motif, which is flanked by extended IDRs [82]. Detailed work in Drosophila has shown that a c-terminal IDR of Atx2 is selectively required for mRNP assembly into granules [61]. Parallel experiments showing that the IDR is also required for cytotoxicity in Drosophila FUS, C9ORF72 and Huntington’s disease models suggest RNP-granule formation to be a significant mechanism by which Atx2 promotes neurodegeneration [61, 74]. A recent discovery that the Atx2-LSm domain antagonizes IDR-function has led to a model in which the Atx2 cIDR: ( a ) does not support mRNP assembly when Atx2 is associated with actively translating mRNAs through Atx2-LSm domain interactions; ( b ) becomes accessible and active in mediating mRNP assembly when LSm-domain interactions break and mRNA translation stalls [82, 83]. We now present a series of experiments further elaborating mechanisms by which Ataxin-2 functions in mRNA translation and mRNP assembly. These show that the PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2 and its interactions with PABP are not essential for granule assembly but are required to efficiently recruit Atx2-target mRNAs and specific protein components into Ataxin-2 granules. When taken together with other findings [73, 82–84], our observations indicate that PAM2 binding to PABP on the polyA tail of mRNAs helps specify the composition of Ataxin-2 granules. We propose an early role for PAM2:PABP interactions working in coordination with the LSm domain to support mRNA translation and thereby oppose the mRNP formation [82]; as well as a later role in escorting translationally-stalled PAM2:PABP linked mRNAs into mRNP granules. In vivo experiments analysing motor decline in transgenic Drosophila indicate that the PAM2:PABP interactions also support the progression of the neurodegenerative process

. Although such a model aligns with our data, we recognize the absence of experimental evidence in the current study and acknowledge the necessity for extensive and rigorous testing within the life cycle of a single Ataxin-2 target mRNA. Antisense Oligonucleotide ( ASO ) based therapeutic strategies that lower levels of ATXN2 are being developed for the treatment of ALS and SCA2 [72, 77]. Our experiments provide a much finer grained analysis of the activities of Ataxin-2, suggesting that the function of the LSm domain should be spared, and that IDR-mediated assembly mechanisms and perhaps PAM2:PABP interactions should be most usefully targeted by therapeutics. Our previous work showed that atx2 mutants lacking the cIDR required for Ataxin-2 granule formation in Drosophila neurons and S2 cells, were resistant to neurodegeneration as assessed in Drosophila disease models [61, 74]. We further showed that the LSm-domain antagonizes Ataxin-2 granule formation [83]. Here we advance the latter observation by demonstrating that Ataxin-2 forms lacking the LSm domain may more effectively cause cytotoxicity than the wild-type or IDR-deficient forms ( Fig 5C ). While Ataxin-2 is a largely disordered protein, structured regions within the protein may confer functionality by facilitating the formation of more stable complexes, thereby hindering aggregation. However, we remain uncertain whether the LSm domain alone can exert neuroprotective effects. These observations independently confirm our original conclusions and provide further support for a model in which the efficiency of mRNP assembly correlates with the speed and severity of neurodegenerative processes in Drosophila

Some RNA-binding proteins can remain associated with mRNAs across multiple stages: RNA processing, transport, translation, or translational control [2, 95–99]. Ataxin-2 may be one such protein. It is a translational activator of the Drosophila period mRNA, a repressor of several miRNA reporters, a facilitator of neuronal mRNP-granule and stress-granule formation as well as a broad stabilizer of Ataxin-2 associated mRNAs [61, 92, 100–105]. While these different functions could represent different modes of engagement with distinct sets of mRNAs, the data are also consistent with another model. Sequential interactions mediated by different protein regions during mRNP modelling allow Ataxin-2 to contribute in multiple ways to translational control to a single mRNA. Previous work has shown that Atx2 enhances period mRNA translation through a mechanism requiring LSm-domain interactions with a complex of LSM12 and TYF ( Twenty Four ) proteins associated with the 5’cap of the translating mRNA [100, 105, 106]. Given considerable supportive evidence for direct binding between the LSm domain and LSM12, we postulate that LSm-domain-LSM12 interactions occur in translating polysomes [84] and contribute to increased efficiency of translation. This proposal is consistent with the observation that the LSm domain opposes the formation of mRNP granules, which usually contain translationally repressed mRNAs [83]. However, the LSm domain must also contribute to LSM12-independent functions, because LSm-domain deletions from Drosophila Atx2 cause lethality and LSM12 null mutants, while arrhythmic, are viable and fertile [106]. One possibility is that LSm domains additionally contribute, perhaps indirectly, to interactions with the DEAD-box helicase Me31B/DDX6 in a translational repressor complex [106, 107]

. Thus, we suggest that in the case of actively translating mRNAs, the Atx2 function is driven by LSm-domain association with LSM12 and translational initiators, and that LSM12 disengages from a translational initiation complex as the mRNA transitions into a repressed state driven by Me31B. While polyA tails and PABP are known to support translation and the Ataxin-2 PAM2 domain is involved in targeting the protein to polysomes [84], existing data do not directly address how Ataxin-2 PAM2 motif interactions contribute to translational activation. One possibility, supported by observations on the period mRNA is that the PAM2 domain guides Ataxin-2 to the 3’UTR of its target mRNAs [100]. Our observation that PABP co-immunoprecipitates with mini-Ataxin2, show that Atx2PAM2:PABP interactions occur independently of and prior to mRNP granule formation. Recent findings that this association antagonizes the Ataxin-2 condensation [82] are consistent with a model in which the Atx2-PAM2 motif interacts with PABP in translating mRNAs to support efficient translation. However, in addition to supporting translation, PABP is also known to associate with translational repressors that could drive either mRNA deadenylation and/or storage [93, 108, 109]. We propose a dual role for Ataxin-2 associated with PABP in translational repression. First, when Ataxin-2 target mRNAs are not actively translated, then the mRNP through Me31B/DDX6 and PABP may recruit deadenylases to transition into either a translationally dormant or degradative state [106, 109–111]. Second, Atx2-associated mRNA may move into mNP granules through P2-AB interactions with PAB, where they are protected from deadenylation and degradation [82, 93, 108]. This model is supported by the observation that Atin-2 mRNAs in mNP granules are stabilized [61, 100] and that P2-AB interactions are required for mNP granule assembly [82].

    Title: 
    Abstract: Gene regulatory networks that act upstream of skeletal muscle fate determinants are distinct in different anatomical locations. Despite recent efforts, a clear understanding of the cascade of events underlying the emergence and maintenance of the stem cell pool in specific muscle groups remains unresolved and debated. Here, we invalidated Pitx2 with multiple Cre-driver mice prenatally, postnatally, and during lineage progression. We showed that this gene becomes progressively dispensable for specification and maintenance of the muscle stem ( MuSC ) cell pool in extraocular muscles ( EOMs ) despite being, together with Myf5, a major upstream regulator during early development. Moreover, constitutive inactivation of Pax7 postnatally led to a greater loss of MuSCs in the EOMs compared to the limb. Thus, we propose a relay between Pitx2, Myf5 and Pax7 for EOM stem cell maintenance. We demonstrate also that MuSCs in the EOMs adopt a quiescent state earlier that those in limb muscles and do not spontaneously proliferate in the adult, yet EOMs have a significantly higher content of Pax7+ MuSCs per area pre- and post-natally. Finally, while limb MuSCs proliferate in the mdx mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, significantly less MuSCs were present in the EOMs of the mdx mouse model compared to controls, and they were not proliferative. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive in vivo characterisation of MuSC heterogeneity along the body axis and brings further insights into the unusual sparing of EOMs during muscular dystrophy.

   . Second, no differences in the number of GFP+ cells per area nor in the proportion of Pitx2+GFP+ cells were observed in the foetal period between control and mutant EOMs, suggesting that factors other than Pitx2 ( and Pax3 ) may ensure the specification of this cell population during embryonic development. In this context, a higher number of dying cells per muscle area were observed in Pax7 null EOMs compared to controls at P1, suggesting that this might be a critical period where compensation by other factors is minimal. Finally, previous studies showed that Pax7 is required for limb myogenic cells to express genes normally associated with functional MuSCs such as Syndecan4 and CD34 [36, 38]. Here, we further show that expression of CalcR, another MuSC marker [50], was absent in EOMs and TA lacking Pax7. In addition, while the fraction of committed GFP+ cells in Pax7 null EOMs display a marked increase compared to controls, no significant changes were observed in mutant and control TA at P21. This observation probably reflects differences on the pace of lineage progression between these muscles in vivo. It would be of interest in future studies to assess whether the downstream targets of Pax7 in MuSCs of cranial and somite origin are similar and to identify complementary transcription factors that confer these distinct MuSC phenotypes. Dystrophin protein is expressed in differentiated myofibres where it is required for sarcolemmal integrity, but it was also reported to be expressed in activated MuSCs, where it regulates MuSC polarity and the mode of cell divisions [74, 75]. Moreover, several mechanisms of MuSC dysfunction have been described in DMD [76], including severe proliferation defects and premature senescence of chronically activated MuSCs [42, 77–79]. Notably, in a preclinical rat model of DMD, expression of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor ( Tshr ) was shown to protect MuSCs in the EOMs from entering senescence [42]

. Yet, as no MuSC lineage-specific deletion of Pitx2 has been performed in EOMs, it is unclear: i ) to what extent Pitx2 is required temporally for emergence and maintenance of the MuSC population, and its relative function compared to the MRFs and Pax7; ii ) if Pitx2 is continuously required for maintenance of the adult MuSC population. Further, global deletion of Pax7 in trunk and limb muscles leads to an extensive loss of MuSCs during early postnatal development [35–39]. Deletion of Pax7 in adult MuSCs results in reduced MuSC numbers and impaired regeneration following muscle injury [40, 41]. While Pax7 is dispensable for EOM formation during embryonic development [30], the presence of MuSCs in the EOMs of postnatal Pax7 null mice and the relative roles of Pax7 and Pitx2 in maintaining these MuSCs remain unresolved. Finally, several reports showed that expression of Pitx2 in postnatal MuSCs is higher in EOMs than in limb muscles [10, 11, 42]. As high levels of Pitx2 are retained in dystrophic and ageing mouse EOMs [42, 43] and overexpression of Pitx2 was reported to enhance the regenerative potential of dystrophic skeletal MuSCs [44], Pitx2 could potentially contribute to the sparing of EOMs in muscular dystrophies. However, the functional role of Pitx2 in EOM MuSCs in mdx mice has not been formally evaluated to-date. In this study, we examined the spatiotemporal functional roles of Pitx2 and Pax7 in the emergence and maintenance of the EOM progenitor population using combinations of genetically modified and lineage traced mice. Our study provides a qualitative and quantitative analysis of myogenesis from embryonic to postnatal stages in vivo and identifies differential cycling states, dynamics of commitment, and establishment of MuSC quiescence in EOMs compared to limb muscles. We show that Pitx2 is critically required for establishing the EOMs prior to Pax7 expression but is subsequently dispensable

In the trunk, both at the dermomyotome and limb levels, expression of Pax3 and Myf5 precede the expression of Pax7 [1, 64–66], with Pax3 expression being then rapidly downregulated during myogenic cell commitment ( i. e. in Myod+ cells ). Following the establishment of a muscle anlagen ( uncommitted and differentiated cells ), Pax7 is expressed from mid-embryogenesis in the upstream undifferentiated population, and it persists to give rise to adult MuSCs [17, 64]. In the head of vertebrate models analysed, Pax7+ myogenic cells were reported to emerge de novo, as Pax3 is not expressed in head MuSCs [21, 23, 32, 33]. Instead, and like the role of Pax3 in the trunk and limbs, Pitx2 is critically required cell-autonomously to maintain myogenic progenitors in an immature state, ensure their survival until the end of the embryonic period, and to activate the MRFs [30]. Differently to the role of Pax3 in the trunk, Pitx2 expression persists following activation of the MRFs in the developing EOMs [21]. The expression of Pitx2 also in adjacent mesenchymal cells [53, 54] has complicated the analysis and interpretation of the cell-autonomous roles of this gene in EOM development. In this context, conditional inactivation of Pitx2 in neural-crest-derived cells does not affect the specification of the EOM primordia, but it results in severe muscle patterning defects [67]. We demonstrated herein a temporal requirement for Pitx2 during lineage progression: deletion of this gene in muscle progenitors ( Myf5Cre ) results in the absence of myofibres and upstream cells in the embryo, while deletion in myoblasts ( MyodiCre ) does not. Further, deletion of this gene in Pax7+ cells led to a reduction in the number of foetal MuSCs in the EOMs, whereas Pitx2 function appears to be dispensable for the maintenance of these MuSCs in the adult ( Fig 8 )

. It was also proposed that Pitx2+ myogenic cells do not co-express Pax7 but express Myod in human EOMs, and these cells could then represent a second progenitor population involved in EOM remodeling, repair, and regeneration [43]. Given our observation that more than 92% of Pax7+ MuSCs coexpress Pitx2, this might highlight species specific differences or antibody sensitivity and tissue processing issues in the different studies. Several studies analysed the limb and trunk phenotypes of constitutive [35–38] and inducible [39–41] Pax7 mutants. While MuSC progenitors are initially specified in homeostatic conditions [38], the progressive loss of MuSCs in newborn mice appears to be due to proliferation defects of MuSCs and cell death [37, 38]. Elimination of Pax7 in adult MuSCs results in MuSC loss likely due to enhanced differentiation, reduced heterochromatin condensation and severe deficits in muscle regeneration [36, 38, 40, 41]. The phenotypes of Pax7 null cells during in vitro activation were somewhat more divergent, depending on the system used ( isolated myoblasts, myofibres, clonogenic assays ) including reduction in the number of myoblasts, increased or reduced differentiation and/or commitment to alternative fates [35–38, 40, 41]. As EOMs are not amenable to in vivo muscle injury, in this study we examined the in vivo roles of Pit2 and Pax7 in MuSC in EOM and limb muscles using lineage-traced mice. Our results show that Pit2 is required for the emergence of MuSC in the EOM but dispensable for their maintenance, while Pax7 is required for MuSC maintenance in both EOM and limb. We also show that MuSC in EOM adopt a quiescent state earlier than those in limb muscles and do not spontaneously proliferate in the adult, yet EOM have a higher content of Pax7 MuSC per area pre- and postnatally. Finally, while limbSC proliferate in mdx mouse for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, less MuSC were present in the EOM of mdx mouse compared to controls and were not proliferative. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive in vivo characterisation of Mu heterogeneity along the body axis and brings insights into the sparing of EOM during muscular dystrophy 

The final answer is: Here is a formal, clear, and concise summary of the research article:

The study investigated the role of Pitx and Pax in the development and maintenance of muscle stem cells (Mu) in the extraocular muscles (EOM) and limb muscles. They found that Pitx is required for the emergence of Mu in the E but dispensable for their maintenance, while Pax is required for Mu maintenance in both E and limb. The study also showed that Mu in E adopt a quiescent state earlier than those in limb and do not spontaneously proliferate in adult, yet E have a higher content of Pax+ Mu per area pre- and postnat. In the md mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, less Mu were present in E compared to controls and were not proliferative. The study provides a comprehensive characterization of Mu heterogeneity along the body axis and brings insights into the sparing of E during muscular dystrophy.

The study used a combination of genetically modified and lineage-traced mice to examine the spatiemporal roles of Pit and Pax in the emergence and maintenance of the E progenitor population. They found that Pit is required for establishing the E prior Pax expression but subsequently dispensable, while Pax is required for Mu maintenance in both E and limb. The study also showed that Mu in E adopt a quies state earlier than those in limb and do not spontaneously proliferate in adult, yet have a higher content of Pax Mu per area pre and postnat. In the md mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, less Mu were present in E compared to controls and were not proliferative. The study provides a qualitative and quantitative analysis of myogenesis from embryonic to postnatal in vivo and identifies cycling states, dynamics, commitment, and establishment of Mu in E compared to limb.

The study highlights the importance of Pit and Pax in the development and maintenance of Mu in E and limb, and provides insights into the sparing of E during muscular dystrophy. The results suggest that Pit is required for the emergence of Mu in E but dispensable for their maintenance, while Pax is required for Mu maintenance in both E and limb. The study also shows that Mu in E adopt a quies state earlier than those in limb and do not spontaneously proliferate in adult, yet have a higher content of Pax Mu per area pre and postnat. The study provides a comprehensive characterization of Mu heterogeneity along body and brings insights into the sparing E during muscular dystrophy.
Researchers have developed a novel algorithm called VOC-IN to simulate the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants among the human population. The algorithm combines epidemiological data with deep learning and neural networks to estimate the transmission of COVID-19 strains during the pandemic. VOC-IN emphasizes underlying patterns in multivariate data to improve optimization and accurate fitting. It is capable of fitting multi-source data effectively and can be applied in scenarios involving a single virus. The researchers applied VOC-IN to data from British Columbia and internal health institutions in Canada, demonstrating good performance in simulating observed and unobserved dynamics, time-dependent inference, and short-term predictions. They compared VOC-IN with traditional methods, showcasing advantages in accuracy and predictive performance. The algorithm integrates epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemi models to estimate the intensity of COVID-19 transmission. It uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINs) to estimate time-vary parameters. PINs are data-driven algorithms that solve forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations. Recent studies have shown PINs can accurately fit compartmental models and estimate timeary parameters. The researchers propose VOC-IN that fits data and infers complex timeary parameters by encoding VOC infection, epidemiological mechanisms, and differential equations into networks. They designate two neural networks, UD and UP, with variable t as input, and weights and biases parameterized by and, respectively. The study aims to integrate VOC-IN with other machine methods to better fit and predict infectious data.
This study introduces CytoNet, a Deep Sets-based model that aggregates single-cell data into profiles using self-supervised contrastive learning. CytoNet learns an aggregation strategy by receiving single-cell morphological input and providing the aggregated profile as output. The model outperforms average profiling in both retrieval and mechanism of action tasks, with relative improvement depending on CytoNet application. For mechanism retrieval on the dataset c000, CyNet achieves 36-60% better performance than average profiling on hold-out plates with different protocols than training plates. A 30% improvement is observed on dataset c0003. When applied to c000 and validation, CyNet achieves 50-81% better than average, affirmed by 68% increase for c000 data. Results improve ~20 gains using features on different dataset. CyNet effectively overcomes retraining challenge, making easier to use. CyNet has difficulty generalizing unseen plates within same set and different set. Dataset c000 tested compounds provides insights CyNet generalizability. 

 CytoNet employs Deep Sets formulation to learn model aggregating single data into profile that outperforms population-averaged in predicting compound mechanism. This is through self-sup contrast learning within multiple-instance framework, allowing model process groups data-labeled group rather individual point and make classifications collective groups. Training evaluated replicate retrieval, retrieving wells same compound and downstream retrieving annotated mechanism using mean precision metric. Cyto evaluated two fronts: generalizing unseen compounds protocols and practical scenario trained large measured performance mechanism retrieval dataset. Methods capture subpopulations rather dispersions did not improve average. They incomparable across unless subpop defined. Many phenotypes described continuous scale. Previous work improved profiling features averages, dispersion, covariances provided ~20 better predicting mechanism gene pathway, capturing statistics heterogeneity improve tasks. However, has limitations: only captures first-second moments, produces matrix recom pairwise profiles new included. 

Cyto proposes self contrast learning leveraging profiling information experiments. Contrast aims general features beneficial tasks. Use pert ident labels train latent space distinguishing samples. This frames multiple problem assuming replicates cells feature, compounds distributions. Not every pert yields distinct, collectively feature captures biological variations. Apply contrast already features, applicable image datasets features readily. Data collection sets cells, sample corresponds set based definition. Aggregate sample profile function few properties: capable input sizes, permutation-invariant, learnable.
Researchers proposed a framework to quantify cognitive effort during task performance using electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns. The framework relies on identifying discrete dynamical states (microstates) and optimal theory. To validate its effectiveness, they applied it to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stro task, a cognitive test where participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another often conflicting aspect. Findings reveal increased cost linked to cognitive, confirming the framework's effectiveness in capturing and quantifying transitions. The study analyzed EEG data from 44 participants during a 5-minute resting-state and task sessions, including a spatial Stro task with varying levels of cognitive engagement. Microstate analysis revealed different distributions across conditions, with higher cost for incongruent stimuli and influenced by level of control. A correlation between cost and reaction times showed reduced cost associated with improved performance. Results highlight the value of characterizing brain dynamics and transitions in understanding cognitive processes and the relationship between neural patterns, effort, and performance. The framework estimates brain cost using the Schrödinger bridge, a probabilistic approach reducing dimensionality. Brain activity can be described as discrete transitions between metastable states, capturing significant variance. Microstate analysis reduces electrical signal into distinct topographies, associated with activations or deactivations of resting networks and spectral bands. The study found distinct microstates across conditions, modulated by level of demand, and asymmetric transitions indicating flux and entropy production. Future directions include quantifying entropy across tasks as a measure of cognitive load and investigating pathological conditions' influence on control.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Expansion of atypical memory B cells ( aMBCs ) was demonstrated in malaria-exposed individuals. To date, the generation of P. vivax-specific aMBCs and their function in protective humoral immune responses is unknown. Here, P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein II ( PvDBPII ) probes were generated to detect the development and durability of specific aMBCs, and to demonstrate the capacity of these cells to produce neutralizing antibodies following natural infections. PvDBPII-specific aMBCs were elicited during malaria illness, and they persisted through the recovery phase of infections. To address biology and function of P. vivax-specific aMBCs in producing protective antibodies, a single MBC was cultured, and the secreted IgG was tested for binding and inhibition activity. The aMBC-derived clones produced antibodies with variable levels of anti-PvDBPII IgG in cultures, and some produced high antibody levels comparable to classical MBC clones. Thus, we focused our attention on the function of aMBCs in producing neutralizing antibodies. Among the aMBC clones, A1F12 and B4E11 produced broadly neutralizing antibodies against a panel of PvDBPII variants. Notably, B cell receptors ( BCRs ) of PvDBPII-specific aMBCs expressed unique IGHV genes, with similar usage of IGHV1-3, comparable to classical MBCs. The somatic hypermutation ( SHM ) rate and CDR3 length of VH and Vκ in these two MBC subsets were not significantly different. Together, our findings revealed that P. vivax infections elicited the development and persistence of P. vivax-specific aMBCs. The accumulation of aMBCs during and following infections might play an important role in producing protective antibodies against malaria.

   . Of note, the phenotypes of P. vivax-specific aMBCs were heterogeneous ( S4 Fig ), consistent with a previous study in chronic P. falciparum parasite exposure [35], in which three subsets of aMBCs were identified, but not all developed into ASCs. Of total six PvDBPII-TH2-specific aMBC clones, three clones ( A1F12, A3F12 and B4E06 ) differentiated and secreted IgG with high inhibitory efficacy. Notably, one clone ( A1F12 ) exhibited high binding affinity, comparable to that of the classical MBC clone ( B4E11 ), and produced broadly inhibitory antibodies against the binding of diverse PvDBPII variants to human erythrocytes. Together, our findings highlight a protective role of aMBCs in humoral immune response to malaria by differentiating into ASCs for producing broadly neutralizing antibodies against P. vivax invasion into human erythrocytes. However, low competency of aMBCs in ASC differentiation was detected, compared to classical MBCs. This finding is consistent with previous in vitro studies that the differentiation of aMBCs into ASCs required signals ( IL-21 cytokine ) and interactions with Tfh cells [25, 27]. In addition to their role as precursors of ASCs, as shown in previous studies and ours, aMBCs have capacity to present antigens by internalizing membrane-associated antigens [23] and express MHC class II and CD11c molecules to interact with T cells [42]. Also, they primed Tfh cells in Germinal Center ( GC ) to sustain the immune response in persistent malaria infection [43]. Therefore, it seems that aMBCs act as a key player in immune responses ( both innate and adaptive immunity ) against malaria. Investigation of mechanisms and dependencies driving malaria-specific MBCs in antigen presentation, cytokine secretion and ASC differentiation will be beneficial for vaccine design. The BCR characteristics of aMBCs in P. falciparum malaria has been described [21, 44]

. vivax variant strains. To support the capability of MBCs to produce cross-reactive antibodies, single clones of PvDBPII-TH2-MBCs were cultured and then tested for broad binding and inhibition of a panel against PvDBPII allelic variants. Screening of IgG culture supernatants showed that two ( A1F12 and A3F12 ) clones and one ( B4E11 ) clone from aMBCs and classical MBCs, respectively, showed cross-reactivity. Most significantly, MBC-derived HuMoAbs from clones A1F12 and B4E11 showed broadly inhibitory activity against a panel of PvDBPII variants. These data support the previous finding that strain-transcending anti-PvDBPII antibodies were acquired in natural infections [38–40]. Overall, our study highlights the development of a small number of broadly reactive aMBCs and classical MBCs against P. vivax variant strains following natural infections. The differentiation of these MBC subsets into ASCs potentially leads to potential production of broadly neutralizing antibodies against P. vivax parasite binding and invasion of human erythrocytes. Although expansion of aMBCs in malaria has been reported [14, 20, 27, 41], the competency of these cells to differentiate into ASCs for secreting protective anti-malarial antibodies remains unknown. Here, we used single MBC cultures ( Nojima cultures ) to demonstrate P. vivax-specific aMBC function in ASC differentiation. The culture system contains MS40L-low feeder cells and multiple cytokines ( IL-2, IL-4, IL-21 and BAFF ) [31, 32]. Our result demonstrated that P. vivax-specific aMBCs differentiated into ASCs for IgG secretion. However, in comparison to classical MBCs, they had lower ability in ASC differentiation. The IgG reactivity in MBC culture supernatant showed that 35. 29% ( 6/17 ) and 48. 64% ( 36/74 ) of aMBC and classical MBC clones were positive, respectively ( Fig 2B ). Of note, the phenotypes of P

Expansions of bulk aMBC phenotypes have been demonstrated in malaria-exposed individuals in high P. falciparum malaria transmission settings of Africa [20–22], as well as in low P. vivax transmission regions of Brazil and Thailand [14, 26–28]. It is unclear whether these expansions of aMBCs and their activation upon receiving T cell help could contribute to development of protective immunity against malaria. Identifying MBC subsets or phenotypes that play a major role in producing protective antibodies will facilitate development of effective and long-lasting malaria vaccines. Here, we demonstrated the generation of antigen-specific aMBCs in vivax malaria. In acute infections, PvDBPII-TH2-specific MBCs were detected in 17 individuals ( average 0. 024%, SD 0. 020% ). Of these, 11. 28% and 40. 24% expressed aMBC and classical MBC phenotypes, respectively. Thus, we focused our study on the durability of aMBC responses. These were observed during the recovery phase in 7 subjects indicating that P. vivax infections elicited the development and persistence of antigen-specific aMBCs. The finding was consistent with similar observations in P. falciparum malaria [25, 35, 36]. The PfAMA1- and PfMSP1-specific aMBCs were detected in chronic P. falciparum-exposed individuals in Mali and Uganda [25, 35]. To determine the factors that may drive the development of aMBCs, we assessed whether the presence of P. vivax-specific aMBCs increased with age and number of infections. No correlation was observed between the frequency of specific aMBCs and age ( r = -0. 3100, p = 0. 2259 ). Additionally, almost all of our P. vivax participants were diagnosed with the first P. vivax infection. There was only one acutely infected patient and one recovered subject who had repeated episodes of P. vivax malaria. The time intervals to reinfection or relapse were 12 and 3 months, respectively ( S3 Table )

. Additionally, aMBCs produce antibodies with the help of T follicular helper ( Tfh ) cells [25]. In vivax malaria, an increased frequency of aMBCs was observed during both the acute and recovery phases of infections [14, 26–28]. Through study of in vitro cultures, aMBCs were shown to secrete immunoglobulin after receiving IFN-γ and IL-21 signals [26]. These previous reports were based on bulk aMBCs, of either CD21-CD27- or CD21-CD27-Tbet+FCRL5+ phenotype. The specificity of these expanded aMBCs, and the function of P. vivax-specific aMBCs are unknown. Our generation of fluorochrome-labeled P. vivax antigens, along with staining for aMBC markers, should provide insights into the development of these P. vivax-specific aMBCs and their function. In the present study, we demonstrate specificity of aMBC responses and the role of P. vivax-specific aMBCs in producing neutralizing antibodies following natural infections. The leading vaccine candidate, PvDBPI, was used to detect the development and durability of P viv-specific aBC.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Polygenic prediction of complex trait phenotypes has become important in human genetics, especially in the context of precision medicine. Recently, mr. mash, a flexible and computationally efficient method that models multiple phenotypes jointly and leverages sharing of effects across such phenotypes to improve prediction accuracy, was introduced. However, a drawback of mr. mash is that it requires individual-level data, which are often not publicly available. In this work, we introduce mr. mash-rss, an extension of the mr. mash model that requires only summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWAS ) and linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) estimates from a reference panel. By using summary data, we achieve the twin goal of increasing the applicability of the mr. mash model to data sets that are not publicly available and making it scalable to biobank-size data. Through simulations, we show that mr. mash-rss is competitive with, and often outperforms, current state-of-the-art methods for single- and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in a variety of scenarios that differ in the pattern of effect sharing across phenotypes, the number of phenotypes, the number of causal variants, and the genomic heritability. We also present a real data analysis of 16 blood cell phenotypes in the UK Biobank, showing that mr. mash-rss achieves higher prediction accuracy than competing methods for the majority of traits, especially when the data set has smaller sample size.

    In this work, we have introduced mr. mash-rss, the summary data version of a recently developed empirical Bayes multivariate multiple regression method [20]. Like mr. mash, mr. mash-rss enjoys ( 1 ) the ability to learn patterns of effect sharing across phenotypes; ( 2 ) the ability to model dozens of phenotypes jointly; ( 3 ) computational efficiency. Additionally, mr. mash-rss addresses two important limitations of mr. mash —the need for individual-level data and the lack of scalability to biobank-size data. Through an array of simulations and real data analysis using the UK Biobank, we showed that mr. mash-rss is competitive with state-of-the-art univariate and multivariate PGS methods. Of note, mr. mash-rss outperformed competing methods in 14 out of 16 blood cell phenotypes, although the magnitude of the improvement varied across phenotypes, from modest to substantial. This highlights that the general mr. mash model can adapt to either more sparse ( e. g., for gene expression [20] ) or more dense ( e. g., for complex traits ) genetic architectures. We also showed that the improvement in prediction accuracy from using mr. mash-rss increased substantially with a smaller sample size. This holds good promise for improving prediction accuracy for phenotypes that are difficult to measure and in samples of individuals of non-European descent, which are usually much smaller [44]. In addition, the performance of the mr. mash model depends on the accuracy of the “data-driven” covariance matrices [20]. Thus, advances in covariance matrix estimation can potentially lead to improvements in prediction accuracy. A limitation of mr. mash-rss is that it does not perform as well for very polygenic phenotypes as highlighted by the second data application. This is a known issue for this type of variational empirical Bayes methods [12, 43]

. mr. mash-rss shares some features with the established Multivariate Adaptive Shrinkage ( mash ) [22], in that they both use the same mixture-of-multivariate-Normals prior on the effect sizes to leverage effect sharing across conditions ( e. g., different phenotypes ), and the EB approach to adapt the prior to the data. In fact, both mr. mash and mr. mash-rss “borrow” this framework that was introduced with mash. However, while mash assumes that the input summary statistics come from independent variables ( i. e., it does not deal with LD ), mr. mash-rss takes a full multivariate multiple regression approach and adjusts effect sizes for both sharing across conditions and correlations among variables ( i. e., it takes LD into account ). We test mr. mash-rss in the task of PGS prediction for multiple phenotypes jointly via simulations in several scenarios and show that it is competitive in terms of prediction accuracy with currently available methods. We then confirm these results in the analysis of real data for 16 blood cell traits in the UK Biobank [23, 24].

. Recently, Morgante et al. ( 2023 ) introduced the “Multiple Regression with Multivariate Adaptive Shrinkage” or “mr. mash” [20]. mr. mash is a Bayesian approach to multivariate multiple regression that is able learn complex patterns of effect sharing across phenotypes directly from the data. This is achieved through the use of flexible priors on the effect sizes across phenotypes and an empirical Bayes ( EB ) framework to adapt these priors to the data. Computational effiency is achieved by using Variational Inference ( VI ) as opposed to the more expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) methods. For a detailed account of VI and EB in this context, including the advantages, we direct the reader to [20]. Using multi-tissue gene expression prediction from cis-genotypes as an example, the authors showed that mr. mash is competitive in terms of both prediction accuracy and speed [20]. However, while powerful, mr. mash has some limitations. First, mr. mash requires individual-level data, i. e., genotypes and phenotypes for each individual and, mainly for privacy reasons, these data are rarely publicly available [21]. Second, mr. mash does not scale well to datasets with very large sample size, such as modern biobanks. These weaknesses limit the use of mr. mash for PGS prediction in human genetics. In this work, we overcome both these limitations by introducing “mr. mash Regression with Summary Statistics” or “mr. mash-rss”, an extension of mr. mash that only requires summary-level data. These are effect sizes and their standard errors ( or Z-scores ) from univariate Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWASs ) and Linkage Disequilibrium ( LD ) estimates from reference panels, which are usually publicly available [21]. mr

. Thus, some trait-scenario combinations are based on fewer than 20 replicates for MTAG+LDpred2-auto. To evaluate runtime, we selected chromosome 10 as a medium size chromosome and LDpred2-auto, SmvBayesC, and mr. mash-rss as the best performing methods in Shared Effects in Subgroups, i. e., the most complex scenario in our simulations. The results confirm that mr. mash-rss is computationally efficient compared to the other multivariate method ( S1 Table ). When analyzing real data, it is common to use LD matrices that are computed using a reference panel, rather than the individuals from whom the summary statistics were computed. It is well-known that issues with analyses with summary statistics arise when the reference panel and the GWAS population do not match [27, 35, 36]. Thus, it is important to assess the robustness of mr. mash-rss to the choice of the LD matrix. While we note that all the simulations above used an LD matrix that was computed using a subset of UK Biobank individuals that did not overlap with those used to compute the summary statistics, we also tested the performance of mr. mash-rss with truly external LD matrices. To do so, we used the same setting as the Equal Effects scenario, but computed LD matrices using 503 unrelated European individuals from the 1000G project [37]. This is a very small sample size that has been shown to be problematic when analyzing large GWAS samples [35]. Some preliminary testing highlighted that “banded” LD matrices ( as used for the other simulations ) resulted in convergence issues for the methods, while “block-diagonal” LD matrices computed as in [38] produced a better performance. Thus, we used the latter for the “External LD” simulation scenario. The results of this analysis are summarized in S1 Fig and show that, as expected, all the methods performed worse compared to the Equal Effects scenario. However, mr. mash-rss remained the best performing method overall. mr

We devised a simulation study where the goal was to compare mr. mash-rss and other competing methods at computing PGS for multiple phenotypes from summary data. We used real genotypes from the UK Biobank array data for n = 105, 000 nominally unrelated White British individuals that were randomly sampled. After applying a series of filters ( see S1 Text for details ), the data included p = 595, 071 genetic variants. We simulated r = 5 phenotypes according to three scenarios that differed in the structure of the effect sharing across phenotypes. Causal variants ( 5, 000 for all scenarios ) were randomly sampled from all genetic variants. These three scenarios were similar to those used in [20], but some parameters ( e. g., number of causal variants ) were modified to reflect more closely the genetic architecture of complex traits, rather than gene expression. We also simulated a few scenarios based on the Equal Effects scenario ( i. e., equal effects of the causal variants across phenotypes ) to assess the effect of genomic heritability, polygenicity ( i. e., number of causal variants ), and number of phenotypes modeled on the performance of the methods: For each of these scenarios, we ran 10 replicates and computed the average of the correlation between predicted and true phenotypes. The results are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. In all scenarios, mr. mashss outperformed or was competitive with other methods, especially when the number of phenotypes was small ( e. g. 2 ) or heritability was low ( e. g. 0. 2 ). However, when the number of phenotypes was large ( e. e. 5 ) or heritability was high (. e. 0.8 ) mr. mashss was competitive but not outperformed other methods. This is consistent with the known issue of variational Bayes methods for polygenic traits [12, 43]. We also observed that the improvement in accuracy from mr. mashss increased with smaller sample size, especially when the number of phenotypes was small ( e. g. 2 ) or heritability was low (. e.0.2 ) This is promising for traits that are difficult to measure or in samples of non-European descent, which are usually smaller [44. 

In addition to simulations, we applied mr. mashss to real data from the UKob for 16 blood phenotypes. The results are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. mr. mashss outperformed other methods for 14 of the 16 phenotypes, especially when sample size was small. The magnitude of the improvement varied across phenotypes from modest to substantial. This highlights that mr. mash can adapt to more sparse ( e. g. gene expression [20 ] or more dense (. e. complex ) genetic architectures. We also observed that the improvement in accuracy from mrss increased with smaller sample size. This holds promise for improving accuracy for traits that are difficult to measure or in samples of non-European descent, which are usually smaller [44. In addition, the performance of mr. mash depends on the accuracy of the data-driven covariance matrices [20. Thus, advances in covariance estimation can potentially lead to improvements in accuracy. A limitation of mrss is that it does not perform well for very polygenic phenotypes as highlighted by the data. This is an issue for type of variational Bayes methods [12, 43] 

mr. mashss shares features with established Multivariate Shrink ( mash [22 ] in that both use the same-mixture multivariate-Norm prior on effect sizes to leverage sharing across conditions ( e. g. phenotypes ) and EB to adapt prior the data. In fact, both mash and mrss “borrow” this framework introduced with mash. However, while mash assumes input statistics from independent ( i. e. does not deal with LD ) mrss takes multivariate regression and adjusts sizes for sharing and correlations among variables ( i. e. takes LD into account ) We test mrss in PGS for multiple phenotypes via simulations and show it is competitive with available methods in terms accuracy. then confirm results in real data for 16 blood traits in UKob [23,24 ]
This study proposes a novel framework that integrates spatio-temporal heterogeneity into homogeneous models by introducing a continuous recruitment process for susceptibles. A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations (DE) model. The model is trained using deep learning and calibrated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methods. Data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai are used to train the DE model and calibrate the mechanistic model. The study projects the attack and peak of new infections for the Omicron wave in China after the adjustment of the zero-COVID policy, indicating an attack rate of 80.06% and peak of 3.17% of the population, compared to the homogeneous model's 99.97% and 32.78, providing an 18.6% improvement in accuracy. Simulations show heterogeneity decreases herd immunity by 37.36% and prolongs the outbreak from 30 to 70 days, aligning with real cases. The study lays groundwork for a new class of models and insights for heterogeneity. Employing deep learning, the DE model is validated and the mechanistic model contributes to uncovering mechanisms in recruitment. The dual strategy combines strengths of learning and mechanistic to yield a comprehensive framework for predicting disease dynamics. A comparison shows the learning approach is more flexible in capturing information. The mechan model offers intuitive insights into transmission and control. The study aims to develop a generalized framework that embeds spatio-temporal heterogeneity into homogeneous models, leveraging the compartment for efficient prediction and enhancing accuracy. A machine approach is developed to shape the recruitment from COVID-19 data. The model is applied to project trends and evaluate accuracy with traditional frameworks. The implications and applications of the novel framework are discussed.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Synapses in the brain are highly noisy, which leads to a large trial-by-trial variability. Given how costly synapses are in terms of energy consumption these high levels of noise are surprising. Here we propose that synapses use noise to represent uncertainties about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. To show this, we developed a mathematical framework, in which the synapse as a whole interacts with the soma of the postsynaptic neuron in a similar way to an agent that is situated and behaves in an uncertain, dynamic environment. This framework suggests that synapses use an implicit internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics that is being updated by a synaptic learning rule, which resembles experimentally well-established LTP/LTD mechanisms. In addition, this approach entails that a synapse utilizes its inherently noisy synaptic release to also encode its uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential. Although each synapse strives for predicting the somatic dynamics of its postsynaptic neuron, we show that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network resolve different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment. Hereby, synapses coordinate themselves to represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations.

   . g. [18, 19] for an in-depth discussion of different definitions of surprise ). In general, these stimuli map only parts of the environment’s true state, implying an unavoidable residual level of uncertainty. To reduce the uncertainty, the agent uses the internal model to formulate predictions about the environment and performs actions to test these predictions. These actions may lead to new stimuli that provide feedback about the environment’s true state, triggering an update of the internal model. We apply PP to individual synapses, arguing that the dynamics of a synapse can be considered as an agent interacting with its cellular environment, and derive a synaptic learning rule by minimizing the surprise in individual synapses. This learning rule enables synapses to adapt their synaptic efficacy to best predict future postsynaptic spikes, which are registered by back-propagating action potentials ( bAPs ). In contrast to previous approaches ( e. g., [20] ) that used PP to understand the influence of neuromodulatory signals such as Dopamine on synaptic plasticity, we focus here on a PP perspective of synaptic plasticity [21, 22], unraveling the dynamics of a single synapse governed by only locally accessible quantities such as the pre- and postsynaptic-spike times and the current value of the synaptic efficacy. This is the only assumption made in our model. The presented synaptic plasticity rule follows directly from this assumed interaction between a synapse and its post-synaptic neuron. Predictive processing has emerged as a powerful normative theory to derive biologically plausible rules for synaptic plasticity from first principles, and a number of previous studies have explored this, e. g., to address the role of neural compartmentalization [21, 22], cortical mocrocircuits [23], and dendritic trees for few short learning [24]

. In the current study we focus on the temporal dynamics of the uncertainty that is being induced by sparse back-propagating action potentials and the role of noise in synaptic transmission. This synapse-centric view on predictive processing allows us to study the precise timing of synaptic dynamics in terms of spike-timing-dependent plasticity. We call our new model the synaptic predictive processing ( SPP ). The emergent synaptic plasticity rule reproduces a number of experimentally observed effects of long-term potentiation ( LTP ) and depression ( LTD ) protocols and predicts precise forms for the influence of synaptic and neuron parameters. The SPP suggests that synapses probe their environment by sending stochastic synaptic currents and integrate the arriving feedback ( bAPs ) to update their internal state ( synaptic efficacy ) to better predict the somatic dynamics. Thus, every stochastic release event can be seen as a “small experiment”, that is based on previous experience and the outcome of which shapes subsequent future activity. In other words, as we show here, the task of a synapse to learn suitable synaptic responses can be considered as a problem of behaving in a partially unknown environment, where the variability in synaptic release is being used to properly represent the uncertainty of the synapse about the cellular, environmental state. On the network level, our computer simulations indicate that SPP allows several thousand synapses to exploit their synaptic noise to successfully master different learning paradigms despite ambiguous or uncertain inputs.

. After the synapse has formed a model of the post-synaptic membrane potential ( the environment in PP parlance ), it can be used to reproduce state trajectories that match the learned behavior. For the SPP, this means that synapses install a particular firing pattern z through synaptic plasticity. To demonstrate this behavior, we consider here a simple example where a single postsynaptic and many pre-synaptic neurons are repeatedly brought to fire at different fixed offset times ( five example pre-synaptic neurons illustrated in Fig 3A, top ). According to the stochastic bridge model, the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron evolves according the mean and variance functions illustrated in Fig 3A, bottom. We forced all neurons to repeatedly fire according to the fixed pattern while the learning rule Eq ( 11 ) was active. SPP learning installs behavior in the synapses that supports ( or predicts ) the neuron dynamics ( Fig 3B–3D ). Individual PSCs after learning are shown for five example synapses in Fig 3B. The injected currents show high trial-by-trial variability, and the amplitude strongly depends on the relative pre- and post-synaptic firing. Despite these variabilities, the summed effect of all PSCs show a clear increasing trend towards the postsynaptic spike ( single trial shown in Fig 3C ). In this example, the optimal solutions of synaptic efficacies can be solved analytically. Fig 3D shows the theoretical and simulation results after learning. The synaptic efficacies learn single parameter distributions that encode the theoretically derived μ* and σ*. This is further studied in Fig 3E, where we plot the synaptic efficacies after learning for different values for μ* and σ*. As can be seen w* encodes μ* and σ*, but collapsed into a single value

. These results demonstrate that the SPP learning rule can be applied to supervised learning scenarios and also leads to self-organization of meaningful representations in an unsupervised learning scenario. To demonstrate the role of stochastic synapitc release in the pattern classification task, we created ambiguous patterns by mixing the spikes of two patterns ( ▫ and ☆ ) with different mixing rates ( Fig 4E ). Mixing rates of 0 ( 1 ) corresponds to a pattern that is identical to ▫ ( ☆ ). This can be encoded by a network with unreliable ( left, noisy synapses ) and with reliable synaptic transmission ( right, without noise ). However, intermediate values of the mixing rate result in high levels of ambiguity that are represented in the neural output of the network with unreliable synaptic transmission by high trial-by-trial variability, but not with noise-free synapses. In Fig 4F we further analyze the effect of the release probability r0. Networks were trained with different values of r0 ( 0. 1, 0. 3, 0. 7, 0. 9 ) and the output decodings for mixed patterns were evaluated as in Fig 4E. For too low a probability ( 0. 1 ), the network did not produce any output spikes, was not able to learn the patterns and the output decodings were consequently at chance level. Intermediate values of 0. 3 and 0. 7 resulted in good learning performance, but the networks were not able to represent uncertainties around the mixing rate of 1/2 well ( the case r0 = 0. 5 has the highest trial-by-trial variance ). Uncertainty representation was further degraded when r0 was increased to 0. 9. In summary, we found that a release probability around the maximum variance value of 0. 5 resulted in the best representation of uncertainty. In Fig 4G we study the effect of the number of spikes in the input patterns on the behavior of the network. The theoretical derivation of the learning rule assumes a large number of input spikes ( M → ∞ )

Synapses are inherently unreliable in transmitting their input to the post-synaptic neuron. For example, the probability of neurotransmitter release is typically around 50% [1–3] and can be as low as 20% in vivo [4]. In other words, up to 80% of synaptic transmissions fail due to release unreliability, providing one of the major sources of noise in the synapse. Pre- and post-synaptic noise sources result in a large trial-by-trial variability in the post-synaptic current ( PSC ) [5]. At the same time, synapses are very demanding in terms of energy consumption [6], suggesting that a large portion of the body’s energy intake dissipates by the unreliability of synaptic transmission. Similar to biological synapses also neuromorphic technologies are exposed to noise culminating in unreliable synaptic transmission [7–9]. The functional implication of noisy synaptic transmission, and whether it is a feature or bug in biological and artificial neuronal systems, is therefore highly debated [5, 10–13]. Here, we show that synapses can exploit noisy synaptic transmission to encode their uncertainty about the somatic membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron. Our results suggest that synapses use internal model of the postsyn membrane dynamics that is updated by a synaptic learning rule that resembles LTP/LTD mechanisms. This approach entails that synapses utilize their noisy release to encode uncertainty about the state of the postsyn potential. Although synapses strive to predict the dynamics of the postsyn neuron, the emergent dynamics of synapses in a network resolve learning problems such as classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment. Synapses coordinate to represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations

The article discusses the idea that synapses in the brain are noisy, which leads to large trial-by-trial variability. The authors propose that synapses use noise to represent uncertainty about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. They develop a mathematical framework where the synapse interacts with the soma of the postsyn neuron like an agent in an uncertain environment. This framework suggests synapses use an internal model of somatic dynamics updated by synaptic rule resembling LTP/LTD mechanisms. The approach entails syn utilizes noisy synaptic release to encode uncertainty of somatic potential. Each syn strives to predict somatic dynamics of postsyn neuron, but emergent dynamics of syn in network resolve learning problems like classification or closed control in dynamic environment. Synapses coordinate to represent and utilize uncertainties on network in behaviorally ambiguous situations.

The authors apply predictive processing (PP) to synapses, considering dynamics of syn as agent interacting with cellular environment and derive synaptic rule minimizing surprise. This rule enables syn to adapt efficacy to predict postsyn spikes. They focus on PP perspective of synaptic plasticity, unraveling dynamics of syn governed by locally accessible quantities. The synaptic rule follows interaction between syn and postsyn neuron. Predictive processing has emerged as normative theory to derive biologically rules for plasticity from principles. Previous studies have explored PP to address role of compartmentalization, cortical circuits, and dendritic trees for learning. The current study focuses on temporal uncertainty induced by backpropagating potentials and role of noise in transmission. Synaptic view on PP allows studying precise timing dynamics in spike-dependent plasticity. They call this model synaptic predictive processing (SPP). Emergent plasticity reproduces LTP/LTD effects and predicts influence synaptic parameters. S suggests syn probe environment by stochastic currents and integrate feedback to update efficacy to predict somatic. Every release can be seen as small experiment based on experience and outcome shaping future. On network level, simulations indicate S allows syn to master learning paradigms despite uncertain inputs.

The authors demonstrate SPP with simple example where postsyn and preyn neurons fire at fixed times. According to stochastic model, postsyn potential evolves mean and variance. They forced neurons to fire while learning rule active. S installs behavior in syn that supports or predicts dynamics. Individual syn after learning show variability and amplitude depends on pre and postsyn firing. Summed effect shows trend towards postsyn spike. Optimal efficacies can be solved analytically. Theoretical and simulation results show efficacies encode μ and σ. This is further studied with efficacies for different μ and σ. Results demonstrate S learning can be applied to supervised and unsupervised scenarios.

To study role of stochastic release in classification, they created patterns mixing spikes with different rates. Mixing 0 corresponds identical pattern. This can be encoded by network with unreliable synapses and transmission. Intermediate rates result high ambiguity represented in output with unreliable transmission but not noise. They analyze effect of release probability. Networks trained with values 0.1, 0.3,0.7,0.9 and output for mixed patterns evaluated. Low probability 0.1 did not produce output, not learn, and output chance. Intermediate 0.3 and 0.7 resulted good performance but not represent uncertainty around 0.5. Uncertainty degraded when 0.9. Found release around 0.5 resulted best representation.

They study effect of spikes in input on behavior.
Researchers have developed a new method, Scup, for reconstructing cell lineage trees from single-cell DNA sequencing data, addressing challenges such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors. Scup uses a probabilistic framework and neighbor-joining algorithm to compute distances between cells and reconstruct the tree. The method is embarrassingly parallel, making it faster than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining accuracy. Its robustness is investigated using synthetic and biological datasets of 18 cells. Single-cell sequencing enables detailed analysis of development and differentiation, and Scup is designed for healthy diploid data, but can be extended to cancer data by incorporating copy variations. The method is compared to state-of-art methods using synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells, showing better accuracy and faster runtime. The tree reconstruction of cell lineage from single data is a fundamental problem with potential for studies of development and differentiation. Various methods have been developed, including bulk, single DNA, and single RNA data, exploiting mutations to reconstruct trees. However, mutations are scarce in healthy tissues, highlighting the need for single DNA sequencing data, which reveals more mutations than other types but comes with challenges such as amplification errors and allelic dropouts. To compare methods, synthetic datasets were generated with ground truth trees and mutations, accounting for amplification, allelic, and sequencing errors. Scup is compared to SCI and Phylo using a fibro dataset of 18 cells, showing better accuracy and faster runtime.

    Title: 
    Abstract: An efficient allocation of limited resources in low-income settings offers the opportunity to improve population-health outcomes given the available health system capacity. Efforts to achieve this are often framed through the lens of “health benefits packages” ( HBPs ), which seek to establish which services the public healthcare system should include in its provision. Analytic approaches widely used to weigh evidence in support of different interventions and inform the broader HBP deliberative process however have limitations. In this work, we propose the individual-based Thanzi La Onse ( TLO ) model as a uniquely-tailored tool to assist in the evaluation of Malawi-specific HBPs while addressing these limitations. By mechanistically modelling—and calibrating to extensive, country-specific data—the incidence of disease, health-seeking behaviour, and the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the demand for care under realistic constraints on human resources for health available, we were able to simulate the health gains achievable under a number of plausible HBP strategies for the country. We found that the HBP emerging from a linear constrained optimisation analysis ( LCOA ) achieved the largest health gain—∼8% reduction in disability adjusted life years ( DALYs ) between 2023 and 2042 compared to the benchmark scenario—by concentrating resources on high-impact treatments. This HBP however incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of its implementation. Other feasible approaches to prioritisation were assessed, including service prioritisation based on patient characteristics, rather than service type. Unlike the LCOA-based HBP, this approach achieved consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario on a year- to-year basis, and a 5% reduction in DALYs over the whole period, which suggests an approach based upon patient characteristics might prove beneficial in the future.

   . Input from the Malawian Ministry of Health, as well as from several clinicians working in the country, was sought and accounted for at all development stages of the model, alongside a large number of data sources ( see [25] ). The analysis conducted in this work assumes the prioritisation policies evaluated are implemented from 1 January 2023 onward and extends to the following 20 years until 31 December 2042, inclusive, to capture the long term effects of the policies considered. As the output produced by the simulation is broken down by year, this allows us to evaluate the performance of the policies on any time period up to 20 years, as discussed in section 3. 3. The initial population size adopted ( in 2010 ) was 100, 000 individuals, and we performed 10 simulations per scenario considered, each with independent random draws; both numbers were found to be large enough to give stable estimates of the mean and variance of the health burden obtained under each cause included in the simulation over independent realisations. The results reported are scaled to the true population size in Malawi in 2010 of 14. 5 million individuals. The incidence of disease and disability among individuals in the TLO simulation, combined with assumed models for health-seeking behaviour ( see model’s overview paper [25] and references therein ), determine the number of people seeking specific healthcare system interactions ( HSIs ) at each of the healthcare facilities modelled in the simulation on any given day. Such HSIs can be both preventative and curative in nature, while the impact of a variety of non-medical initiatives ( such as outreach programmes on condom use for HIV prevention and contraception, use of insecticide treated bed nets, etc ) is captured through its effect on the probability of individuals contracting relevant diseases and subsequently seeking care

Using the TLO simulation, we evaluated a number of resource allocation strategies for Malawi ( summarised in section 2. 4 ) which either reflect current preferences in the prioritisation of services among policy-makers and external funding agents ( RMNCH, VP, and CMD policies ), mirror current analytical tools and approaches to prioritise health interventions ( HSSP-III HBP or LCOA ), or implement new strategies of prioritisation based on patient characteristics rather than service type ( CV policy ). In our evaluation, we assumed that prioritisation policies are enforced consistently for a 20-year period ( 2023–2042 ). We found that: The evaluation of the policies considered accounted for imperfect clinical practices motivated by country-specific data [26], as well as the probability of consumables stock-outs [28]. Our TLO-based approach, however, further allows us to evaluate how the relative performance of the policies would change were health-seeking and clinical practices to be significantly improved, and hence assess how much the outcome of specific policies is limited not by the design of the policies themselves, but by other factors related to the practical application of those policies. These will be addressed in future work. We have shown that the TLO simulation provides a unique tool with which to test HBPs designed specifically for Malawi, providing detailed evaluations on the health gains that can be achieved through the relative prioritisation of services given realistic constraints in available human resources for health while addressing limitations in other analytic methods commonly used to weigh evidence for different interventions. Although considerations of equity were not included in the analysis at this stage, they are already included in the TLO model, and will be the focus of later studies

. We therefore believe that our current approach provides an initial but balanced first step toward a realistic representation of resource constraints for the Malawian healthcare system, and we postpone an analysis of the above-mentioned factors to a later work. Finally, an optimal healthcare system should aim to maximise the care delivered without relying on the over-working of its medical workforce, or the reduction of time taken to deliver HSIs, to do so. The adoption of a rigid healthcare system assumption, therefore, is by definition fully consistent with the objective of our optimisation analysis. Playing an important role in the overall health outcome under a rigid healthcare system is the assumed persistence in health seeking, or how we model the behaviour of patients who have not received treatment on the day they first sought care due to capabilities having been exhausted: are patients likely to persist in seeking care, and if so, with what frequency will they do so? Will they continue to seek care at the same facility, or will they switch to a different provider? How does this behaviour depend on individual characteristics and the medical condition for which they seek treatment? We limited ourselves to considering a single scenario where patients continued to seek care on successive days for a maximum of seven days for all medical conditions. This scenario fails to capture a number of factors: individuals with chronic or long-term conditions may delay seeking treatment again by weeks or months, which may allow for a deterioration of their health in the meantime, potentially leading to a lower success rate in treatment in the long run. In the case of infectious diseases, the delay may lead to an increase in overall incidence of the disease among the population. Additionally, patients are more or less likely to persist in seeking care depending on the severity of their symptoms

. The TLO model is designed to comprehensively forecast, specifically in the context of Malawi, the health outcome achievable by any HBP while: Crucially, this country-specific predictive tool therefore addresses the limitations in CE evidence-based analyses outlined above, and as such can provide a useful and additional input to the country’s HBP generative process. In particular, our analysis evaluates a limited set of possible HBPs to establish the relative reduction in the overall health burden that could be achieved through different prioritisation strategies, and to showcase how model-based analyses can offer an important insight into the factors that make individual HBPs particularly successful or unsuccessful in achieving this outcome. The HBP performance evolution over time is also evaluated.

The TLO simulation, for the first time, allowed us to place a realistic constraint on the amount of health that the Malawian healthcare system is able to deliver based on data-driven estimates of human resources for health as well as time requirements for different types of appointments. Modelling assumptions required to enforce this in practice were summarised under the rigid healthcare system approach ( see section 2. 2 ) ; some uncertainty around these assumptions, however, exists in reality. [26] suggest medical practitioners in Malawi, on average, are likely to work overtime and/or adjust the duration of appointments to accommodate a high volume of patients per day. In this case, our analysis may therefore overestimate the health burden incurred when enforcing resource constraints in the analysis. This is perhaps most visible in the case of HIV/AIDS-caused DALYs, which incur a sharp increase in 2023 following the transition to a rigid healthcare system assumption ( see Fig B in S4 Appendix ) as the healthcare system struggles to meet the demand for HIV treatments. Only ∼35% of all HIV treatment requests between 2023 and 2024 are in fact delivered under the VP policy, which has the highest rate of HIV treatment delivery. MPHIA data [36], on the other hand, shows that most people ( 97. 9% ) diagnosed with HIV in Malawi are receiving antiretroviral therapy. This discrepancy suggests that, in reality, healthcare professionals are able to provide such services through a combination of overtime and/or reduction of appointment duration. Our results therefore confirm the extent to which the healthcare system relies on such practices to provide a much higher volume of service delivery than should be expected, and hence the benefits that could result from an increased efficiency in the delivery of HIV services in reducing the workload of HCWs

The study proposes the Thanzi Lae On (TLO) model as a tailored tool to evaluate health benefits packages (HBPs) in Malawi, addressing limitations of analytic approaches used to weigh evidence for interventions. The model mechanistically models and calibrates country-specific data on disease incidence, health-seeking behaviour, and healthcare capacity to meet demand under realistic resource constraints. Simulations of plausible HB strategies showed the linear optimisation-based HBP achieved largest health gains, an 8% reduction in disability-adjusted life years (DALs) between 2023-204 compared to a benchmark, concentrating on high-impact treatments. However, this HBP incurred excess DALs in the first years of implementation. Other prioritisation approaches were assessed, including service prioritisation based on patient characteristics rather than type, which achieved consistent gains relative to the benchmark and 5% reduction in DALs over the period. 

The TLO model was developed with input from the Malian Ministry of Health and clinicians, using large data sources. Analysis assumed prioritisation policies implemented from 2023 to 204 to capture long-term effects. The population size was 100,000 individuals, with 10 simulations per scenario, and results scaled to Malawi's 14.5 million population. Disease incidence and disability were determined by models of health-seeking behaviour. The TLO evaluated resource strategies for Malawi, including current prioritisation, analytical tools, and new approaches based on patient characteristics. 

The study found the TLO provides a tool to test HBs specifically for Malawi, evaluating health gains under realistic constraints and addressing limitations of other methods. Although equity considerations were not included, they are included in the model and will be focus of later studies. The approach provides a balanced representation of constraints for the Malian healthcare system, postponing analysis of factors to later. An optimal healthcare system aims to maximise care without over-working workforce or reducing delivery time, the adoption of a rigid system is consistent with the objective.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Precise regulation of chromosome dynamics in the germline is essential for reproductive success across species. Yet, the mechanisms underlying meiotic chromosomal events such as homolog pairing and chromosome segregation are not fully understood in many species. Here, we employ Oligopaint DNA FISH to investigate mechanisms of meiotic homolog pairing and chromosome segregation in the holocentric pantry moth, Plodia interpunctella, and compare our findings to new and previous studies in the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori, which diverged from P. interpunctella over 100 million years ago. We find that pairing in both Bombyx and Plodia spermatogenesis is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends. Additionally, both species form rod shaped cruciform-like bivalents at metaphase I. However, unlike the telomere-oriented chromosome segregation mechanism observed in Bombyx, Plodia can orient bivalents in multiple different ways at metaphase I. Surprisingly, in both species we find that kinetochores consistently assemble at non-telomeric loci toward the center of chromosomes regardless of where chromosome centers are located in the bivalent. Additionally, sister kinetochores do not seem to be paired in these species. Instead, four distinct kinetochores are easily observed at metaphase I. Despite this, we find clear end-on microtubule attachments and not lateral microtubule attachments co-orienting these separated kinetochores. These findings challenge the classical view of segregation where paired, poleward-facing kinetochores are required for accurate homolog separation in meiosis I. Our studies here highlight the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model systems, as employing novel organisms can lead to the discovery of novel biology.

    Here, we employed the Oligopaint DNA FISH technology to characterize meiotic chromosome dynamics in the holocentric pantry moth Plodia interpunctella for the first time. By visualizing single chromosomes at sub-chromosomal resolution, we found that meiotic homolog pairing during spermatogenesis is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends. This finding mirrors our previous studies in Bombyx mori, suggesting that this mechanism may be broadly conserved in Lepidopteran insects. Whether or not transcription, the transcription machinery, or transcripts themselves facilitate homolog recognition and pairing in Lepidoptera is an area for future study. Indeed, transcription has been associated with meiotic pairing in other species, such as S. pombe [49, 50], and with somatic pairing in species from flies to humans [51–54], suggesting that pairing may be regulated by similar mechanisms across species. How gene density may influence other early meiotic events such as the formation of double-strand breaks, and whether breaks are actually required for pairing in Plodia spermatogenesis, are areas of ongoing investigation. Intriguingly, while pairing is initiated at chromosome ends, chromosome ends are not used for chromosome segregation at metaphase I in Plodia. Instead, we observed that bivalents can be positioned in either a telomere- or center-oriented configuration at metaphase I ( with telomeres or centers facing the spindle poles, respectively ). Furthermore, chromosome centers act as kinetochore-recruitment sites in Plodia spermatogenesis. A similar mechanism was observed in Bombyx spermatogenesis, despite the fact that telomeres are always oriented toward spindle poles in this species. This mechanism of segregation differs from the cup-based segregation mechanism observed in the holocentric nematode C. elegans [15, 16] and the inverted meiosis observed in some holocentric plants [17]

. Our previous work in the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori, suggested that gene-rich chromosome domains near telomeres facilitate homolog recognition and that telomeres face the spindle poles for chromosome segregation in the male germline [35]. However, whether these findings apply to all Lepidopteran insects ( of which there are almost 200, 000 spanning more than 120 million years of evolution ) is unknown. Here, we employ a combination of Oligopaint DNA FISH and immunofluorescence to investigate meiotic chromosome dynamics in the pantry moth Plodia interpunctella and compare our findings to new and previous work in Bombyx. Plodia is a promising new laboratory model for genetics and genomics in Lepidoptera. While Bombyx have been used for decades as a model Lepidopteran system, creating transgenic Bombyx is extremely challenging and the feeding and space demands of rearing these large insects make them sub-optimal for laboratory research. Plodia, on the other hand, are small, their embryos are easy to inject, and several recent studies have demonstrated high success in creating transgenic strains using CRISPR and PiggyBac technologies [36, 37]. Our studies here demonstrate the suitably of using Plodia as a model system for studying both conserved and divergent aspects of meiotic chromosome biology. Using Oligopaints to label multiple domains along individual chromosomes in Plodia larval testes, we find that pairing in Plodia spermatogenesis is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends, similar to Bombyx. Additionally, both Bombyx and Plodia form rod shaped cruciform-like bivalents at metaphase I. However, while Bombyx bivalents always have telomeres oriented toward spindle poles at metaphase I in spermatogenesis, we find that Plodia bivalents can be either “telomere-oriented” ( telomeres facing spindle poles ) or “center-oriented” ( chromosome centers facing spindle poles )

. To test this, we performed the same co-IF-FISH assay with Dsn1 and Bombyx ch15 stripe paints in Bombyx 4th-5th instar larval testes squashes ( S5 Fig ). To our surprise, this experiment revealed that like Plodia, Bombyx telomeres are not utilized for kinetochore formation, despite their poleward-facing position. Instead, we observed Dsn1 localization away from telomeres and closer to the chromosome center, just as in Plodia ( S5 Fig ). Together, these data suggest that moths employ a novel “center-kinetic” segregation mechanism during spermatogenesis, where kinetochore formation is restricted to the center of the chromosome. This is a unique mechanism that differs from the mitotic holokinetic or holocentric segregation mechanism employed by these species. It is also distinct from the previously described meiotic mechanisms in holocentric species: telokinetic, kinetochore cups, and inverted meiosis. Finally, center-kinetic segregation is distinct from a classical “monocentric” segregation mechanism ( as observed in flies and mammals ) where kinetochores form at the endogenous centromere locus defined by the histone H3-variant CENP-A in every mitotic and meiotic cell. We noted that in both Plodia and Bombyx, two distinct sister kinetochores are present on each homolog, rather than the single, paired kinetochore observed during meiosis in other species [44]. This could pose an issue for proper bi-orientation of homologs, as the two sister kinetochores need to co-orient ( be attached to microtubules from the same spindle pole ). Sister kinetochore “splitting” as we observed here ( Figs 4, S4 and S5 ) has previously been shown to increase the probability of incorrect microtubule attachments, such as sister kinetochores attaching to microtubules from opposite spindle poles during metaphase I [45, 46]

. Intriguingly, we find that both Plodia and Bombyx form kinetochores at non-telomeric loci towards chromosome centers, even when telomeres are oriented toward spindle poles. We term this “center-kinetic” chromosome segregation. These central kinetochores do not seem to pair between sister chromatids, resulting in metaphase I structures with four distinct kinetochore foci. Despite the spacing between kinetochores, we observe clear co-orientation mediated by end-on microtubule attachments. This mode of chromosome segregation appears to be a completely distinct mechanism from that employed by these moths during mitosis, where they are holocentric, and it is distinct from other previously described mechanisms of meiotic segregation in holocentric species. Together, our studies reveal that unique mechanisms dictate chromosome segregation dynamics in Lepidopteran spermatogenesis.

. Together, these assays validate the P. interpunctella genome assemblies and demonstrate the specificity of our Oligopaints. Our previous studies in Bombyx revealed that meiotic homolog pairing in the male germline is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends. To test if this mechanism is conserved in Plodia, which diverged from Bombyx over 100 million years ago, we labeled one chromosome at a time using our stripe Oligopaints described above to quantify which chromosome region ( arms or center ) pairs first as cells progress through early meiotic prophase ( Fig 2A ) in early 5th instar larval testes. Analysis of pairing between Arm1, Arm2, and Center domain probes for all painted chromosomes revealed that like Bombyx, pairing in Plodia is initiated at distal chromosome arm domains more frequently than the central domain ( Fig 2B ). Interestingly, when we broke these pairing data down further, we found that in Plodia pairing is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends more frequently than non-gene chromosome ends ( Fig 2C ). This is consistent with our previous findings in Bomx and suggests that this mechanism may be conserved in Lepidopteran.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The median eminence ( ME ), located at the base of the hypothalamus, is an essential centre of information exchange between the brain and the pituitary. We and others previously showed that mutations and duplications affecting the transcription factor SOX3/Sox3 result in hypopituitarism, and this is likely of hypothalamic origin. We demonstrate here that the absence of Sox3 predominantly affects the ME with phenotypes that first occur in juvenile animals, despite the embryonic onset of SOX3 expression. In the pituitary, reduction in hormone levels correlates with a lack of endocrine cell maturation. In parallel, ME NG2-glia renewal and oligodendrocytic differentiation potential are affected. We further show that low-dose aspirin treatment, which is known to affect NG2-glia, or changes in gut microbiota, rescue both proliferative defects and hypopituitarism in Sox3 mutants. Our study highlights a central role of NG2-glia for ME function during a transitional period of post-natal development and indicates their sensitivity to extrinsic signals.

   . Our study highlights a novel role for NG2-glia in the post-weaning formation of a functional ME and its control of pituitary maturation, and that an otherwise robust phenotype due to loss of Sox3 in these cells can be modified by non-genetic factors.

SOX3 is widely expressed in the developing CNS [22], but it is also retained within some brain regions postnatally, notably the hypothalamus [26], where its expression is found in tanycytic neural stem cells ( NSCs ) and several differentiated cell types [29]. In contrast, we only observed SOX3 in rare cells within the pituitary representing a very small subset of lactotrophs ( S1A Fig ). Therefore, the hypopituitarism displayed by Sox3 mutants is likely to be of hypothalamic origin. To test this hypothesis, we used Nestin-Cre [30] and Pou1f1-Cre [31] to delete Sox3 in the CNS and the pituitary respectively. Pituitary hormonal contents were then measured by radio immunoassay ( RIA ) in two-month-old males ( Fig 1A ). While Nestin-Cre animals display a modest but significant reduction in growth hormone ( GH ) levels, as we previously reported [32], we observed a significant reduction of GH contents in Nestin-Cre; Sox3floxGFP/Y mice compared to both Nestin-Cre and Sox3floxGFP/Y controls. This 75% reduction in Nestin-Cre; Sox3floxGFP/Y mice is comparable to that measured in Sox3-/Y mutant males ( Fig 1A, [26] ). In contrast, in Pou1f1-Cre; Sox3floxGFP/Y mice, neither GH ( Fig 1A ) nor Prolactin ( PRL ) ( S1B Fig ) contents are affected. These data are therefore in agreement with a CNS origin of the hypopituitarism displayed by Sox3-/Y animals. To avoid undesirable effects originating from the Nestin-Cre transgene, we pursued our subsequent analyses on Sox3-/Y animals. We then measured GH contents at different time points after birth to determine when deficits appear in Sox3-/Y males ( Fig 1B ). After birth, GH levels rise normally in mutants compared to Sox3+/Y animals, but decline sharply shortly after weaning, down to 25% of the levels observed in Sox3+/Y animals at two months of age

. In contrast, in Sox3 mutants, their volume does not significantly increase during the same period ( Fig 1F ). This suggests that hormonal secretory capacity/maturation is affected in mutants. We directly examined this aspect by performing transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and observed a striking reduction in the number of secretory granules in cells of Sox3-/Y ALs ( Fig 1G ), implying impaired endocrine cell terminal differentiation. Altogether these data show that the hypopituitarism displayed by Sox3-/Y mice is of hypothalamic origin. The consequence, at the pituitary level, is an impairment of endocrine cell maturation, which becomes apparent after weaning and results in the production of insufficient levels of hormones. To determine the origin of the hypothalamic defect, we analysed SOX3 expression in more detail ( Fig 2A ). SOX3 is expressed in cells lining the third ventricle and in scattered cells in the surrounding parenchyma. In the latter, it is present in some neurons ( NeuN, Figs 2B and S2A ), as previously shown [29], and in a few astrocytes ( GFAP, Figs 2C and S2A ) and NG2-glia ( PDGFRa, Figs 2E–2F and S2A ). SOX3 is also present in Nestin+ve tanycytes ( Fig 2D ). Beside these 3 cell types, it is likely that SOX3 is alos expressed in neuroblasts and during oligodendrocyte differentiation, as shown in the spinal cord [24]. Within the ME, SOX3 is found in NG2-glia ( PDGFRa, Fig 2E; NG2, S2B Fig ), but not in MAG+ve oligodendrocytes ( S2C Fig ). Because SOX3 is expressed in hypothalamic tancyte NSCs, and SOXB1 proteins are known to be required for NSC emergence and maintenance ( for review see [21] ), we first performed in situ hybridization for the tanycyte marker Rax [36]. Rax expression pattern between Sox3-/Yand Sox3+/Yanimals is similar, albeit possibly slightly reduced in Sox3-/Y hypothalmi, suggesting that deletion of Sox3 does not affect tanycyte emergence ( Fig 2G )

. Notably this was accompanied by reappearance of the hypopituitarism, with Gh expression being reduced in Sox3-/Y FT animals compared to Sox3+/Y FT animals ( Fig 6E ). We then analysed the oligodendrocyte lineage, particularly in the ME, of NIMR, Crick and FT Sox3+/Y and Sox3-/Y animals. The reduction in the number of PDGFRa+ve NG2-glia, MAG+ve mature oligodendrocytes and concomitant increase of APC+ve cells observed in NIMR Sox3-/Y mice ( Figs 5B–5D and 6F–6G ) was confirmed in FT Sox3-/Y ME but absent in Crick Sox3-/Y ME ( Fig 6E–6F ). Altogether, these data indicate that changes of gut microbiota affect oligodendrocyte lineage composition in ME, and occurrence of hypopituitarism in Sox3-/Y mutants. In conclusion, because NG2-glia in the ME are the cells mostly affected by Sox3 loss and their proliferation, but not differentiation to oligodendrocytes, is corrected by either low-dose Aspirin treatment or by a ‘Crick-typical’ profile of gut microbiota, we propose that sufficient numbers of NG2-glia are required in the ME to support pituitary cell maturation as the animal becomes independent at weaning.

. There are exceptions, however. For example, SOX2 and SOX3 are maintained in spinal cord oligodendrocyte precursors, where they are required for their subsequent differentiation [24]. In both humans and mice, mutations in SOX3/Sox3, which is located on the X chromosome, are associated with hypopituitarism ( for review see [25] ). In mice, we showed that SOX3 is largely absent from the pituitary, but it is found in the developing and mature hypothalamus, being particularly highly expressed in the embryonic infundibulum and later maintained in the ME ( [26] and this study ). Here, we aimed to characterise the role of SOX3 in the hypothalamus and the etiology of the hypopituitarism. Using conditional gene deletion, we show that loss of Sox3 in the central nervous system ( CNS ) is sufficient to cause hypopituitarism and that this develops postnatally, at the time of weaning. Consequently, we observe in the pituitary a defective maturation of endocrine cells. SOX3 is expressed in hypothalamic stem cells and its deletion affects their proliferation in vivo and in hypothalamic neurosphere assays. SOX3 is also expressed in NG2-glia in the ME, and both their proliferation and differentiation are reduced in Sox3 mutants. Furthermore, we observe a striking deficiency in myelination of axons in the ME. Importantly, the appearance of all these defects correlates with development of hypopituitarism suggesting that SOX3 is required postnatally for the functional maturation of the ME. Building on previous work demonstrating the efficacy of aspirin in inducing proliferation and/or differentiation of NG2-glia [27, 28], we treated Sox3 mutants with low dose aspirin. We observed a restoration of NG2-glia proliferation, and a rescue of pituitary hormonal deficiencies, but not a rescue of myelination of axons. These data indicate that NG-glia in the ME play a critical role in pituit cell maturation and are sensitive to extrinsic signals, such as those from the gut microbiota. Our study highlights a novel role for NG-glia in the postnatal development of the ME and its control of pituitary maturation, and shows that otherwise robust phenotype due to loss of Sox can be modified by non-genetic factors.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Coordinated activation and inhibition of F-actin supports the movements of morphogenesis. Understanding the proteins that regulate F-actin is important, since these proteins are mis-regulated in diseases like cancer. Our studies of C. elegans embryonic epidermal morphogenesis identified the GTPase CED-10/Rac1 as an essential activator of F-actin. However, we need to identify the GEF, or Guanine-nucleotide Exchange Factor, that activates CED-10/Rac1 during embryonic cell migrations. The two-component GEF, CED-5/CED-12, is known to activate CED-10/Rac1 to promote cell movements that result in the engulfment of dying cells during embryogenesis, and a later cell migration of the larval Distal Tip Cell. It is believed that CED-5/CED-12 powers cellular movements of corpse engulfment and DTC migration by promoting F-actin formation. Therefore, we tested if CED-5/CED-12 was involved in embryonic migrations, and got a contradictory result. CED-5/CED-12 definitely support embryonic migrations, since their loss led to embryos that died due to failed epidermal cell migrations. However, CED-5/CED-12 inhibited F-actin in the migrating epidermis, the opposite of what was expected for a CED-10 GEF. To address how CED-12/CED-5 could have two opposing effects on F-actin, during corpse engulfment and cell migration, we investigated if CED-12 harbors GAP ( GTPase Activating Protein ) functions. A candidate GAP region in CED-12 faces away from the CED-5 GEF catalytic region. Mutating a candidate catalytic Arginine in the CED-12 GAP region ( R537A ) altered the epidermal cell migration function, and not the corpse engulfment function. We interfered with GEF function by interfering with CED-5’s ability to bind Rac1/CED-10. Mutating Serine-Arginine in CED-5/DOCK predicted to bind and stabilize Rac1 for catalysis, resulted in loss of both ventral enclosure and corpse engulfment. Genetic and expression studies strongly support that the GAP function likely acts on different GTPases. Thus, we propose CED-5/CED-12 support the cycling of multiple GTPases, by using distinct domains, to both promote and inhibit F-actin nucleation.

   . There are 18 other GEFs found in C. elegans. Several have been shown to regulate embryonic development, mainly by regulating CDC-42 or RHO-1 [62, 51, 63]. We are investigating GEFs that act on CED-10. During epidermal cell migrations, CED-5/CED-12 have an important role limiting the activity of CDC-42, and this requires the proposed CED-12 GAP function. We previously published the surprising observation that in wsp-1 ( gm324 ) mutants, which are approximately 30% lethal, epidermal F-actin is too high, and the cells migrate too quickly [21]. This resembles what we show here for loss of the CED-12 GAP function. Perhaps in GAP mutants with excess CDC-42, too much WSP-1 is activated, which also promotes excessive branched F-actin. This suggests too much or too little WSP-1 has same phenotype: too much F-actin, and some dead embryos. Similar findings have been shown for regulators of the RHO-1 pathway [31, 32]. During epidermal cell migrations, CED-5/CED-12 have an important role limiting the activity of RHO-1, and this requires the proposed CED-12 GAP function ( Figs 6B, 6C, 6F and 7E ). If RHO-1 is overly active, more actomyosin would form, driving more linear F-actin. It was possible that excess RHO-1 would increase membrane and cortical tension, thus inhibiting protrusions, as has been proposed [64]. However, increased epidermal F-actin correlated with increased leading edge membrane dynamics ( Fig 2C ), suggesting excess RHO-1 supported protrusions, perhaps through increased tension, as has been shown in some migrating cells ( Reviewed in [65] ). A second consequence of excess RHO-1, given that levels of actin can be limiting in some cell types [66], is reduced monomeric actin available to form branched actin. At this time, we do not have tools to specifically monitor branched actin vs

CED-5/DOCK-180 and CED-12/ELMO act as a bipartite GEF that promotes active CED-10/Rac1 during the engulfment of cells that die by programmed cell death in C. elegans [13–17]. We showed that CED-10/Rac1 also acts to promote the tissue migration known as ventral enclosure that leads the epidermis to enclose the developing C. elegans embryo [2] ( Fig 1A ). However, the GEF for CED-10/Rac1 during this process is not known. To test if CED-5 and CED-12 are required during embryonic epidermal cell migrations, we crossed null or strong loss of function alleles of ced-5 ( n1812 ) [20] and ced-12 ( n3261 ) [17] into a strain that expresses F-actin only in the epidermis ( lin-26p:: Lifeact::mCherry, Fig 1B, strains are listed in the Methods ) [21]. Staged embryos that were oriented with ventral tissues facing up ( towards the cover slip ) were imaged from 280 to 320 minutes after first cleavage. These 4D movies of live embryos showed that wild type embryos are enriched for F-actin at the leading edge of the migrating row of ventral cells, as previously shown [3, 22]. Timing the migration, from the first appearance of leading cell edge protrusions, to when the leading cells met at the ventral midline, took approximately 20 minutes at 23°C ( Fig 1C ). We use the term “protrusion” here and throughout, since the leading cells ( and all cells along the ventral edge ) make membrane extensions that encompass both lamellipodia and filopodia ( see also Fig 2C ). Loss of the GTPase CED-10/Rac1, showed significantly reduced levels of F-actin in leading cells, and arrested migrations, as would be expected for the removal of a major activator of branched actin ( Fig 1B–1D ). Only one leading cell is visible in the ced-10 ( tm597 ) embryo due to the enclosure failure and the angle of the movie

. The original ced-10 alleles were hypomorphic alleles that interfered with the ability of cells to engulf dying cells [4, 5]. Identifying null alleles of ced-10 revealed a second role for CED-10: promoting embryonic morphogenesis [6, 2]. CED-10 was proposed to recruit and activate the WAVE complex, which in C. elegans is essential for embryonic organ tissue formation and tissue migrations [2, 7]. GTPases are proposed to be recruited and activated at membranes by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors, GEFs, that enhance the exchange of GDP for GTP, thus activating the GTPase ( Reviewed in [8, 9] ). The GEF for CED-10 during corpse engulfment was proposed to be CED-5/DOCK180 [5] CED-5 was also proposed to act as the GEF for CED-10 during neuronal migrations [10]. However, the CED-10 GEF or GEFs that promote embryonic epidermal movements are not known. CED-5/DOCK180 is a DOCK GEF which requires an ELMO protein to activate Rac [11]. In C. elegans, CED-5/DOCK180 works with CED-12/ELMO to activate CED-10 during corpse clearance ( Proposed by [12]; [13–17] ). During corpse engulfment CED-5/CED-12 and CED-10 are proposed to act in neighboring cells, to enclose dying cells, by promoting F-actin polymerization in membrane protrusions that encircle dying cells. F-actin was shown to enrich around dying cells in the germline and embryos [18, 19], and then disappear as the corpse decayed. While some studies noted that CED-12 appears to have an embryonic role [13], the role of CED-5 and CED-12 during embryonic development, and epidermal morphogenesis has not been investigated. We present here analysis of the role of CED-5/DOCK and CED-12/ELMO, during epidermal morphogenesis, that shows these cell death regulators also support epidermal migrations. We therefore investigated if CED-5/CED-12, a candidate GEF for CED-10 during embryonic epider cell migrations, could also act as GEF for other Gases.
Researchers investigated the hierarchical organization of temporal processing in the rodent visual system using information-theoretic and autocorrelation analysis. They found that information and timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. Intrinsic times for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, whereas predictability was stimulus-dependent. These observations were reproduced in a basic network model with correlated sensory input. The findings suggest that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher areas while reducing predictability for an efficient neural code. A hierarchical organization of temporal processing was observed in the visual pathway of the mouse cortex, with a gradual increase in correlation and timescales and decrease in predictability along the anatomical hierarchy. Analysis of data from different conditions and network models indicated that timescales are supported by stimulus-independent network-intrinsic mechanisms, such as increasing recurrence along the anatomical. The decrease in predict is in line with efficient coding and observed in rodents, as well as formation of increasingly invariant, high-level visual representations, and might be a hallmark of hierarchical processing in mammals. The hierarchy of times was more shallow under spontaneous activity, indicating visual stimulation affects the times hierarchy. However, times and timescales were similar between stimulation and spontaneous, mirroring findings in somatosensory cortex. The results indicate network-intrinsic mechanisms, such as increase in recurrence, shape the temporal hierarchy. Such mechanisms cause stronger correlations in population codes, yielding long times of consistency and stable representations for readout and accumulation in higher areas.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with broad potential for new applications, but the neural circuits that are engaged during TMS are still poorly understood. Recordings of neural activity from the corticospinal tract provide a direct readout of the response of motor cortex to TMS, and therefore a new opportunity to model neural circuit dynamics. The study goal was to use epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn through which the mechanisms underlying the response to TMS, including direct and indirect waves, could be investigated. An in-depth sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify important pathways, and machine learning was used to identify common circuit features among these pathways. Sensitivity analysis identified neuron types that preferentially contributed to single corticospinal waves. Single wave preference could be predicted using the average connection probability of all possible paths between the activated neuron type and L5 pyramidal tract neurons ( PTNs ). For these activations, the total conduction delay of the shortest path to L5 PTNs determined the latency of the corticospinal wave. Finally, there were multiple neuron type activations that could preferentially modulate a particular corticospinal wave. The results support the hypothesis that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, activation of both afferents to the motor cortex as well as specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiated different I-waves, and the results were interpreted to propose the cortical origins of afferents that may give rise to certain I-waves. The methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analyses on complex models and relating the results to the network structure to both identify and understand mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation.

    Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) can non-invasively activate superficial cortical regions to study brain functions, treat psychiatric and neurological disorders, and collect diagnostic biomarkers [1]. However, improving methodologies and developing new applications remain slow and challenging due to the uncertainties about what is activated by TMS and how this activation courses through the circuits within and beyond the stimulated region [2]. One approach to understanding these network effects in the motor cortex is via descending volleys of activity that propagate to the spinal cord in response to TMS and can be recorded epidurally as transient corticospinal waves ( Fig 1 ). The corticospinal waves represent the activity of layer 5b pyramidal tract neurons ( PTNs ) that send axons into the spinal cord [3]. The shortest latency direct wave ( D-wave ) is widely agreed to represent the direct activation of PTNs [4]. Subsequent waves are called indirect waves ( I-waves ) and likely represent transsynaptic activations of PTNs resulting from the initial direct activation of PTNS, axons of afferents, and other neuron types. Understanding the neurons and circuits that produce the I-waves would provide insight into patterns of neuron activation and the circuit connections that mediate the cortical response to TMS [5]. Current understanding of I-waves arises from epidural recordings combined with pharmacological interventions that identified the synaptic receptors involved in I-wave generation and broadly suggested excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms that contribute to I-waves [5, 6]. These and other experimental findings were organized into conceptual frameworks to propose mechanisms that give rise to the corticospinal waves [5, 6]. Two broad categories of these frameworks are I-wave generation through circuit activations and I-wave generation via intrinsic neuronal mechanisms ( neural oscillator hypothesis )

. 1% ( Fig 8B ). The most important feature to identify which corticospinal wave a preferential parameter affected was the conduction delay of the shortest path between the starting neuron and the L5 PTNs, and the validation accuracy was 81. 6% ( Fig 8C and 8D ). Although the sensitivity analysis identified important circuit mechanisms ( i. e., activations and projections ) involved in corticospinal wave generation, the subsequent machine learning analysis identified the anatomical bases that explained how and why the circuit mechanisms had a preferential effect. This secondary structural analysis provides a method for identifying fundamental principles involved in the neural response to acute stimulation.

. With circuit activation, corticocortical afferents are thought to initiate activations in different neuronal populations that propagate through the cortical circuit to L5 PTNs. Intrinsic neuronal mechanisms have also been hypothesized to allow L5 PTNs to behave as neural oscillators such that the I-waves result from repeated spiking from the same neuron due to the dynamics following initial excitation by TMS. Computational neuronal network models have been developed that integrate anatomical and electrophysiological details to investigate TMS-induced corticospinal waves. A model by Esser et al. represented the major layers of motor cortex using spiking point neurons and homogeneous activation of a proportion of fiber terminals across all layers to represent activation by single TMS pulses [7]. Rusu et al. developed a network model of layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons with realistic dendritic morphologies to investigate the effect of somatodendritic conduction and integration on I-wave generation [8]. These models generated I-wave activity that qualitatively resembled experimental findings. However, the models were not directly constrained by experimental recordings and lacked an exhaustive sensitivity analysis to investigate, among other variables, the effects of inhomogeneous activation across different neuron types. To determine the TMS activations and neuron-to-neuron projections that contribute to I-waves, we used experimental recordings of the corticospinal response to TMS to provide objectives to optimize a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn. Starting from a reduced version of the Esser model, that could produce I-waves and is mathematically compact, we established a spiking neuronal network model of motor cortex that reproduced the features of D-waves and I-waves recorded epidurally in the cervical spine of human subjects

. Communications across adjacent macrocolumns, i. e., intracortical afferents, could alter the corticospinal response to TMS as they represent “afferent” inputs to macrocolumns that arise within the motor cortex. Their interactions could further modulate I-waves through both excitatory and direct inhibitory projections, and the latencies of the feedback will likely cause adjacent macrocolumns to contribute toward late I-waves. The analysis could also be improved by including more types of data. Experimental data from only two subjects was used with responses from a single TMS intensity. The data were representative of the two qualitative types of responses—with and without D-wave. The small dataset allowed for more rapid model development due to fewer optimization constraints, and the methods established in this work can be applied in the future to extended data from more subjects and more recordings within subject. Furthermore, the optimization included only a single stimulus intensity as a constraint. Incorporating corticospinal recordings in response to multiple stimulus intensities from the same subject could reveal differences in effect size or engaged mechanism as a function of intensity. Additionally, the predictions from the model are limited to the single pulse response and are not readily extendable to paired pulse or repetitive pulse paradigms. This is partly due to GABABR parameters being underconstrained. GABABR conductance was partially constrained by the baseline firing rate objective but has been shown to have no effect on I-waves [38]. However, GABABR is important for the cortical silent period [39] and paired pulse responses [40], and these data can be incorporated as optimization objectives in future work. Including more interneuron types such as somatostatin or vasoactive intestinal peptide expressing interneurons would further disambiguate contributions of both GABAAR and GABABR

. The analysis identified that: the D-wave was most sensitive to the activation of L5 PTNs, the I1-wave was most sensitive to direct activation of afferents to L5 PTNs followed by activation of L2/3 IT and L6 IT, the I2-wave was most sensitive to activation of basket cells, and the I3-wave was most sensitive to activation of afferents to L2/3 ITs. The sensitivity analysis predicted that multiple parameters could preferentially influence each I-wave. To identify any shared features that may predict preferential influence on the same corticospinal wave, a secondary analysis was conducted ( Fig 8 ). The anatomical properties of the macrocolumn, such as the distances between neurons and connection probabilities, remained invariant during optimization. These invariant properties were quantified using a graph theoretical analysis, and machine learning was used to identify patterns in the network structure that contributed to corticospinal wave generation. Because only the L5 PTNs contributed to the signal recorded in the corticospinal tract, the relationships between neuron types to the L5 PTNs were characterized by deconstructing the network graph into simple paths, i. e., paths with non-repeating nodes. All directed simple paths for all neuron types leading to L5 PTNs were characterized for analysis. See Methods for detailed descriptions of the graph characterizations. Recursive feature elimination was used to identify the features with the best classification performance ( Fig 8A and 8C ). The most important features to identify parameters that preferentially activated a single corticospinal wave were a strong average connection probability to L5 PTNs and whether the overall effect on the L5 PTNs was excitatory or inhibitory ( Fig 8B and 8 ). These features explained 81. 6% of the variance in corticosp wave ( Fig 8 and 8 ). The results support the hypothesis that different pathways contribute to corticosp waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, activation of affer to the cortex as well as specific types within the motor cortex initiated Iaves and the results suggest the origins of affer that give rise to Iaves. The methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analysis on complex models relating the results to network to identify mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation. 

The final answer is: 

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with broad potential for new applications, but the neural circuits engaged during TMS are poorly understood. Recordings of neural activity from the corticospinal tract provide a direct readout of the response of motor cortex to T, and a new opportunity to model circuit dynamics. The goal was to use epidural recordings from the spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of motor cortical macro through the mechanisms the underlying response to T, including direct and indirect waves, could be investigated. An-depth analysis was conducted to identify pathways and machine was used to identify circuit features among these. Sensitivity identified neuron types that preferentially to cortispinal waves.

Cell-free placental DNA (cDNA) is present in maternal circulation throughout gestation and has been detected as early as the fourth week of pregnancy, comprising approximately 40% of total plasma cell-free DNA. Since its discovery in 1997, cDNA has been used in clinical non-invasive testing (NIPT) to screen for fetal aberrations, notably chromosomal aneuplies. However, the basic biology of cDNA remains poorly understood, limiting its research and clinical utility. Characterization of cDNA features by release mechanisms can provide real-time insights into placental health, a powerful tool for longitudinal studies of development and disease. Improved understanding of biological mechanisms is required to leverage cDNA as a tool for assessing placental health and screening complications.

cDNA originates mainly from trophlasts, the major placental cell type, and is more accurately referred to as cell-free placental DNA (cDNA). Reports of first trimester cDNA in anembry pregnancies, presence before fetal circulation, and cell release in placental studies provide evidence of trophlastic origin. Detection of cDNA in maternal plasma and correlation between placental and cDNA methylomes solidify the placenta as source. Increased cDNA in conditions involving placental dysfunction, such as preeamps, placenta accreta, and previa, point to placental origin, hypothesized due to trooblast death.

Absolute quantification of cDNA is required for characterization across gestation and pathologies, achievable by spike controls sequencing. Markers for identifying cDNA in pregnancies regardless of sex and genotype have been proposed. Regions differentially methylated between placenta and white cells are candidate markers. cDNA carries placental genome status and has been proposed for differentiating cDNA from maternal. cDNA methylation has potential for research and nonvasive screening. Investigation of epigen modifications, such as hydroxymethylation, in cDNA is a research direction.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Hormone-dependent cancers ( HDCs ) share several risk factors, suggesting a common aetiology. Using data from genome-wide association studies, we showed spatial clustering of risk variants across four HDCs ( breast, endometrial, ovarian and prostate cancers ), contrasting with genetically uncorrelated traits. We identified 44 multi-HDC risk regions across the genome, defined as overlapping risk regions for at least two HDCs: two regions contained risk variants for all four HDCs, 13 for three HDCs and 28 for two HDCs. Integrating GWAS data, epigenomic profiling and promoter capture HiC maps from diverse cell line models, we annotated 53 candidate risk genes at 22 multi-HDC risk regions. These targets were enriched for established genes from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census, but many had no previously reported pleiotropic roles. Additionally, we pinpointed lncRNAs as potential HDC targets and identified risk alleles in several regions that altered transcription factors motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Known drug targets were over-represented among the candidate multi-HDC risk genes, implying that some may serve as targets for therapeutic development or facilitate the repurposing of existing treatments for HDC. Our approach provides a framework for identifying common target genes driving complex traits and enhances understanding of HDC susceptibility.

    Breast, endometrial, ovarian and prostate cancers are hormone-dependent cancers ( HDCs ) that together account for up to 30% of new cancer diagnoses each year [1]. These cancers share several environmental, behavioural and genetic risk factors, suggesting a common aetiology [2, 3]. This premise is supported by genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) which have identified hundreds of cancer-specific risk loci [4–7] and multiple pleiotropic loci associated with at least two HDCs [8–11]. The detection of pleiotropic loci suggests that shared genetic factors likely contribute to polygenic risk of HDCs and raises the possibility of common driver genes and biological pathways. A key aim of post-GWAS is to identify the target gene ( s ) that are affected at each GWAS region. This is complicated by the fact that most risk variants reside in noncoding regions of the genome making it difficult to interpret how they contribute to cancer susceptibility [12]. Target gene mapping for pleiotropic loci typically relies on statistical approaches such as expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTL ) and transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) [9, 10, 13]. However, these methods are limited by small sample sizes which reduces power, the use of steady-state gene expression and the lack of data from relevant tissues. Orthologous functional assays provide complementary mapping approaches to better define regulatory variants and connect them to their target genes.

. Additionally, the lack of suitable baits for selected promoters, the lower resolution for short-range interactions, and the transient, cell type-specific nature of chromatin interactions may contribute to false negatives. It is also important to note that interactions between risk variants and gene promoters do not infer causality and that follow-up studies are required to interpret GWAS results. In summary, our study expands the repertoire of risk regions and candidate risk genes for HDCs, providing further insights into the complex genetic architecture and biology underpinning HDC susceptibility. The candidate mHDCR gene list was enriched for known cancer genes and drug targets, which provides support that other, less-well-characterized genes at mHDCR regions may play important roles in HDC development. Our approach highlights the value of performing integrative analyses of genetics and functional genomics to enhance pleiotropic cancer gene identification. Combined with future research that investigates functional mechanisms, our results may serve to redirect efforts to more promising targets for new drugs or allow drug repurposing for HDC treatment.

. 01 ) were downloaded from regulomedb. org. From this dataset, we extracted two key metrics: the RegulomeDB ranking, where a score of 1 indicates stronger supporting evidence for regulatory function and probability scores, where a score of 1 indicates higher likelihood that a variant is regulatory ( S4 Table ). ChromHMM data was available for three breast, five prostate, three ovarian and one endometrial tissue sample or cell line. We annotated the chromatin states of all potential regulatory variants using ChromHMM signatures [20] ( S4 Table ). Previous studies have performed functional assays for some of the noncoding variants in individual HDCs [21–24]. For example, Lawrenson et al used 3D mapping and reporter assays to show that breast and ovarian cancer risk variants at 19p13 influence distal enhancers, which in turn regulate ABHD8 expression [22]. Furthermore, Stegeman et al used reporter assays to show a prostate cancer risk variant alters microRNA binding to the MDM4 3’UTR [23]. These studies provide additional support that the variants can impact target gene expression through various mechanisms. An initial analysis identified 17 candidate mHDCR genes ( across 11 mHDCR regions ) that contain exonic, promoter or potential splicing variants associated with two or more HDCs ( Figs 2B and S1C and S5 Table ). For those candidate mHDCR genes with promoter variants, all were supported by evidence of cell-type-specific regulatory activity from ChromHMM ( S4 Table ). Additionally, six are cancer genes based on information from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer ( COSMIC [25] ), while the remaining genes may represent new pleiotropic HDC risk genes. One example is the PAX9 transcription factor ( TF; mHDCR region 18 ) [26] which has a missense breast cancer risk variant plus promoter and intronic breast and prostate cancer risk variants ( Fig 2C )

While most GWAS variants are dispersed across the genome, several genomic regions harbour variants for multiple cancer types, suggesting common target gene ( s ) may drive these associations. Independent signals for HDC were obtained from large-scale GWAS, meta-analyses and fine-mapping ( 196 breast [4], 17 endometrial [5], 60 ovarian [6] and 258 prostate cancer index variants [7] ). To assess whether HDC variants were more frequently positioned together than would be expected by chance, we defined “clusters” when variants associated with two or more HDCs were co-localized within the same 100 kb window. We compared observed cluster frequency to a null distribution, generated by randomly shuffling variants one million times ( see Methods ), and recounted cluster occurrence in each random set. This resulted in a statistically significant increase in observed frequency ( Fig 1A; P < 10−6, permutation test ). As an additional comparison, index variants for four genetically uncorrelated traits [14] were obtained from the Open Target Genetics portal ( 179 for coronary artery disease, 22 lung cancer, 38 Alzheimer’s disease and 94 Parkinson’s disease [15] ). These traits showed similar genomic distributions to randomly generated background regions ( Fig 1A ), which provided support that HDC risk regions co-localize in the genome and that these regions likely contain pleiotropic variants and common target genes. To identify candidate multi-HDC risk ( mHDCR ) regions, we extended the variants of each HDC by 0. 5 Mb on either side, resulting in cancer-specific risk regions. mHDCR regions were defined as areas where the cancer-specific risk regions of at least two HDCs overlapped ( Fig 1B ). We did not consider linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) between variants of each cancer type, focussing solely on their positional relationships. In total, 44 mHDCR regions were identified across the genome ( Fig 1C and S1 Table )

. Rs2236007 ( breast ) and rs12882923 ( prostate ) were the top-ranked variants on RegulomeDB and mapped to transcriptionally active open chromatin ( ChromHMM TSS signatures in breast and prostate samples; S4 Table ). Previous studies in breast cells showed that the rs2236007 risk g-allele reduced PAX9 promoter activity [27], via recruitment of the suppressive TF EGR1 and increased breast cancer cell growth [28]. Furthermore, rs12882923 maps to a POL2RA binding site and the DNA motif of multiple TFs in prostate epithelium ( Fig 2C ), suggesting the variant has functional impact. Most of the identified HDC risk variants are noncoding ( S1A Fig; ~94% ), and a subset of these will map to DNA regulatory elements that modulate gene transcription through long-range chromatin interactions [29]. To compile a comprehensive list of candidate mHDCR genes, we next intersected the intronic and intergenic HDC variants with the 44 mHDCR regions. Promoter capture HiC ( PCHiC ) was used to assign distal regulatory variants to their target gene promoters ( Fig 3A ). PCHiC probes were designed to 2774 HindIII fragments containing 3096 GENCODE gene promoters that fall within the 44 mHDCR regions ( S6 Table ). PCHiC data was derived from twelve breast, endometrial, ovarian and prostate non-tumorigenic and cancer cell lines, as described previously [30] ( S2A Fig and S7 Table ). Using an interaction score threshold ( CHiCAGO score ≥ 5 ) we detected 8–19, 000 high-confidence interactions per cell type across the 44 mDC regions ( Fig 3B and S Table S2 ). Candidate mDC genes were defined as those with at least one high-confidence interaction ( CHCAGO ≥ 5 ) in at least one cell type ( Fig 3C and S Table S3 ). In total, 53 candidate mDC genes were identified across 22 mDC regions ( Fig 3 and S Table S4 ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: Recently we characterized polymyositis in the Dutch Kooiker dog. The familial occurrence of the disease were suggestive of an inherited cause. Here we report the results of our molecular genetic investigation. A genome-wide association study of 33 cases and 106 controls indicated the involvement of a region on chromosome CFA19 ( p = 4. 7*10−10 ). Haplotype analysis indicated that the cases shared a 2. 9 Mb region in the homozygous or the heterozygous state. Next Generation Sequencing of genomic DNA implicated a deletion of a 39 kb DNA fragment, located 10 kb upstream of the neighbouring interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. The frequency of the deletion allele was 0. 81 in the available cases and 0. 25 in a random sample of the Kooiker dog breed. Leukocytes of affected, untreated dogs that were homozygous for the deletion overexpress IL21 and IL2 upon stimulation with mitogens. We suggest that elements located 10–49 kb upstream of the IL21/IL2 locus play an important role in the regulation of the canine genes and that deletion of these elements is a risk factor for polymyositis in Kooiker dogs. Postulating causality, the penetrance of the disease phenotype was estimated at 10–20% for homozygous dogs and 0. 5–2% for dogs that were heterozygous for the deletion. Our results suggest that distant variants upstream of IL21 could also be important for human autoimmune diseases that have been found to be associated with the IL21/IL2 chromosome region.

   . Follow-up experiments should be directed to fine-mapping of the DNA elements in the 39 kb fragment that are involved in the expression of IL21. By targeted deletion of smaller DNA fragments in a wild-type cell line, capable of IL21 expression in response to stimulation, these elements could be identified. Genome-wide association studies established a possible role of the IL21/IL2 region in the human autoimmune diseases RA, SLE, type 1 DM, and SS [33]. No DNA variants have been identified that are instrumental in the risk of the diseases. Our results indicate that these variants may be found at a distance of at least 10 kb upstream of the IL21 gene. Our study unequivocally demonstrates the involvement of the IL21/IL2 locus in polymyositis in the Kooiker dog. However, the responsible DNA element and its function in inflammatory processes are yet to be discovered. It will be interesting to learn whether human cases of autoimmune diseases that map to the IL21/IL2 locus carry specific variants in the region syntenic to the 39 kb deletion. Meanwhile, the PCR assay to genotype the deletion allele in Kooiker dogs provides a tool for breeders to prevent the birth of high risk dogs and reduce the incidence of polymyositis in the breed.

Kooiker dogs presented an autoimmune myopathy that we could analyze genetically because of the homogeneous makeup of the breed population. We linked the disease to a deletion of a DNA region of 39 kb, upstream of two interleukin genes. The obtained LOD score is well above the threshold value of 3. 0, which is conventionally considered proof of linkage. The score of 4. 7 means that the likelihood that the phenotype is linked to the DNA variant is 104. 7 = 50, 000 times larger than the likelihood that they are not linked. The deleted region does not contain protein-coding exons according to the recent genome annotation ( UU_Cfam_GSD_1. 0 ). We postulated that the deletion affects the regulation of one or both of the adjacent interleukin genes IL21 and IL2, thereby increasing the risk for superfluous inflammatory reactions. According to data in TADKB [26], the two genes are located on the same topologically associating domains ( TADs ) in diverse human cell lines, suggesting their expression could be coordinated. Indeed, the expression of both genes is enhanced strongly in PBMCs from untreated PM affected Kooiker dogs that are homozygous for the deletion. Leukocytes from a control dog that did not have the deletion showed little change of expression of the genes. The expression study needs to be replicated in a larger cohort to confirm the effect of the 39 kb deletion on the regulation of the genes. Interestingly, a similarly sized deletion upstream of IRGM in humans has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease 19 ( Crohn disease 19 ) [27]. The deletion of 20 kb at a distance of 2, 7 kb from IRGM leads to up- or downregulation of the gene, depending on the cell type. The mode of inheritance of Kooiker dog PM seems to be semidominant with incomplete penetrance. Of the cases, 65% is homozygous for the deletion and 33% is heterozygous. Homozygotes tend to develop the disease at a younger age than heterozygotes

. With approximately 15, 000 Kooiker dogs from which the cases were recruited, and a deletion allele frequency of 0. 25, we estimate that the penetrance of PM is between 0. 1 and 0. 2 for homozygous dogs and between 0. 005 and 0. 02 for heterozygous dogs, depending on the report level of all cases to the breed club. It is very well possible that other inherited factors modify the risk of PM in Kooiker dogs. Only two of 102 available Kooiker dogs with PM do not have the deletion. These two dogs have the same mother while their fathers are first cousins. Possibly these two cases are phenocopies with a completely different pathogenesis. It is also possible that the two isolated cases share yet unknown risk factors with other cases. The role of IL-21 in autoimmunity has been studied extensively ( reviewed in [28] ). Mainly expressed by activated CD4+ T cells, it promotes the proliferation of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells. Overexpression of IL-21 is observed in tissues and sera of human patients with autoimmune diseases such as systematic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ), rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ), type 1 diabetes mellitus ( DM ), and primary Sjögren syndrome ( SS ) [28, 29]. Specifically, expression of the IL21 gene was found to be upregulated in patients with PM and dermatomyositis [12]. Clearly, enhanced expression of IL21 can be instrumental in the etiology of these autoimmune diseases. The role of the interleukin encoded by the neighboring gene IL2 in autoimmunity seems to be the opposite of that of IL-21. Not overexpression but Il2 knockout leads to a disrupted immune response and predisposition to inflammatory bowel disease [30, 31]. The interleukin IL-2 has been investigated as a therapeutic agent in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases with promising results [32]. We conclude that dysregulation of IL21 expression is the most likely cause of PM in Kooiker dogs

. Inspection of the resequenced region with IGV showed that all 8 affected dogs were homozygous for a deletion of 39 kb, located 10–49 kb upstream of IL21 ( Fig 2 ). The deletion stretched from CFA19 positions 18, 414, 090–18, 453, 526 ( UU_Cfam_GSD_1. 0 annotation NC_049240. 1:g. 18414090_18453526del = ). Judging from the read coverage of the 39 kb region, two of the controls were heterozygous for the deletion. The deletion fragment did not contain nor overlapped with known protein-coding genes. The later generated whole genome sequences of three Kooiker dogs, one of which was homozygous for the deletion allele and two that were heterozygous, did not reveal variants in the critical region that justified further investigation ( S6 Table ). All variants in the region with a predicted high or moderate effect on protein function were represented in the variant database dog10k derived from genome sequences of 1987 dogs with substantial frequencies [25]. Low impact variants that appeared to be in complete LD with the 39 kb deletion in the three dogs were also represented in dog10k. We concluded that the 39 kb deletion was the most likely and only risk factor for the development of PM in the CFA19 region, i. e. without allelic heterogeneity. A PCR assay with three primers was developed that distinguished the deletion allele from the reference allele by the length of the respective products ( Fig 3 ). Of the available cases, 66 were homozygous for the deletion, 34 were heterozygous and two were clear of the deletion. The frequency of the deletion allele was 0. 81 in the cases and 0. 25 in a random group of Kooiker dogs. The assay confirmed that two of the controls included in the NGS analysis were heterozygous. The genotype distribution ( Fig 3C ) of the cases differed from that of the random group with a chi-square test p-value of 5*10−157

An autoimmune-mediated inflammatory myopathy ( IM ) was seen with increasing frequency in the breed of Nederlandse Kooikerhondjes, named Koo dogs. The disease was characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles of the hind legs and forelimbs. Histopathological examination of muscle biopsies showed inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes and macrophages in the endomysium and perimysium of the muscle fibres. The disease was named polymyositis ( PM ). The breed was homogeneous with a population size of approximately 15, 000 dogs, making it possible to perform a genome-wide association study ( GWA ) to identify the genetic cause of the disease. A GWA of 33 cases and 106 controls indicated the involvement of a region on chromosome C19 ( p 4. 7*10−10 ). Haplotype analysis showed that cases shared a 2.9 Mb region in homozygous or heterozygous state. Next-generation sequencing of genomic DNA implicated a deletion of a 39 kb fragment located 10 kb upstream of the interlein genes IL21 and IL2. The frequency of the deletion was 0.81 in cases and 0.25 in a random sample of the breed. Leukocytes of affected dogs that were homozygous for the deletion overexpressed IL21 and IL upon stimulation with mitogens. We suggest that elements 10–49 upstream of the IL/IL locus play a role in the regulation of the genes and deletion of these is a risk for PM in Kiker dogs. Postulating the penetrance of the disease was 10–20 for homozyg dogs and 0.5–2 for dogs that were heterozygous for the deletion. Our results suggest that variants upstream of IL could also be important for human diseases that have been associated with the IL/IL chromosome.
Researchers have developed a protein language model, ESMm, to predict protein stability using a large-scale dataset of 528 natural and de novo sequences from 461 domains, accommodating deletions, insertions, and multiple mutations. They fine-tuned ESM on the folding of small domains and showed it generalizes to sequences distant from the training set, demonstrating the potential for transfer learning to reduce experimental burden. The model's performance on larger proteins lags behind state-of-the-art, highlighting the need for a larger stability dataset mirroring the distribution of sequence lengths in nature. A mega-stability dataset of 776k sequences from 479 domains was used to fine-tune a language model, p, ESM, from E-2, as an end-to-end stability predictor. ESM performs comparably to state-the models and generalizes to small sequences. Training on an ensemble of domains improves performance for folding prediction. The model generalizes well to small domains but is weaker on larger proteins, suggesting a bias towards shorter sequences. A large-scale dataset of longer sequences is needed to improve generalizability.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors ( iKIRs ) are a family of inhibitory receptors that are expressed by natural killer ( NK ) cells and late-stage differentiated T cells. There is accumulating evidence that iKIRs regulate T cell-mediated immunity. Recently, we reported that T cell-mediated control was enhanced by iKIRs in chronic viral infections. We hypothesized that in the context of autoimmunity, where an enhanced T cell response might be considered detrimental, iKIRs would have an opposite effect. We studied Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) as a paradigmatic example of autoimmunity. In T1D, variation in the Human Leucocyte Antigen ( HLA ) genes explains up to 50% of the genetic risk, indicating that T cells have a major role in T1D etiopathogenesis. To investigate if iKIRs affect this T cell response, we asked whether HLA associations were modified by iKIR genes. We conducted an immunogenetic analysis of a case-control T1D dataset ( N = 11, 961 ) and found that iKIR genes, in the presence of genes encoding their ligands, have a consistent and significant effect on protective HLA class II genetic associations. Our results were validated in an independent data set. We conclude that iKIRs significantly decrease HLA class II protective associations and suggest that iKIRs regulate CD4+ T cell responses in T1D.

   . In this model, prevention of engagement of CD94/NKG2A, either by antibody-blockade or by knockin of a mutated ligand, resulted in elimination of autoreactive T cells and improvement of EAE. Furthermore, in studies of a murine T1D model, NOD mice immunized with Complete Freund’s adjuvant, NK cells decreased the numbers of autoreactive CD8+ T cells preventing T1D [50]. Similarly, NK cells can suppress CD8+ T cell-mediated hyperglycemia in a mouse model characterized by the transgenic expression of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus on β-cells [51]. Perhaps, NK cells and Treg cells act in synergy to suppress autoreactive T cell responses and prevent autoimmunity. How functional iKIR modify HLA associations in T1D and whether similar modifications are seen in other autoimmune disease are exciting and important areas that merit further research. One limitation of this work is that the iKIR-ligand binding groups which we use in our definition of “functional iKIR” are simplistic. Incomplete knowledge of how different KIR and HLA alleles and different ( HLA bound ) peptides affect KIR-HLA binding and signalling precludes a more sophisticated definition. Nevertheless, these simple groupings have proved very powerful in other studies [52–57]. With this definition of inhibitory score, we saw clear and reproducible results both in the T1D cohorts and in the HIV-1, HCV and HTLV-1 cohorts. This suggests that the inhibitory score is a meaningful metric. It is worth noting that in the majority of the analyses, the score is only used to split the cohorts in half, so second order changes to the calculation of the score will not necessarily change the results ( because a person’s score can change considerably, and they will still remain in the same strata ). The importance of this work is twofold. First, we have identified a family of genes that significantly impact T1D risk

. The two main mechanisms of increased T cell survival are inhibition of activation-induced cell death ( attributed to iKIRs expressed on T cells ) and inhibition of NK cell-mediated killing of activated T cells ( attributed to iKIRs expressed on NK cells ) [8–11]. We have previously found that iKIRs together with their ligands significantly enhance CD8+ T cell survival in humans [7]. Furthermore, iKIRs with their ligands also enhance protective and detrimental HLA class I associations and have a significant impact on the clinical outcome of three different chronic viral infections [10, 12]. We distinguish this modulation of protective and detrimental HLA associations by functional iKIR, which we suggest is due to a modulation of T cell responses by iKIR, from a main effect of functional iKIR, which we suggest is more likely to be NK cell-mediated [10, 12]. Evidence for a main effect of iKIR or functional iKIR in T1D is weak. Since 2003, 15 studies have reported KIR gene associations with T1D risk, but none has been consistently reproduced and, in a recent meta-analysis, no associations survived correction for multiple comparisons [13]. A few studies have explored functional iKIR associations i. e. associations between iKIR-HLA ligand gene pairs and T1D [14–16] but again, results are not consistent across the studies. The impact of functional iKIR on HLA associations has not been studied. We postulated that, given their impact on adaptive immune responses in chronic viral infections, iKIRs might play an analogous role in autoimmunity. Associations between HLA class II genes and T1D are clear evidence that CD4+ T cells play a role in T1D. We hypothesized that if iKIRs modulate CD4+ T cell responses then this should be manifest as an iKIR modulation of HLA class II genetic associations

Our aim was to conduct an immunogenetic analysis to study the role of iKIRs in autoimmunity. Specifically, we wanted to investigate whether functional iKIR genes have a significant impact on HLA associations in T1D. This interaction is clinically significant in other contexts; we previously reported that functional iKIR genes enhanced protective and detrimental HLA disease associations in chronic viral infections. We postulated that a similar effect might be relevant in autoimmunity. We have analyzed a large ( N = 11, 961 ) case-control T1D dataset to investigate the effect of functional iKIR genes on HLA class II genetic associations. We found that a low number of functional iKIR genes ( iKIR genes together with the genes encoding their corresponding HLA class I ligands ), enhanced the dominant protection conferred by DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02. The effect was driven by iKIR-ligand pairs rather than HLA ligands alone, which are independently associated with T1D. The same results were observed for the other 9 protective HLA class II genotypes in our cohort; for all but two infrequent genotypes, the results were statistically significant and the effect was observed at all iKIR stratifications considered. The odds of observing this effect across all protective genotypes by chance is low ( P = 2×10−8 ). Moving onto an independent replication cohort, an identical result was observed with protective class II genotypes being more protective in individuals with a low number of functional iKIR genes. Again, the probability of observing this result by chance was low ( P = 1×10−5 ). In striking contrast, functional iKIR had no consistent impact on detrimental class II associations. Most detrimental genotypes showed no iKIR modification at all

. We sought to test this hypothesis by investigating the impact of iKIRs on HLA class II disease associations in T1D using a large ( N = 11, 961 ) case-control dataset from the UK Genetics Resource Investigating Diabetes ( UK-GRID ). We identified a consistent and significant functional iKIR modification of HLA class II protective associations. The size of this effect was striking, for instance the odds ratio of iKIR in DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02+ individuals is 6. 12; one of the largest genetic effects reported in T1D in recent decades and is replicated across all protective class II genotypes. These findings are reproduced in a smaller independent dataset consisting of 342 US multiplex T1D families from the Human Biological Data Interchange ( HBDI ). Our immunogenetic analyses show that genes encoding iKIRs with their ligands decrease protective class II genetic associations, consistent with a picture in which iKIRs modulate T cell-mediated regulation of autoimmunity.

Type 1 Diabetes ( T1D ) is a common autoimmune disease characterized by insulin-deficiency due to the destruction of insulin-producing islet β-cells. The exact aetiology of T1D remains elusive, but environmental triggers are thought to initiate the break in peripheral tolerance in genetically susceptible individuals. The largest genetic contributors to susceptibility to T1D are the human leucocyte antigen ( HLA ) genes [1, 2]. Within the HLA region, the closely linked classical class II HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA1 genes display the strongest associations indicating that CD4+ T cells have a major role in T1D etiopathogenesis. In particular, DRB1*04:01/02/04/05-DQA1*03:01-DQB1*03:02 and DRB1*03:01-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01 haplotypes are associated with the highest T1D susceptibility whereas DRB1*15:01-DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02 is associated with dominant protection [3]. Here we investigated the role of inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors ( iIR ) in modulating CD4 T cell responses in T1. iIR are expressed by NK and late-differentiated T cells and have been shown to regulate cell-mediated immunity [4, 5]. We hypothesized that in the context of autoimmunity, where an enhanced T response might be detrimental, iIR would have an opposite effect. We conducted an immunogenetic analysis of a large T1 dataset ( N = 11 , 961 ) and found that iIR genes in the presence of genes encoding their ligands have a consistent and significant effect on HLA class II genetic associations. Our results were validated in an independent set. We conclude that iIR significantly decrease H class II protective associations and suggest iIR regulate CD+ T responses in T1.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy ( FECD ) is an age-related cause of vision loss, and the most common repeat expansion-mediated disease in humans characterised to date. Up to 80% of European FECD cases have been attributed to expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat element ( termed CTG18. 1 ) located within the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor encoding gene, TCF4. The non-coding nature of the repeat and the transcriptomic complexity of TCF4 have made it extremely challenging to experimentally decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease. Here we comprehensively describe CTG18. 1 expansion-driven molecular components of disease within primary patient-derived corneal endothelial cells ( CECs ), generated from a large cohort of individuals with CTG18. 1-expanded ( Exp+ ) and CTG 18. 1-independent ( Exp- ) FECD. We employ long-read, short-read, and spatial transcriptomic techniques to interrogate expansion-specific transcriptomic biomarkers. Interrogation of long-read sequencing and alternative splicing analysis of short-read transcriptomic data together reveals the global extent of altered splicing occurring within Exp+ FECD, and unique transcripts associated with CTG18. 1-expansions. Similarly, differential gene expression analysis highlights the total transcriptomic consequences of Exp+ FECD within CECs. Furthermore, differential exon usage, pathway enrichment and spatial transcriptomics reveal TCF4 isoform ratio skewing solely in Exp+ FECD with potential downstream functional consequences. Lastly, exome data from 134 Exp- FECD cases identified rare ( minor allele frequency <0. 005 ) and potentially deleterious ( CADD>15 ) TCF4 variants in 7/134 FECD Exp- cases, suggesting that TCF4 variants independent of CTG18. 1 may increase FECD risk. In summary, our study supports the hypothesis that at least two distinct pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation, both underpin the pathophysiology of FECD. We anticipate these data will inform and guide the development of translational interventions for this common triplet-repeat mediated disease.

   . 1 expansions. In conclusion, this study supports the hypothesis that at least two distinct pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation, underpin the pathophysiology of the transcriptionally distinct CTG18. 1-mediated FECD. In our established primary corneal endothelial system, we see evidence of TCF4 isoform dysregulation at the TCF4 transcript level and can detect the potential downstream effects of the isoform-specific pattern of TCF4 dysregulation. Our data also suggests that, in rare instances, irrespective of CTG18. 1 expansions, FECD cases can harbour TCF4 variants that may independently induce isoform-specific TCF4 dysregulation and act as risk factors for disease. This supports the hypothesis that TCF4 dysregulation is a key mechanism underlying this common, age-related and visually disabling disease. We anticipate that concepts and biomarkers identified by this study will inform and guide the development of future translational interventions targeting this triplet-repeat mediated disease, and these in turn may act as exemplars for much rarer and currently untreatable and severe repeat expansion disorders that typically affect less accessible neurological/neuromuscular systems.

FECD is now recognized to be the most common repeat expansion-mediated disease in humans, with up to 80% of European FECD cases harbouring CTG18. 1 expansions [4]. The non-coding nature of the repeat and the transcriptomic complexity of TCF4 have made it extremely experimentally challenging to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease. Thus, many aspects of its pathophysiology remain elusive, despite the strong mechanistic parallels with other repeat-mediated diseases, and the urgent clinical need for new treatments for this common and visually disabling disease. To tackle this challenge, we employed a large, biologically independent set of primary FECD case-derived CEC lines and numerous complementary transcriptomic methodologies to gain novel mechanistic insight into both RNA toxicity driven and TCF4 dysregulation-related molecular features of this repeat-mediated disease. By including both Exp+ and Exp- FECD data, we have been able to dissect out more generic downstream biomarkers that occur irrespective of CTG18. 1 expansion status. Our extensive long- and short-read RNA-Seq data and spatial transcriptomic analysis of FECD case-derived CEC lines demonstrates that, in addition to being a spliceopathy, expansion-positive FECD is concurrently associated with isoform-specific patterns of TCF4 dysregulation, hence providing novel mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of this triplet-repeat mediated disease. Furthermore, we have identified a subset of Exp- FECD cases with rare and potentially deleterious TCF4 variants, supporting the hypothesis that dysregulation of TCF4 itself irrespective of CTG18. 1 expansions may also be a risk factor for FECD. Our robust transcriptomic analysis, presented within a biologically relevant cellular and genomic context, highlights an array of novel molecular signatures driven by CTG18

. Furthermore, given that domains in the AD3-containing isoforms can also dictate intracellular location and dimerization partners of TCF4, we also hypothesise that additional TCF4-driven functional implications of this shift occur within affected CECs that requires future experimental investigation. Interestingly, a recent single-cell ( sc ) RNA-seq study has identified that varying levels of TCF4 expression exist within discrete populations of healthy CECs [46]. It was not possible as part of this study to genotype CTG18. 1 whilst concurrently analysing transcriptomic profiles of the CEC populations, thus future development and application of scRNA-seq in combination with single cell genotyping of CTG18. 1 within FECD-case derived CEC samples is anticipated to shed light on if and how genomic instability of this repeat element within the corneal endothelium may drive and/or exacerbate the pathophysiology and explain the unique vulnerability of this cell layer to CTG18. 1 expansions. [47, 48] Additionally, we identify rare and predicted deleterious TCF4 variants in 7/134 Exp- FECD cases. This was notable to us given the high levels of evolutionary constraint acting on TCF4 and suggests such rare variants may be acting as risk factors for FECD, independently of CTG18. 1 repeat expansion. This could also in-part explain the established missing heritability of the disease [4] and does further reinforcing the hypothesis that dysregulation of TCF4 itself is pivotal to the pathophysiology of FECD. Despite a rare variant gene-burden style analysis of these data not reaching significance, we observed an emerging trend whereby a subset of qualifying variants identified notably affected regions of the gene not included by the vast majority of TCF4 isoforms. Hence, they can only be predicted to exert a functional impact on a small subset of total TCF4 transcripts

. Expansion-positive ( Exp+ ) FECD represents by far the most common disease within this category. However, to date, it has only been established that it affects the cornea, which is in contrast to the majority of the other much rarer non-coding repeat expansion disorders that typically have devastating outcomes on neurological and/or neuromuscular systems. Despite these differences, strong mechanistic molecular parallels exist between CTG18. 1-mediated FECD and other non-coding repeat expansion diseases, whereby multiple pathogenic mechanisms occur concurrently to drive pathology [8, 9]. We, and others, have demonstrated that RNA toxicity comprising splicing dysregulation attributed to the accumulation of CUG-containing RNA foci and sequestration of splicing factors MBNL1 and MBNL2 within affected cells, is a key feature of FECD in the presence of one or more expanded CTG18. 1 alleles [6, 7, 10–12]. Alongside this RNA induced toxicity, repeat-associated non-AUG ( RAN ) dependent translation of the expanded repeat, and dysregulation of TCF4 itself have also been hypothesised to contribute to the underlying pathology of CTG18. 1 Exp+ mediated FECD [13]. However, a comprehensive understanding of consequences and role of both the spliceopathy and downstream effects of the TCF4 dysregulation have yet to be characterised in parallel in the same model system. Furthermore, because TCF4 comprises >90 alternative spatially and temporally expressed isoforms, deciphering transcript-specific level dysregulation has proven to be extremely challenging and a consistent pattern of TCF4 dysregulation has yet to be associated with CTG18. 1 expansions in corneal endothelial cells ( CECs ) [14–16]. Such diversity is reflected in the varied functional roles TCF4 plays in human development, alongside the range of human disease associated with TCF4 variants in addition to FECD

. These examples, alongside the emerging evidence that the Exp+ FECD displays distinctive pathological features and epidemiological characteristics [5, 7], suggests that Exp+ FECD should be categorised as a distinct clinical entity. We suggest integrating CTG18. 1 genotyping into routine FECD clinical care pathways is warranted, especially given the numerous international efforts underway to develop gene-directed therapies for CTG18. 1-mediated FECD [27, 41, 42, 45]. Our complementary RNA-seq approaches, in combination with the spatial resolution of T4 isoforms in CECs, have provided novel mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of this disease. We anticipate these findings will inform and guide the development of translational interventions for this common repeat-mediated disease, and may serve as exemplars for rarer and currently untreatable and severe expansion disorders typically affecting neurological/neuromuscular systems.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Direct seeding is employed to circumvent the labor-intensive process of rice ( Oryza sativa ) transplantation, but this approach requires varieties with vigorous low-temperature germination ( LTG ) when sown in cold climates. To investigate the genetic basis of LTG, we identified the quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) qLTG11 from rice variety Arroz da Terra, which shows rapid seed germination at lower temperatures, using QTL-seq. We delineated the candidate region to a 52-kb interval containing GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14h ( GF14h ) gene, which is expressed during seed germination. The Arroz da Terra GF14h allele encodes functional GF14h, whereas Japanese rice variety Hitomebore harbors a 4-bp deletion in the coding region. Knocking out functional GF14h in a near-isogenic line ( NIL ) carrying the Arroz da Terra allele decreased LTG, whereas overexpressing functional GF14h in Hitomebore increased LTG, indicating that GF14h is the causal gene behind qLTG11. Analysis of numerous Japanese rice accessions revealed that the functional GF14h allele was lost from popular varieties during modern breeding. We generated a NIL in the Hitomebore background carrying a 172-kb genomic fragment from Arroz da Terra including GF14h. The NIL showed superior LTG compared to Hitomebore, with otherwise comparable agronomic traits. The functional GF14h allele from Arroz da Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.

    Low-temperature seed germination ( LTG ) is a pivotal agronomic trait in rice ( Oryza sativa ). As rice originated from tropical and subtropical regions, it is highly susceptible to low-temperature conditions compared to other cereal crops such as wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) and barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) [1]. Nevertheless, rice is produced in temperate and high-altitude regions, where it frequently experiences temperatures below 20°C. In Japan, rice is abundantly cultivated in relatively cold areas such as Tohoku and Hokkaido. In recent years, there has been an increasing demand to shift from conventional transplantation-based rice cultivation to direct seeding to reduce labor and costs. However, direct seeding raises the risk of exposure to low temperatures during seed germination [2]. Therefore, to expand the use of direct seeding, it is crucial to breed rice cultivars with enhanced LTG. LTG is a quantitative trait regulated by complex molecular mechanisms. Linkage mapping and genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have identified over 30 LTG-related quantitative trait loci ( QTLs ) or genomic regions associated with this trait, located on all 12 rice chromosomes [3–20]. However, only a few genes involved in LTG have been described, such as qLTG3-1 [3] and STRESS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN16 ( OsSAP16 ) [15]. The qLTG3-1 gene, encoding a protein of unknown function, has a substantial influence on LTG [3]. During seed germination, qLTG3-1 expression is strongly induced in embryos, which leads to the loosening of the tissues covering the embryo by promoting vacuolation [3]. OsSAP16 encodes a stress-associated protein with two AN1-C2H2 zinc finger domains [15]. OsSAP16 presumably acts as a regulator of LTG. 14-3-3 proteins are regulatory proteins that are widely conserved in eukaryotes

In this study, we identified GF14h as being implicated in LTG. In a previous study, a genetic complementation assay with a functional GF14h allele introduced into the rice cultivar Nipponbare background increased the germination rate at 30°C, but only to a limited extent at 15°C [28]. This result is not consistent with our finding that introducing functional GF14h into Hitomebore resulted in a significant improvement in germination at low temperature. Perhaps this discrepancy is due to differences in the rice varieties used in the germination assays. Notably, the haplotypes of qLTG3-1, a major QTL behind LTG [3], are different between Nipponbare and Hitomebore: whereas Nipponbare, which was released in 1961, harbors the functional allele of qLTG3-1, Hitomebore carries a loss-of-function allele with a deletion of 71 bp ( S2 Fig ) [37]. Moreover, the cultivars Koshihikari and Hayamasari, which carry the same loss-of-function qLTG3-1 allele as the Hitomebore variety, were reported to exhibit lower germination rates at low temperatures than Nipponbare [37]. LTG tests using chromosome segment substitution lines derived from a cross between Koshihikari and Nipponbare indicated that qLTG3-1 contributes to the difference in LTG between the two varieties [37]. Based on these observations, it is likely that Nipponbare has a better LTG ability than Hitomebore, which may have masked the effect of functional GF14h on LTG in the previous study [28]. Our study confirmed the involvement of GF14h in LTG through map-based cloning and analysis of knockout and overexpression lines. It is also worth mentioning that our experiments were performed in the qLTG11-NIL background, which allowed us to isolate the contribution of GF14h to LTG without any influence from qLTG3-1 or other genes in the Arroz da Terra background. In summary, we provided multiple lines of evidence that GF14h contributes to LTG

. These proteins bind to phosphorylated serine and tyrosine residues in their target proteins that participate in signal transduction and the regulation of gene expression [21, 22], thus altering their enzymatic activity, subcellular localization, stability, or protein–protein interactions [23–25]. The rice genome encodes eight 14-3-3 proteins, named GF14a–h for GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14 [26]. GF14h is involved in rice seed germination under optimal temperature conditions [27, 28]. In addition, GF14h contributes to phytohormone signaling, including abscisic acid and gibberellin signaling [27, 28]. However, it remains unclear whether GF14h promotes seed germination under low-temperature conditions [28]. QTL pyramiding has been proposed as a breeding concept [29] for bringing together several QTLs ( or genes ) related to agronomically important traits in the genetic background of locally adapted elite cultivars. In practice, it is essential to generate pre-breeding materials for QTL pyramiding, i. e., near-isogenic lines ( NILs ) that harbor one or a few genomic segments introgressed from the donor parent into the genome of the recipient parent through a combination of continuous backcrossing and selfing via marker-assisted selection [30]. In this study, we determined that GF14h is responsible for an LTG-related QTL in Portuguese rice variety Arroz da Terra. We generated a NIL in the background of rice cultivar Hitomebore, which is adapted for growth in northern Japan, by replacing its GF14h genomic fragment with that from Arroz da Terra and tested its LTG performance.

. However, the frequency of varieties carrying loss-of-function alleles for both GF14h and qLTG3-1 has increased since crossbreeding began in the early 20th century. This trend has continued to the present, perhaps as a result of artificial selection to improve resistance to pre-harvest sprouting, with more than 80% of all varieties bred since 2001 carrying these loss-of-function alleles. Our study provides a historical perspective on allelic shifts in Japanese rice breeding while highlighting the influence of modern breeding on genetic diversity. Further research is needed to elucidate the potential effects of higher frequencies of loss-of-function alleles on the overall phenotypic characteristics and ecological adaptability of Japanese rice varieties. In addition, as mentioned in previous reports [27, 28], we believe that the reintroduction of functional alleles should be considered in order to develop cultivars suitable for labor-saving cultivation techniques such as direct seeding. Cultivation stability under direct seeding conditions is important for managing rice production costs and reducing labor. However, since rice is sensitive to low temperatures, improving seed germination and seedling establishment at low temperatures is a desirable breeding trait in high-latitude rice production areas such as Japan. In the current study, we developed a potentially useful NIL ( NIL-GF14hArroz ) by introducing the functional GF14h allele into the Hitomebore background. Overexpressing this functional GF14h allele was previously shown to improve anaerobic germination and tolerance to seedling establishment under anaerobic conditions in laboratory experiments [27]. However, whether NIL-GF14hArroz exhibits strong seedling vigor at low temperatures in rice fields remains to be determined. We previously identified a QTL associated with seedling vigor, qPHS3-2 ( QTL for plant height of seedling 3–2 ) [38]

We investigated seed germination characteristics of a Portuguese rice variety Arroz da Terra and a Japanese varieties Iwatekko and Hitomebore. Under low-temperature conditions, Arroz Terra showed rapid germination, whereas Hitb exhibited slow germination. We mapped the QTL qG11 to a 52-kb interval containing the GENERALULATORY FACTOR14 ( GFh ) gene. The Arroz Terra allele encodes functional GFh whereas Hitb harbors a 4-b deletion in the coding region. Knocking out GFh in a near-isogenic line ( NIL ) carrying Ar da allele decreased germination whereas overexpressing GFh in Hitb increased germination indicating GFh is the gene behind qG11. Analysis of numerous rice accessions revealed the functionalh allele was lost in popular varieties during breeding. We generated a NIL in Hitb background carrying 172-k genomic from Arroz including GFh. The showed superior germination to Hitb with comparable agronomic traits. The functionalh from Ar Terra represents a valuable resource for seeding in cold regions.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) relaxed circular DNA ( rcDNA ) possesses an 8–9 nucleotide-long terminal redundancy ( TR, or r ) on the negative ( - ) strand DNA derived from the reverse transcription of viral pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ). It remains unclear whether the TR forms a 5’ or 3’ flap structure on HBV rcDNA and which TR copy is removed during covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ) formation. To address these questions, a mutant HBV cell line HepDES-C1822G was established with a C1822G mutation in the pgRNA coding sequence, altering the sequence of 3’ TR of ( - ) strand DNA while the 5’ TR remained wild type ( wt ). The production of HBV rcDNA and cccDNA in HepDES-C1822G cells was comparable to wt levels. Next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) analysis revealed that the positive ( + ) strand DNA of rcDNA and both strands of cccDNA predominantly carried the wt nt1822 residue, indicating that the 5’ TR of ( - ) strand DNA serves as the template during rcDNA replication, forming a duplex with the ( + ) strand DNA, while the 3’ TR forms a flap-like structure, which is subsequently removed during cccDNA formation. In a survey of known cellular flap endonucleases using a loss-of-function study, we found that the 3’ flap endonuclease Mus81 plays a critical role in cccDNA formation in wild-type HBV replicating cells, alongside the 5’ flap endonuclease FEN1. Additionally, we have mapped the potential Mus81 and FEN1 cleavage sites within the TR of nuclear DP-rcDNA by RACE-NGS analyses. The overlapping function between Mus81 and FEN1 in cccDNA formation indicates that the putative 5’ and 3’ flap formed by TR are dynamically interchangeable on rcDNA precursor. These findings shed light on HBV rcDNA structure and cccDNA formation mechanisms, contributing to our understanding of HBV replication cycle.

   . However, the ( + ) strand DNA only contains one complementary copy of TR as its internal sequence, indicating a template selection of TR during ( + ) strand DNA synthesis. Since only one copy of TR will form duplex with ( + ) strand DNA at the cohesive end region of rcDNA, it remains unclear whether TR forms a 5’ or 3’ flap-like structure on rcDNA and which copy of TR is discarded during cccDNA formation ( Fig 1B ). A previous study introduced mutations into the 5’ terminus of duck hepatitis B virus ( DHBV ) rcDNA ( - ) strand and the sequence analysis of mutant virus-derived rcDNA and cccDNA revealed that in a high frequency ( ~ 85% ), the ( + ) strand DNA synthesis used the mutated 5’ TR as template; and the mutant 5’ TR sequence was largely replaced by wild type ( wt ) 3’ TR sequence in cccDNA, indicating a preferential removal of mutant 5’ TR of rcDNA during DHBV cccDNA formation [24]. However, given the different viral DNA sequences and host cell background between DHBV and HBV, whether the above findings from DHBV mutagenesis study also apply to HBV remains unexplored. It is generally acknowledged that HBV relies on host DNA repair machinery to convert rcDNA into cccDNA and recent studies in this direction have identified a handful of cellular DNA repair factors and viral DNA intermediates involved in cccDNA biosynthesis ( reviewed in [12, 19, 20] ). Among them, a deproteinated rcDNA ( DP-rcDNA, or protein-free rcDNA ) species, which is devoid of the covalently attached Pol at 5’ end of ( - ) strand DNA, has been previously identified and suggested as an intermediate during cccDNA formation [25–30]. The in-depth analyses of cytoplasmic DP-rcDNA termini revealed that both copies of TR sequence remain intact on rcDNA, indicating that the removal of one copy of TR occurs after the import of DP-rcDNA into nucleus [31]

. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying cccDNA biosynthesis, maintenance and transcription regulation is essential for development of novel antiviral therapeutics to cure chronic hepatitis B [9, 12–16]. Unlike host chromosomal DNA and other viruses with double-stranded circular DNA genomes such as papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses [17, 18], the authentic HBV cccDNA does not undergo semi-conservative replication but is only converted from viral relaxed circular DNA ( rcDNA ) during de novo infection and/or via the intracellular amplification pathway ( also known as ( aka ) rcDNA recycling pathway ) [4, 19, 20]. The rcDNA is a 3. 2 kb partially double-stranded open circular viral DNA genome within the mature capsid and virion particles, and it is the major final product from reverse transcribing the pgRNA template catalyzed by viral polymerase ( Pol ) [21–23] ( Fig 1 ). To date, the molecular mechanism by which rcDNA is converted into cccDNA is still not fully understood. Comparing the major differences between rcDNA and cccDNA ( Fig 1A ), a series of biological reactions are required to correct the molecular peculiarities on rcDNA termini during cccDNA formation, including 1 ) completion of positive ( + ) strand DNA synthesis; 2 ) removal of the 5’ end capped RNA primer on ( + ) strand DNA; 3 ) removal of viral Pol covalently attached to the 5’ end of negative ( - ) strand DNA; 4 ) removal of one copy of the terminal redundancy ( TR, or r ) on ( - ) strand DNA; 5 ) ligation of both strands to generate the bona fide cccDNA [13, 14]. Among them, the 8–9 nucleotide ( nt ) -long TR on ( - ) strand DNA is a duplication of nt 1820/1821 ( transcription initiation sites ) to nt 1828 ( reverse transcription initiation site ) reversed transcribed from the pgRNA template, and the 5’ TR is covalently linked to Pol as a result of protein-primed DNA synthesis [19, 21]

To investigate the TR selection of HBV ( - ) strand DNA during rcDNA and cccDNA biosynthesis, we introduced a point mutation into the 3’ TR ( Fig 2A ). The rationale for mutating 3’ TR instead of the 5’ one is that the latter requires mutating the priming site in 5’ epsilon or the 5–6 nt immediately upstream of 3’ DR1 on pgRNA, which contains important cis element for the initiation of viral reverse transcription [21]. In line with this, a previous study mutating the 5’ TR of DHBV genome by altering the priming site in 5’ epsilon resulted in certain level of aberrant priming and reduction of DHBV DNA replication [24]. Based on the known molecular mechanism of HBV rcDNA biosynthesis ( Fig 2A ), we designed a point mutation C1822G downstream of pgRNA transcription starting site ( A1820/1821 ). During HBV DNA replication, the point mutation C1822G at the 5’ end of pgRNA will be reverse transcribed into G1822C in the 3’ TR of ( - ) DNA, while the 5’ TR maintains the wt G1822 ( Fig 2A ). Accordingly, we introduced the 5’ C1822G mutation into plasmid pTREHBVDES and established a HepG2-based, tetracycline ( tet ) -inducible HBV stable cell line HepDES-C1822G as described in Materials and Methods. Compared to the prototype HBV cell line HepDES19, the HepDES-C1822G line exhibited similar levels of cytoplasmic core DNA replication and nuclear cccDNA production upon induction ( tet- ) ( Fig 2B and 2C ). The 3’ RACE and sequencing of ( - ) strand DNA confirmed the G1822C mutation in the 3’ TR of rcDNA produced in HepDES-C1822G cells ( Fig 2D ). The completion of HBV ( - ) strand DNA synthesis is accompanied by the degradation of pgRNA template catalyzed by Pol’s RNaseH activity, then the 5’ DR1-containing RNA remnant serves as primer to initiate rcDNA ( + ) strand synthesis after annealing with DR2, and once the ( + ) strand elongates to the TR region of ( - ) strand DNA, it needs to select one copy of TR ( 5’ or 3’ TR ) as the template ( Fig 1 )

. While these results are partly consistent with the DHBV study, especially the 5’ TR selection during rcDNA formation regardless of whether it is wt or mutant; the almost complete absence of mutated 3’ TR sequence on cccDNA indicates certain virus- or host-specific mechanism ( s ) governing HBV and DHBV cccDNA formation. However, it is also possible that hepadnaviruses could selectively get rid of the mutated TR moiety as a quality control mechanism. Nonetheless, our data suggest that the 5 TR of ( ) DNA serves as the template during rcDNA synthesis forming a duplex with the ( ) DNA while the 3 TR forms a flap-like structure, which is removed during cDNA formation ( Fig 2 ). To investigate the role of cellular flap endonucleases in cDNA formation, we performed a loss-of-function study of known flap endonases in HBV replicating cells. We found that Mus81 plays a critical role in cDNA formation alongside the 5 endonuclease F1 ( Fig 3 ), and mapped the putative cleavage sites of Mus81 and F1 within the TR of DP-rcDNA by RACE-NG analyses ( Fig 3 ). The overlapping function between Mus and F1 incc formation indicates the putative 5 and 3 flaps formed by TR are dynamically interchangeable on rcDNA precursors ( Fig 3 ). These findings shed light on HB rcDNA and cDNA mechanisms contributing to our understanding of HB replication cycle.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The efficiency of microbial fuel cells ( MFCs ) in industrial wastewater treatment is profoundly influenced by the microbial community, which can be disrupted by variable industrial operations. Although microbial guilds linked to MFC performance under specific conditions have been identified, comprehensive knowledge of the convergent community structure and pathways of adaptation is lacking. Here, we developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model ( mmGEM ) based on metabolic cross-feeding to study the adaptation of microbial communities in MFCs treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory. The metabolic model encompassed three major microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria ( SRB ), methanogens ( MET ), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria ( SOB ). Our findings revealed a shift from an SOB-dominant to MET-dominant community as organic loading rates ( OLRs ) increased, along with a decline in MFC performance. The mmGEM accurately predicted microbial relative abundance at low OLRs ( L-OLRs ) and adaptation to high OLRs ( H-OLRs ). The simulations revealed constraints on SOB growth under H-OLRs due to reduced sulfate-sulfide ( S ) cycling and acetate cross-feeding with SRB. More cross-fed metabolites from SRB were diverted to MET, facilitating their competitive dominance. Assessing cross-feeding dynamics under varying OLRs enabled the execution of practical scenario-based simulations to explore the potential impact of elevated acidity levels on SOB growth and MFC performance. This work highlights the role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial community structure in response to high OLRs. The insights gained will inform the development of effective strategies for implementing MFC technology in real-world industrial environments.

    The performance of MFCs in sulfide and organic-rich wastewater from the canned-pineapple industry, including electricity production and the removal of COD and sulfide, was significantly influenced by the composition and activity of the microorganisms. To investigate microbial complex interaction in MFC system, we developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model ( mmGEM ) using functional-based lumped compartmentalized model design to unravel the intricate metabolic cross-feeding among important microbial guilds. Since fundamental microbial functions in MFCs are driven by groups of microbial species rather than by single species, a microbial compartment in the mmGEM was modeled as a microbial guild, ideally aggregating multiple species. The mmGEM conceptual design provides effective computational simulation and interpretation with strategically retaining sufficient biological complexity to accurately represent the studied system, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the circumstances. Under this design, we demonstrated that the mmGEM could simulate an accurate microbial transition from SOB-dominant to MET-dominant during increasing OLR conditions. The approach also revealed metabolic cross-feeding mechanisms that influenced changes in microbial composition. Additionally, the function-based metabolic model effectively responded to dynamic organic substrate conditions and captured the capacity for microbial interactions. This not only provided insights into the microbial ecosystem in MFCs but also suggested a manipulative strategy for improving MFC performance. Our approach achieves a well-balanced combination of computational feasibility and realistic contextual representation with minimal data requirements. Unlike many GEM studies that rely on species-level or synthetic communities, this study offers an alternative approach that is practical for real and complex microbial systems

The performance of the MFC system treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory declined as the organic loading increased during high-production seasons ( S1A Fig ). Sriwichai et al. ( 2024 ) likewise demonstrated that the performance of MFCs is impacted by changes in the microbial community structure, including variations in the composition and relative abundance profiles, at high organic loading conditions. A genome-scale model of microbe-microbe interactions ( mmGEM; S1 File ) was developed to comprehensively study the associations among microbial species in the MFC ecosystem, particularly focusing on how the community adapts to variable OLR conditions. Given the high complexity and diversity of microbial community in MFCs, the mmGEM was designed using an effective modelling approach based upon the functionally-lumped compartmentalized structure, which extends microbial and environmental coverages while maintaining computational demand and model reconstruction effort. This approach assumes that each fundamental metabolic function essential for substrate conversion in MFC is not driven by a single species, but rather by a cohort sharing metabolic characteristics. Thus, a microbial compartment in the mmGEM conceptually incorporated multiple microbial species, serving as functional guild representative. This allowed the mmGEM to simulate the microbial interaction underlying the phenomenon based on the aggregated microbial compartment of a metabolism-specific function while accounting larger proportion of microbial species and environmental condition ( see also S1 Text ). The model was also built on the assumptions that: 1 ) the equilibrium state of the ecosystem is mainly modulated by the predominant microbial cohorts and 2 ) these groups grow inter-dependently based on substrate-product cross-feeding and their ability to compete for available substrates within a common pool

. Fig 1A illustrates the hypothetical metabolic cross-feeding model involving SRB, MET, and SOB, which are three major microbial groups identified in MFC ecosystems ( S1 Table [5] ). The associations among these microbial groups are driven by their individual metabolic characteristics [13, 42, 43], and the wastewater composition profile ( S1 Fig ). Each group represents essential metabolic functions required to achieve the overall metabolic activity observed in MFC performance. We hypothesized that as MFC environments transition to high organic loading, the composition of organic substrates changes, thereby disrupting the equilibrium of substrate uptake and product secretion among major microbial groups ( S1 Text ). This disturbance influences the community structure by altering growth-dependent substrate availability and creating uneven growth potentials in competitive substrate conditions. The model first simulated the microbial interactions influencing the relative abundance of the microbial community in MFCs operated under low OLR ( L-OLR ) conditions during periods of low seasonal production ( S1 Fig ). Subsequently, the model assessed how microbial metabolic cross-feeding responded to high OLR ( H-OLR ) conditions ( S1 Fig ). The mmGEM comprised four spatial compartments representing three microbial groups ( i. e. SRB, MET, and SOB ), and one common pool of metabolites ( community compartment—COM ) ( Fig 1A ). The model finally contained 3, 535 reactions related to 3, 369 metabolites, 2, 366 metabolic genes ( Fig 1B ( Table ) and S2 Table ). These microbial groups freely exchanged organic substrates and metabolites with each other within the COM space ( See also S2 Table and S2 Text ). The SRB group had the highest number of exchangeable metabolites, followed by SOB and MET. The Venn diagram in Fig 1B presents a set of common metabolites potentially exchanged between the microbial groups, indicating cross-feeding

This work highlights the significant role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial composition and MFC performance under varying OLRs. Through functional-based lumped compartmentalized modeling, the mmGEM facilitated a comprehensive study of the intricate dynamic metabolic interactions within microbial communities in MFCs, ultimately enhancing our understanding of microbial ecology and facilitating the optimization of MFC performance for various biotechnological applications. Here, it presents a detailed description of the transition from an SOB-dominant community at L-OLRs to a MET-dominant community at H-OLRs, as the MFC performance declines. This transition can be attributed to dynamic interactions among microbial groups in the system. Our findings unveiled various cross-feeding mechanisms. Specifically, we observed a deterioration in SRB-SOB interactions, including S cycling and acetate cross-feeding. Additionally, we identified efficient acetate consumption by MET. These interactions collectively led to changes in the composition and structure of the microbial community within the MFC system, finally impacting performance. We propose a manipulation strategy to enhance MFC performance by sustaining the dominance of SOB under H-OLR conditions. By increasing the amount of proton ( H+ ) in the MFC environment, we simulate the growth of SOB, enhance ATP production, strengthen SRB-SOB interactions, and boost MFC performance. The anticipated outcomes offered a hopeful prospect for the long-term functioning of MFCs, illuminating potential future applications within the industrial domain.

. The results showed that these microbial guilds exchanged metabolites, mainly butyrate, acetate, sulfate, sulfide, NH4, methane, and CO2, ( Fig 2B, left ), which served as key carbon and nitrogen sources and metabolic currency compounds involved in core biosynthesis processes of microbial metabolism, emphasizing the significance of syntrophic cross-feeding relationships within the MFC microbiome. The simulation of metabolite cross-feeding showed that SOB greatly benefitted from autotrophic CO2 fixation for their growth, consequently releasing high amounts of sulfate into the environment. The increasing sulfate levels, together with butyrate loading, provided substrates for SRB whose metabolism returned acetate, sulfide, and CO2 to the community. Despite being the only microbial group capable of directly utilize butyrate, a major organic component in wastewater influent, SRB exhibited minimal relative abundance compared to SOB and MET ( Fig 2, left ). The scenario underscores the strong dependency of SRB growth on sulfate, which functions as a final electron acceptor in anaerobic sulfate respiration. The presence of sulfate in the system, exclusively produced by SOB, was postulated to constrain the overall metabolic activity of SRB by limiting electron transfer. This constraint led to a shift from SR-domin to METomin community as OLR increased ( Fig 2, right ). The mmEM accurately predicted relative abundance of SR, SO, and MET at L-OL and H-OL conditions ( Fig 2, right ).

    Title: 
    Abstract: Machine learning ( ML ) is increasingly being used to guide biological discovery in biomedicine such as prioritizing promising small molecules in drug discovery. In those applications, ML models are used to predict the properties of biological systems, and researchers use these predictions to prioritize candidates as new biological hypotheses for downstream experimental validations. However, when applied to unseen situations, these models can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives. One solution to address this issue is to quantify the model’s prediction uncertainty and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate ( FDR ) pre-specified by researchers. We propose CPEC, an ML framework for FDR-controlled biological discovery. We demonstrate its effectiveness using enzyme function annotation as a case study, simulating the discovery process of identifying the functions of less-characterized enzymes. CPEC integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool known as conformal prediction, providing accurate and FDR-controlled function predictions for a given protein enzyme. Conformal prediction provides rigorous statistical guarantees to the predictive model and ensures that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. Evaluation experiments show that CPEC achieves reliable FDR control, better or comparable prediction performance at a lower FDR than existing methods, and accurate predictions for enzymes under-represented in the training data. We expect CPEC to be a useful tool for biological discovery applications where a high yield rate in validation experiments is desired but the experimental budget is limited.

    Machine learning models play a vital role in generating biological hypotheses for downstream experimental analyses and facilitating biological discoveries in various applications. A significant challenge in the process of ML-assisted biological discoveries is the development of ML models with interpretable uncertainty quantification of predictions. When applied to unseen situations, ML models without uncertainty quantification are susceptible to overconfident predictions, which misdirects experimental efforts and resources to the validation of false positive hypotheses. Addressing this challenge becomes essential to ensure the efficiency and reliability of ML-assisted biological discovery. In this work, we have presented CPEC, an ML framework that enables FDR-controlled ML-assisted biological discoveries. Leveraging the conformal prediction framework, CPEC allows users to specify their desired FDR tolerance α, tailored to the experiment budget or goals and makes corresponding predictions with a controlled FDR. We demonstrate CPEC’s effectiveness using enzyme function annotation as a case study, simulating the discovery process of identifying the functions of less-characterized enzymes. PenLight2, an improved version of PenLight optimized for multi-label classification is utilized as CPEC’s base ML model. Specifically, CPEC takes the sequence and structure of an enzyme as input and outputs a set of functions ( EC numbers ) that the enzyme potentially has. The conformal prediction algorithm in CPEC theoretically guarantees that the FDR of the predicted set of functions will not exceed α with high probability. The evaluation of CPEC on the EC number prediction task showed that CPEC provides reliable FDR control and has comparable or better prediction accuracy than baseline methods at a much lower FDR. Interpretable cutoffs were provided by CPEC for guiding the EC number annotations of proteins

. Here, we propose an ML method, called CPEC ( Conformal Prediction of EC number ), to achieve FDR-controlled enzyme function prediction by leveraging a statistical framework known as conformal prediction ( CP ) [13]. CPEC receives the sequence or structure of an enzyme as input and predicts a set of functions ( EC numbers ) that the enzyme potentially has. The unique strength of CPEC is that the averaged per-protein FDR ( i. e., the number of incorrect predictions divided by the prediction set size for a protein ) can be controlled by a user-specified hyper-parameter α. The CP framework theoretically guarantees that the FDR of our per-protein predictions is no larger than α with a very high probability. This equips researchers with foresight, offering success rate estimates even before experimental validation. In an ML-guided workflow of protein function discovery, researchers can specify the desired FDR level α based on the experiment budget or expectations. For example, setting α to a smaller value when only the most confident predictions are needed or the test budget is limited, or setting to a larger value when the goal is to discover novel functions and a slightly higher FDR and budget are acceptable. The base ML model of CPEC is PenLight2, an improved version of the deep learning model PenLight [14] for the multi-class multi-label protein function annotation problem, which uses a graph neural network to integrate 3D protein structure data and protein language model embeddings to learn structure-aware representations for function prediction. Benchmarked on a carefully curated dataset, we first found that CPEC outperformed existing deep learning methods for enzyme function prediction. We also demonstrated that CPEC provides rigorous guarantees of FDR and allows users to trade-off between precision and recall in the predictions by tuning the desired maximum value α of FDR

. After examining the consistency of the FDR control across different difficulties, we explored an adaptive strategy for predicting EC numbers, which allows the ML model not to predict a too specific EC number than what the evidence supported and only predict at the most confident level of EC hierarchy. Conformal prediction quantifies the ML model’s uncertainty in its predictions, especially for the predictions for previously unseen data. This is extremely useful in ML-guided biological discovery as we often need to make predictions for unseen data to gain novel discoveries. For example, in protein function annotation, the most challenging proteins to annotate are those previously uncharacterized or do not have sequence homologous in current databases. Conventional ML models that do not quantify prediction uncertainties are often overconfident when making predictions for the aforementioned challenging samples, leading to a large number of false positives in their predictions, which can incur a high cost in experimental validation without yielding a high true positive rate. Considering the importance of predicting previously uncharacterized data, here we designed an evaluation experiment to assess CPEC’s prediction performance on these challenging proteins. We created a test set that contains only proteins that have less than 30% sequence identity to any proteins in the training set, which simulated a challenging application scenario. We varied the FDR tolerance α from 0. 05 to 0. 5 and counted the number of correct predictions, where assigning one EC number to a protein was counted as one prediction. We observed that CPEC had an effective uncertainty quantification for its predictions on this low-sequence-identity test set ( Fig 5A ). For example, when α = 0. 05 which forced the model to only output the most confident predictions, CPEC was highly accurate, with a precision of nearly 0. 97. At the FDR tolerance level of 0

. While human experts can assess the success likelihood of generated hypotheses based on their domain knowledge or intuition, this ability is not naturally developed by an ML model and, as a result, the model could be susceptible to pathological failure and only provide overconfident or unreliable predictions. This can have critical implications in ML-assisted biological discovery, as unreliable ML predictions can guide experimental efforts in the wrong direction, wasting resources on validating false positives. In this work, we aim to develop ML models that can generate hypotheses with limited false positives, providing confident and accurate predictions that can potentially help improve the yield rate in downstream validation experiments. Specifically, we use the function annotation problem of protein enzymes as an example to demonstrate our method. The underlying computational problem of function annotation is a multi-class, multi-label classification problem as a protein can have multiple functions. In computational protein function annotation, a model typically predicts a set of functions that the query protein may potentially have. The set of predicted functions, if validated by experiments, can be incorporated into existing databases to augment our knowledge of the protein function space. There is often a trade-off regarding the size of the prediction set: researchers prefer a set with a small size, containing a handful of very confident predictions, as it is not desirable to spend resources on too many hypotheses that ultimately turn out to be false positives; on the other hand, researchers may be willing to increase the budget to validate a larger set of predictions in order to improve the chance of discovering novel functions for under-studied proteins

Machine learning ( ML ) algorithms have proven to be transformative tools for generating biological hypotheses and uncovering knowledge from large datasets [1, 2]. Applications include designing function-enhanced proteins [3, 4], searching for novel drug molecules [5], and optimizing human antibodies against new viral variants [6]. These discoveries often involve a combination of computation and experimentation, where ML-based predictive models generate biological hypotheses and wet-lab experiments are then used to validate them. This approach is beneficial as it greatly reduces the search space and eliminates candidates that are unlikely to be successful, thus saving time and resources in the discovery process. For example, in drug discovery, ML has become a popular strategy for virtual screening of molecule libraries, where researchers use ML models to predict the properties of molecules, such as binding affinity to a target, and identify the most promising candidates for downstream experimental validation and lead optimization [7]. To gain new insights into biological systems or make novel discoveries ( e. g., designing new drugs ), ML algorithms are often used to make predictions for previously unseen data samples. For example, to support the design of new vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19, ML algorithms need to predict the potential for immune escape of future variants that are composed of mutations that have not yet been seen. Similarly, in drug screening, ML algorithms should be able to predict molecules that are structurally different from those in the training data, which helps scientists avoid re-discovering existing drugs. However, when ML models are applied to unseen situations, they can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives, which can misdirect experimental efforts and resources to the validation of false hypotheses. To address this issue, it is essential to quantify the model’s prediction uncertainty and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate ( FDR ) specified by the researcher. This is the focus of this work, where we propose an ML framework for FDR-controlled biological discovery, called CPEC, which integrates a deep model with a statistical tool as conform prediction, providing accurate and F-controlled predictions for a given protein. Conform prediction provides rigorous guarantees to the model and ensures the expected F will not exceed a user-specified with high probability. We demonstrate C’s effectiveness using enzyme annotation as a case, simulating the process identifying functions of less-character enzymes.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Neuronal inclusions of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 are hallmarks of disease for most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ). Mutations in TARDBP, the gene coding for TDP-43, can cause some cases of familial inherited ALS ( fALS ), indicating dysfunction of TDP-43 drives disease. Aggregated, phosphorylated TDP-43 may contribute to disease phenotypes; alternatively, TDP-43 aggregation may be a protective cellular response sequestering toxic protein away from the rest of the cell. The heat shock responsive chaperone Hsp90 has been shown to interact with TDP-43 and stabilize its normal conformation; however, it is not known whether this interaction contributes to neurotoxicity in vivo. Using a C. elegans model of fALS mutant TDP-43 proteinopathy, we find that loss of function of HSP-90 protects against TDP-43 neurotoxicity and subsequent neurodegeneration in adult animals. This protection is accompanied by a decrease in both total and phosphorylated TDP-43 protein. We also find that hsp-90 mutation or inhibition upregulates key stress responsive heat shock pathway gene expression, including hsp-70 and hsp-16. 1, and we demonstrate that normal levels of hsp-16. 1 are required for hsp-90 mutation effects on TDP-43. We also observe that the neuroprotective effect due to HSP-90 dysfunction does not involve direct regulation of proteasome activity in C. elegans. Our data demonstrate for the first time that Hsp90 chaperone activity contributes to adverse outcomes in TDP-43 proteinopathies in vivo using a whole animal model of ALS.

   . elegans. Under stress conditions, perinuclear HSP-90 protects newly synthesized proteins from denaturation or from being degraded by the cell stress response in somatic cells [35]; moreover, this protective role against chronic proteotoxic stress functions as an integrated organismal response in a cell non-autonomous manner [41]. While molecular chaperones such as Hsp90 have been studied in ALS [31], a full understanding of their roles remains unclear. Evidence exists that molecular chaperones can function both as protectors against the toxicity associated with protein misfolding and as enhancers of disease that maintain the stability of the toxic form of TDP-43 [31]. For example, Hsp90 inhibition reduces TDP-43 levels in an autophagy-dependent mechanism in HeLa cell models [42]. In contrast, another model of TDP-43 proteinopathy generated in human neuroblastoma cells found the knockdown of both Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones leads to an accumulation of toxic TDP-43 species, potentially by blocking the degradation pathways in which these chaperones are involved [12]. However, consequences of Hsp90 inhibition have not been tested in vivo, in the context of an intact nervous system. In this study, we explore the role of the C. elegans hsp-90/daf-21 chaperone in an animal model of TDP-43 proteinopathy that expresses full length human TDP-43 containing ALS-causing mutations pan-neuronally. We found that disrupting HSP-90 functions genetically or with small molecule inhibitors is sufficient to protect against TDP-43 neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration.

Protein level regulation during cellular stress conditions is essential to maintain homeostasis and reduce cellular toxicity. In neurodegenerative proteinopathies, these regulatory mechanisms can be impaired, resulting in the accumulation of neurotoxic misfolded proteins in disease-affected regions of the central nervous system [72]. The chaperone Hsp90 plays a crucial role in the quality control of proteins, including preventing protein misfolding and assisting in protein degradation, which counteracts protein aggregation [27, 28]. However, its contribution to disease is not fully understood since both protective and deleterious actions have been described in different experimental models of neurodegeneration [12, 42]. In the present study, we report that HSP-90 promotes disease in a transgenic C. elegans fALS model expressing human mutant TDP-43. Either by genetic intervention or pharmacological inhibition, using Tanespimycin ( 17-AAG ), we partially rescue neuronal function in our models of TDP-43 proteinopathy ( Figs 1A, 1C and 1D and S1A–S1C Fig ). Both 17-AAG and genetic inactivation of HSP-90 have a similar mechanism of action: the hsp-90 mutant has a point mutation at the C-terminus that induces a drastic charge change likely affecting protein function [39] and reduced ATP turnover ( [73], and 17-AAG inhibitor binds Hsp90 N-terminally, acting as a competitive inhibitor for the ATP binding site ( [74]. We also show that genetic inactivation in C. elegans or pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 in HEK293 cells partially reduces phosphorylated TDP-43 levels, indicating a conserved role in mediating TDP-43 protein dynamics ( Fig 3C and 3F [51, 75] ). Our results have been confirmed by three different experimental approaches; whether we tested Hsp90 chaperone dysfunction or inactivation in vivo or in vitro, using different experimental models, we show a protective effect against TDP-43 related pathology by reducing Hsp90 activity

. In C. elegans, HSP-90 modulates proteostasis by sequestering HSF-1, preventing it from raising the turnover of proteins, and protecting new and mature proteins from being degraded under physiological conditions [98]; however, when cells are under stress, HSP-90 is dissociated from HSF-1 in order to activate the heat shock response, which includes the upregulation of hsp-70. Hsp70 induces protein degradation by activating both autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system pathways [99]. In fact, RNA-binding proteins including TDP-43 and Fus may be cleared by chaperone-mediated autophagy [100]. However, future studies are needed for in depth investigation of this pathway in ALS. In addition to Hsp70, Hsp90 inhibition induces the overexpression of another small heat shock protein, alpha β crystallin [101]. Under physiological conditions, this protein forms multimeric complexes that sequesters them with minimal chaperone activity. However, during stress stimulus and disease, these protein complexes break down, increasing the accessibility of crystallins to interact with aggregation-prone proteins such as SOD1 or tau, and prevent the formation of pathological aggregates [102, 103]. Here, we have investigated whether HSP-90 inactivation affects the HSP-16 protein family, the main C. elegans homologs of the human α/β crystallin proteins. The HSP-16 family has been widely studied in C. elegans in association with several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and retinopathies [104–107]. These small heat shock proteins are inducible under cellular stress conditions, including heat shock, oxidative stress, and hypoxia [66–69]. We found genetic modulation of hsp-90 increased hsp-16 family mRNA levels ( Fig 5L–5O ). Increased levels of HSP-16 may contribute to the neuroprotection seen in our C. elegans fALS model. In fact, our data show that RNAi mediated reduction in hsp-16

. Therefore, Hsp90 inhibition strategies may dismantle this complex and reduce phosphorylated tau burden in cells [83]. Similarly, TDP-43 can form TDP-43/Hsp90/co-chaperone complexes, and dismantling this association drives TDP-43 to degradation pathways [42]. Moreover, Hsp90 inhibition can be neuroprotective in ALS, facilitating the clearance of TDP-43 by releasing the transcription factor HSF-1, which activates the heat shock response. [84]. Hsp90 inhibition has previously been shown to promote proteasome-mediated degradation of other known clients [26, 33]. In order to test whether proteasomal changes underlie Hsp90-mediated TDP-43 protein accumulation or clearance, we generated a worm strain including a reporter for proteasome biogenesis in C. elegans [54]. Interestingly, we found that animals with diminished HSP-90 chaperone activity, hsp-90 ( 9673 ), do not exhibit altered proteasome biogenesis. However, both strains carrying the TDP-43M337V transgene showed an increase in proteasome biogenesis, regardless of HSP-90 chaperone activation status ( Fig 4 ). This indicates that while fALS associated TDP-43 triggers proteasomal changes, these changes are unlikely to be the main contributor or primary factor in the decreased protein accumulation observed in TDP-43 ( M337V ) ;hsp-90 ( p673 ). This is the first report in C. elegans models showing that TDP-43 ( M337V ) expression leads to likely proteasome activation, but other publications have shown similar results for animals expressing amyloid beta, another neurodegenerative disease associated aggregating protein [54]. Importantly, these data do not exclude the possibility that proteasomal changes contribute to T-43 pathology in other contexts.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Our understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and define cellular identity in the Arthropod female reproductive system and the extent of their conservation is currently very limited. This is due to the focus on model systems, including Drosophila and Daphnia, which do not reflect the observed diversity of morphologies, reproductive modes, and sex chromosome systems. We use single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing to produce a comprehensive single nucleus atlas of the adult Artemia franciscana female reproductive system. We map our data to the Fly Cell Atlas single-nucleus dataset of the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, shedding light on the conserved regulatory programs between the two distantly related Arthropod species. We identify the major cell types known to be present in the Artemia ovary, including germ cells, follicle cells, and ovarian muscle cells. Additionally, we use the germ cells to explore gene regulation and expression of the Z chromosome during meiosis, highlighting its unique regulatory dynamics and allowing us to explore the presence of meiotic sex chromosome silencing in this group.

   . Although an analysis in the water flea Daphnia [38], the closest model organism to Artemia, suggests the sequence conservation of many meiosis genes between insects and crustaceans, their conserved role in crustacean oogenesis and meiosis, and the transcriptional diversity/heterogeneity of cell types in the female reproductive system, have yet to be studied. Here, we create a single nucleus RNA sequencing ( snRNA-seq ) atlas of the Artemia ovary, and we identify different somatic and germline cell types, allowing us to perform a detailed comparison with the well-characterized Drosophila melanogaster [39]. We further combine RNA-seq and chromatin accessibility ( ATAC-seq ) data obtained from the same nuclei to investigate the transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics of germ cells during oogenesis. Finally, we characterize the dynamic expression of Z-linked genes in oogenesis, to test whether dosage compensation and sex chromosome inactivation occurs in the germline of the independent ZW system of Artemia, enhancing our understanding of sex chromosome regulation during meiosis.

In this study, we used single nucleus RNA sequencing to resolve the cellular complexity of the Artemia ovary. We identify clusters of cells with distinct expression patterns and show that they share different levels of expression-based homology with the Drosophila ovarian clusters from the Fly Cell Atlas. This suggests that many of the expression programs that give rise to cellular identity and function are highly conserved despite ~505 MYA ( CI: 474. 8–530. 0 MYA ) of divergence between Crustacea and Insecta [53]. Ovarian muscle cells show the highest level of conservation, in line with a previous study that showed a high similarity in orthologous gene expression of muscle cells across several vertebrate and invertebrate species [54]. Two clusters, which show some expression similarity to each other ( S5 Fig ), map to Tracheal and Follicle cells in Drosophila ( epithelial cell types ). In Drosophila, Tracheal cells form the tracheal system, which transports oxygen to the different organs [55], while follicle cells are involved in many aspects of oogenesis, including control of egg shape, eggshell formation, and formation of appendages, such as the dorsal appendage [56]. The two identified clusters ( in addition to prefollicle cells ) express trachealess ( trh, S17A Fig ), which is essential for the initiation and maintenance of invagination [57]. The trachealess ortholog has also been found to be expressed in the salt gland of nauplii and in the thoracic epipod of juveniles in Artemia franciscana, suggesting it might play other roles in this species [58]. Early germ cells ( germ cells A ) also show a high level of conservation between the two species

. Due to the limited number of studies on ZW systems, whether dosage compensation is present in the germline cells and whether Z-chromosomes are inactivated during oogenesis are still open questions. Here, we address these questions using Artemia brine shrimp, an aquatic arthropod from the Branchiopoda class with a pair of differentiated ZW sex chromosomes [34]. Arthropods have two major types of ovaries: panoistic, where all the germline cells differentiate into oocytes, and meroistic, where only one cell becomes an oocyte and the rest of the germ cells differentiate into nurse cells. Although the majority of crustaceans have panoistic ovaries, meroistic ovaries are typical for Branchiopoda [35]. This facilitates drawing parallels between the Artemia reproductive system and that of Drosophila melanogaster, the most studied insect system in terms of molecular, developmental and morphological data. In Artemia females, oogenesis starts in the two tubular-like ovaries, where the germ cells differentiate into oocytes and up to 70 nurse cells, and where most of the previtellogenesis and vitellogenesis take place [35]. Artemia nurse cells and oocytes do not show any differences in their morphology until the end of previtellogenesis, where the nurse cells reportedly become polyploid ( to increase ribosomal RNA content ), and unlike oocytes, do not undergo vitellogenesis and do not produce yolk protein [36]. Similar to Drosophila, nurse cells remain connected to the oocyte through cytoplasmic bridges and continue supporting it until the end of vitellogenesis, where they are phagocytosed by follicle cells. The oocytes progress through prophase I as they grow in the ovary and move towards the oviduct, where they stay temporarily. After that, the eggs move to the ovisac and stay there in arrested metaphase I until fertilization [36, 37]

. However, these cells have high expression of phagocytosis and apoptotic cell clearance genes draper and draper-like ( S17D Fig ), which are expressed in follicle cells to promote nurse cell death in Drosophila [60]. We use 10x single cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to explore the expression and chromatin accessibility changes during female oogenesis in Artemia brine shrimp. We observe a dramatic decrease in the ATAC counts in the Germ cells B cluster, along with a noticeable decrease in the total RNA counts and the percentage of unspliced RNA. Those observations further support the idea that this cluster consists at least in part of late prophase cells, and the lack of ATAC signal is likely due to the compaction of chromatin and the establishment of prophase I arrest. A similar pattern has been observed in Drosophila, where the total number of ATAC peaks decreases dramatically in the later stages of oogenesis ( whole ovaries ) compared to GSCs and young ovaries [51]. In mouse single cell data, the number of ATAC peaks in mitotic cells decreases dramatically in the progression from prophase I to metaphase I [61]. The compact structure of the chromatin during mitotic and meiotic prophase is thought to present a barrier to many transcription factors, which causes a reduction in the levels of gene expression [9, 62]. In meiosis, the global silencing of transcription in oocytes is highly conserved, and the extensive remodeling of the oocyte chromatin seems to play an important role in the oocyte to embryo transition [63]. We also checked the expression of three genes that have been shown to play an important role in the chromatin remodeling of the Drosophila oocyte ( their knockdowns introduced significant disturbances to the oocyte epigenome ) [9]

. Previous studies have linked the observed conservation of several aspects of germline cyst development between distant species, such as of mice and Drosophila, to the critical role of germ cells in the preservation of the nuclear genome and the importance of early oocytes for embryonic development [59]. We identify a single cluster in our dataset that maps to all the late stage germline clusters in Drosophila, including nurse cells. This is in line with expression patterns in this species, where all late germline and nurse cell clusters are highly correlated ( S18 Fig ). It should therefore be noted that our germline clusters may also contain a mix of developing oocytes and closely related nurse cells. Some of the cluster annotations should be interpreted more cautiously, as they likely represent cell types with less conserved transcriptional programs, making inferences based on Drosophila less reliable. The Artemia cluster mapping to Escort cells is nested with the two germline clusters in the dendrogram, unlike Escort cells in the Drosophila dendrogram, which are nested with somatic cells ( S5 Fig ). The absence of Escort cells from the unmated females suggests those cells are either late stage follicle cells, late stage germline/embryonic cells, or sperm ( the minority of cells that are assigned to the same cluster in replicates 3 and 4 after integration are likely to be misclustered germ cells A or B ). We did not find any enrichment of testis biased genes in any of the different clusters, which rules out contamination by sperm ( S19A and S19 Fig ), but could not distinguish between other possibilities. The cluster mapping to follicle cells in Drosila is supported by the expression of tracheless ( S17 Fig ) which is essential for the initiation and maintenance of invagination [57] and also expressed in the salt gland naupi and thoracic epod of Artemia franciscana [58]. Follicle cells in Doph are involved in many aspects of oogenesis, including control of egg shape, eggshell formation, and appendage formation, such as the dorsal appendage [56]. The cluster to follicle cells in Artemia also express tracheless ( S Fig 17 ) which is essential for the initiation and maintenance of invagination [57 ] and expressed in the salt gland naupi and thoracic epod of Artemia francana [58 ]. Folle cells in Doph are involved in many aspects of oogenesis, including control of egg, egg formation and appendage, such as the dorsalage [56 ] The cluster to follicle in Artem also express tracheless ( S Fig 17 ) which is essential for initiation and maintenance invagination [57 ] and expressed in salt gland naup and thoracic of Artemia [58 ] Folle in D are involved in many oogenesis including control egg, formation and appendage such as dorsal [56 ] The cluster to follic in Artem also express tracheless ( S Fig 17 which is for initiation and maintenance invagination [57 and expressed in salt naup and thor of Artemia [58 ] Folle in D are in oogenesis control egg formation and appendage such as dorsal [56 The cluster to follic in also express tracheless ( S Fig 17 which is for initiation and invagination [57 and expressed in naup and thor of Artem [58 ] Fol in are in oogenesis control egg and appendage such as dorsal [56 The cluster to express tracheless ( S Fig 17 which is for and invagination [57 and in naup thor of Artem [58 ] Fol in o control egg and appendage such as dorsal [56 cluster to express tracheless ( Fig 17 which for and invagination [57 in na and thor of Artem [58 Fol in o and appendage such as dorsal [56 cluster express trache ( Fig 17 for and invagination in na and of Artem [58 Fol in egg and append such as dorsal [ cluster trache ( Fig 17 and invagination in na of Artem [ Fol and append such as dorsal cluster trache ( Fig inv in na Artem and [ Fol such as dorsal cluster trache ( in na and Artem [ Fol such as cluster trache in na and [ Fol as cluster trache in na and Fol as cluster trache in na and Fol cluster trache in na as cluster trache in na Fol cluster trache in na cluster trache in Fol cluster trache na cluster trache cluster trache cluster trache cluster trache cluster trache trache cluster trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache trache

    Title: 
    Abstract: Chronic pain is a wide-spread condition that is debilitating and expensive to manage, costing the United States alone around $600 billion in 2010. In a common symptom of chronic pain called allodynia, non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with highly variable presentations across individuals. While the specific mechanisms remain unclear, allodynia is hypothesized to be caused by the dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory ( E-I ) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In this work, we analyze biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures that represent common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn. These circuits are hypothesized to be part of the neural pathways that mediate two different types of allodynia: static and dynamic. We use neural firing rate models to describe the activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within each subcircuit. By accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions, we specify model parameters defining populations of subcircuits that yield typical behavior under normal conditions. Then, we implement a sensitivity analysis approach to identify the mechanisms most likely to cause allodynia-producing dysregulation of the subcircuit’s E-I signaling. We find that disruption of E-I balance generally occurs either due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling so that excitatory neurons are “released” from inhibitory control, or due to upregulation of excitatory neuron responses so that excitatory neurons “escape” their inhibitory control. Which of these mechanisms is most likely to occur, the subcircuit components involved in the mechanism, and the proportion of subcircuits exhibiting the mechanism can vary depending on the subcircuit structure. These results suggest specific hypotheses about diverse mechanisms that may be most likely responsible for allodynia, thus offering predictions for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia and identifying targets for further experimental studies on the underlying mechanisms of this chronic pain symptom.

   . We note, however, that our current results would not be qualitatively affected as Aβ and C fibers are parallel pathways and their inputs do not interact. In this study, we introduced an analysis methodology for neural population model circuits that can determine parameter values optimized to account for experimental observations and for identifying sensitivities of model behaviors to parameter variations. The methodology involves the following steps: This methodology can be applied to study any circuit of neural populations, although the implementation of Step 2 is more tractable for feedforward circuits with a relatively small number of populations. Thus, we expect that the methodology may be useful for analyzing propagation of signaling and E-I balance in other sensory processing circuits with feedforward structure. In all, successful treatment of chronic pain conditions, such as allodynia, require full understanding of the underlying physiological causes. Dysregulation of E-I balance in dorsal horn circuitry is a compelling cause supported by an array of pre-clinical studies, but our incomplete understanding of the circuitry and the building evidence for its complexity leave many questions for how the dysregulation occurs. The identification of multiple types of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in dorsal horn circuits suggests that dysregulation may occur through multiple mechanisms that may be dependent on the nature of the injury or insult that induces the chronic pain condition [46]. Our modeling results are a first step to systematically unravel the interactions among multiple interneuron populations for the maintenance of E-I balance in healthy conditions and its disruption in allodynia. Our identification of a wide diversity of mechanisms underlying allodynia in simplified dorsal horn subcircuits suggest potential sources for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia conditions

. Hence, painful stimuli generating activity on C fibers would activate these excitatory cells and the downstream projection neurons. Under normal healthy conditions, responses of these excitatory populations to non-painful stimuli signaled by Aβ input is assumed to be gated by the inhibitory populations. Allodynia occurs when the E-I balance is disrupted such that non-painful Aβ input causes firing in these excitatory populations, leading to activation of the downstream projection neurons. While allodynia can also be induced by nociceptor-mediated sensitization of projection neurons [20], here we focus on allodynia caused by disruption of inhibitory gating of Aβ input. The goal of this study is to identify and characterize “most likely” potential mechanisms that disrupt the processing of Aβ signals and E-I balance in these subcircuits leading to allodynia. We model the activity and interactions of the neural populations in these subcircuits using a population firing rate model formalism ( see e. g. [23–25] ) constrained by experimental data. We begin by identifying the full space of model parameters that generate responses to Aβ signals that is correlated to healthy conditions in each subcircuit, i. e. low firing of the E or E2 populations. We specifically focus on analyzing effects of synaptic coupling parameters that represent the magnitude of effects of pre-synaptic activity on post-synaptic response. Due to the relative mathematical simplicity of our firing rate model formalism, we are able to analytically define an “allowable parameter space” ( APS ) as a solution to a system of inequalities on model parameters. The APS for each subcircuit indicates the considerable range of parameter combinations that can reproduce healthy responses and demonstrates the myriad ways that E-I balance might be obtained

. Including such spiking properties in a firing rate population network would allow analysis of the interactions of these cellular firing patterns with network structure in maintaining or disrupting E-I balance in dorsal horn circuits. Experimental studies have shown that static and dynamic allodynia are mediated by different afferent inputs [42–44]. Specifically, dynamic allodynia is mediated by Aβ fiber input which in healthy conditions is unable to activate laminae I-II nociceptive circuits, while static allodynia can be mediated by Aβ fiber input or by sensitized mechanical nociceptors ( Aδ or C fiber input ) depending on the pathological or experimental conditions [42]. Our analysis focused on dysregulation of inhibitory gating of Aβ fiber input for both allodynia types. Further experiments are needed, however, to identify if signaling patterns on Aβ fibers differ in response to brushing ( dynamic ) or punctate ( static ) stimuli. Our models did not include activity on nociceptive Aδ or C fibers, or responses of lamina I projection neurons. The model subcircuits could be extended to explicitly include the effects of painful signals arriving on Aδ/C fibers that make direct connections on projection neurons and interneuron populations. In previous work modeling spinal subcircuits using a firing rate model formalism, we included C fiber input that was mediated through NMDA receptors in post-synaptic populations [45]. The NMDA-receptor mediated connection strength depended on post-synaptic average voltage to account for voltage-dependent removal of a Mg2+ block. Such an extended model would be able to account for wind-up of projection neuron activity in response to repetitive brief C fiber input and also explicitly account for pain inhibition, namely the attenuation of C fiber response in the projection neurons in the presence of simultaneous Aβ input

We first illustrate our analysis methodology by applying it to a simple subcircuit representing the canonical “gate control” model ( Fig 2A ). This simple subcircuit consists of an inhibitory interneuron population ( I ) that inhibits an excitatory interneuron population ( E ). Both populations receive input from Aβ fibers. We assume that any sustained activity of the E population is a proxy for a painful response. Thus, under healthy conditions, Aβ activity in the range of 10–20 Hz [27] should not cause sustained firing of the E population. This is achieved through appropriate balancing of the inhibitory input from the I population and the excitatory Aβ input onto the E population. We characterize different ways in which this subcircuit can become dysregulated to produce firing in the E population in response to normal Aβ input. The static subcircuit consists of two inhibitory populations ( I1 and I2 ), and one excitatory ( E ) population, all receiving Aβ input ( Fig 4A ). As in the simple circuit, we assume that the E population directly relays signals to projection neurons and allodynia is defined as any sustained firing of the E population in response to typical non-painful Aβ input. The APS is defined in the 5-dimensional space of coupling parameters ( gAβI1, gI1E, gAβE, gAβI2, gI2E ) and the allodynia surface is a hypersurface in this space. While the I1 and I2 populations represent classes of inhibitory interneurons with different molecular markers ( DYN+ and PV+, respectively ), we assume they have similar response properties [26] and use the same model parameters for each population. In this way, the subcircuit is symmetric in the sense that there is nothing to distinguish the two inhibitory populations from one another. As shown below, this symmetry is reflected in the structure of the APS for this subcircuit, as well as in features of the predicted most likely mechanisms for allodynia

These results can be applied to help understand how E-I balance is maintained and likely disrupted in more complex dorsal horn circuits [34, 35]. In models of more complex circuits, the space of unconstrained parameters is so high-dimensional that identifying the diversity of parameter sets that satisfy desired model behaviors is difficult, even when computational optimization algorithms are implemented. Our results show that the methodology can be used to identify mechanisms of dysregulation of E balance in subcircuits that are likely to produce allody, even in the presence of high dimensionality of the parameter space. The methodology can be applied to any circuit with feedforward structure and relatively small number of populations, such as those in lamina II of the dorsal horn. We expect the methodology to be useful for studying propagation of signaling and E balance in other sensory circuits with feedforward structure.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Protein homeostasis relies on the accurate translation and folding of newly synthesized proteins. Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 ( eEF2 ) promotes GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome during translation. eEF2 folding was recently shown to be dependent on Hsp90 as well as the cochaperones Hgh1, Cns1, and Cpr7. We examined the requirement for Hsp90 and cochaperones more closely and found that Hsp90 and cochaperones have two distinct roles in regulating eEF2 function. Yeast expressing one group of Hsp90 mutations or one group of cochaperone mutations had reduced steady-state levels of eEF2. The growth of Hsp90 mutants that affected eEF2 accumulation was also negatively affected by deletion of the gene encoding Hgh1. Further, mutations in yeast eEF2 that mimic disease-associated mutations in human eEF2 were negatively impacted by loss of Hgh1 and growth of one mutant was partially rescued by overexpression of Hgh1. In contrast, yeast expressing different groups of Hsp90 mutations or a different cochaperone mutation had altered sensitivity to diphtheria toxin, which is dictated by a unique posttranslational modification on eEF2. Our results provide further evidence that Hsp90 contributes to proteostasis not just by assisting protein folding, but also by enabling accurate translation of newly synthesized proteins. In addition, these results provide further evidence that yeast Hsp90 mutants have distinct in vivo effects that correlate with defects in subsets of cochaperones.

   . We showed that the yeast C372Y mutant, which corresponds to a de novo mutation in an individual with neurodevelopmental disorders [28], results in growth defects that were partially rescued by overexpression of HGH1, suggesting that it may be possible to alleviate folding defects of some forms of mutated eEF2. Further studies are needed to determine the scope of Hgh1 functions. In yeast, deletion of the genes in the diphthamide synthesis pathway has mild effects on growth, but in humans, alteration of the pathway results in developmental or neurological disorders [25, 65]. Further studies are also required to understand the connection between Hsp90 and susceptibility to DT. Interestingly, this is not the first connection between Hsp90 cochaperones and DT. A prior study found that Hsp90, Hsp70, and cochaperones such as Cyp40, FKBP51, and FKBP52, facilitate the transport of diphtheria toxin into human cells [78]. This highlights the vast cellular roles of Hsp90 in mediating cellular functions and the potential impact of modulating Hsp90 and/or cochaperone function in order to treat a variety of human diseases.

Hgh1 was identified as a protein that bridges the interaction of eEF2 with either the Hsp90 or TRiC chaperone systems [33, 34]. A physical and genetic network consisting of Cpr7 and Cns1 had been recognized for years [46–48], but only recently were those two cochaperones, along with Hgh1, shown to be involved in regulating eEF2 folding and solubility [34]. The prior studies that examined the connection between the Hsp90 machinery and eEF2 used a system in which eEF2 was expressed under the regulatable GAL1 promoter [34]. We examined the impact of mutations in the Hsp90 machinery on the levels of soluble His-eEF2 in cell lysates ( the Eft2 isoform containing a 6x-His tag ) expressed under a constitutive promoter [28]. First, we compared isogenic wild-type ( WT ) cells, or cells lacking HGH1 or CPR7. CNS1 is essential, so we tested cns1 cells expressing WT CNS1 or the temperature-sensitive mutation cns1-G90D, which alters a residue in an essential domain [34, 49]. As shown in Fig 1, isolation of 6xHis-eEF2 using nickel resin results in one predominant band that migrates at the expected size. In agreement with the prior study [34], deletion of HGH1 or CPR7, or mutation of CNS1, resulted in significantly lower levels of the introduced His-eEF2 bound to nickel resin and also resulted in lower levels of eEF2 in cell lysates, which is a combination of endogenous and introduced His-eEF2. Reduced levels in our assay may be due either to insolubility of His-eEF2 or misfolding and subsequent degradation of His-eEF2. In contrast, the level of His-eEF2 was not significantly affected by deletion of DPH2, one of the genes required for the diphthamide modification [50], indicating that eEF2 folding is not dependent on the modification. A prior study found that deletion of STI1 did not affect eEF2 levels [20]

. We monitored eEF2 folding, as measured by steady-state levels of soluble eEF2, and susceptibility to diphtheria toxin. Our results suggest that Hsp90 and cochaperones have two genetically distinct roles in mediating eEF2 function. The folding of eEF2 is highly dependent on the Hgh1, Cpr7 and Cns1 cochaperones and most sensitive to the Hsp90 mutants in the reopening group. In contrast, sensitivity to diphtheria toxin is dependent on the Sti1 cochaperone and most sensitive to mutations in the loading and closing groups. These results demonstrate that the role of the Hsp90 machinery may vary as a single client progresses to the functional state.

. They also used polysome run-off experiments to demonstrate that strains with reduced levels of Hgh1, Cpr7 or Cns1 likely have defects in translation elongation or termination [34]. Many of the genes linked to the translational apparatus share a pattern of transcriptional coregulation. Prior studies suggested that Cpr7 and Hgh1 have functions related to translation due to their similar pattern of regulation [75, 76]. A recent study demonstrated that a separate Hsp90 client is involved in translation initiation. Hsp90 inhibition reduced the fidelity of start site selection, and evidence suggests that the accumulation of misfolded polypeptides due to translational infidelity triggers the heat shock response mediated by the transcription factor Hsf1 [1]. Loss of CPR7 or deletion of HSC82 is known to result in increased basal Hsf1 activity [77]. In yeast, the eEF2 mutations P580H and H699N result in increased -1 frameshifting, and cells expressing P580H exhibited an enhanced stress response [28, 29], presumably due to the buildup of mistranslated proteins. Additional studies are required to determine whether cells lacking CPR7 or expressing the reopening mutants display errors in translational fidelity. However, our studies provide evidence that Hsp90 has critical roles in translation elongation in addition to translation initiation. Hgh1 was identified as a protein that bridges the interaction of eEF2 with either Cns1 and Hsp90 or with the TRiC chaperone [33, 34]. Further studies are required to better understand whether the interaction of Hgh1 and eEF2 with TRiC and Hsp90 represent independent folding pathways or whether TRiC and Hsp90 interact with eEF2 in a sequential manner

. eEF2 is a large multidomain protein with five domains. Domain I binds GTP, domain III binds Hgh1 and domain IV contains the diphthamide modification, which occurs on His699 [26, 34]. A yeast model system previously examined the effects of two eEF2 mutations that mimic human eEF2 mutations associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, C372Y and P580H. C372Y alters a residue in domain II and P580H is in domain IV, close to H699 [28, 29]. We expressed His-tagged versions of those mutants, as well as H699N, which blocks the modification, in an eft1eft2 strain isogenic to our other strains ( Fig 4A ). All three of these mutations resulted in growth defects at elevated temperature, with C372Y and P580H also causing reduced growth at the optimal growth temperature of 30°C. To determine the effect of mutation on folding, WT and mutant His-eEF2 were isolated out of yeast as described above. As shown in Fig 4B, His-eEF2 WT and H699N accumulated to similar levels, consistent with a prior analysis [55], but the C372Y and P580H alterations resulted in significantly reduced levels of His-eEF2, suggesting that misfolding of eEF2 contributes to the human disorders associated with these variants. Since Hgh1 directly interacts with eEF2 and enhanced growth defects were observed upon combination of hsc82 mutants and HGH1 deletion, we constructed isogenic eft1eft2 and eft1eft2hgh1 strains. The loss of HGH1 reduced the growth of cells expressing all mutants, with a significant reduction in cells expressing C372Y ( Fig 4C ). Further, overexpression of HGH1 partially rescued the growth defect of cells expressing C372Y ( Fig 4D ). In addition to providing new evidence that Hgh1 has a role in folding of eEF2, this suggests that overexpression of Hgh1 may help rescue defects of human eEF2 caused by the homologous mutation

Researchers investigated how individuals with lesions in the insula or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, regions involved in decision-making, made choices in social and non-social contexts. Participants played a gambling task where choices were made alone and after observing others' choices. Both groups showed disrupted utility-based computations for risky options in social decisions, but increased conformity with others' choices independent of utility. This suggests that in social contexts, others' choices may be a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based processing is disrupted. The insula and dACC have been implicated in decision-making about risky options in non-social contexts via lesion, neuroimaging, and electrophysiology studies. Individuals with focal insula (N=10) or dACC (N=6) lesions and non-lesioned controls (NC; N=28) made choices between gambles alone and after observing others' choices. Trials comprised four types: Solo, Info-safe, Info-risky, and Info-mix, where social choices were safer, riskier, or mixed. Results showed that individuals with ins or dACC lesions exhibited disrupted utility-based risk and used social information to guide decisions. This suggests conformity can serve as an alternative to utility-based processing in social decision-making when risk is impaired. The findings have implications for suboptimal decision-making in neurodevelopment, neurological disorders, and psychiatric conditions characterized by altered decision-making. Disrupted utility-based processing may play a role in the influence of others in adolescent decision-making and substance misuse. The study suggests avenues for addressing maladaptive decision-making, such as enhancing or changing group composition.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Biomorphs, Richard Dawkins’s iconic model of morphological evolution, are traditionally used to demonstrate the power of natural selection to generate biological order from random mutations. Here we show that biomorphs can also be used to illustrate how developmental bias shapes adaptive evolutionary outcomes. In particular, we find that biomorphs exhibit phenotype bias, a type of developmental bias where certain phenotypes can be many orders of magnitude more likely than others to appear through random mutations. Moreover, this bias exhibits a strong preference for simpler phenotypes with low descriptional complexity. Such bias towards simplicity is formalised by an information-theoretic principle that can be intuitively understood from a picture of evolution randomly searching in the space of algorithms. By using population genetics simulations, we demonstrate how moderately adaptive phenotypic variation that appears more frequently upon random mutations can fix at the expense of more highly adaptive biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent. This result, as well as many other patterns found in the structure of variation for the biomorphs, such as high mutational robustness and a positive correlation between phenotype evolvability and robustness, closely resemble findings in molecular genotype-phenotype maps. Many of these patterns can be explained with an analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained sections of the genome. We postulate that the phenotype bias towards simplicity and other patterns biomorphs share with molecular genotype-phenotype maps may hold more widely for developmental systems.

   . Under what conditions sequence-constraint-based provide a useful first approximation and whether these conditions hold in specific GP maps, is a topic for future research. Our simulations show that phenotypic bias can have an influence on adaptive evolution: when several phenotypes convey an adaptive advantage, the more frequent ( and therefore usually the simpler ) phenotype is more likely to evolve. It is important to note that this result is not in contradiction to arguments that complexity can increase over evolutionary time, see e. g. [70]. First of all, natural selection may simply favour more complex phenotypes. Secondly, there are normally many more phenotypes with higher complexities than those with lower complexities. Even if the probability that a particular individual phenotype appears upon random mutations is typically higher if its complexity is lower, the probability P ( K ) that a random mutation generates a phenotype of complexity K may still peak at a higher K because there are simply many more possible phenotypes with higher K ( see [3] and section D. 4 in S1 Text ). Indeed, P ( K ) is a very broad distribution for biomorphs. Nevertheless, the question of how simplicity bias interacts with changes in morphological complexity over evolutionary time needs further study. If simplicity bias in GP maps follows from very general intuitions based on the algorithmic infinite monkey theorem, as formalised by AIT, then we might expect it to hold for a much wider range of GP maps than have been studied so far [3, 5]. Indeed, our results show that simplicity bias is observed beyond the molecular scale in Richard Dawkins’s biomorphs, which were created as a simplified description of morphological development. This then prompts the question of whether we should expect to see simplicity bias more generally in development

. We first show that in the absence of selection, biases in phenotypic frequencies ( which are calculated on a uniform random sampling of genotypes ) are reflected in the average rates with which each biomorph phenotype appears in an evolving population. Next, we turn to a scenario that is adapted from refs [14, 15] and includes both variation and selection: Two adaptive phenotypic changes are possible and for a range of fitness values, we find that the more frequent phenotype fixes first even though it is not the fittest phenotype. We also study a scenario from Dawkins’s book [1] where he finds it hard to reconstruct an evolutionary pathway to an ‘insect’-shaped phenotype. He argues that for such rare phenotypes, while short paths exist, these are only a tiny fraction of a much larger set of potential paths, and so they are hard to reliably find. We illustrate these shortest paths and note that if neutral mutations are included, fewer phenotypic changes are needed, making it easier to create fitness functions that lead to monotonically increasing fitness paths to the final desired phenotype. Algorithm 1 From genotype ( g1, g2, g3, g4, g5, g6, g7, g8, g9 ) to a biomorph drawing ( paraphrased from ref [29] ) procedure DefineVectors ( g1, g2, g3, g4, g5, g6, g7, g8 ) ⊳ This function produces eight vectors {v → i} from the first eight genome positions: g1 to g8. v → 1 ← ( - g 3, g 7 ) v → 2 ← ( - g 2, g 6 ) v → 3 ← ( - g 1, g 5 ) v → 4 ← ( 0, g 4 ) v → 5 ← ( g 1, g 5 ) v → 6 ← ( g 2, g 6 ) v → 7 ← ( g 3, g 7 ) v → 8 ← ( 0, g 8 ) end procedure procedure DrawBiomorph ( i, c, x0, y0, {v → i} ) ⊳ Call this function with i = 4, c = g9, x0 = y0 = 0, and the vectors {v → i} from DefineVectors to draw the figure

. It would be interesting to study in more quantitative detail the interplay of random mutations and these phenotypic correlations on incremental adaptive evolution for biomorphs. This research program would entail combining the power of natural selection, demonstrated by Dawkins’s 2nd infinite monkey theorem, with an algorithmic account of how structured variation arises, illustrated by the 3rd monkey theorem. Such an interplay can help illustrate that phenomena such as developmental bias and natural selection are not in opposition, but should rather be seen as dual causes in a richer explanatory landscape. We believe that taking both creative forces into account should be far from “boring” [86]. Instead, their interaction opens up exciting new avenues for understanding how the remarkable power of evolution generates “endless forms most beautiful” [13].

. The main aim of this paper will be to analyze the generation of phenotypic variation more systematically in this system and test the hypothesis that this iconic model of morphological development also exhibits simplicity bias and other phenomena similar to those observed for molecular GP maps. We will also analyze the effect that these biases in the arrival of variation have on evolutionary dynamics. We analyze the biomorphs GP map as follows. Firstly, to take into account the fact that many biomorph phenotypes look highly similar, we define a coarse-graining that maps them onto a discrete 30 × 30 pixel grid, as shown in Fig 3. We then exhaustively analyse all genotypes within a fixed parameter range, and use an approximate descriptional complexity measure [30] to show that the frequency-complexity relationship of biomorph phenotypes is indeed consistent with the simplicity bias of Eq 1. We show that the GP map of biomorphs exhibits many other properties that resemble those commonly found in molecular GP maps, as reviewed in [7, 31]. For example, the phenotype robustness ρp, defined as the mean mutational robustness of all genotypes g that generate to a given phenotype p, scales as the logarithm of the frequency fp of the phenotype. Evolvability, a measure that counts how many novel phenotypes are accessible by point mutations, correlates negatively with the mutational robustness ρg of an individual genotype g, but positively with phenotype robustness ρp of the whole neutral set [32]. We can rationalize these effects in the biomorphs systems as in existing GP maps, where they are captured by a simple analytically tractable model based on separating genotypes into constrained and unconstrained portions [33–36]. Another big question is to what extent these structural GP map characteristics, which determine the spectrum of novel variation that appears upon random mutations, affect evolutionary outcomes when natural selection is also at play

Fundamentally, the GP map determines how random mutations produce novel variation. Many molecular GP maps have been shown to share a series of structural features beyond simplicity bias that also shape the spectrum of phenotypic variation [7, 31]. This finding prompts the question of whether the biomorph GP map also exhibits these other features. We will focus on three structural features of GP maps that affect evolutionary dynamics. We first explore mutational robustness which quantifies the likelihood of neutral mutations that keep the phenotype unchanged. Secondly, we study how the mutational robustness of a phenotype correlates with a measure of evolvability that counts how many different unique phenotypes are accessible by point mutations. Thirdly, we analyze the phenotypic mutation probabilities, which measure how likely a mutation lead to a specific new phenotype. The definitions of these quantities follow standard practice [14, 31, 32, 40], and are given in Table 1. To help quantify these structural features, we use a random null model from ref [40] where the neutral set sizes of each phenotype are kept fixed, but the individual assignments of the genotypes to phenotypes are randomized. Comparing to this random null model helps clarify where properties arise from the non-trivial structure in the GP map. Having analyzed what the GP map can tell us about the phenotypic variation, we turn to the evolutionary dynamics of biomorphs. We study the effect of phenotyp bias on the fixation of adaptive phenotypes in the presence of selection. We use simulations to show that the more frequent phenotype is more likely to fix, even if it is not the fittest. We also study a scenario from Dawkins book [1] where he finds it hard to reconstruct an evolutionary pathway to an ‘insect-aped’ phenotype. He argues that such rare phenotypes, while paths exist, are a tiny fraction of a larger set of potential paths, so are hard to reliably find. We illustrate shortest paths and note if neutral mutations are included, fewer phenotyp changes needed, making it easier to create functions that lead to monotonically increasing fitness to final phenotype Algorithm 1 genotype ( g, g, g, g, g, g, g, g, g, g ) to biomorph ( paraphrased from [29 ] procedureVectors ( g, g, g, g, g, g, g, g, g ) ⊳ function this produces vectors { →} from first genome: g to g v ← ( g, g ) v ← ( g, g ) v ← ( g, g ) v ← (, g ) v ← ( g g ) v ← (, g ) v ← ( g ) v ← ( g ) end procedure Drawiom ( i, c, x, y, { →} ⊳ call with i =, c g, x =0 y =0, and vectors { → from Vectors to draw figure

Here is a clear, concise, and formal summary of the research article:

**Title:** Biomorphs, a model of morphological evolution, demonstrates the power of natural selection to generate order from random mutations, but also illustrates how developmental bias shapes adaptive outcomes. We show that biomorphs exhibit a type of developmental bias, where certain phenotypes are orders of magnitude more likely to appear through random mutations, with a preference for simpler phenotypes with lower complexity. This bias is formalized by an information-theoretic principle, similar to the algorithmic monkey theorem. Using population simulations, we demonstrate that adaptive phenotypic variation appears more frequently through random mutations at the expense of highly adaptive biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent.

**Key Findings:**

* Biomorphs exhibit bias towards simplicity and other patterns similar to molecular-genotype maps, such as high mutational robustness and positive correlation between evolvability and robustness.
* Phenotypic bias can influence adaptive evolution when phenotypes convey an advantage, making the more frequent and simpler phenotype more likely to evolve.
* Simplicity in biom maps follows from general intuitions based on algorithmic infinite theorem, formalized by AIT, and may hold for wider GP than studied so far.
* In absence of selection, phenotyp frequencies are reflected in rates of biomorph appearance in evolving populations.
* In scenario with variation and selection, more frequent phenotype fixes even if not fittest.
* Neutral mutations included, fewer phenotyp changes, making it easier to create functions leading to monotonically increasing fitness to final phenotype.

**Research Questions:**

* How interplay of random mutations and phenotyp correlations on incremental evolution for biomorph.
* Quantitative study of interplay of random and phenotyp correlations on adaptive evolution for biomorph.
* Extent of simplicity in biom maps follows from general intu based on algorithmic infinite theorem.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Activities like ball bouncing and trampoline jumping showcase the human ability to intuitively tune to system dynamics and excite motions that the system prefers intrinsically. This human sensitivity to resonance has been experimentally supported for interactions with simple linear systems but remains a challenge to validate in more complex scenarios where nonlinear dynamics cannot be predicted analytically. However, it has been found that many nonlinear systems exhibit periodic orbits similar to the eigenmodes of linear systems. These nonlinear normal modes ( NNM ) are computable with a recently developed numerical mode tool. Using this tool, the present resarch compared the motions that humans excite in nonlinear systems with the predicted NNM of the energy-conservative systems. In a user study consisting of three experiment parts, participants commanded differently configured virtual double pendula with joint compliance through a haptic joystick. The task was to alternately hit two targets, which were either aligned with the NNM ( Experiments 1 and 2 ) or purposefully arranged offset ( Experiment 3 ). In all tested experiment variations, participants intuitively applied a control strategy that excited the resonance and stabilized an orbit close to the ideal NNM of the conservative systems. Even for increased task accuracy ( Experiment 2 ) and targets located away from the NNM ( Experiment 3 ), participants could successfully accomplish the task, likely by adjusting their arm stiffness to alter the system dynamics to better align the resonant motions to the task. Consequently, our experiments extend the existing research on human resonance sensitivity with data-based evidence to nonlinear systems. Our findings emphasize the human capabilities to apply control strategies to excite and exploit resonant motions in dynamic object interactions, including possibly shaping the dynamics through changes in muscle stiffness.

   . Through a haptic joystick, participants moved a virtual motor link coupled to the first link l1 of the double pendulum by a spring k1 ( Fig 1A and 1B ). Rotating the motor link induced motions in the pendulum system and the spring forces were reflected to the user as haptic force feedback. By varying the equilibrium of the spring k2 connecting the first and second pendulum link, different pendulum configurations ( P0, P90, P45 ) could be tested ( Fig 1C ). In each case, the task was to alternately hit two target balls to collect hit points. There were two major reasons for choosing a compliant double pendulum for the investigation. First, although the system is not inherently chaotic if the compliance is chosen high enough, the dynamics of the double pendulum is strongly nonlinear. It is the simplest model approximation of a flexible object, such as a whip or rope. As such, it can be easily extended with further links in future work to analyze interactions with more complex dynamics. Second, human resonance sensitivity is presumably not only important in object interactions but also for the control of one’s own body. Hence, the compliant double pendulum can also be regarded as the simplest approximation of a human limb. Insights about how humans excite and stabilize such dynamics might support further investigations on human motor learning and control. To identify the pattern underlying the human control approach, prior to the user experiment, three baseline strategies ( BL1–3 ) were defined based on literature-reported human control principles. In simulations, each strategy commanded a position signal to the pendulum’s motor link ( Fig 1, red link ), which was identical to what participants controlled by moving the haptic joystick. The amplitude of all strategies was empirically tuned to reach the two targets with the second pendulum link tip

. 98 Hz = 6. 16 rad s−1 ). At these frequencies, plotting the joint coordinates also shows the joint motions being closest to the expected nonlinear modes derived from the ideal conservative system. The generation of the random motions on the motor link visualizes that the reachable space of the pendulum system is quite large, which is especially apparent in the joint space plots ( Fig 11B ). Thus, the carried-out characterization measurements prove that the pendulum systems can be excited in various ways and do not automatically fall to their respective NNM. Based on previous findings about human preferences and abilities in dynamic interactions with ( non- ) linear systems, possible control strategies that humans could use to drive rhythmic motions of the above-introduced double pendulum are hypothesized. Each considered strategy is defined as possible baseline strategy ( BL ) that will be applied to the system and later used as references to identify the underlying strategy of the participants in the user study.

. Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that the resonance sensitivity of humans extends to nonlinear systems, even when system or precision requirements change. However, in these experiments, the required oscillation task aligned with the intrinsically preferred pendulum motions, i. e., the targets coincided with the turning points of the ideal NNMs. Since such alignments are uncommon in everyday scenarios, we conducted an additional experiment with all participants ( n = 20 ) to explore how humans excite a nonlinear system when the task and intrinsic dynamics are not aligned. This experiment was carried out with the P45 pendulum, where qeq = ( 0, 45 ) °. The target balls for this configuration did not coincide with the turning points of the system’s NNM but were arranged on a radius between the P0 and P90 targets ( Fig 1C, yellow ). Although the targets were not aligned with the NNM, the participants could still achieve a hit rate of 85%, thus lying in between the rates achieved with the P0 and P90 configurations. The participants intuitively excited an oscillation at 0. 81 ± 0. 02 Hz ( Table 3 ), which was not significantly different from the determined NNM eigenfrequency of 0. 82 Hz ( t ( 19 ) = −2. 04, p = 0. 06 ). However, the mode metric of the participants and BL1–3 indicate that the excited pendulum motion had a much larger distance from the ideal NNM trajectory, which was expected since the targets were not located on the turning points of the NNM ( Fig 7, middle and right ). The difference between the participants’ η-values and BL1–3 showed to be significantly different from zero for all cases ( all: p < 0. 001 ), indicating the participant strategy was closer to the NNM than any baseline strategy

. The mode metric η only increased slightly for both pendulum configurations, indicating the excited pendulum motions remained close to the predicted NNM path ( Fig 5 ). However, the excited frequencies in P0 and P90 were slightly but significantly lower than the predicted eigenfrequencies. Moreover, the hit scores slightly decreased with comparatively more error attempts compared to the original target size of Experiment 1 ( Tables 1 and 2: overshoot, undershoot ). To understand how the oscillation frequency could be lowered while the mode metric suggests still close proximity to the ideal NNM, the hand-joystick interaction of the participants is considered. The close match of the eigenfrequencies and low η-values in the previous experiments suggested that participants maximally stiffened their wrists when holding the joystick handle. This best mimics the idealized condition of the conservative systems, where the motor link was static at θ = 0. However, changing the wrist stiffness could alter the coupled system dynamics [19]. Although, the human arm stiffness was not specifically considered in our experiment, a very rough approximation of such stiffness change can be made by assuming a changed stiffness for the first system spring k1. Since the human arm and this spring act in series, it can be assumed that lowering the wrist stiffness would lower the overall stiffness seen by the first pendulum link, such that changing k1 can be used to gain first insights. A more detailed modeling would exceed the scope of this paper, but will be considered for further research. Here, we simply recalculated the NNM of the pendulum systems with slightly decreased first spring stiffness k1 = 4. 75 N m rad−1. This results in eigenfrequencies of fres ( P0 ) = 0. 758 Hz and fres ( P90 ) = 0. 90 Hz, showing no significant difference to the frequencies excited by the participants to reach the targets with decreased radius ( P0: t ( 9 ) = −1. 55; p = 0

. Despite daily encounters with nonlinear dynamics, empirical evidence of human reso- nance sensitivity is mostly limited to interactions with simple systems exhibiting linear dynamics [21, 22]. Testing if humans intuitively excite and stabilize intrinsic nonlinear behaviors requires nonlinear dynamics to be computable in advance for comparison. But unlike the eigenmodes of linear systems [23, 24], intrinsic motions in nonlinear systems cannot be derived analytically. Instead, periodicity in chaotic systems can be found and stabilized through phase synchronization [2, 25], but multiple possible periodic orbits make it hard to predict which solutions emerge in human interactions. However, recent research showed even nonlinear systems like the double pendulum, a classic example of chaotic behavior [26], display predictable, computable periodic orbits [27, 28]. These orbits can be determined with numerical methods based on algebraic topology and differential geometry. One class of these periodic orbits are nonlinear normal modes ( NNM ), similar in appearance and description to the linear analogy of eigenmodes. Analogously, they oscillate with a characteristic eigenfrequency between two turning points, where all velocities are zero. However, unlike linear eigenmodes, the shape of the nonlinear mode and the associated eigenfrequency changes with increasing energy levels and does not always cross zero [29]. NNM can be computed with a numerical tool recently developed for conservative systems [30], which was used in this study to compare the motions of humans excite in nonlinear systems with the predicted N of energy-conservative systems

The study consisted of three experiments with participants commanded a virtual double pendulum through a haptic joystick. The task was to alternately hit two targets which were either aligned with the N ( Experiments 1 and 2 ) or purposefully arranged ( Experiment 3 ). In all tested variations, participants intuitively applied a strategy that excited the resonance and stabilized an orbit close to the N of the systems Even for increased accuracy ( Experiment 2 ) and targets away from the N ( Experiment 3 ) participants could accomplish the task by adjusting their stiffness to better the dynamics align resonant to the. Our findings extend existing on human sensitivity with data to nonlinear systems and emphasize the capabilities to control and exploit motions in dynamic interactions, possibly shaping through changes in muscle.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, transcriptional regulation plays a crucial role in responding to environmental cues during the transition from exponential to stationary phase. A group of transcription factors called transition regulators (TSRs) control developmental processes such as biofilm formation, motility, genetic competence, and sporulation. Two TSRs, Sco and Abr, along with the Mar-family factor PR, negatively regulate the production of the iron chelator pulerrin in B. subtilis. Genetic analysis shows that all three factors are necessary to limit pulerr production during exponential phase and influence the rate and amount of pulerr produced. Expression of the pulerr biosynthesis gene yC is under the control of Sco, Abr, and PR and correlated with the amount of pulerr produced. In vitro data indicate a direct role for Sco in controlling pulerr production with Abr and PR. The regulation by two distinct systems underscores the importance of pulerr in B. subtilis physiology.

TSRs, originally identified in sporulation, are regulators that inhibit genes involved in developmental processes but do not result in sporulation mutation when deleted. Sco and Abr are well-stud TSRs in B. subil. Sco is a Mar-family winged helix-helix transcription factor first identified in hyperproase mutants. Array analysis between WT and Sco mutants identified 560 genes with differential expression in motility and competence as well as protease and peptide transport. Abr is a 10.8 kDa part of a family with beta-alpha DNA N-terminal domain. Mutants have pleiotropic and some overlap with Sco. IP-q analysis of Abr identified many sites with bipart TNA motif.

Pulerr is a secreted chelating molecule researched in B. subis and microorganisms. This study uncovers layered regulation of pulerr by discrete systems. The systems work together to inhibit biosynthesis of energetically costly and growth limiting metabolite. Expression of yC promoter resembles the pattern of pulerr production, but in Sco and Abr backgrounds display broad distributions, suggesting TSR influence in pulerr producing cells. Only absence of three factors is yC expression achieved and pulerr is produced throughout exponential. Biochemical shows regulators of pul biosynthetic operon and state regulators Sco and Abr bind yC differing off-rates.

    Title: 
    Abstract: After spinal cord injuries ( SCIs ), patients may develop either detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( DSD ) or urinary incontinence, depending on the level of the spinal injury. DSD and incontinence reflect the loss of coordinated neural control among the detrusor muscle, which increases bladder pressure to facilitate urination, and urethral sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, which control the bladder outlet to restrict or permit bladder emptying. Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) applied to the spinal cord after SCI reduced DSD and incontinence. We defined, within a mathematical model, the minimum neuronal elements necessary to replicate neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder after a SCI and incorporated into this model the minimum additional neurophysiological features sufficient to replicate the improvements in bladder function associated with lumbar TMS of the spine in patients with SCI. We created a computational model of the neural circuit of micturition based on Hodgkin-Huxley equations that replicated normal bladder function. We added interneurons and increased network complexity to reproduce dysfunctional micturition after SCI, and we increased the density and complexity of interactions of both inhibitory and excitatory lumbar spinal interneurons responsive to TMS to provide a more diverse set of spinal responses to intrinsic and extrinsic activation of spinal interneurons that remains after SCI. The model reproduced the re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex after SCI. When we investigated the effect of monophasic and biphasic TMS at two frequencies applied at or below T10, the model replicated the improved coordination between detrusor and external urethral sphincter activity that has been observed clinically: low-frequency TMS ( 1 Hz ) within the model normalized control of voiding after SCI, whereas high-frequency TMS ( 30 Hz ) enhanced urine storage. Neuroplasticity and increased complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons, beyond what is necessary to simulate normal bladder function, must be present in order to replicate the effects of SCI on control of micturition, and both neuronal and network modifications of lumbar interneurons are essential to understand the mechanisms whereby TMS reduced bladder dysfunction after SCI.

    We developed a basic framework for model-based analyses of neural circuits controlling micturition after SCI and of the effects of TMS on the spinal cord as a therapeutic intervention to alleviate bladder dysfunction following SCI. A model of the neural circuits was developed by building on a state-of-the-art model to capture the normal storage/voiding functions under healthy conditions and typical disorders of the bladder after SCI [6], such as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and overactivity of the bladder. The effect of TMS on the spinal cord was modeled at the single-cell level based on recent experimental findings from patch-clamp [14] and extracellular recordings [59]. The effect of TMS at the network level was analyzed through model simulations, which revealed possible mechanisms underlying the amelioration of the detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia by TMS and the mechanism whereby low ( but not high ) frequency TMS was effective for this purpose. Insights from this modeling illustrate how an integrated, systems-level modeling approach can advance the understanding of neural dysfunction, which is essential to determine the neuronal basis of adverse effects of SCI so that rehabilitation and neuromodulation may be used to ameliorate the neurological disorders following SCI.

Several previous models embody the hierarchical structure of control of urination in normal subjects [6, 13, 15–17], and though they differ slightly from each other, they share a core architecture describing the neural feedback controlling micturition [15, 18]. The features of this traditional model are shown schematically in Fig 1A [15, 18]. Spinal cord injury above the lumbar level blocks or weakens supraspinal control of voiding and prevents reciprocal coordination between the activity of the bladder and the urethra. Previous models of ‘normal’ bladder and urethral sphincter control have not replicated the usual patterns of bladder dysfunction observed after a spinal cord injury, such as an overactive bladder ( disinhibited detrusor contractions and urine leakage ) or detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( simultaneous contraction of the detrusor and the urethral sphincter ). The dysfunctional patterns of bladder activity after a SCI derive from interactions among spinal networks of interneurons, neuronal plasticity, and reorganization of spinal circuitry that foster emergence of a latent spinal voiding reflex [1, 6, 30–33]. When a SCI occurs at T10 or above ( an upper-level injury; the red dashed line in Fig 1B ), communication between the brainstem circuits and the spinal micturition circuits is blocked or attenuated. The control of urine storage in the bladder remains intact, as autonomous feedback below the level of injury enables inhibition of bladder contraction and excitation of the urethral sphincter However, bladder emptying is dysfunction: the lack of descending signals from the PMC allows detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia to emerge, and, depending on the level of SCI, the bladder may not simply be overfilled; it can also be overactive, which may result in incontinence

. In either case, the models were based on mechanistic descriptions of physiological processes that incorporated the smallest set of neural or biochemical features needed to describe the behavior being modelled, and the models described control of the LUT in healthy subjects. Muscle dynamics have been described by Hill equations ( which describe the activation of muscles controlling the bladder in terms of muscle length, tension, and velocity of shortening ), but neural elements were represented by static models, such as the weighted sum of inputs operating around a threshold or a logical on/off switch [10]. More recently, a model including the supraspinal voiding reflex was used to examine the effect of pudendal nerve stimulation on bladder contraction [12]. The neural elements were modeled as a network of integrate-and-fire neurons, and nerve stimulation was simulated as action potentials in the pudendal nerve. Last, a model based on what might be described as weighted logic gates to simulate excitatory or inhibitory neurons within the circuit of micturition control produced on/off reflex responses that simulated normal urine storage and micturition [13]. None of these previous models addressed the effect of SCI on micturition. Given the limited capacity to perform invasive measurements in humans, modeling the dynamical behavior of the neural circuits controlling micturition provides a useful mechanism to explore how SCI may alter control of micturition and how spinal cord stimulation may ameliorate control of bladder function. Therefore, we developed a mathematical model of the spinal micturition circuit as a dynamical network of neural nodes described by the Hodgkin-Huxley equations so that spinal cord stimulation was incorporated directly as a transient opening of the sodium channels

. The model creates an environment in which we can propose the minimum necessary neuronal substrates required to replicate observed clinical problems and assess different therapeutic patterns of spinal cord stimulation and their effects on micturition. Modulating spinal cord circuits by electrical or magnetic stimulation can ameliorate a variety of dysfunctional conditions after SCI, such as hand motor control [67], locomotion [5], neurogenic bladder [2], sensorimotor system [68], neuropathic pain [69], and spasticity [70]. However, the mechanisms underlying the immediate and long-term effects of stimulation on neural activity at the single-cell and network levels, including the effects of neuroplasticity, are not adequately understood [68, 71, 72]. The results of the current study may have implications for use of TMS in other settings, and the differential TMS activation of inhibitory and excitatory neurons, which was essential to mitigate observed abnormalities of bladder function in patients after SCI within the model, may explain why low frequency TMS leads to reduced cortical excitability and high frequency TMS increased cortical excitability in treating depressive disorders [73]. These issues are not easily approached experimentally, and model-based analyses and predictions may be helpful unraveling these mechanisms and may point to studies that could provide experimental validation. We modeled the dense network of interneurons throughout the spine as individual nodes, which do not accurately reflect the polysynaptic pathways controlling parasympathetic, sympathetic and somatic control of bladder function [6, 18, 74]

Many patients with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) above the lumbar spine lose voluntary control of bladder function, either partially or entirely, and develop a neurogenic bladder, which manifests as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( DSD ) —a lack of coordination between the detrusor and sphincter muscles that prevents effective bladder emptying. On the other hand, patients with SCI at the lumbosacral spinal level have an areflexic, flaccid bladder, reduced bladder capacity, and an inability to store urine leading to incontinence [1]. Electromagnetic stimulation of the spinal cord is a promising approach to restore lower urinary tract ( LUT ) functions after SCI. Epidural electrical stimulation and transcutaneous magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) of the lumbar spine below the level of injury influence neural activities within the spine and have the potential to foster recovery of bladder function after SCI [2–5]. The mechanisms whereby spinal cord stimulation affects the activities of the neural circuits in the lumbosacral spinal cord are not well understood, however, and the effects of T on bladder function in patients with SCI have been inconsistent [6, 7, 8]. We developed a mathematical model of the neural circuits controlling mictition after SCI and the effects of T on the spinal cord as a therapeutic intervention to alleviate bladder dysfunction after SCI. A model of the neural circuits was built on a state-of-the-art to capture normal storage/void functions under healthy conditions and disorders of the bladder after SCI, such as detor-sinct dyssynerg and overactivity of the bladder. The effect of T on the spinal was modeled at single-cell based on experimental findings from patch-clamp and extracellular recordings. The effect at the network level was analyzed through simulations which revealed mechanisms the amelioration of detor-sinct dyssergia by T and the whereby low ( not high ) frequency T was effective for this.

Researchers have proposed a mathematical model to estimate fungal growth rates from indirect optical density (OD) data without the need for calibration, making it accessible to microbiology laboratories that collect OD data. The model treats OD as an observed variable distributed around a linear transformation of true fungal concentration, explicitly including calibration in the structure. The model was demonstrated to fit and predict OD time-course data for Aspergillus fumatus, a filamentous fungus, and estimated morphology-specific growth using measured data. The model outperformed reference non-parametric models in fitting and predicting OD curves, overcoming discrepancies between morphology-specific rates inferred from OD versus directly measured data. The model was used to infer hyal growth from indirect OD data and hyal extension and growth from direct measures. The estimated rates were closer to those from direct measures compared to a logistic model without calibration. A parametric models are preferred for growth and rate estimation due to explicit growth parameter, increased interpretability, and inclusion of known mechanisms. The model can be used as a foundation for investigating antifungal action using OD data by inferring growth rates in varying concentrations.
Beetles are the most species-rich group of animals, with over 400,000 described taxa, and harbor diverse karyotypes. Most species have XY chromosomes, but X0 sex determination is common in some groups. A whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confus, with a neo-sex chromosome, was generated, and eleven beetle genomes were used to reconstruct kary evolution across Coleoptera. Ancestral groups, termed Muller elements, share conserved genes across beet. The ancestral X chromosome is conserved across beet, but autosomes are added to the sex chromosomes independently. Neo-sex evolve stereotypical properties, including dosage compensation and non-random gene distribution with sex-bi expression. Beet provide a model to understand diverse forces driving sex evolution.

A phylogenetic sampling of beet suggests they are a model to study kary evolution and evolutionary forces on chromosomes. Ancestral groups are maintained across beet, allowing kary evolution study at molecular level. The X is conserved in Coleoptera, but multiple neo-chromosomes formed among closely related beet. Abundance of beet and genomic tools make Cole a valuable system to study mechanisms and forces driving sex differentiation across taxa. A chromosome assembly for Tribium confus and assemblies from eleven species were used to reconstruct sex and kary evolution in beet. RNA-seq data from tissues explored changes on neo-chromosomes in T. confus and Dendctonus ponderae, allowing evolutionary trajectory of sex in beet.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Chromatin structure and DNA accessibility are partly modulated by the incorporation of histone variants. H2A. Z, encoded by the non-essential HTZ1 gene in S. cerevisiae, is an evolutionarily conserved H2A histone variant that is predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR1-complex ( SWR1-C ). While H2A. Z has often been implicated in transcription regulation, htz1Δ mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. However, given that growth defects of htz1Δ mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SWR1-C subunits, previous work examining the role of H2A. Z in gene expression regulation may be confounded by deleterious activity caused by SWR1-C when missing its H2A. Z substrate ( apo-SWR1-C ). Furthermore, as H2A. Z mutants only display significant growth defects in genotoxic stress conditions, a more substantive role for H2A. Z in gene expression may only be uncovered after exposure to cellular stress. To explore this possibility, we generated mRNA transcript profiles for wild-type, htz1Δ, swr1Δ, and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants before and after exposure to hydroxyurea ( HU ), which induces DNA replication stress. Our data showed that H2A. Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than repression during HU exposure, and its incorporation was important for proper upregulation of several HU-induced genes. We also observed that apo-SWR1-C contributed to gene expression defects in the htz1Δ mutant, particularly for genes involved in phosphate homeostasis regulation. Furthermore, mapping H2A. Z incorporation before and after treatment with HU revealed that decreases in H2A. Z enrichment at transcription start sites was correlated with, but generally not required for, the upregulation of genes during HU exposure. Together this study characterized the regulatory effects of H2A. Z incorporation during the transcriptional response to HU.

    In this study, we generated a robust gene expression dataset to explore the complex relationship between H2A. Z and gene expression during HU exposure in S. cerevisiae. Our findings revealed that H2A. Z incorporation was more prominently involved in gene activation than repression, and that while relatively few genes were differentially expressed in the absence of H2A. Z, its incorporation was necessary for proper wild-type expression of several HU-induced genes. Furthermore, we observed that apo-SWR1-C contributed to the gene expression defects present in the htz1Δ mutant, particularly for genes involved in the PHO operon. Additionally, our investigation demonstrated that decreases in H2A. Z enrichment at TSSs correlated with, but was not generally required for, increased mRNA expression of HU-activated genes. Collectively, our results underscore the importance of both accounting for the confounding effects of apo-SWR1-C and using a model that induces widespread transcriptional changes to effectively examine the general role of H2A. Z in gene expression regulation. Our data provide new insights into how differences in gene expression could contribute to the slow growth phenotypes of the htz1Δ, swr1Δ, and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants during HU exposure. In our analysis we identified several genes and pathways associated with dNTP use and production that were dysregulated in the absence of H2A. Z incorporation. For example, HUG1, a ribonucleotide reductase ( RNR ) inhibitor that is highly upregulated upon DNA replication stress [56, 57], exhibited lower transcript levels in the HU-treated condition in all three mutants compared to wild-type. Furthermore, the absence of H2A. Z incorporation resulted in the upregulation of the iron regulon and the repression of several PHO operon genes

. Z substrate. Given that SWR1-C is not dependent on H2A. Z to bind TSSs [63], but H2A. Z is required for its efficient release from chromatin [64], it is likely that the deleterious effects of apo-SWR1-C resulted from a prolonged interaction with chromatin. Coinciding with this idea, in vitro experiments have demonstrated that SWR1-C binding is sufficient to initiate, but not complete, DNA unwrapping from nucleosomes [65], which may have transcriptional consequences in vivo. Therefore, to effectively examine the effects of H2A. Z incorporation on gene expression in S. cerevisiae, it is imperative to consider and address the additive effects of apo-SWR1-C on transcript profiles. While it is clear that H2A. Z has a diverse role in transcription regulation, and does not adhere to a universal paradigm [3], our results suggest that H2A. Z played a larger role in gene activation than repression in S. cerevisiae, particularly during HU exposure. Here we showed that controlling for the additive effects of apo-SWR1-C, or examining gene expression during HU exposure, revealed that the majority of DEGs caused by the absence of H2A. Z incorporation were downregulated compared to wild-type. Furthermore, by comparing gene expression between untreated and HU-treated conditions we showed that several genes highly upregulated during HU-exposure had smaller fold changes in the absence of H2A. Z incorporation. Given that many of the genes induced by HU exposure are also part of the ESR, a general stress response pathway in yeast [52], it is plausible that H2A. Z function is not specific to gene activation during HU exposure, but is instead a broad regulator of gene induction during an array of cellular stress conditions. Our findings are also consistent with previous work in budding yeast showing that many H2A. Z-dependent genes are only dysregulated in HTZ1 mutants when they are induced or derepressed [40–43, 66, 67]

. Z in gene expression regulation in S. cerevisiae, we examined the mRNA transcript profiles of htz1Δ, swr1Δ, and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants in both untreated and HU-treated conditions. Analysis of six biological replicates revealed that H2A. Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than gene repression during HU exposure, and that H2A. Z incorporation was important for wild-type expression of several HU-induced genes. We also observed that both the swr1Δ and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants had less severe gene expression defects compared to the htz1Δ mutant, particularly for genes involved in the regulation of phosphate homeostasis. Furthermore, by mapping H2A. Z incorporation at a single-nucleosome resolution before and after HU exposure, we found that decreases in H2A. Z enrichment at transcription start sites correlated with, but was generally not required for, increased mRNA expression of HU-activated genes. Taken together these results indicate that to effectively examine the role of H2A. Z in transcription regulation, it is important to account for the confounding effects of apo-SWR1-C and advisable to examine gene expression before and after gene induction.

. Z homotypic nucleosomes ( H2A. Z-H2A. Z-containing ) [28, 31], and the presence of other histone variants or histone post-translational modifications can further modify histone-histone and histone-DNA interactions [32–34]. In addition to affecting nucleosome stability, H2A. Z occupancy in mammalian models correlates with various transcription-related histone post-translational modifications, such as H3K4 methylation, further indicating a role for H2A. Z in gene expression regulation [3]. While these previous findings suggest a strong relationship between H2A. Z function and gene expression, the role of H2A. Z in transcription regulation has remained a long-standing enigma within the field, particularly in S. cerevisiae. One compelling model suggests that H2A. Z occupancy promotes gene activation by facilitating the disassembly of the +1 nucleosome, thereby promoting RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) initiation and elongation [35]. However, microarray experiments in budding yeast have challenged this notion, finding that less than 5% of genes are differentially expressed in the htz1Δ mutant in steady-state conditions despite H2A. Z being enriched at the majority of gene promoters [18, 22, 36–38]. Additionally, previous studies have found no broad correlation between H2A. Z occupancy and gene expression levels, with many H2A. Z-dependent genes exhibiting relatively limited H2A. Z enrichment at their promoter [18, 22, 23]. However, there is strong evidence to suggest that H2A. Z primarily regulates genes expression during the transcriptional response to cellular stress and changes in environment [3, 39]. For example, the htz1Δ mutant has defective activation of several inducible genes such as GAL1, PHO5, and IMD2 [40–42] and H2A. Z mutants only display significant growth defects when exposed to stress conditions [1]. This then raises the intriguing possibility that the relationship between H2A

Incorporation of histone variants is one of the principal mechanisms that cells use to create structurally and functionally distinct regions of chromatin. H2A. Z is an evolutionarily conserved histone variant in the H2A family encoded by the non-essential HT1 gene in S cerevisiae, which is predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR-complex ( SW1 ). While H2. Z has been implicated in transcriptional regulation, ht1 mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. However, given that growth defects of ht1 mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SW1 subunits, previous examining the role of H Z in gene regulation may be confounded by deleterious activity of SW1 when its Z substrate (apo-SW1 ) Furthermore, as Z mutants display significant growth defects in genotoxic conditions a more substantive role Z in gene may be uncovered after exposure cellular. To explore this possibility we generated mRNA profiles for wild-type ht1, sw1, and ht1sw mutants before and after hydroxya ( H ) which induces replication stress Our data showed Z played a prominent role in activation than repression during H exposure and its incorporation important for upregulation several H-induced genes also observed that apo-S1 contributed expression in ht mutants particularly genes involved homeostasis regulation Furthermore mapping Z incorporation before and after treatment H revealed decreases Z at transcription sites correlated but not required upregulation genes during exposure this study characterized effects Z during transcriptional response H

    Title: 
    Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNASeq ) data plays a major role in advancing our understanding of developmental biology. An important current question is how to classify transcriptomic profiles obtained from scRNASeq experiments into the various cell types and identify the lineage relationship for individual cells. Because of the fast accumulation of datasets and the high dimensionality of the data, it has become challenging to explore and annotate single-cell transcriptomic profiles by hand. To overcome this challenge, automated classification methods are needed. Classical approaches rely on supervised training datasets. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining data annotated at single-cell resolution, we propose instead to take advantage of partial annotations. The partial label learning framework assumes that we can obtain a set of candidate labels containing the correct one for each data point, a simpler setting than requiring a fully supervised training dataset. We study and extend when needed state-of-the-art multi-class classification methods, such as SVM, kNN, prototype-based, logistic regression and ensemble methods, to the partial label learning framework. Moreover, we study the effect of incorporating the structure of the label set into the methods. We focus particularly on the hierarchical structure of the labels, as commonly observed in developmental processes. We show, on simulated and real datasets, that these extensions enable to learn from partially labeled data, and perform predictions with high accuracy, particularly with a nonlinear prototype-based method. We demonstrate that the performances of our methods trained with partially annotated data reach the same performance as fully supervised data. Finally, we study the level of uncertainty present in the partially annotated data, and derive some prescriptive results on the effect of this uncertainty on the accuracy of the partial label learning methods. Overall our findings show how hierarchical and non-hierarchical partial label learning strategies can help solve the problem of automated classification of single-cell transcriptomic profiles, interestingly these methods rely on a much less stringent type of annotated datasets compared to fully supervised learning methods.

   . Because of the rapid accumulation of data, one of the major challenges currently is to perform accurate automated annotation of single-cell RNASeq datasets into accurate cell types [12–15]. Annotation strategies rely on the establishment of large atlases and expert knowledge, as well as transfer learning strategies for the use of already annotated datasets to newly generated ones. While often gene markers can be used to identify unambiguously a given cell type, in some cases, the annotation remains partial with an ambiguity that cannot be resolved by known a priori information [9]. We propose in this paper to take advantage of partial label learning strategies for the problem of automated single-cell transcriptomics profile annotation. The idea of partial label learning [16] consists in the task of multiclass classification, where, instead of a single label per sample, a set of candidate labels is given per sample, among which only one is correct. One of the application of this approach consists in the case when even with expert knowledge on known marker genes, it is not possible to perform single-cell annotation as it is the case for C. elegans [9]. The second class of applications concerns the situation where a reference atlas exists, providing sufficient information for establishing sets of candidate labels for each transcriptomic profile, but not sufficient for a single-cell resolution annotation ( because of time, cost, and computational limitations ). In this paper, we establish and address the challenge of resolving partially annotated single-cell transcriptomics profile by solving a partial label learning problem. We compare various implementations of the problem that we test both in simulated data and experimental data. We focus in particular on the question of labels with a hierarchy, such as the ones that can be found in developing and differentiating systems [12, 17–21]

. Altogether, we propose an approach that helps reduce the time spent on precise annotation of training datasets by considering sets of candidate labels per sample. In an era where transcriptomic data is being generated increasingly [57], being able to automatize more and with less expert knowledge the task of automatic cell type classification is highly relevant, as the quality of the annotation is currently the bottleneck [15]. Moreover, in addition to the automatic cell type classification task, one of the current challenges is to be able to combine multiple studies and atlases. Our results suggest that we could for example be using the classification results obtained from other already existing annotated datasets as a way to construct partial annotation for a new datasets. Similarly, we could be using tissue level information which is at scale high than cellular by nature and use all of the cell types expected in this tissue as a candidate label set. In conclusion, the flexibility and adaptability of the partial label learning framework is a key step in making transcriptomic single-cell data annotation easier and the corresponding prediction even more routinely used to interrogate the nature of the mechanisms underlying cell differentiation.

We proposed several approaches for the classification of partially labeled scRNASeq data. We provided detailed description of the optimization algorithms used to learn the models. To thoroughly evaluate the performance of all the methods, we devised a comprehensive testing protocol that covered various partial labeling scenarios. This protocol was applied to both simulated and experimental datasets. The experiments demonstrated that our approach, specifically the Prototype-Based Neural Network ( PB-nn ), achieved remarkably high accuracy in a fully supervised setting. Equally impressive was the models performances when only partial label training samples were available, showcasing the models’ ability to leverage partial information effectively. Furthermore, we showed that incorporating partially labeled training samples corresponding to certain labels improved the performance on labels for which supervised samples were also available at training time. Our findings also provided insights into the effect of the level of uncertainty in partial labeling, allowing us to achieve the best performance. Ultimately, we found that incorporating hierarchical information could significantly increase performance in partial label settings, particularly in extreme situations with low number of training samples. Our results, showing that we can perform multiclass classification with high accuracy on partially labeled data can be associated to the fact that transcriptomic datasets are highly structured and lie on a low dimensional manifold [3]. Indeed when training a classifier on several transcriptomic profiles, even if they’re partially annotated, will necessary take advantage of their geometrical properties. Because we showed that the highest performing partially labeled classifier is a nonlinear Prototype-Based method, we understand that the relationship between cell type identity and position in the feature space is not a linear function

The problem of automatically classifying partially labeled transcriptomic profiles is summarized in Fig 1. The task we are interested in may be viewed as a multi-class classification problem where samples x ∈ X belong to a set of labels Y that may be organized in a hierarchy. Here we consider X = R d and we note | Y | = c. We explored several settings, that we briefly describe now. We investigated several families of methods: Support Vector Machines based methods ( SVM ) ; Logistic Regression ( LR ), Nearest Neighbor methods ( kNN ), Prototype-based methods ( PB ) and ensemble-based methods ( Random forest ( RF ) and Extreme Gradient Boosting Methods ( XGBM ) ). We first explain in a generic way, independently of the classification model, how we handled the partially supervised setting. We then detail how we handled the hierarchical information to perform hierarchical classification. We note fW a classification model ( e. g. a SVM ) parameterized by a set of parameters W, fW ( x ) the class output by model fW for a sample x, score ( fW, x, c ) the score for model fW, class c and sample x ( in particular f W ( x ) = arg max c s c o r e ( f W, x, c ) ). Finally, we note loss ( fW, x, y ) the loss computed for a model fW and a labeled training sample ( x, y ). To start with, in the basic supervised multiclass classification problem, when the dataset includes supervised samples only, the solution is usually handled by an optimization problem of the form: arg min W Ω ( W ) + μ l ∑ i = 1 l l o s s ( f W, x i, y i ) ( 2 ) where W are the parameters of model f to be learned, Ω ( W ) is a regularization term, and μ tunes the trade-off between the two terms of the objective function. We experimented with several models and strategies. We distinguish between two families of models

. This leads us to a benchmark of partial hierarchical labeling methods adapted from classical approaches to the problem of partial labels. From the machine learning point of view, the problems we want to solve are hierarchical classification problems with partially labeled training data. Partial label learning has been studied in a variety of real-world learning scenarios, including automatic face naming [22, 23], web mining [24], and multimedia content analysis [23]. Researchers have proposed various approaches to tackle the partial label learning problem using well-known machine learning techniques. These techniques include maximum likelihood estimation [25], convex optimization [16], k-nearest neighbors [22, 25] and more. While maximum margin methods ( e. g. SVM ) are a powerful solution to such a partial labeling setting [26, 27], we will investigate prototype-based methods, nearest neighbor, logistic regression and ensemble methods as well to provide a comparative study of a wide spectrum of methods. Similarly, hierarchical classification has been addressed by many approaches in the machine learning community and in particular for extreme classification ( hierarchical classification with a very large number of labels ) [28]. Hierarchical classification has been intensively studied for image data [29] and textual data [30]. Yet the research in this area has mainly focused on specific application contexts for these data, large-scale problems ( in the number of classes and in the number of data ) [28–32], whereas our focus is on single-cell transcriptomic data with a relatively small number of samples and a large number of labels.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The RNA content is crucial for the formation of nuclear compartments, such as nuclear speckles and nucleoli. Phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) is found in nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and nuclear lipid islets and is involved in RNA polymerase I/II transcription. Intriguingly, the nuclear localization of PIP2 was also shown to be RNA-dependent. We therefore investigated whether PIP2 and RNA cooperate in the establishment of nuclear architecture. In this study, we unveiled the RNA-dependent PIP2-associated ( RDPA ) nuclear proteome in human cells by mass spectrometry. We found that intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) with polybasic PIP2-binding K/R motifs are prevalent features of RDPA proteins. Moreover, these IDRs of RDPA proteins exhibit enrichment for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites. Our results show for the first time that the RDPA protein Bromodomain-containing protein 4 ( BRD4 ) associates with PIP2 in the RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions, and that altered PIP2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BRD4 protein. Thus, we propose that PIP2 spatiotemporally orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RDPA proteins and affects their ability to form foci presumably via phase separation. This suggests the pivotal role of PIP2 in the establishment of a functional nuclear architecture competent for gene expression.

   . e., components of protein complexes. It is a different approach than using immobilized PIP2 on beads, which we have previously used to identify PIP2 interactors [83]. Thus, the GST-PLCδ1 PH domain-based approach identifies naturally occurring PIP2-containing nuclear structures associated with protein complexes. Therefore, this experimental pipeline allowed us to determine the nuclear RNA-dependent PIP2-associated ( RDPA ) proteome. Our data show that the vast majority of PIP2-associated proteins lose their PIP2 association upon removal of higher-order RNA ( Fig 1E ). PIP2 is normally embedded in cytoplasmic membranes where it regulates various processes through interactions with a variety of proteins with PIPs binding domains. We hypothesized that nuclear PIP2 might be also involved in the recognition and binding of various proteins, thereby regulating the localization of their actions. Such proteins typically contain canonical PIPs binding domains with well-defined globular structures, e. g., pleckstrin homology ( PH ), phox homology ( PX ), Fab-1, YGL023, Vps27 and EEA1 ( FYVE ) domains, etc. To assess the abundance of PIPs binding domains in the RDPA proteome, we generated in parallel several reference datasets by analyzing the nuclear and cytosolic fractions isolated from the same HeLa cell line using the same LC-MS/MS proteomic pipeline ( see M&M section for more details ). We then searched for these domains in the RDPA proteome and in datasets of proteins identified exclusively in the nucleus ( ’nucleo-specific’, 848 proteins ) and in the cytosol ( ’cytosol-specific’, 428 proteins ). In addition, we generated the ’total cell proteome’ ( 4, 082 proteins ) by combining all proteins identified in our MS analyses of nuclear and/or cytosolic proteomes. For comparison, we also provide the analysis of the additional proteomes, i. e

Differentially phosphorylated inositol headgroups of different phosphoinositides ( PIPs ) serve as a recognition code for the recruitment of a plethora of interacting proteins [1–4]. PIPs are typically embedded in eukaryotic cell membranes where they regulate processes such as vesicular trafficking, actin polymerization, or autophagy [5, 6]. The pioneering work on identifying the presence of PIPs in the cell nucleus was done several decades ago [7–10] but is now receiving increasing attention. One of the most widely studied nuclear PIPs is phosphatidyl inositol 4, 5-bisphosphate ( PIP2 ). PIP2 localizes to nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and small nucleoplasmic structures called nuclear lipid islets ( NLIs ) [11, 12]. Nuclear PIPs are involved in gene expression [2, 11, 13]. In particular, nuclear PIP2 regulates transcription by affecting the condensation capacity of the RNA Pol2 initiation complex [14]. Interestingly, nuclear compartments containing PIP2, such as the aforementioned nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and nucleoplasmic transcription initiation foci, are formed by the process of phase separation [15–21]. The phase separation-driven formation of membraneless compartments, sometimes referred to as ’biomolecular condensates’, is associated with enhanced kinetics of biochemical reactions in the living cell [22–25]. The formation of these compartments provides high local concentrations of reaction components and forms diffusion barriers that serve as adsorption catalyst surfaces [26]. In addition, biomolecular condensates allow the sequential progression of processes through the successive coupling of subsequent reactions in multilayered compartmentalized reaction chambers, such as ribosomal biogenesis in nucleoli, packaging of hnRNP particles in Cajal bodies, or the involvement of nuclear speckles in pre-mRNA splicing [17, 27–29]

. e., ’nuclear fraction’ proteins, ’cytosolic fraction’ proteins, and ’reference proteome’ ( S3 Fig and S3 and S4 Tables; see M&M for details ). However, in agreement with previously published data [2, 83], the frequency of canonical PIPs binding domains was very low in both RDPA subpopulations. Only 11 out of 183 RDPA proteins positively regulated by the presence of higher-order RNA contain the PIPs binding domains ( S5 Table ), suggesting that these domains are not a major route of PIP2 association. Interestingly, none of the proteins negatively regulated by the presence of higher-order RNA possess such a domain. Notably, this dataset ( 16 proteins ) that showed increased PIP2 binding upon higher-order RNA cleavage is rather small for reasonable statistical correlation with other datasets. Therefore, we focused further analyses only on RDPA proteins with a positive higher-order RNA effect on their PIP2 binding, and unless otherwise noted, the term RDPA proteins refers to this subpopulation. Nuclear PIP2 localizes to two archetypal liquid-like structures formed by phase separation—nuclear speckles and nucleoli [17, 25, 29]. The appropriate subcompartmentalized nature of such multiphase structures depends on the presence of architectural RNAs [27, 55, 91, 99, 100]. Furthermore, there is a higher concentration of RNA in the nucleus compared to the cytosol, suggesting that RNA is the critical driving force for the preferential formation of such structures in the nucleus. Our bioinformatic analyses confirmed the enrichment of RNA-binding properties within the RDPA proteome ( Figs 2A and S4A and S6 Table ), a predictable feature due to the RNase III treatment step in our MS workflow. Importantly, we showed that the RDPA proteome is the most enriched for proteins with the ability to phase separate from all datasets ( Figs 2A and S4A and S7 Table )

. Based on our data, we propose that nuclear PIP2 regulates the affinity between RNA and BRD4 protein. This interaction defines the areas of foci formation, thus orchestrating nuclear subcompartmentalization and leading to efficient gene expression. Our data are consistent with the recently published work in which the authors describe, among other fundamental findings, the effect of PIPs on the quantity, size and morphology of condensates in an in vitro system [59]. This model brings new perspectives to another recent observation that carcinogenic human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection increases nuclear PIP2 levels in human wart samples [97]. Thus, we provide mechanistic insights into the real biological implications of this phenomenon. In conclusion, we have shown that nuclear PIP2 localization is dependent on the presence of higher-order RNA and identified RDPA proteins that associate with nuclear PIP2 in a higher-order RNA-dependent manner. To this end, we developed and optimized a MS-based experimental pipeline that can be applied to other nuclear lipid-protein interactors. Our results showed that interactions between RDPA protein BRD4 and PIP2 are mediated by electrostatic interactions, presumably via the enriched K/R motifs within the IDRs. The PIP2-binding function of such K/R motifs has been described previously [3, 83]. Based on our bioinformatics analysis, we have shown that more than half of the RDPA proteins have experimentally demonstrated RNA binding capacity and are associated with the process of phase separation. We found that IDRs have a bimodal distribution of pI, and we provide bioinformatic tools for their convenient analyses. We also showed that IDRs of RDPA proteins are longer and more hydrophilic

. The K/R motif-containing IDRs of RDPA proteins are enriched for known phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites, possibly providing an additional level of regulation for their integration into phase-separated condensates. GO analysis revealed that RDPA proteins are involved in various biological processes, such as gene expression, transcription, translation, and RNA processing. Our results suggest that P2 orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RD proteins and affects their ability to form foci via phase separation. This is a pivotal role of P2 in the establishment of a functional nuclear architecture competent for gene expression.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Phenotypic plasticity is thought to be an important driver of diversification and adaptation to environmental variation, yet the genomic mechanisms mediating plastic trait development and evolution remain poorly understood. The Scarabaeinae, or true dung beetles, are a species-rich clade of insects recognized for their highly diversified nutrition-responsive development including that of cephalic horns—evolutionarily novel, secondary sexual weapons that exhibit remarkable intra- and interspecific variation. Here, we investigate the evolutionary basis for horns as well as other key dung beetle traits via comparative genomic and developmental assays. We begin by presenting chromosome-level genome assemblies of three dung beetle species in the tribe Onthophagini ( > 2500 extant species ) including Onthophagus taurus, O. sagittarius, and Digitonthophagus gazella. Comparing these assemblies to those of seven other species across the order Coleoptera identifies evolutionary changes in coding sequence associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis. We then contrast chromatin accessibility in developing head horn tissues of high- and low-nutrition O. taurus males and females and identify distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition- compared to sex-responsive development, including a large proportion of recently evolved regulatory elements sensitive to horn morph determination. Binding motifs of known and new candidate transcription factors are enriched in these nutrition-responsive open chromatin regions. Our work highlights the importance of chromatin state regulation in mediating the development and evolution of plastic traits, demonstrates gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals, and provides new reference-quality genomes for three species that will bolster future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies of this insect group.

    Nutrition-responsive phenotypic plasticity is a ubiquitous property of living systems and important biological mechanism for adaptation and trait diversification [1, 2]. In this study, we first used comparative genomics to identify coding and non-coding changes in dung beetles associated with metabolite and developmental regulation that are potentially underpinning the evolution of nutritionally plastic phenotypes in these species. These biological pathways are involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, juvenile hormone production, and embryonic transcriptional regulation, which collectively are now motivating new hypotheses for how nutrition-responsive development may have evolved in this group of insects. We then carried out an in-depth genomic and developmental analysis of one of these traits, head horns–secondary sexual weapons with an extreme degree of inter- and intraspecific variation. Chromatin configuration assays suggest alternative forms of intraspecific horn variation ( sexual dimorphism vs. nutritional plasticity ) are instructed by discrete regulatory architectures, a conclusion corroborated by two independent pieces of support: 1 ) largely distinct sex- and nutrition-responsive head horn OCRs; and 2 ) a disproportionate amount of OCRs that are nutrition-, but not sex-, responsive and only found in the O. taurus genome. In other words, accessibility of putative cis-regulatory elements covaries extensively with sex and, in males, nutritional state, of which the latter set is disproportionally composed of recently evolved regulatory elements. Future work comparing the overlap of sex- and nutrition-dependent changes in regulatory element activity of other body regions with varying degrees of sex and nutrition responsiveness will be critical to contextualizing these results and understanding how gene regulatory mechanisms evolve across disparate traits

. Through a series of whole genome alignments and comparative genomic assays including other published beetle genomes, we identify sequence gains and changes putatively associated with adaptations unique to dung beetle ecology and evolution. We then utilize these three reference genomes to investigate the role of the non-coding genome in the development and evolution of sex- and nutrition-dependent horn formation across our three focal species. We chose these three species because collectively they embody a remarkable diversity in head horn development reflective of much of the diversity contained within the clade, including: a highly exaggerated sexual dimorphism and male polyphenism in O. taurus; a rare example of sex-reversed horn development in O. sagittarius females paralleled by a secondary loss of horn polyphenism in males; and a modest sexual dimorphism and male polyphenism in the more distantly related D. gazella thought to reflect ancestral character states ( Fig 1B ). Specifically, we apply genome-wide chromatin accessibility assays to investigate the cis-regulatory basis for sex- and nutrition-biased horn formation in O. taurus and provide some of the first evolutionary insights into the chromatin architecture underlying nutrition-dependent morph determination and developmental plasticity broadly. Our approach and results open new ways of understanding how gene networks may evolve to generate novel structures and regulate environment-responsive development.

. We focused on individuals who had just completed the larval to pupal transition and replicated our approach in both males and females reared in high and low nutrition conditions to identify putative regulatory elements involved in sex- and morph-dependent horn morphogenesis. It total, we identified 68, 038 open chromatin regions ( OCRs ) in dorsal epithelial cells of O. taurus pupae, a portion of which we predict will contain CREs involved in developmental regulation of this body region. At a genome-wide scale, the chromatin landscape of high and low nutrition females is nearly indistinguishable and only 25 OCRs ( 0. 037% ) are significantly differentially accessible between nutritional conditions in this sex ( S4 Data ). This result may not be surprising given, like most dung beetle species, O. taurus females do not develop head horns or any other nutrition-responsive dorsal head phenotype. Accordingly, we grouped high and low nutrition female samples into a single female sample group ( seven biological replicates ) for downstream accessibility comparisons. In stark contrast, we found 401 differentially accessible OCRs in primordial horn tissue of males reared in high vs. low nutritional conditions, including 250 OCRs more accessible in major males and 151 OCRs more accessible in minor males ( Fig 3A: top ). We categorize this set of OCRs as putative nutrition-responsive regulatory sites. Interestingly, over half ( 52. 3% ) of the 151 OCRs more accessible in minor males are located on the X chromosome ( Scaffold 8 ), suggesting many loci responsible for regulating plastic horn growth are concentrated on this chromosome

. This includes not only consuming dung as a food source ( coprophagy ), but also as a resource for larval food provisioning and nest construction, thereby enabling a single offspring to complete development from egg to adult within the confines of an underground brood ball. One key adaptation aiding in this strategy is a highly diversified degree of nutrition-responsive ( plastic ) development. In the case of dung beetles, nutrition-responsive development is a flexible developmental response to variable and limited larval food quality and quantity, resulting in a wide range of adult body sizes, which in turn has fueled the evolution of alternative, body size-dependent morphological, physiological, and behavioral phenotypes [8]. Accordingly, phenotypic plasticity is predicted to be an evolutionary driver for many dung beetle adaptations. Furthermore, due to their diversity, abundance, pronounced environment-sensitive development, and unique feeding and reproductive traits, dung beetles have thus long served as important models for behavioral ( e. g. status dependent selection and sperm competition models [9, 10] ), developmental ( e. g. mechanisms of plasticity [11, 12] ), evolutionary ( e. g. the origins of evolutionary novelties [13] ), and ecological studies ( e. g. meta-population theory [14], nutrient recycling, soil aeration [15, 16] ). However, despite the significance of dung beetles in both basic and applied science, a reference-quality genomic resource for any member of this insect group has so far been lacking and thus limited studies examining the genetic basis for dung beetle traits and adaptations. Among the most conspicuous morphological trait of dung beetles are head horns—novel, highly diversified secondary sexual weapons used in reproductive competition [17]

. In total, we identified 19, 407 orthogroups across the three Onthophagini species reported here and seven other coleopterans for which chromosome-scale resolution genomes ( or close to ) where available ( Fig 2A ). These seven non-dung beetle species represent a diverse set of feeding ecologies ( e. g. predation: Photinus pyralis ( firefly ) ; phytophagy: Leptinotarsa decemlineata ( Colorado potato beetle ) ; wood feeding: Anoplophora glabripennis ( Asian long-horned beetle ) ) and a range of phylogenetic distances relative to the Scarabaeinae. From these orthogroups, we identified evolutionary changes in gene content in dung beetles relative to species in other beetle families in two ways: 1 ) examination of rapidly evolving gene families within multi-copy orthogroups ( 14, 414 orthogroups ) using CAFE [25] and 2 ) testing for evidence of episodic diversifying selection among single copy orthologs ( 2, 948 orthogroups tested ) with BUSTED [26]. While gene family size changes and non-synonymous mutations are not necessarily indicative of adaptation, these analyses provide predictions of candidate genes and pathways for further assessment. We highlight evolutionary changes at five phylogenetic positions ( Fig 2A ) : each beetle species tip, the ancestral node of O. taurus and O. sagittarius, and the ancestral node of all three dung beetle species examined here ( Ot-Os-Dg node ). For each dung beetle species, we identified ~200–300 rapidly evolving ( mostly expanded ) orthogroups as well 110 inferred to be under episodically selected. These include genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, juvenile hormone production, and embryonic transcriptional regulation, which are now motivating hypotheses for how nutrition-responsive development evolved in this group of insects. 

The results of this study demonstrate the importance of chromatin regulation in mediating the development and evolution of plastic traits, show that gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals, and provide reference-quality genomes for three species that will bolster future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies of this group.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The pathogenesis of Lassa fever has not yet been fully deciphered, particularly as concerns the mechanisms determining whether acute infection is controlled or leads to catastrophic illness and death. Using a cynomolgus monkey model of Lassa virus ( LASV ) infection reproducing the different outcomes of the disease, we performed histological and transcriptomic studies to investigate the dynamics of LASV infection and the immune mechanisms associated with survival or death. Lymphoid organs are an early major reservoir for replicating virus during Lassa fever, with LASV entering through the cortical sinus of draining lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, subsequent viral tropism varies considerably with disease severity, with viral dissemination limited almost entirely to lymphoid organs and immune cells during nonfatal Lassa fever. By contrast, the systemic dissemination of LASV to all organs and diverse cell types, leading to infiltrations with macrophages and neutrophils and an excessive inflammatory response, is associated with a fatal outcome. These results provide new insight into early viral dynamics and the host response to LASV infection according to disease outcome.

   . We have shown that, following its initial replication at the inoculation site, LASV reaches the SLOs, where it displays significant levels of replication in all animals. However, the dynamics of viral dissemination then differ strikingly between outcomes. LASV displays no significant further spread in surviving animals, whereas systemic viral dissemination and replication is observed in animals with fatal disease, leading to a cytokine/chemokine storm and multiple organ failure closely resembling that observed in septic shock syndrome. Here, we further analyzed the dynamics and tropism of these two strains of LASV in these animals, to shed light on the pathogenesis of Lassa fever and the immune mechanisms associated with the different outcomes.

The aim of this study was to characterize in more detail the dynamics of the pathogenesis and immune responses associated with survival or death from LF in a cynomolgus monkey model in which infection with AV LASV leads to non-lethal disease whereas infection with Josiah LASV results in death [25]. We previously showed that early LASV replication occurs in the skin adjacent to the subcutaneous site of infection. We show here that the draining lymph nodes are the first organ targeted by LASV after this early local replication, with infected cells detected in the subcortical sinus of ILNs close to the inoculation site at 2 DPI. This observation suggests that LASV probably accesses the LN draining the inoculation site through afferent lymph vessels, via infected APCs or free viral particles. We were unable to detect LASV in other tissues/organs at this time. The virus subsequently replicates in the ILNs, MLNs, GALT, and thymus and then in the spleen. These results confirm that lymphoid organs are an early major reservoir for LASV replication whatever the outcome of the disease, and that APCs—or at least macrophages—probably play a key role in the dissemination of LASV from the inoculation site. However, differences in tropism were observed between LASV strains in MLN, with only macrophages infected by the AV strain whereas stromal cells—probably fibroblastic reticular cells ( FRC ) —and neutrophils were also found to contain Josiah LASV material. From 5 DPI, tropism differed considerably between AV and Josiah LASV. Josiah LASV disseminated to almost all the organs, as previously reported for fatal LF in cynomolgus monkeys [17, 20, 26, 30], replicating in non-immune cells, stromal cells, endothelial cells, hepatocytes, and epithelial cells. By contrast, AV LASV spread was limited to a few organs—the liver, adrenal glands and capillaries in the brain—with its effects limited essentially to immune cell infiltrates

. Lineages 1, 2, and 3 circulate in Nigeria, lineage 4 is found in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, lineage 5 has been described in Mali and Côte d’Ivoire, and lineage 7 predominates in Togo and Benin [4, 14–16]. By contrast, lineage 6 has been isolated only from rodents [7]. All LASV strains can cause fatal disease in humans, and it remains unclear whether there are differences in the pathogenicity of the various strains in patients. However, in the cynomolgus monkey model, the different lineages seem to induce disease with different severities [17–19]. As both patient access and the handling of LASV patient samples are very limited, animal models are crucial to understand the pathogenesis of Lassa fever and the events enabling some patients to control LASV and leading to catastrophic illness and death in others. LASV has a preferential tropism for antigen-presenting cells ( APC ), dendritic cells and macrophages, potentially accounting for the rapid transfer of the virus from site of local infection to secondary lymphoid organs ( SLOs ) [20, 21]. However, this tropism does not seem to favor the induction of LASV-specific T-cell responses [22–24]. The replication of LASV in SLOs is followed by systemic dissemination to almost all organs during severe Lassa fever in cynomolgus monkeys, whereas the spread of the virus appears to be restricted to a few organs in surviving animals [17, 20, 25]. We and others have shown that LASV strains belonging to lineage 5, such as AV and Soromba [5, 16], cause less severe disease than the Josiah strain in cynomolgus monkeys [18, 26]. We have recently developed a cynomolgus monkey model that reproduces the different outcomes of Lassa fever observed in humans [25]. Infecting animals with the Josiah and AV strains of LASV at the same dose and via the same route of inoculation leads to uniformly fatal Lassa fever and non-severe disease and survival, respectively

. These observations suggest that T-cell activation may be non-specific and that the widespread presence of activated bystander T cells may contribute to the disease, as previously suggested in patients with fatal infections [24]. One limitation of this study is the subcutaneous ( SC ) route of infection used, which is not similar to natural infection with LASV that occurs via respiratory tract. We cannot perform aerosol infection in our BSL4 facilities, and have choosen SC instead of intramuscular route to avoid a systemic route of infection. However, we think that this discrepancy with natural infection does not alter the course of infection, as lungs rapidly became targeted with the virus and similar pathological changes and viral tropism was reported in LASV-infected cynomolgus monkeys infected using aerosol route [30]. Another limitation is the fact that AV LASV has been isolated from a single patient who succumbed, showing that this virus can be fatal in humans whereas it is not in our model. However, as our aim is to model fatal and nonfatal Lassa fever in cynomolgus monkey, this discrepancy is not a problem. This study shows that SLOs are early and crucial reservoirs for LASV replication in all infected animals, irrespective of the severity of the disease. Then, cell tropism, viral dissemination, and immune cell infiltration strikingly differ between animals according to the disease outcome. Moreover, our results suggest that events that take place in SLOs early during the course of infection may determine the later different host responses and the outcome of Lassa fever, either control of LASV and recovery or catastrophic illness and death. However, further experiments will be needed to characterize these mechanisms.

. The splenic marginal zone ( SMZ ) is a crucial area for immune responses. We therefore investigated the transcriptomic profile of SMZ-derived cells purified from FFPE sections by laser-capture microdissection 11 DPI. The viral load in this area was significantly higher in Josiah-infected animals than in AV-infected animals ( Fig 6A ). We performed a gene set enrichment analysis with the HALLMARK database and identified pathways for which there were significant differences between Josiah- and AV-infected animals ( Fig 6B ). The IFNα and γ response, E2F target, IL6/JAK/STAT3, G2/M checkpoint, IL2/STAT5 and complement pathways were activated during Lassa fever, as shown by comparison with mock-infected animals, but this activation was more intense after Josiah LASV infection. The MYC targets V1, unfolded protein response, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were activated in Josiah-infected animals relative to AV-infected animals, but were downregulated in AV-infected animals relative to mock-infected animals. The mTORC1 signaling pathway was upregulated in Josiah-infected animals relative to AV-infected animals. Finally, the apoptosis pathway was upregulated in Josiah-infected animals relative to all other groups. We then analyzed the expression of gene sets related to different immune parameters and observed that those specific to monocytes, the type I IFN response, B cells, and cytokines were activated during LASV infection, and that this activation was stronger for Josiah LASV ( Fig 6C and 6D ). The T cell-related gene set was also activated after LASV infection, but with no difference between LASV strains. We used the same approach to determine the transcriptome of hepatocytes purified 11 DPI by laser-capture microdissection from FFPE sections stained for LASV GP

Here is a summary of the study on the pathogenesis of Lassa fever, a viral disease caused by the Lassa fever virus (LASV). The researchers used a cynomolg monkey model to investigate the dynamics of LAS infection and immune responses associated with survival or death. They found that lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes and spleen, are early reservoirs for LAS replication, regardless of disease outcome. However, viral tropism varies with severity, with limited spread to lymphoid cells in non-fatal disease and systemic dissemination to all organs in fatal. The study provides new insights into viral dynamics and host response to LAS infection according to disease outcome.

The researchers showed that after initial replication at inoculation site, LASV reaches lymph nodes, displaying significant replication in all animals. However, dynamics differ between outcomes, with no further spread in surviving animals and systemic dissemination in fatal. They analyzed the dynamics and tropism of two LAS strains to shed light on pathogenesis and immune mechanisms. The aim was to characterize the pathogenesis and immune responses associated survival or death in cynolg monkey model, which leads to non-lethal disease with AVV and fatal with Josiah LAS.

The study found that lymph nodes are first targeted by LAS after local replication, with infected cells in subcortical sinus close inoculation at 2 DPI. The virus replicates in lymph, MLNs, GALT, thymus, and spleen, confirming lymphoid organs major reservoir for replication. However, differences in tropism observed between strains, with macrophages infected AV and stromal cells, fibroblastic reticular (F) and neutils Josiah. From 5 DPI, tropism differed, with Josiah disseminating almost all organs, replicating non-imm cells, strom, endothelial, hepatocytes, epithelial, whereas AV limited to few organs, liver, adrenal, capillaries brain, with effects immune infiltrates.

The study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of Lassa fever and immune mechanisms associated with different outcomes. The findings suggest that early events in lymphoid organs determine later host response and outcome, either control or catastrophic death. Further experiments are needed to characterize these mechanisms.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Pathological disruption of Nucleocytoplasmic Transport ( NCT ), such as the mis-localization of nuclear pore complex proteins ( Nups ), nuclear transport receptors, Ran-GTPase, and RanGAP1, are seen in both animal models and in familial and sporadic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ), frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobar degeneration ( FTD\FTLD ), and Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s Related Dementias ( AD/ADRD ). However, the question of whether these alterations represent a primary cause, or a downstream consequence of disease is unclear, and what upstream factors may account for these defects are unknown. Here, we report four key findings that shed light on the upstream causal role of Importin-β-specific nuclear transport defects in disease onset. First, taking advantage of two novel mouse models of NEMF neurodegeneration ( NemfR86S and NemfR487G ) that recapitulate many cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases, we find an Importin-β-specific nuclear import block. Second, we observe cytoplasmic mis-localization and aggregation of multiple proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS/FTD and AD/ADRD, including TDP43, Importin-β, RanGap1, and Ran. These findings are further supported by a pathological interaction between Importin-β and the mutant NEMFR86S protein in cytoplasmic accumulations. Third, we identify similar transcriptional dysregulation in key genes associated with neurodegenerative disease. Lastly, we show that even transient pharmaceutical inhibition of Importin-β in both mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cells induces key proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in our mouse models and in neurodegeneration. Our convergent results between mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cellular biology provide mechanistic evidence that many of the mis-localized proteins and dysregulated transcriptional events seen in multiple neurodegenerative diseases may in fact arise primarily from a primary upstream defect in Importin- β nuclear import. These findings have critical implications for investigating how sporadic forms of neurodegeneration may arise from presently unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations in Importin-β function.

    Nucleocytoplasmic transport ( NCT ) defects underlie several neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ), frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobar degeneration ( FTD\FTLD ), and Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s Related Dementias ( AD/ADRD ) [1–3]. Here we show that mutations in Nuclear Export Mediator Factor ( NEMF ) in mice result in Importin-β-specific nuclear import defects, cytoplasmic protein mis-localization, and recapitulate phenotypic and transcriptional alterations found in neurodegenerative disorders. We further show that transient pharmaceutical inhibition of Importin-β induces key proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in neurodegenerative diseases. NCT involves the regulated trafficking of proteins and RNA between the nucleus and the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) [4]. Smaller molecules ( <40kDa ) can freely migrate through the nuclear pore, whereas larger molecules require active transport mediated by nuclear transport receptors ( NTRs, also known as karyopherins ) such as importins and exportins [5]. During nuclear import, nuclear import receptors ( NIRs ), such as Importin-β, directly bind their cargo in the cytoplasm or utilize importin-α as an adaptor to bind cargo proteins bearing a classical nuclear localization signal ( cNLS ) [6, 7]. Other NIRs, such as Transportin-1, recognize different nuclear localization signals, such as a Proline-Tyrosine NLS ( PY-NLS ), for transport into the nucleus [8]. Pathological disruption of NCT, such as the mis-localization of Nuclear Pore Complex proteins ( Nups ), NTRs, and Ran-GTPase, are seen in both animal models and in familial and sporadic forms of ALS, FTD, and AD/ADRD [9–16]. In addition, pathological cytoplasmic protein aggregates mark the progression of most neurodegenerative diseases [17, 18]

A common pathological hallmark of neurodegeneration is the accumulation of cytoplasmic amyloid-like aggregated proteins [17, 65, 66]. Our data, utilizing two independent single nucleotide polymorphisms in Nemf ( R86S and R487G ), demonstrate that disrupted Importin-β nuclear import results in the mis-localization of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm. Importantly, this disruption of NCT is specific to Importin-β nuclear import and not to Transportin-1 or RQC function. Recent evidence indicates that cells actively promote the sequestration of misfolded proteins into aggregates, which are further compartmentalized within distinct cellular compartments [25, 67, 68]. NIRs have been shown to operate in the cytoplasm and disaggregate NLS-bearing cargoes to prevent deleterious phase transitions [69]. This ability to inhibit and reverse both physiological and deleterious phase transitions has been implicated in multiple forms of neurodegenerative diseases, wherein RNA-binding proteins or Prion-like domains are lost from the nucleus and accumulate in the cytoplasm [69–77]. This is demonstrated in the role of Importin-β cooperating with Importin-α to prevent and reverse TDP-43 condensation and fibrillization [69, 71]. Furthermore, Importin-β upregulation has been shown to rescue hallmarks of TDP-43 proteinopathy [63, 64]. The potential of these NIRs to serve as cytoplasmic chaperones and restore the nuclear function of RNA-binding proteins highlights their therapeutic potential [78]. It is difficult to establish whether the mutant NEMF R86S is pathologically interacting with Importin-β directly or is indirectly associating with Importin-β through aggregate-induced sequestration. However, the absence of nuclear import defects in an Ltn1 knockdown model highlights an RQC-independent specificity for NEMF in these observed import defects

. Our study reveals that there is a causative role for an Importin-β nuclear import deficiency upstream of the multiple proteinopathies and transcriptional pathologies found in neurodegenerative disease.

. Interestingly, knockdown of NEMF and Importin-α, but not Importin-β causes an upregulation of APOE transcripts, again mimicking similar phenotypes observed in mice. The divergence for the dysregulation of Apoe and Stmn2 suggests that these transcripts are more likely dysregulated through separate downstream pathways, with Stmn2 being dysregulated by defects in nuclear import and Apoe by other unknown mechanisms, non-specific to neuronal cells. However, the ability for Importin-β upregulation to rescue both Stmn2 and Apoe in our NemfR86S, even if partially suggests a divergence of pathology that can be mediated by both driving nuclear import as well as the disaggregating chaperone activity of Importin-β. We have demonstrated that there is a direct impact of Importin-β nuclear import dysregulation on multiple phenotypes seen in neurodegeneration through the following: ( 1 ) NEMF-specific dysregulation of Importin-β nuclear import ( but not of Transportin-1 import ), ( 2 ) mis-localization and aggregation of NEMF, TDP43, Ran, RanGAP1 and Importin-β, ( 3 ) amyloid-like aggregation, ( 4 ) PLA cytoplasmic association between NEMF R86S and Importin-β, ( 5 ) cytoplasmic accumulation of NEMF, Importin-β, and TDP43 in Nemf mutant mouse spinal cord, ( 6 ) transient Importin-β-specific nuclear import blockage knockdown recapitulates these transcriptional alterations ( 7 ) and upregulation of Importin-β can partially rescue these transcriptional alterations. These dysfunctions are not, however, recapitulated upon knockdown of NEMF’s RQC partner LTN1, indicating a specific, non-RQC role for NEMF in impairing Importin-β nuclear import. Collectively, our data suggests that Importin-β nuclear import dysfunction serves as a primary upstream pathomechanism for TDP-43-mislocalization and phosphorylation, as well as transcriptional dysfunction seen in neurodegenerative proteinopathies.

. Indeed, when the NemfR86S MEFs were pulsed with puromycin ( OP-Puro ), we observed a reduction for these substrates to be properly transported into the nucleus compared to WT MEFs, resulting in their accumulation in the cytoplasm ( Fig 3E and 3F ). This cytoplasmic accumulation was also observed when WT MEFs were treated with an Importin-β antagonist IPZ [46], highlighting the role of Importin-β as both a nuclear import mediator and a cytoplasmic chaperone ( Fig 3E and 3F ). Importin-β has been shown to form cytoplasmic granules under basal conditions as well as under stress [47]. It has been demonstrated that under conditions of stress such as neurodegenerative disease, both the abundance and activity of Import-β are upregulated [48, 49]. Our results suggest that Import-β is not only a cytoplasm chaper but also a nuclear mediator of NCT, and that its dysregulation can lead to proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in neurodegenerative diseases.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Lytic bacteriophages hold substantial promise in medical and biotechnological applications. Therefore a comprehensive understanding of phage infection mechanisms is crucial. CRISPR-Cas systems offer a way to explore these mechanisms via site-specific phage mutagenesis. However, phages can resist Cas-mediated cleavage through extensive DNA modifications like cytosine glycosylation, hindering mutagenesis efficiency. Our study utilizes the eukaryotic enzyme NgTET to temporarily reduce phage DNA modifications, facilitating Cas nuclease cleavage and enhancing mutagenesis efficiency. This approach enables precise DNA targeting and seamless point mutation integration, exemplified by deactivating specific ADP-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. Furthermore, by temporally removing DNA modifications, we elucidated the effects of these modifications on T4 phage infections without necessitating gene deletions. Our results present a strategy enabling the investigation of phage epigenome functions and streamlining the engineering of phages with cytosine DNA modifications. The described temporal modulation of the phage epigenome is valuable for synthetic biology and fundamental research to comprehend phage infection mechanisms through the generation of mutants.

   . coli. Furthermore, α-/β-gt serve as auxiliary genes [7, 17, 22], as the encoded proteins are pivotal in protecting phage DNA through glycosylation from host defense systems and host nucleases, including Cas nucleases [15, 23]. Thus, DNA modifications such as 5hmdC and 5ghmdC prevent the effective use of CRISPR-Cas for targeted phage mutagenesis and counterselection. In this study, we apply a eukaryotic ten-eleven translocation ( TET ) methylcytosine dioxygenase [24] to temporally reduce the abundance of 5ghmdC within the phage T4 genome to enable the specific and efficient targeting of phage DNA with CRISPR-Cas. This results in the facilitated introduction of point mutations into the phage genome in a scarless manner, exemplarily shown for two specific T4 phage ADP-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. The increased targeting efficiency of phage DNA by Cas nucleases allows for sequence-specific spacer selection. Simultaneously, the improved targeting efficiency of phage DNA by Cas nucleases can be exploited for efficient counterselection, streamlining the enrichment process for the generated phage mutant. We utilized a high-throughput screening approach based on next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) to identify the mutants, facilitating the identification and validation of phage T4 mutants. This method is compatible with automation, simplifying the phage genome engineering process and eliminating the need to introduce reporter genes into the phage genome. The scarless nature of this approach allows for the precise study of the impact of introduced mutations on phage infection without the side effects associated with gene deletion or reporter gene insertion. Overall, our findings propose an efficient strategy for introducing point mutations into genomes of lytic phages that possess cytosine-based DNA modifications

CRISPR-Cas has emerged as an extremely valuable tool for genome engineering. The effectiveness of CRISPR-Cas systems in phage engineering has been limited by extensive DNA modifications up to this point. In particular, specific Cas-mediated targeting and induction of DNA double-strand breaks, essential for the mutagenesis, is prevented by DNA modifications [15, 34]. The low Cas targeting efficiency of phage DNA is further reflected in the low mutagenesis rate, necessitating the screening of a large phage population to identify the phage mutants. Recently, the RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13a system has been reported to enable the introduction of multi-gene deletions and single codon changes. However, a minimum of three point mutations must be inserted for this system to counterselect for T4 phage mutants [52]. Our study circumvents previous limitations and presents a novel approach for precise, site-specific phage mutagenesis based on temporarily reducing phage DNA modifications. This enhances DNA accessibility for Cas nucleases, boosting the efficiency of phage DNA double-strand breaks–the first and essential step of CRISPR-Cas-based mutagenesis. Thus, we eliminate the need for pre-screening for the most efficient spacer, significantly facilitating the introduction of scarless point mutations at selected positions within the phage genome. The treatment of phage DNA with NgTET resulted in an increase in phage DNA targeting efficiency of up to ~70% ( Fig 3C ) and in mutagenesis efficiency of up to 6% ( Table 1 ). While both numbers considerably differ, it is important to mention that while Cas nuclease targeting is an essential mutagenesis step, it is not the only factor that influences the success of the precise genome mutagenesis

. Nevertheless, both T4 WT and NgTET-treated T4 phages ultimately induced complete lysis of the bacterial culture. Furthermore, the phages released during the lysis with NgTET-treated T4 were confirmed to be infectious, as evidenced by their ability to infect and lyse wild-type E. coli ( S1 Fig ). The previous experiment showed that treating phage T4 with NgTET led to delayed lysis of E. coli, showing the importance of phage DNA modifications for its fitness. Building on this, we aimed to investigate whether CRISPR-Cas targeting of the phage DNA would also be enhanced due to the NgTET treatment. We hypothesized that the reduction in DNA modifications could increase the susceptibility of phage DNA to Cas nuclease targeting, as demonstrated by the more effective targeting of non-glycosylated phage T4 DNA by CRISPR-Cas12 [44]. Therefore, NgTET treatment of T4 DNA would potentially result in Cas-mediated DNA double-strand breaks. Such a break would impede phage replication, consequently causing delayed or even absent lysis by NgTET-treated T4 compared to T4 WT. Given the extensive modifications in T4 WT DNA, we expected its lysis not to be significantly delayed by the expression of the CRISPR-Cas system. To follow this hypothesis, we conducted a lysis experiment in which we infected an E. coli strain, heterologously expressing the CRISPR-Cas12, with either T4 WT or NgTET-treated T4 phages ( Fig 2C ). For a proof of principle study, we designed a spacer targeting the T4 gene alt which encodes the T4 Alt ADP-ribosyltransferase. First, we verified that overexpression of CRISPR-Cas12 without a spacer does not negatively affect phage lysis and bacterial growth ( S3 Fig ). Next, we conducted the infection of the E. coli strain expressing the CRISPR-Cas12_Alt ( spacer targeting alt gene ) with T4 WT. As expected, we did not observe any negative impact of CRISPR-Cas12_Alt expression on phage lysis

. This break can be further repaired via homologous recombination with donor DNA ( DNA carrying the desired mutation ) present within the infected cell. However, the application of the CRISPR-Cas-based phage mutagenesis on the model phages, such as phage T4, has revealed an overall low mutagenesis efficiency ( 0–3% ) and being strongly dependent on the spacer selected for the mutagenesis [15–17]. This strongly impedes the specific targeting of the phage genome via CRISPR-Cas and requires pre-screening for efficient spacer before the mutagenesis, strongly reducing the applicability of the approach for efficient phage mutagenesis. The reason for the strong spacer dependence of Cas targeting efficiency is attributed to the extensive DNA modifications—present on phage DNA—that protect it from cleavage. The DNA modifications among the phages are widely distributed and are also present in the phage T4 [18, 19]. The enzyme deoxycytidylate 5-hydroxymethyltransferase ( gene 42 ) originating from T4 phage catalyzes the conversion of 2´-deoxycytidine 5´-monophosphate ( dCMP ) into 5-hydroxymethyl-2´-deoxycytidine 5´-monophosphate, which is subsequently converted to into 5-hydroxymethyl-2´-deoxycytidine 5’-triphosphate and incorporated into T4 DNA during replication ( further referred to as 5hmdC ). Next, the 5hmdC is glycosylated by α- or β-glycosyltransferases ( α-/β-gt ) to 5-α-/β-glycosyl hydroxymethyl-2´-deoxycytidine ( 5ghmdC ) within T4 DNA ( Fig 1A ) [20, 21]. The T4 phage epigenome plays a crucial role in phage fitness, exemplified by the essential gene 42. Notably, amber mutants for the gene have been reported. However, in this scenario, phage infections must be carried out using E. coli strains that harbor additional plasmids and thus do not represent the wild-type E. coli

Bacteriophages ( phages ) are viruses that specifically infect prokaryotic hosts. The high potential of the application of lytic phages in both medical and industrial settings has boosted phage research. However, understanding the mechanisms of phage infection is crucial for the development of phage-based therapeutics. CRIS-Cas have emerged as a powerful tool for genome engineering. However, the effectiveness of CR-Cas in ph engineering has been hindered by extensive DNA modifications present in phage. Our study presents a novel strategy for ph mutagenesis based on temporarily reducing ph DNA modifications, enhancing Casuc cleavage and mutagen efficiency. This approach enables precise targeting and seamless integration of point mutations exemplified by deactivating AD-ribosyltransferases crucial for ph infection. By temporally removing modifications, we elucidated the effects of these on T ph infections without necessitating deletions. Our strategy enables investigation of ph epigen functions and streamlining of ph with cytosine modifications. The described modulation of ph ep is valuable for synthetic and fundamental to comprehendage mechanisms through generation of mutants.
The genome of living cells is constantly challenged by DNA lesions that interfere with cellular processes such as transcription and replication. A manifold mechanisms act in concert to ensure DNA repair, expression, and genome stability. Bulky DNA lesions, such as those induced by UV or DNA-damaging 4-nitquinoline, act transcription and replicational roadblocks and represent a threat to cell metabolism. When on transcribed of active genes, these lesions are handled by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision (TCER), a incompletely understood ER-path. Using a genetic screen in yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, identified histone H2 as an important to transcription and DNA integrity following irradiation. The absence of H, repair TCER is severely impaired and RNAase II reduced, leading to increase in double-strand breaks.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The pervasiveness of gene expression variation and its contribution to phenotypic variation and evolution is well known. This gene expression variation is context dependent, with differences in regulatory architecture often associated with intrinsic and environmental factors, and is modulated by regulatory elements that can act in cis ( linked ) or in trans ( unlinked ) relative to the genes they affect. So far, little is known about how this genetic variation affects the evolution of regulatory architecture among closely related tissues during population divergence. To address this question, we analyzed gene expression in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubule as well as microbiome composition in the two gut tissues in four Drosophila melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids from two divergent populations: one from the derived, European range and one from the ancestral, African range. In both the transcriptome and microbiome data, we detected extensive tissue- and genetic background-specific effects, including effects of genetic background on overall tissue specificity. Tissue-specific effects were typically stronger than genetic background-specific effects, although the two gut tissues were not more similar to each other than to the Malpighian tubules. An examination of allele specific expression revealed that, while both cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific in genes expressed differentially between populations than genes with conserved expression, trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis effects. Despite there being highly variable regulatory architecture, this observation was robust across tissues and genetic backgrounds, suggesting that the expression of trans variation can be spatially fine-tuned as well as or better than cis variation during population divergence and yielding new insights into cis and trans regulatory evolution.

    Using transcriptome data from parental and F1 hybrid D. melanogaster strains from an ancestral and a derived population in the midgut, hindgut and Malpighian tubule, we found that both the genetic basis of expression variation ( i. e. cis versus trans ) and the mode of expression inheritance ( i. e. dominant versus additive ) were highly tissue- and genetic background-specific ( Figs 3 and 4, Table 1 ). Previous studies using F1 hybrids in Drosophila have found that genetic background [19, 21, 28] and body part or tissue [21–22, 28] can have large effects on regulatory architecture; however, to our knowledge, this is the first study examining highly spatially and functionally proximate tissues that not only communicate with each other but also functionally and physically interact. Thus, our results demonstrate that even functionally related, interconnected tissues can show highly divergent regulatory architecture among tissues and genetic backgrounds. Indeed, overall gene expression was most similar between the Malpighian tubule and the midgut ( Fig 1 ), despite these tissues being part of the excretory and digestive system, respectively, while the two gut tissues are part of the same alimentary canal. Thus, our results suggest that the level of functional and physical interconnectivity between tissues may not necessarily be predictive of similarity in gene expression or regulatory architecture. Consistent with this interpretation, we detected similar fold-size differences in the proportion of cis-regulated genes in the hindgut versus the Malpighian tubule or midgut ( Fig 4A ) as has previously been reported in the testes versus the head or ovaries [28]

. Overall, our findings yield insight into the evolution of regulatory architecture, the effects of regulatory variation on tissue specificity, the effects of genetic background on expression and microbiome variation, as well as the importance of accounting for context-specificity in evolutionary studies.

. 001 ), which is unsurprising given that these gut regions differ in their pH and associated digestive functions [37]. We also detected a significant effect of the genetic background ( i. e. strain ) as well as a significant interaction effect between the examined strain and gut region on the bacterial community ( Fig 7, S11 Table; PERMANOVA, P ≤ 0. 015 for both ), suggesting that genetic background affects microbiome composition, and this effect is at least partially tissue-dependent. Indeed, when we examined community composition within each tissue individually, the genetic background significantly influenced the gut bacterial community in the hindgut while it had no significant effect on the structure of the community in the midgut ( Fig 7, S11 Table; PERMANOVA, P = 0. 002 and P = 0. 89 respectively ). We also detected significant tissue and genetic background effects on bacterial alpha-diversity ( S11 Fig, S12 and S13 Tables; LMM, P = 0. 017 and P < 0. 001 ), with the hindgut being more diverse and displaying stronger differentiation between parental and F1 strains ( S11 Fig ). Thus, the diverse bacterial community of the hindgut offered more possibility for differentiation while the midgut community was dominated by Acetobacter among all samples. In contrast, gene expression in the hindgut was less differentiated among genetic backgrounds but more differentiated from the other tissues while the midgut showed the opposite pattern ( Figs 1 and S1C ), suggesting that the expression and regulatory variation we detected in these tissues is unlikely to be driven by bacterial community composition. Thus overall, tissue type ( i. e. gut region ) had the largest impact on microbial community composition and diversity, with genetic background also affecting microbiome variation to a lesser degree, especially within the hindgut; however, these genetic background effects do not appear to be related to host gene expression variation.

. However, we should note that the tissues we examined in this study, and the midgut in particular, are known to be regionalized [37–38, 40] with an estimated 22, 4, and 5 distinct cell types currently described in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubules, respectively [49–50]; therefore, it is possible that we may have missed some of the more subtle differences in gene regulation that occur among individual regions or cell types. It has long been thought that regulatory changes and particularly cis-regulatory changes are important during adaptation as they can fine-tune gene expression both temporally and spatially [51–52]. Indeed, we found that genes with trans and cis effects were more tissue-specific than genes with no differential expression regulation ( Fig 5 ), suggesting that regulatory changes between diverged populations are often tissue-specific, which is likely driven by spatial fine-tuning of gene expression. Interestingly and somewhat surprisingly, we found that trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis-effects and this finding was consistent across tissues and genetic backgrounds ( Fig 5B ). Thus, our results reveal that trans-regulatory changes can be as or, potentially, even more tissue-specific than cis-regulatory changes that occur as populations diverge. In contrast to our findings, a recent study on ASE in two mouse tissues found that tissue-specific genes were largely cis-regulated during population divergence [25]. Indeed, cis-regulatory changes have long been thought to be more common during adaptation due to lower pleiotropy [53]. One of the disadvantages of our methods is that we were unable to assign regulatory effects to their underlying genetic variants and do not know the location or identity of the genetic variants underlying the detected tissue-specific trans effects

. However, deviations from this pattern of regulatory variation have been documented in Drosophila [20–23] as well as other species [24–25], which underscores that there remains much to learn about the evolution of gene expression regulation, especially over short evolutionary distances. An advantage of utilizing ASE to investigate the regulation of gene expression is that both the genetic basis of expression variation ( e. g. cis versus trans ) and the mode of expression inheritance ( e. g., dominance versus additivity ) can be assessed. Indeed, previous studies of ASE in Drosophila utilizing expression in F1 hybrids have found that environment [6, 26], sex [27–28], genetic background [19, 21, 28], and body part or tissue [21–22, 28] can affect regulatory architecture. However, previous studies have largely focused on single populations, long term lab strains, or comparatively closely related populations [5–6, 20–22, 26–28] ( for an exception see [19] ). Moreover, previous studies measured expression in whole animals, body parts ( e. g. heads ), single tissues, and/or highly functionally diverged tissues ( i. e. testes versus ovaries or heads ) ; thus, little is known about how regulatory architecture and inheritance vary among individual tissues that are spatially and/or functionally proximate. To investigate the effect of natural genetic variation from divergent populations on regulatory architecture in multiple functionally related, interconnected tissues, we analyzed messenger RNA-sequencing ( mRNA-seq ) data of midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubule tissues in four D. melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids. Two of the strains were from a population in Umeå, Sweden [29], representing the northern edge of the species’ derived distribution, while the other two strains were from a population in Siavonga, Zambia, representing the species’ inferred ancestral range [30]

    The study analyzed gene expression in the midgut, hindut and Maligh tub as well as microbiome in the gut of two tissues in D melanogaster and their F hybrids from two divergent populations: one from the European range and one from the African range. Both transcript and microbiome data detected tissue and genetic-specific effects including genetic on tissue specificity. Tissue effects were stronger than genetic effects although the gut were more similar to each other than the Maligh tub. Examination of allele expression revealed that cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific genes differentially expressed between populations than conserved genes trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis. The study found that trans-regulatory can be as or more tissue-specific cis-reg changes during population divergence yielding insights into cis and trans evolution. Gene expression was similar between the Maligh tub and midut despite being part the excret and digestive system respectively while the gut part alimentary canal. The study detected tissue and genetic effects on bacterial community and diversity the hindut was more diverse and showed stronger differentiation between parental and F strains while midut was dominated by Acobacter among samples. Expression in hindut was less differentiated genetic but more from other tissues while midut showed opposite pattern suggesting variation not driven by community. Tissue type had largest impact community composition and diversity genetic affecting microbiome to lesser degree within hindut genetic effects not related host variation.

    Title: 
    Abstract: While the first infection of an emerging disease is often unknown, information on early cases can be used to date it. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, previous studies have estimated dates of emergence ( e. g., first human SARS-CoV-2 infection, emergence of the Alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant ) using mainly genomic data. Another dating attempt used a stochastic population dynamics approach and the date of the first reported case. Here, we extend this approach to use a larger set of early reported cases to estimate the delay from first infection to the Nth case. We first validate our framework by running our model on simulated data. We then apply our model using data on Alpha variant infections in the UK, dating the first Alpha infection at ( median ) August 21, 2020 ( 95% interpercentile range across retained simulations ( IPR ) : July 23–September 5, 2020 ). Next, we apply our model to data on COVID-19 cases with symptom onset before mid-January 2020. We date the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan at ( median ) November 28, 2019 ( 95% IPR: November 2–December 9, 2019 ). Our results fall within ranges previously estimated by studies relying on genomic data. Our population dynamics-based modelling framework is generic and flexible, and thus can be applied to estimate the starting time of outbreaks in contexts other than COVID-19.

    Dating the first infection of an emerging infectious disease is a step towards tracing the disease’s origin and understanding early epidemic dynamics. Beyond the early transmission of a new pathogen, estimating the date of first infection is also of interest while studying the initiations of local clusters in naïve populations, such as when the pathogen is first introduced to a new location, but also when the pathogen evolves to distinct genotypes such as emerging variants of concern ( VOCs ). Various attempts have been made to date the first human infections by SARS-CoV-2 that led to the COVID-19 pandemic ( noting that earlier spillovers, leading to dead-ends, may have occurred ), using case data and/or viral genomic data. Using a stochastic model for the epidemic spread coupled with genomic data allowing to trace transmission at the individual level, Pekar et al. [1] estimated that the first human infection took place between late October and early December 2019. This estimate was slightly later than a previous one by the same authors, who had previously found an emergence date between mid-October and mid-November 2019 [2]. Their revision notably included updating the dates of the first case reported [3], and better cleaning up genomic data to exclude sequencing errors [1]. Another, earlier, modeling study used case data only and dated the first COVID-19 case between early October and mid-November 2019, by adapting a technique used in conservation science for dating extinction using observation events [4]. The analysis had nevertheless been conducted on outdated case data [5]; re-running the analysis on updated case data had major effects on both the estimated date of the first infection and 95% confidence interval ( see Fig A in S1 Text ). Other studies have focused on the introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to different countries

. Next, we apply our model to data on the early COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, estimating the date of the first SARS-CoV-2 infection around November 28 ( 95%IPR: Nov 2–Dec 9 ), 2019, and not earlier than September 26, 2019. These ranges also fall remarkably close to—slightly later than—previously published estimates [1]. To the best of our knowledge, the novelty of our findings rests on using exclusively a population-dynamics approach, unlike previous studies aiming to date the emergence of the COVID-19 epidemic. The median estimate in Pekar et al. [1] ( which is a first infection, and not a tMRCA ) falls ∼8 days before ours, which can be explained by the fact that our approach ignores genomic information. Namely, with our approach, having two cases with the exact same infecting virus, or two cases with viruses two mutations away, are treated the same way, as our approach only uses case numbers. Using genomic information would however yield an earlier date of emergence if the infecting viruses are genetically more distant. Our findings are thus also compatible with a previous study that found no evidence of widespread transmission in Wuhan before December 2019, using serological data [24]. Hence, in accordance to previous discussions [1, 2], our results suggest that widespread SARS-CoV-2 circulation ( and even more so, international spread ) earlier than the end of 2019 is unlikely. Assuming an origin of the pandemic in China [25], claims of large early ( i. e., before January 2020 ) circulation outside of China ( e. g. [26] and references therein ) would be therefore extraordinary, and require extraordinary evidence, excluding potential false positives by setting appropriate controls. Our study differs from [1, 2] in that we use population-level rather than genomic data, and does not intend to replace nor outperform other approaches

. This variation in the results is particularly true for the application on the Alpha variant data, probably due to the notably smaller case dataset we use. Our study has several limitations. First, our results depend heavily on input data, while access to good quality data on the early stages of an epidemic outbreak may be challenging. Datasets may be scarce, they may face reporting delays, early cases may be detected retrospectively and detection protocols may change. Early Wuhan COVID-19 cases with symptoms onset before December 30 ( the day of issue of the emergency notice from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission ) [22, 30] were diagnosed clinically before tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection were available [3]. Second, our model requires early estimates of the distributions for key epidemiological indicators such as the mean number of secondary infections, the secondary infection generation time, the probability of case detection and the incubation period, which depend themselves on the quality of early observed data and may not be available for new emerging infectious diseases. In particular, it can be challenging to estimate the probability of case detection ( or ascertainment rate ) during early stages of an emergent infectious diseases, and its value may vary between countries [31]. Third, our methods rely on the hypothesis that by the time an infection is detected, a sustained epidemic is ongoing, and all cases contained in the data set belong to the same transmission tree. That is, our model does not deal with earlier transmission trees that have gone extinct. We model epidemic spread starting from a single infectious individual, thus neglecting scenarios of multiple introductions. This impedes, for instance, the application of our model to contexts such as SARS-CoV-2 importation to France [6]

. This may also be a limitation in the context of epidemics emerging from multiple spillover events, such as has been concluded by [1] relying on data on the early SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Fourth, the simulations of our model do not allow to consider time-dependent parameters, but a more classic Approximate Bayesian Computation approach will. Hence, we are constrained to use data on relatively short periods of time to ensure that epidemiological parameters remain nearly constant over the study period. This may not reflect early epidemic dynamics, where public outbreak alerts may provoke, on the one hand, an increase in testing efforts and thus, rapid changes in the probability of detection and, on the other hand, changes in individual behaviors that may impact the probability of disease transmission and thus, the expected number of secondary infections. The numerous, fast and free availability of genomic data for the COVID-19 epidemic is unprecedented. Here, we built our model in a parsimonious, generic and flexible manner intended to be applied to contexts other than COVID-19, provided that key epidemiological parameters are known and transmission chains arise from a single infectious individual. Further developments of our model need to include genomic data on top of case data, as it is likely that sequencing will remain as intensive for other infectious diseases as it has been for COVID-19. In conclusion, our study contributes to the literature with estimates of the date of first infection of early COVID-19 cases and infections with the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant. Our results fall within ranges previously found by studies relying on genomic data, thus offering weight to these estimates using different methodologies.

. Fig G in S1 Text ). We parameterized our model using estimates from the literature; they are listed in Table 2. The 5 000 selected simulations represent ∼14% of all runs ( cf. Table A in S1 Text ) and are depicted in Fig H in S1 Text. Our simulations yield an estimated median number of days between the 1st SARS-CoV-2 infection to the Nth symptomatic COVID-19 case recorded of 52 ( 95%IPR: 41–78 ) days, dating the emergence ( i. e., the first sustained human infection ) of SARS-CoV-2 to November 28 ( 95%IPR: November 2–December 9 ), 2019, and not earlier than September 26, 2019. This also implies that the epidemic remained completely undetected ( i. e., no detected infections ) for about 9 days ( 95%IPR: 7–12 ) after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan.

    Title: 
    Abstract: During meiosis, pairing of homologous chromosomes ( homologs ) ensures the formation of haploid gametes from diploid precursor cells, a prerequisite for sexual reproduction. Pairing during meiotic prophase I facilitates crossover recombination and homolog segregation during the ensuing reductional cell division. Mechanisms that ensure stable homolog alignment in the presence of an excess of non-homologous chromosomes have remained elusive, but rapid chromosome movements appear to play a role in the process. Apart from homolog attraction, provided by early intermediates of homologous recombination, dissociation of non-homologous associations also appears to contribute to homolog pairing, as suggested by the detection of stable non-homologous chromosome associations in pairing-defective mutants. Here, we have developed an agent-based model for homolog pairing derived from the dynamics of a naturally occurring chromosome ensemble. The model simulates unidirectional chromosome movements, as well as collision dynamics determined by attractive and repulsive forces arising from close-range physical interactions. Chromosome number and size as well as movement velocity and repulsive forces are identified as key factors in the kinetics and efficiency of homologous pairing in addition to homolog attraction. Dissociation of interactions between non-homologous chromosomes may contribute to pairing by crowding homologs into a limited nuclear area thus creating preconditions for close-range homolog attraction. Incorporating natural chromosome lengths, the model accurately recapitulates efficiency and kinetics of homolog pairing observed for wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast, and can be adapted to nuclear dimensions and chromosome sets of other organisms.

    How homologs pair during meiosis in the presence of an excess of non-homologous chromosomes is presently unknown. To explore contributions to the pairing process of the entire nuclear chromosome ensemble, we have developed an agent-based mathematical model derived from first principles that takes into account both attractive forces between homologs and dissociative forces between non-homologous chromosomes ( see Methods section ). In many organisms, homologs enter meiosis separated by distances that far exceed the reach of resected DSBs that could assess homology. This necessitates a process that ensures initial homolog co-localization potentially provided by chromosome movements together with non-homologous repulsive forces. Results from our simulations suggest that repulsive forces together with chromosome movements are indeed a key determinant of bringing homologs into close vicinity. Both attractive and repulsive forces exert their effects over the same short distances that are within the range of the single stranded region of resected DSBs. Repulsive interactions between non-homologous chromosomes create excluded regions within the nucleus driving homologs into close vicinity, thereby facilitating close-range attractive pairing interactions. Our simulations further demonstrate that repulsive forces are most effective when chromosome numbers rise above a certain threshold, likely by reducing the available area per chromosome. Attractive forces come into play once distances between homologs are sufficiently small. A repulsive force that shortens the time spent in non-homologous interactions is a key feature of our pairing model. It represents molecular processes that dissociate non-homologous chromosomes from each other

Our homologous pairing model considers three contributing processes, i. e., chromosome interactions ( homologous and non-homologous collision dynamics ), chromosome translation ( directed movements ), and random chromosome motion ( thermal noise within the nucleus ) ( Fig 1 ). By deriving a model entirely from these first principles, we avoid the introduction of mathematical parameters not apparent from the underlying biological process. A key feature of our model is the inclusion of attractive and repulsive forces representing processes that stabilize homologous pairing or disrupt non-homologous interactions, respectively. Rather than focusing on a single homolog pair, our model captures trajectories of complete chromosome ensembles throughout prophase of meiosis I, facilitating comparison with experimental data and adjustments to species-specific features such as chromosome number and size as well as nuclear dimensions. To compute the net motion of meiotic chromosome sets, we consider pairwise interactions between chromosomes at short distances as provided by a semi-dilute solution [25, 26]. A two-dimensional model is developed to match the available two-dimensional experimental measurements from fixated, surface-spread yeast nuclei used to calibrate the model [13]. For the dynamics of the center of mass, x i ∈ R 2, a coupled system of N equations can be proposed as x ˙ i = v 0 d i + ∑ i ≠ j N F j ( x i - x j ) + 2 D W ˙, ( 1 ) where N gives the number of chromosomes and Fj is the force between two chromosomes, which is obtained as the negative gradient of the potential energy U F j ( x i - x j ) = - ∇ U ( x i - x j ). ( 2 ) The potential energy is defined using the Morse potential [28] U ( x i - x j ) = { C r 1 e - | x i - x j | ℓ r 1 - C a e - | x i - x j | ℓ a, j hom., C r 1 e - | x i - x j | ℓ r 1 + C r e - | x i - x j | ℓ r, j nhom. ( 3 ) Three components in Eq ( 1 ) are noteworthy

. Several mathematical models have examined potential contributions of molecular processes to homolog pairing, including telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope, chromosome bending stiffness, and polymer chains exhibiting an excluded volume repulsive potential [18, 20–23]. Moreover, a cellular automaton model was developed that examines random searching via chromosome shuffling [24]. Importantly, existing pairing models cannot be validated as they model interactions between individual chromosomes that are presently inaccessible to experimental analysis. Here, we have developed an agent-based model ( ABM ), in which movements and interactions between individual chromosomes ( i. e. agents ) are simulated, thereby recapitulating the interaction dynamics of an entire nuclear chromosome ensemble. Rather than making assumptions about pairing dynamics along individual chromosomes, we use differential equations based on first principles that govern the movements of chromosomes as an outcome of interactions with all other chromosomes within the same nucleus. Our model allows for the analysis of individual trajectories for all chromosomes throughout meiotic prophase I, facilitating comparison with experimental data. Modifications of various chromosomal parameters, including chromosome number, size, and movement velocity as well as attractive and repulsive forces provide insights into the contributions of each of these factors to homolog pairing.

. Movie animations of our model indicate that similar disruptions could arise due to collisions with non-homologous chromosomes during incipient pairing interactions of homolog pairs ( e. g., see [45] ). Importantly, results from our model suggest that during this exploratory phase, homolog pairs are susceptible to becoming dislodged due to collisions with non-homologous chromosomes. The agent-based modeling framework developed here is new to chromosome dynamics but has been useful in modeling other multicomponent systems that involve attractive and repulsive forces, ranging from molecular to macroscopic components [20, 21, 26, 65–75]. Earlier modeling approaches have focused on interactions between individual homologs which likely play an important role in completion of the pairing process, but they have not considered the effects of interactions between non-homologous chromosomes [18, 20–22]. Our model has identified unexpected threshold effects for several parameters where minor changes result in major nonlinear effects. Accordingly, for the current settings, homolog pairing levels and/or kinetics are disproportionately increased when chromosomes are initially separated by less than 4 μm ( Fig 4 ), when chromosome size exceeds 400 kbp ( Fig 5 ), and when chromosome velocity is increased from 210 nm/s to 240 nm/s ( Fig 6 ). Such discontinuities are likely related to a critical threshold of non-homologous chromosome encounters that needs to be crossed for homologous chromosomes to become confined to the same nuclear areas, thereby facilitating homolog encounters. Accordingly, the frequency of non-homologous interactions is reduced and crowding of homologous chromosomes into the same nuclear area occurs at low frequencies when chromosomes are present in lower numbers, exhibit smaller sizes or fail to achieve unidirectional movement due to disturbance by Brownian motion

. Rapid chromosome movements during prophase of meiosis I have been observed in species from yeast to mouse [15–17, 76]. Intriguingly, in different taxa, chromosome movements are mediated by different cytoskeleton components potentially resulting in a wide range of movement speeds [17]. Our model indicates that chromosome movements must occur above a certain velocity threshold, likely determined by the number of chromosomes and the dimensions of the nucleus, providing a potential reason why chromosomes move at distinct speeds in different organisms. Moreover, our model predicts that the three smallest yeast chromosomes would be slower in completing homolog pairing ( Fig 5 ). Notably, the same chromosomes exhibit increased DSB and crossover frequencies [53, 54], features that may specifically compensate for size-related disadvantages in pairing [81]. A key feature of the current agent-based model is that the entire ensemble of participating entities is included in the simulations, capturing both typical behavior and deviations thereof. In contrast, experimental analysis of homolog pairing is limited by the availability of distinct tags for individual chromosomes. Accordingly, observations from a small number of homolog pairs have been extrapolated to the entire chromosome complement. Moreover, in cases where the pairing status is monitored in fixated cells [13, 14, 82], the number of homolog is limited by the number of chromosomes that can be observed. Our agent-based model, however, captures the dynamics of all chromosomes in the nucleus, providing a more comprehensive view of the process of homolog pairing.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by inherited TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations. MicroRNA miR-34a is a p53 target and modifier gene. Interestingly, miR-34 triple-null mice exhibit normal p53 responses and no overt cancer development, but the lack of miR-34 promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds. miR-34 genes are highly conserved and syntenic between zebrafish and humans. Zebrafish miR-34a and miR-34b/c have similar expression timing in development, but miR-34a is more abundant. DNA damage by camptothecin led to p53-dependent induction of miR-34 genes, while miR-34a mutants were adult-viable and had normal DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Nevertheless, miR-34a-/- compound mutants with a gain-of-function tp53R217H/ R217H or tp53-/- mutants were more cancer-prone than tp53 mutants alone, confirming the tumor-suppressive function of miR-34a. Through transcriptomic comparisons at 28 hours post-fertilization ( hpf ), we characterized DNA damage-induced transcription, and at 8, 28 and 72 hpf we determined potential miR-34a-regulated genes. At 72 hpf, loss of miR-34a enhanced erythrocyte levels and up-regulated myb-positive hematopoietic stem cells. Overexpression of miR-34a suppressed its reporter mRNA, but not p53 target induction, and sensitized injected embryos to camptothecin but not to γ-irradiation.

   . In this study, we characterized zebrafish miR-34a and its functional interactions with tp53, as well as its independent effects by performing transcriptomic, mutant and overexpression studies. We generated and employed miR-34a mutant zebrafish to determine the effects of its loss on gene expression under normal conditions at three stages of development, which revealed a spectrum of transcriptomic effects. We demonstrated that expression of miR-34 genes is partially dependent on p53 under control conditions, and their induction by DNA damage is fully p53-dependent. Moreover, we found that miR-34a has small but significant transcriptomic effects in 28 hour post-fertilization ( hpf ) zebrafish embryos under both control and DNA damage conditions. The most direct evidence of miR-34a tumor-suppressive functions was provided by the earlier tumor onset in compound miR-34a and tp53 mutants compared to the corresponding single tp53 mutants. Transient overexpression of miR-34a induced a greater sensitivity in zebrafish embryos to camptothecin ( CPT ) treatment but not to γ-irradiation. CPT is a DNA damage-inducing topoisomerase I inhibitor [29], which activates p53 in zebrafish [30]. However, artificial miR-34a overexpression does not affect the activity of p53 and likely functions independently.

We determined that in zebrafish, both miR-34a and miR-34b/c genes are primarily dependent on p53 for induction under DNA damage conditions and partially dependent on p53 for their baseline expression. Some residual induction of miR-34 genes could be due to other transcription factors activated by DNA damage. We also predicted highly significant p53 motifs closely located to both miR-34 genes and in similar configurations, but the formal confirmation of these p53 binding sites will require future studies. These results are fully consistent with multiple studies in mouse and human cell lines that first implicated miR-34 genes in the p53 regulatory network [9–12]. A subsequent in vivo study demonstrated that in adult p53-null mice, miR-34a levels were reduced in some tissues but in major expression sites remained the same or higher [23]. Adult tissue analysis of miR-34 molecules in p53-null zebrafish may provide additional information on the dependence of miR-34 genes on p53. Overexpression of miR-34a has been one of the earliest tools to understand its function. Under genotoxic conditions, we indeed observed induction by p53 of miR-34a up to about 15-fold and up to 5-fold for miR-34b/c. To overexpress miR-34a, we used a commercial miR-34a mimic and a fluorescent reporter system to verify a reference target gene knock-down and measured mature miR-34a levels. Although the extent of miR-34a overexpression was well above the physiological range ( 100 to 200-fold on average ), this experiment showed that miR-34a does not significantly influence p53 target genes in zebrafish. Consistent with this finding, it was previously reported that overexpression of all miR-34 RNAs in multiple cell lines either did not affect or upregulate p53 activity [22]

. The “response” terms in Fig 4B only include down-regulated genes and at least 4 of them function in innate immunity ( irf1b, irg1l, mmp9, hamp1 ), which implies an effect of miR-34a loss on immune function. Other notable expression changes include down-regulation of DNA repair genes ( rad51, fancg ) and a decrease in hypoxia-related genes ( hif1an, egln3 ). Lacking known p53 targets among DEGs in the wild-type vs. miR-34a-/- post-CPT comparison, we visualized expression of zebrafish homologs of known p53 target genes ( S4 File ) and found that wild-type and miR-34a-/- samples have very similar levels of induction of these genes ( S3 Fig ), which was confirmed statistically. Despite miR-34a loss not affecting p53 target genes, we evaluated how miR-34a affects tumor development in p53 mutant zebrafish given that epigenetic silencing of the MIR34A gene in humans carrying TP53 mutant alleles contributes to cancer progression [15]. We used tp53-/- and tp53R217H/R217H as control mutant lines and generated the homozygous maternal-zygotic miR-34a-/-; tp53-/- and miR-34a-/-; tp53R217H/R217H compound mutant lines. We monitored visible tumor formation in control tp53 mutants and in compound mutant lines on a weekly basis from 4 to 16 months and collected tumor-bearing fish for histology. The resulting tumor-onset curves ( probability of tumor-free survival ) show that miR-34a-/-; tp53-/- compound mutants exhibited a small but significant increase in the rate of tumor development compared to tp53-/- alone ( Fig 5A ). Interestingly, in the case of miR-34a-/-; tp53R217H/R217H compound mutants, miR-34a loss converted the mildly cancer-prone tp53R217H/R217H mutant to become as cancer-susceptible as either tp53-/- or miR-34a-/-; tp53-/- ( Fig 5B ). For each pair of genotypes, we also categorized the tumors by their anatomical location such as abdomen, head or eye ( Fig 5C and 5D )

. When the same CPT treatment was performed on 48 hpf embryos for 1 or 3 hours, miR-34a, miR-34c and p21 were induced following 1-hour exposure and all target genes analyzed were induced after the 3-hour treatment ( Fig 2B ). We also aimed to determine the tissue specificity of miR-34a gene induction after 4-hour 1μM CPT treatment compared to controls by WMISH at 28 hpf and observed global induction of its expression ( Fig 2C ). To support the idea that miR-34 genes are p53 targets, we performed 1μM CPT treatment in both wild-type and tp53-/- mutants [33] for 4 hours. p53 loss indeed partially reduced the baseline levels of p21, miR-34a, miR-34b and miR-34c ( Fig 2D ). The induction of p21 and miR-34 genes by CPT treatment was significantly reduced in the tp53-/- fish, strongly indicating that miR-34 genes are p53 targets in the zebrafish. We also identified highly significant adjacent matches of the p53 transcription factor motif on both sides of miR-34a and miR-34b/c genes when looking at the 20-kb regions around these genes ( Fig 2E and S2 Table ). These putative p53 binding sites are analogous to what was reported for human miR-34 genes [9, 11, 12], but the p53 motifs are much closer to the exons encoding miR-34s in zebrafish than in humans since human miR-34 genes contain large introns. To generate a miR-34a mutant p53 genetic modifier model, we employed 6 sgRNAs ( not all of which were known to work a priori ) in our CRISPR/Cas9 deletion strategy to excise the miR-34a transcript ( 98-bp ) and miR-34b ( 98p ) ( Fig 3A ). The miR-34-/- mutant zebish were viable and fertile and exhibited normal DNA damage-induced apoptosis ( Fig 3B ), indicating that miR-34 is not essential for p53 function under normal conditions. However, miR-34-; tp53 compound mutants were more cancer-prone than tp53 alone ( Fig 3C ) and miR-34-; tpR217/RH mutants were more cancer-prone than tpR217/RH ( Fig 3D ), confirming the tumor-suppressive function of mi-34. The miR-34-; tp- and miR-34; tpR217/RH mutants also exhibited a higher rate of tumor development than tp- and tpR/RH ( Fig 3E ), indicating that mi-34 is a tumor-suppressor in zebish. The miR-34-; tp and miR-34; tp217/RH mutants also exhibited a higher rate of tumor development than tp and tp/R ( Fig 3 ) indicating that mi-34 is a tumor-suppressor in zeb. The miR-34; tp and miR-34 tp217/RH mutants exhibited a higher rate of tumor development than tp and tp/R ( 3 ) indicating that mi-34 is a tumor-suppressor in zeb. The mi-34 tp and mi- tp217R/R mutants exhibited a higher rate of tumor development tp and tp/R ( 3 ) that mi-34 is a tumor-sup in zeb.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Sex determination in the nematode C. elegans is controlled by the master regulator XOL-1 during embryogenesis. Expression of xol-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes and autosomes, which differs between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. In males, xol-1 is highly expressed and in hermaphrodites, xol-1 is expressed at very low levels. XOL-1 activity is known to be critical for the proper development of C. elegans males, but its low expression was considered to be of minimal importance in the development of hermaphrodite embryos. Our study reveals that XOL-1 plays an important role as a regulator of developmental timing during hermaphrodite embryogenesis. Using a combination of imaging and bioinformatics techniques, we found that hermaphrodite embryos have an accelerated rate of cell division, as well as a more developmentally advanced transcriptional program when xol-1 is lost. Further analyses reveal that XOL-1 is responsible for regulating the timing of initiation of dosage compensation on the X chromosomes, and the appropriate expression of sex-biased transcriptional programs in hermaphrodites. We found that xol-1 mutant embryos overexpress the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 and have an altered H3K9me landscape. Some of these effects of the loss of xol-1 gene were reversed by the loss of met-2. These findings demonstrate that XOL-1 plays an important role as a developmental regulator in embryos of both sexes, and that MET-2 acts as a downstream effector of XOL-1 activity in hermaphrodites.

   . elegans embryos [9, 10], we looked at the known pathways in males that are regulated by XOL-1 to better understand its potential roles in hermaphrodite embryonic development. In males, XOL-1 represses the activity of the SDC proteins [9, 10]. The SDC proteins independently regulate the pathways of sex determination and dosage compensation in hermaphrodites [17, 45, 46]. In male embryos where xol-1 is highly expressed, male sex determination pathways are turned on and hermaphrodite sex determination and dosage compensation of the X chromosome are turned off [9, 10] ( Fig 3A ). Based on this known mechanism of action, we hypothesized that in xol-1 hermaphrodite embryos, XOL-1 may be repressing dosage compensation pathways during the early stages of embryogenesis, thereby regulating the appropriate timing of the onset of dosage compensation in hermaphrodites. To test this hypothesis, we performed immunofluorescence ( IF ) experiments in stage-matched xol-1 mutant and WT embryos with antibodies against components of the dosage compensation complex ( DCC ) to determine when these components begin loading onto the X chromosomes during embryogenesis ( Fig 3 ). The DCC consists of a 5 subunit condensin IDC complex and 5 additional proteins [17, 22, 23, 45–50]. In Fig 3B–3E, we stained stage-matched 50–100 cell xol-1 and WT embryos with antibodies against DPY-27, a core component of condensin IDC. We also used a co-stain against the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) as an internal control to confirm proper staining of embryos. We scored the embryos and binned them into 4 categories based on the percentage of cells inside an embryo that had visible localization of DPY-27 onto the X chromosomes. In WT embryos, DPY-27 begins loading onto the X chromosomes starting at the onset of gastrulation, when the embryo has about 26 cells [32, 33, 49]

. Organisms across the animal kingdom have significant divergence in their molecular mechanisms for achieving dosage compensation. In mammals, there is near complete inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes of the female to match the transcriptional output from the single X chromosome in males [6]. Other organisms such as Drosophila and birds have their own unique mechanisms to establish dosage compensation which involve hyperactivation of one of the sex chromosomes, though in the case of birds the hyperactivation is incomplete [7, 8]. In the case of C. elegans, the transcriptional output of both the hermaphrodite X chromosomes is repressed by half to match that of the single male X chromosome through the activity of the dosage compensation complex ( DCC ) [5]. XOL-1 is the master switch that regulates both sex determination and dosage compensation in the C. elegans [9, 10]. XOL-1 acts as a sensor that can be toggled on or off depending on the ratio of signal elements from the X chromosome and the autosomes [9]. These elements on the X chromosome such as sex-1, sex-2, ceh-39 and fox-1 are known as X signal elements ( XSEs ) and those on the autosomes such as sea-1 and sea-2 are known as autosome signal elements ( ASEs ) [1, 11–16]. The ratio of these elements differs between the two C. elegans sexes. Hermaphrodites have two X chromosomes resulting in an X: A ratio of 1, whereas the males only have one X chromosome resulting in an X:A ratio of 0. 5. XSEs and ASEs compete to repress and activate expression of the xol-1 gene in early embryos, respectively [15]. Due to the lower X:A ratio in males, transcription of XOL-1 is activated. XOL-1 then represses SDC-1, SDC-2 and SDC-3, which leads to the activation of the male sex determination pathway and the repression of hermaphrodite development and dosage compensation [1, 9, 10]. In hermaphrodites, due to the higher X:A ratio, the reverse occurs where XOL-1 is repressed

. This strengthens the hypothesis that xol-1, in addition to its role in turning off dosage compensation in male embryos, is also required in hermaphrodite embryos for regulating the timing of the initiation of dosage compensation. Similar to the effect of xol-1 on the dosage compensation pathway during embryogenesis, we hypothesized that the loss of xol-1 would also affect sex determination pathways in the developing embryos. Since XOL-1 is responsible for repressing the hermaphrodite sex determination pathway in XO animals, we hypothesized that the xol-1 mutant embryos would have upregulation of genes that are involved in hermaphrodite sex determination in XX early embryos as well. Conversely, since XOL-1 is responsible for activating the male sex determination pathways, we hypothesized that the loss of xol-1 would result in the downregulation of genes involved in embryonic male sex determination. To explore the differences in transcription between early male and hermaphrodite embryos, we generated male-enriched early embryo datasets using him-8 mutants. The him-8 gene is essential for the proper segregation of X chromosomes during meiosis [52, 53]. In WT C. elegans, males occur at a very low frequency ( ~0. 2% ) [54]. Loss of him-8 results in the overproduction of males due to the mis-segregation of the X chromosome, with an average of ~40% of the progeny being male worms [52]. This allowed us to generate samples with mixed-sex male and hermaphrodite embryos. The frequency of males in the population we collected for sequencing was ~45%. We performed successive rounds of synchronization using bleaching to obtain WT and him-8 early embryo populations. We then sequenced mRNA from these samples, and used the differentially expressed genes to define gene sets that are enriched in the mixed-sex him-8 embryos or the WT hermaphrodite embryos ( Fig 4A )

. By both these measures, xol-1 hermaphrodites were not significantly different from WT ( Fig 1D ), consistent with previous studies [10, 40]. This is in contrast to male xol-1 embryos, that have complete embryonic lethality [10]. The xol-1 adult hermaphrodites also look, at least superficially, similar to healthy WT adults. Since xol-1 is important for turning on the male sex determination pathways, we hypothesized that it may be required in hermaphrodite embryonic development to potentiate the molecular pathways that lead to the development of the sperm producing structures in adult worms. To test this, we measured brood counts from xol-1 mutant embryos and WT. In C. elegans, contractions in the oviducts force oocytes to pass through the spermatheca, where they get fertilized [43]. They emerge from the spermatheca as newly fertilized eggs that form a hard and impenetrable eggshell. After the spermatheca is emptied of sperm, oocytes continue to pass through without being fertilized and these oocytes do not form an eggshell. To quantify this process, we counted the number of fertilized and unfertilized eggs laid by worms from each genotype. The number of fertilized eggs were not significantly different between xol-1 and WT ( Fig 5A ). However, the number of unfertilized eggs were significantly higher in xol- mutant compared to WT ( Fig 5B ). This suggests that x-1 heraphrod embryos may have a defect in the development of the sperheca or the oocyte maturation process. To investigate this further, we looked at the expression of genes involved in the sperhe development and oocyte maturation in x- mutant and WT embryos ( Fig 5C ). We found that x-1 hermrod embryos have upregulation of the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 ( met-2 ) and downregulation of genes involved in sperhe development and oocyte maturation. Since the effects of x- on sperhe and oocyte development were reversed by the loss of met-2, we conclude that MET-2 acts as a downstream effector of X- activity in heraphrod embryos.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Genetic surveillance of mosquito populations is becoming increasingly relevant as genetics-based mosquito control strategies advance from laboratory to field testing. Especially applicable are mosquito gene drive projects, the potential scale of which leads monitoring to be a significant cost driver. For these projects, monitoring will be required to detect unintended spread of gene drive mosquitoes beyond field sites, and the emergence of alternative alleles, such as drive-resistant alleles or non-functional effector genes, within intervention sites. This entails the need to distribute mosquito traps efficiently such that an allele of interest is detected as quickly as possible—ideally when remediation is still viable. Additionally, insecticide-based tools such as bednets are compromised by insecticide-resistance alleles for which there is also a need to detect as quickly as possible. To this end, we present MGSurvE ( Mosquito Gene SurveillancE ) : a computational framework that optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations such that the time to detection of an allele of interest is minimized. A key strength of MGSurvE is that it allows important biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit to be accounted for, namely: i ) resources required by mosquitoes ( e. g., food sources and aquatic breeding sites ) can be explicitly distributed through a landscape, ii ) movement of mosquitoes may depend on their sex, the current state of their gonotrophic cycle ( if female ) and resource attractiveness, and iii ) traps may differ in their attractiveness profile. Example MGSurvE analyses are presented to demonstrate optimal trap placement for: i ) an Aedes aegypti population in a suburban landscape in Queensland, Australia, and ii ) an Anopheles gambiae population on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. Further documentation and use examples are provided in project’s documentation. MGSurvE is intended as a resource for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance.

   . This is also a concern for population replacement strategies, as when the drive has spread and there are fewer cleavable wild-type alleles remaining, less costly resistant alleles may replace the drive alleles, reducing their duration of impact [12]. Another concern for population replacement strategies is the emergence and spread of drive alleles lacking a functional effector gene [13]. For spread beyond field sites, open questions relate to the optimal density and placement of traps and the frequency of sampling required to detect gene drive alleles, drive-resistant alleles or non-functional effector genes while they can still be effectively managed. Similar questions relate to the spread of new alleles conferring resistance to other interventions, such as bednets or indoor residual spraying with insecticides. Lessons may be learned from studies of invasive species, a key result for which is that early detection is critical to minimizing invasion impact, preserving the possibility of local elimination, and maximizing the cost-effectiveness of surveillance programs [14, 15]. To this end, we present MGSurvE: an analytical framework that optimizes trap placement for surveillance of mosquito populations such that the time to detection of an allele of interest is minimized. MGSurvE takes into account biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit—namely, resources required by mosquitoes ( e. g., blood and sugar-based food sources and aquatic breeding sites ) and movement of mosquitoes between these resources on a landscape. It also accommodates traps with differing attractiveness profiles. MGSurvE may be used in parallel with MGDrivE [16] or MGDrivE 2 [17] to determine the expected distribution of times to detection or the number of individuals having the allele of interest at this time point in closed populations

. We describe how to set up, run and interpret output from MGSurvE, and provide examples of trap placement optimization for an Aedes aegypti population in Queensland, Australia, and an Anopheles gambiae population on the tropical island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. We then conclude with a discussion of future modeling needs and applications for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations.

Here, we demonstrate the application of MGSurvE to distribute traps in order to minimize time to detection of an allele of interest for Ae. aegypti populations in the suburb of Yorkeys Knob 17 km northwest of Cairns, Queensland, Australia. Yorkeys Knob was a trial site for a successful release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in 2011 [26] ( Fig 3B ). Ae. aegypti is a relatively local disperser, and so households serve as an appropriate population node for the landscape. Resource types do not need to be specified, as in this demonstration, we are assuming households provide all the feeding and breeding resources required by Ae. aegypti. This assumption, however, can be relaxed if we were interested in studying the effects of resource heterogeneity in the way we should approach our surveillance task ( for tutorials on how to incorporate these factors, see the online documentation at https://chipdelmal. github. io/MGSurvE/build/html/demos. html, and the model description in S1 Text ). Household coordinates in Yorkeys Knob were sourced from OpenStreetMap ( https://www. openstreetmap. org/ ), and daily movement probabilities between households were derived from a zero-inflated exponential kernel with a daily staying probability of 72% [19, 27], and a mean dispersal distance conditional upon movement of 54 m [20]. In optimizing trap placement, we consider two types of traps with distinct attractiveness profiles represented by: i ) an exponential kernel with a mean radius of attractiveness of 16 m [28], and ii ) a sigmoidal kernel with an inflection radius of 16 m and shape parameter of 0. 25 ( Fig 3A ). Both traps have maximum attractiveness of 0. 5, meaning that, for a trap placed within a population node, the ratio of mosquitoes that enter the trap to those that do not per time-step is 0. 5:1 ( i. e., in this case, half of mosquitoes in the same node as the trap enter the trap per day )

. 46 and 60. 97 days, respectively ), despite their drastically different computational optimization evolutionary processes ( Fig 3C shows the continuous case slowly moving towards the optimum, whereas the discrete case moves most in the early phases of the process ). The maximum discrete optimization fitness metric seeks to minimize the time it would take for a mosquito to fall into any trap, beginning from the trap for which this time is longest. As such, this approach tends to prioritize placing traps as far from each other as possible whilst covering the most remote locations ( e. g., the eastern-most households in our landscape ). In this case, the algorithm converged to a minimum trap time of 82 days, beginning from the trap for which this time is longest. This is an important metric in situations where confinement of a certain allele/trait is paramount. In the second example, we use MGSurvE to distribute traps in order to minimize time to detection of an allele of interest for An. coluzzii populations on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. São Tomé, an island 225 km west of the coast of Gabon, has been identified as a suitable candidate for field trials of gene drive mosquitoes due to the presence of a single dominant malaria vector species ( An. coluzzii ), relative isolation from mainland Africa, and a history of ecological studies of mosquitoes on the island [29] ( Fig 4B ). An. coluzzii can disperse relatively large distances [20], and so villages and suburbs of comparable size serve as appropriate population nodes. Due to the scale of these localities, and the fact that they were aggregated in a meta-population scheme, resource types do not need to be specified here as each village contains all the resources needed for mosquitoes to flourish. Locality coordinates in São Tomé were sourced by aligning locations in the São Tomé and Príncipe census ( https://projectsportal. afdb

Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and yellow fever continue to pose a major public health burden throughout much of the world. Gene drive-modified mosquitoes have been proposed as a potentially transformative tool to complement currently-available tools by biasing inheritance in favor of an introduced allele [1]. Progress has been made in Anopheles malaria vectors towards two general classes of gene drive strategies: i ) “population replacement”, whereby inheritance is biased in favor of an allele that confers refractoriness to pathogen transmission [2, 3]; and ii ) “population suppression”, whereby vector populations are suppressed by biasing inheritance in favor of an allele that induces a severe fitness cost or sex bias [4, 5]. In Aedes arboviral vectors, a “split drive” system has been engineered with Cas and guide RNA ( gRNA ) drive components at separate loci [6]. Split drive systems display transient drive behavior because the Cas and gRNA components frequently co-occur following a release, but soon dissociate and are eliminated by virtue of fitness costs. The potential spread and scale of impact of this technology is promising; however, surveillance programs present a major cost driver as they must scale with the intervention [7, 8]. Surveillance for gene drive projects will be required to monitor the effectiveness of the strategy at field sites, as has been done for previous self-limiting genetic control projects [9]; however, a more demanding task will be to detect unintended spread of gene mosquitoes beyond field sites and emergence of alternative alleles, such as drive-resistant or non-effector genes within sites. This entails the need to distribute traps efficiently such that an allele of interest is detected as quickly as possible—ideally when remediation is still viable. Insecticide-based tools such as bednets are compromised by insect-resistance alleles for which is also a need to detect as quickly as possible. To this end, we present MGS (Mosquito Gene Surveillance ) a computational framework that optimizes trap placement for genetic of mosquito populations that the time to detection of an allele is minimized. A strength ofGS is that it allows biological features of mosquitoes and landscapes they inhabit to be accounted for : i ) resources required by mosquitoes ( e. g. food and breeding sites can be distributed a landscape ii ) movement may depend on their sex, state of gonotrophic cycle ( female ) and resource iii ) traps differ in attractiveness.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Symbiomonas scintillans Guillou et Chrétiennot-Dinet, 1999 is a tiny ( 1. 4 μm ) heterotrophic microbial eukaryote. The genus was named based on the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum, however, like most such endosymbionts neither the identity nor functional association with its host were known. We generated both amplification-free shotgun metagenomics and whole genome amplification sequencing data from S. scintillans strains RCC257 and RCC24, but were unable to detect any sequences from known lineages of endosymbiotic bacteria. The absence of endobacteria was further verified with FISH analyses. Instead, numerous contigs in assemblies from both RCC24 and RCC257 were closely related to prasinoviruses infecting the green algae Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Bathycoccus prasinos, and Micromonas pusilla ( OlV, BpV, and MpV, respectively ). Using the BpV genome as a reference, we assembled a near-complete 190 kbp draft genome encoding all hallmark prasinovirus genes, as well as two additional incomplete assemblies of closely related but distinct viruses from RCC257, and three similar draft viral genomes from RCC24, which we collectively call SsVs. A multi-gene tree showed the three SsV genome types branched within highly supported clades with each of BpV2, OlVs, and MpVs, respectively. Interestingly, transmission electron microscopy also revealed a 190 nm virus-like particle similar the morphology and size of the endosymbiont originally reported in S. scintillans. Overall, we conclude that S. scintillans currently does not harbour an endosymbiotic bacterium, but is associated with giant viruses.

   . To identify the endobacterium and its role in such a small protist, we conducted Fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) targeting various groups of bacteria and generated amplification-free shotgun metagenomics and whole genome amplification sequencing data of two strains of S. scintillans. This showed the absence of endobacteria of known endosymbiotic lineages. Instead, we observed a viral-like particle by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and recovered three draft viral genomes related to prasinoviruses, namely nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses ( NCLDVs ) belonging to a member of the Phycodnaviridae family [19, 20]. During the course of this work, one strain apparently lost the virus, while the other strain perished, so we were unable to conduct further experiments to verify the nature of the viral association. This work underscores how much is still unknown about endosymbioses, particularly in small heterotrophic protists. We expect that viral association is especially relevant to nano- or pico-eukaryotes, as there may simply not be enough space for endobacteria, and predict more such findings in the future.

. To account for unequal genomic amplification of WGA causing loss of AT-rich and local repeat regions, and secondary structures [61], we also searched bacterial reads in amplification-free shotgun metagenomic data. Many bacterial lineages with high-coverage in WGA were also found in the shotgun metagenomic data ( e. g., Marinobacter spp., Hyphomonas spp., Balneola spp. ) in addition to Marinovum algicola and a member of Phycisphaeraceae, but no known endosymbiotic lineages nor any draft bacterial genomes with “symbiotic features” such as small genome size, AT-rich content, or rapid sequence evolution could be identified in any of these data. The absence of endosymbiotic bacteria in all the sequencing data was further supported by the absence of a bacterial signal using fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) of all sub-cultures of S. scintillans grown in Canada ( RCC257 ) and Japan ( RCC257-jp ) ( Fig 1 ). We observed the same trend in RCC24-jp ( S2 Fig ) using additional probes targeting Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. In all our assembled WGA data, no sequences were assigned to Archaea while the amplification-free shotgun metagenome data had some Archaea contigs with low coverage ( x1-7 ). Instead of endobacteria, we detected contigs assigned to prasinovirus with up to x200 coverage in RCC257 ( S1 Fig and S2 Dataset ). When viral-subset-scaffolds were re-assembled and further scaffolded using a reference-guide approach, we recovered three viral metagenomically assembled genomes ( vMAGs ) related to the prasinovirus genera, Bathycoccus prasinos virus 2 ( BpV2 ), Ostreococcus lucimarinus virus 1 ( OlV1 ), and Micromonas pusilla virus Pl1 ( MpV_Pl1 ). The completeness of vMAGs were the highest for the BpV2-guided assembly ( BpV2-vMAG ), with 100% completeness

To identify the symbionts of Symbiomonas scintillans, we sequenced two geographically distinct strains ( RCC24 isolated from Pacific Ocean and RCC257 from the Atlantic Ocean ) maintained under culture conditions. In most of our sequencing data, a large representation of the host sequence was found as expected. The exception to this is the WGA data from RCC24, where no host sequences could be identified ( see below ). Given the original description of this taxon suggested these symbionts were bacterial, we first searched for bacterial reads assigned to well-known endosymbiotic lineages such as Rickettsiales, Holosporales, or Chlamydiae in all the analyzed genomic and transcriptomic data. No such putative symbiont reads were found, and instead the bacterial reads were largely assigned to common environmental, or culture-associated Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Balneolia such as Marinobacter spp., Epibacterium spp., Hyphomonas spp., Zhongshania spp., Balneola spp., and Labrenzia spp. ( S1A–S1C Fig ). When sequences that had no taxonomic affiliation in WGA data were removed, a scaffold assigned to Marinobacter salinus had the third highest coverage up to x95, 000 ( N50 = 116K ), after the ones assigned to Oomycota ( N50 = 276 ) and Cafeteria roenbergensis ( up to x102, 851 coverage, N60 = 63K ), a species closely related to S. scintillans ( S2 Dataset ) [21]. Notably, Marinobacter spp., Labrenzia spp., and Hyphomonas spp. were all reported to be common in cultures of Ostreoccocus tauri, Symbiodiniaceae, Alexandrium spp., and discobids [54–60]. Accounting for this overwhelming representation of culture-associated bacteria, a subset of whole-genome amplification ( WGA ) data was selected and reassembled based on lower GC content, which is usually associated with endosymbionts. However, no sequences assigned to endosymbiotic bacterial lineages were detected

. We observed similar patterns with scaffolds taxonomically identified as belonging to Rhodophyta ( S2 Dataset ). The possibility that prasinoviruses contaminated the culture media is also highly unlikely, given both the sterilizing protocol ( autoclaving, filtering, and UV sterilization ) and single-cell isolation. These methods could hardly result in near-complete BpV-vMAGs from contaminant viruses, which require a minimum of 105 VLP to reach the observed read depth [80]. Due to the loss of viral signals in RCC257-late and the complete loss of the RCC24 strain, we could not conduct an infection assay or purify lysates. However, given the sequence coverage of prasinoviral reads, completeness of BpV-vMAGs, lack of evidence of green algae in the cultures, and sample processing method, we argue that the SsV vMAGs are indeed directly associated with S. scintillans. This is further supported by the two similar but distinct strains of S. scintillans contained two similar but distinct sets of three giant virus genomes. A virus-like particle ( VLP ) from RCC24 was visualized with negative stain TEM ( Fig 2A and 2B ). The VLP exhibited an icosahedral shape with a diameter of 192 nm, which is unusually large compared to previously characterized prasinoviruses [77]. However, it fell within the size range ( 180–240 nm ) of the inclusion described as endobacteria in S. scintillans [17]. Indeed, the morphology of the “endobacteria” in the original description ( see Fig 1D in [17] ) closely matches that of the VLP in Fig 2A and 2B. We did not observe VLPs in the actively growing RCC257 strain, as expected as the NCLDV reads were no longer detected in RCC257-late. The S.intans RCC24 and RCC257 were grown in the same conditions, but the VLPs were only observed in RCC24. This suggests that the VLPs are associated with S.intans and not a contaminant of the culture medium.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The leiomodin ( Lmod ) family of actin-binding proteins play a critical role in muscle function, highlighted by the fact that mutations in all three family members ( LMOD1-3 ) result in human myopathies. Mutations in the cardiac predominant isoform, LMOD2 lead to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most of the disease-causing mutations in the LMOD gene family are nonsense, or frameshift, mutations predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in nearly all cases of disease, little to no LMOD protein is expressed. We show here that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, a cellular mechanism which eliminates mRNAs with premature termination codons, underlies loss of mutant protein from two independent LMOD2 disease-causing mutations. Furthermore, we generated steric-blocking oligonucleotides that obstruct deposition of the exon junction complex, preventing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of mutant LMOD2 transcripts, thereby restoring mutant protein expression. Our investigation lays the initial groundwork for potential therapeutic intervention in LMOD-linked myopathies.

   . W398* ), LMOD2 protein was not detected in the explanted heart via western blot analysis and RT-qPCR analysis revealed a decrease in mature LMOD2 mRNA levels, but no change in pre-mRNA levels [7]. Thus, we hypothesized that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) underlies loss of mutant protein expression. Two additional LMOD2 disease-causing mutations ( p. R513* and p. L415Vfs*108 ) are predicted to produce truncated proteins, however information is lacking regarding whether, and to what extent, protein is expressed [9, 10]. NMD is a surveillance system whereby the cell detects and degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons ( PTCs ), however NMD also regulates the levels of certain non-mutated, functional transcripts [12, 13]. Although not completely understood, there are multiple proposed pathways by which transcripts are identified and fated for degradation [14]. One mechanism involves deposition of the multi-protein exon junction complex ( EJC ) upstream of exon-exon boundaries during RNA splicing [15]. The EJC remains bound to the transcript and is normally removed by the ribosome during translation. However, if a ribosome pauses at a PTC, 1 ) the SURF ( SMG1/8/9-UPF1-eRF1-eRF3 ) complex of proteins can associate with the ribosome and 2 ) downstream EJCs remain intact. The downstream EJCs then recruit proteins ( e. g., UFP3B and/or UPF2 ) that promote activation of the SURF complex, transforming it into the decay-inducing ( DECID ) complex, leading to degradation of the transcript [16]. In this study we discovered that multiple human LMOD2 mutations associated with dilated cardiomyopathy lead to a lack of LMOD2 protein expression through NMD. We also developed steric-blocking oligonucleotides to specifically inhibit NMD of LMOD2 transcripts, increasing the levels of mutant-truncated protein.

The leiomodin ( LMOD ) family of actin-binding proteins are critical for proper function of all types of muscle in humans. A biallelic mutation in LMOD1, the smooth muscle-specific LMOD family member, leads to megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome, a visceral myopathy characterized by defective contractile activity of muscles that line the bladder and intestine [1]. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in LMOD3, the isoform predominant in skeletal muscle, result in nemaline myopathy, a skeletal muscle disorder characterized by muscle weakness ( there are >20 mutations reported to date ) [2–6]. Additionally, disease causing mutations have been found in the cardiac-predominant isoform, LMOD2. We reported the first known case of a mutation in LMOD2 ( p. W398* ) that results in severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) [7]. Subsequently, a second case confirmed the pathogenicity of this mutation [8]. Additional mutations in LMOD2 have been discovered that also result in early-onset DCM and death [9–11]. The mutations are biallelic in all individuals, with three homozygous for the same mutation ( c. 273+1G>A, p. W398*, or p. L415Vfs*108 ) [7, 8, 10, 11] and one consisting of compound heterozygous mutations ( p. R513* and p. L415Vfs*108 ) [9]. All data to date suggest that Lmod-linked muscle diseases have the common underlying pathophysiology of short thin filaments, reduced muscle contractility and severe muscle weakness. Most disease-causing mutations in the LMOD family of genes are nonsense or frameshift mutations which are predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in most cases, little to no LMOD protein is expressed [1, 2, 7]. In the case of the patient with the first described disease-causing mutation in LMOD2 ( p

In this study we developed an experimental system to directly test the effect of human LMOD2 disease causing mutations on the expression and stability of LMOD2 protein. To date, four distinct LMOD2 mutations have been discovered in individuals from five separate families that all present with early onset dilated cardiomyopathy [7–11]. By analyzing explanted hearts we previously found that two of the mutations ( p. W398* and c. 273+1G>A* ) result in a lack of full-length or mutant protein expression [7, 11]. Here we further show the p. W398* mutation, and an additional unstudied mutation ( p. R513* ), result in very little mutant LMOD2 protein expression when expressed from gene constructs in a human cell line, while another unstudied mutation ( p. V415fs*108 ) does not significantly decrease mutant protein levels. Interestingly, a patient homozygous for the latter mutation displayed the latest onset of disease to date, presenting at 9 months of age [10], revealing a potential correlation between mutant LMOD2 protein levels and severity of DCM. While the L415Vfs*108 mutation did not result in a significant decrease in mutant protein when expressed from the minigene construct ( ~90% of wild type levels ), when expressed from the CDS construct the mutation results in an increase in protein levels ( ~130% of wild type ) suggesting that the mutant protein, which contains 108 random residues C-terminal to valine 415, is more stable than wild type LMOD2. Multiple lines of evidence point to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) as the underlying cause of loss of LMOD2 protein due to the W398* and R513* mutations. First, the mutations only result in a large decrease in protein levels when expressed from constructs containing an intron, indicating that significant loss of mutant protein is not due to a defect at the level of the protein

. Thus, we chose to employ steric-blocking oligonucleotides ( SBOs ) to take advantage of the specificity of Watson-Crick base pairing with the goal of only targeting the LMOD2 transcript by blocking a single EJC binding site downstream of the PTC. Three of the four SBOs ( L2[–30], L2[–34], and L2[–38] effectively increased mutant LMOD2 protein expression. One SBO did not recover mutant LMOD2 protein or mature mRNA levels and resulted in an apparent increase in LMOD2 pre-mRNA levels. The reason for the increase in pre-mRNA levels is not clear, but could result from altered pre-mRNA processing and/or degradation [28]. All of the LMOD2 disease-causing mutations ( should they be expressed ) result in proteins missing varying degrees of their C-termini, which includes one of the three known actin-binding sites of LMOD2. Thus, while recovery of mutant protein expression, due to successful inhibition of NMD, is predicted to improve cardiac function and could potentially provide the patient with additional time to receive other therapies or a cardiac transplant, it is not expected to provide a cure since it is likely that fully-functional protein is not made. Supporting this conclusion, transgenic mice expressing the homologous mutation ( p. W405* ) to that first discovered to cause disease in humans ( p. W398* ) live significantly longer than Lmod2 knockout mice, but display dilated cardiomyopathy and die prematurely as adults ( Iwanski et al., in preparation ). Alternatively, combination of SBO treatment with drugs that promote translational readthrough of premature termination codons could prove therapeutically synergistic. Greater than 50 compounds that promote stop-readthrough have been discovered and are in various stages of therapeutic development [29]. However, degradation of mutant transcripts containing premature termination codons by NMD could limit the effectiveness of stop-readthrough drugs

. Thus, treatment with an SBO that inhibits NMD in combination with a drug that promotes translation of the full-length protein could result in rescue of cardiac function in patients with certain mutations in LMOD2. This study was performed in a human cell line that does not express detectable levels of LMOD2 to facilitate analysis of LMOD2 gene constructs containing patient mutations. Thus, it is not clear whether SBOs will be effective in patients with detectable levels of L2 protein. However, our results suggest that NMD plays a critical role in loss of mutant L2 protein in patients with dilated cardiomy due to mutations in the L2 gene and that steric-blocking oligonucleotides can restore mutant expression of L2 protein. This lays the groundwork for potential therapeutic intervention in L-linked myopathies, including dilated cardiomy due to mutations in the L2 gene.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) polymorphisms modify the risk of Alzheimer’s disease with ApoE4 strongly increasing and ApoE2 modestly decreasing risk relative to the control ApoE3. To investigate how ApoE isoforms alter risk, we measured changes in proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing a human ApoE gene ( isoform 2, 3, or 4 ). The regulation of each protein’s homeostasis is observed by measuring turnover rate and abundance for that protein. We identified 4849 proteins and tested for ApoE isoform-dependent changes in the homeostatic regulation of ~2700 ontologies. In the brain, we found that ApoE4 and ApoE2 both lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins relative to the wild-type control ApoE3. In ApoE4 mice, lack of cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins suggests that dysregulation of proteasome and autophagy is reducing protein quality. In ApoE2, proteins of the mitochondrial matrix and the membrane, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, had a similar increase in degradation which suggests coordinated replacement of the entire organelle. In the liver we did not observe these changes suggesting that the ApoE-effect on proteostasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues. Our findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover rates to decipher proteome regulatory mechanisms and their potential role in biology.

    In this study, we demonstrated how combining protein abundance and turnover rate unveils the cellular regulation of protein synthesis and degradation. Utilizing proteomics data, we compared ontology-level variations due to ApoE genotypes in healthy adult mice. Our findings present in vivo evidence that harmonizes with existing literature, linking brain ApoE4-dependent changes in endosomal trafficking, autophagy, proteasome activity, and lower mitochondrial quality. Concurrently, our data suggests that ApoE2 enhances brain mitochondrial health by increasing turnover in tandem with a corresponding increase in proteolysis capacity in the brain ( Fig 6 ). Future work investigating ApoE-dependent modification of region-specific lipid transport or protein-protein interactions will be necessary to elucidate the key initiating variables causing these proteostatic changes.

. ApoE is an important lipid transporter to many parts of the body, not just the brain. Although ApoE2 protects against Alzheimer’s Disease, it increases risk for cardiovascular disease [18]. This leads us to question if the mechanism by which ApoE2 protects against Alzheimer’s, may be detrimental and disease causing to other tissues. To understand if ApoE elicits a global response across all tissue, we tested and analyzed the liver tissue from our experimental mice in the same manner as the brain. The changes in ApoE2/E3 liver and brain proteostasis were not equivalent. Although many trends were similar between brain and liver, few changes in the liver were statistically significant. Mitochondrial protein localization, transportation, and organization had similar proteostasis trends between tissues, that suggest mitochondrial turnover to be reduced in the liver compared to the brain ( S3 Table compared to S5 Table ). Similarly, ApoE4/E3 liver and ApoE4/E3 brain proteostasis changes in the endosome, metabolism, and proteasome pathways in the brain are not similar between tissues ( see S4 and S5 Tables ). However, significant effects of ApoE4 regarding the mitochondria between the liver and brain contained several of the same proteostasis changes, suggesting there may be some degree of shared effects due to ApoE4. Thus, while some cellular pathways may be affected similarly, a global effect specific to ApoE allele is not observed in our data. We propose the lack of a global ApoE effect ( Figs G and H in S1 File ) is because most tissues have a large number of apolipoproteins ( ~16 ) participating in lipid transport [8, 18]. The brain is limited to the apolipoproteins that it creates ( primarily ApoE and ApoJ ), and ApoA1 which can cross the blood-brain-barrier [16]. Since lipid trafficking in the liver involves many more apoliproproteins, this may dilute the ApoE effect

. These observations agree with previous research on astrocytes indicating ApoE2 expression increases lysosomal activity relative to ApoE3 and ApoE4 expression [41]. We observed ApoE-dependent changes in mitochondrial proteostasis that were consistent with the modified autophagy and lysosomal function discussed above. In ApoE4 ( E4vsE3 ) mice, we measured elevated degradation in mitochondrial membrane ( 406 ), mitochondrial inner membrane ( 303 ) ( Figs 3 and D in S1 File ), Cristae formation ( 11 ), Mitochondrial fusion ( 13 ), and mitochondrial transport ( 72 ) with no accompanying change in mitochondrial matrix ( 159 ) and decreased synthesis of mitophagy ( 18 ). Mitochondrial membrane complexes play critical functions in cellular homeostasis—such as energy production, calcium level modulation, apoptosis, and the regulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) [42]. Prior research has documented dysfunction in the mitochondrial membrane’s integrity as a promoter of Alzheimer’s disease [43, 44]. Most mitochondrial proteins are encoded on the nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria through translocases ( TIM and TOM ) [45, 46]. These translocases interact with the many inner mitochondrial membrane ( IMM ) folds that make up the cristae via the mitochondrial cristae organizing system ( MICOS ). [47] Our observations indicate a change in mitochondrial protein import, especially evident in the higher degradation of the TOM complex ( 10 ), cristae formation ( 11 ), and the MICOS complex ( 7 ) ontologies. ( See Figs 5B and 5E in S1 File ). The MICOS also plays a vital role in cristae organization and the function of respiratory complexes. [48] Disruptions in MICOS have been documented to modify cristae structure[49], and recent studies associate altered MICOS protein expressions with ApoE4 manifestation[44]. The MICOS literature also report evidence of mitochondrial fusion and fission imbalance in Neuro-2a cells expressing ApoE4

Compared to the neutral ApoE3 allele, expression of ApoE4 significantly increases the risk for Alzheimers, while the expression of ApoE2 is moderately protective [5, 8, 12, 22, 25, 27–29]. Here we investigate the etiology of these differences by measuring ApoE-dependent changes in protein homeostasis ( proteostasis ) in the tissues of human-ApoE transgenic mice ( Fig 1A ). Proteostasis is the dynamic control of concentration and quality [19, 30–32] in the cell. According to our model ( Figs 1C and B in S1 File ), protein concentration is controlled by the competition between synthesis and degradation while protein turnover rate, or the rate that proteins are replaced, is the average of synthesis and degradation. We present this as simplified equations that relate to synthesis and degradation ( see ‘Proteostasis Model and Analysis Rational’ section for more detail ). Therefore, changes in protein concentration ( Δabundance, Eq 3 ) paired with changes in protein turnover rate ( Δturnover, Eq 10 ) can highlight the regulatory balance of synthesis versus degradation between conditions ( Fig 1B and 1C ). For instance, to increase abundance in the experimental condition ( resulting in a positive Δabundance ), cells can either synthesize faster or degrade slower. Alternatively, to decrease abundance ( leading to a negative Δabundance ), cells might reduce synthesis or increase degradation. Using the change in protein turnover rates ( Proteostasis Model section, Eq 10 ) we can deduce whether changes in synthesis or degradation led to changes in abundance ( Fig 1B ). Therefore, a positive Δabundance indicates increased synthesis when Δturnover is positive or reduced degradation when Δturnover is negative. Conversely, a negative Δabundance signals increased degradation when Δturnover is positive or decreased synthesis when Δturnover is negative ( Fig 1C )

. [44] Previous analysis of AD brains indicated diminished protein levels connected to mitochondrial fusion/fission[50], which our data supports as a degradation driven loss of fusion proteins ( See Figs DA and DB in S1 File ). Mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) collectively form the mitochondria-associated membrane ( MAM ), which has implications in AD pathology [51, 52]. These MAMs regulate oxidative phosphorylation, calcium levels, protein degradation, and mitochondrial membrane organization. Our dataset elucidates an ApoE4-induced MAM ( 57 ), marked by increased degradation contrasted against ApoE3 ( Figs 3 and D in S1 File ). Our results support ApoE4-related MAM instability by diminished synthesis of chaperone complexes, mitophagy, and calcium transport. These results suggest that ApoE4-tissue relied on replacement of individual components within the mitochondria to maintain homeostasis. In contrast, ApoE2 mice increased degradation of mitochondrial membrane ontologies with a matching increase in the degradation of the matrix proteins. Although both ApoE2 and ApoE4 lead to changes in mitochondrial proteostasis, ApE2 did not lead to a loss of cohesion between the membrane and matrix proteins as seen in ApE4 ( Figs 3 and D in S1 ). Apo2 degradation of the mitochondrial matrix and membrane proteins, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, suggests a coordinated replacement of the entire organelle ( Figs 3 and D in S1 ). The liver did not observe these changes suggesting the ApE-effect on proteasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues ( Figs G and H in S File ). Our findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover to decipher proteome regulatory mechanisms and their role in biology.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Tissue-specific gene knockout by CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful approach for characterizing gene functions during development. However, this approach has not been successfully applied to most Drosophila tissues, including the Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ). To expand tissue-specific CRISPR to this powerful model system, here we present a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis ( CRISPR-TRiM ) toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells. We validated the efficacy of CRISPR-TRiM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue, demonstrated its orthogonal use with the Gal4/UAS binary expression system, and showed simultaneous knockout of multiple redundant genes. We used CRISPR-TRiM to discover an essential role for SNARE components in NMJ maintenance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the canonical ESCRT pathway suppresses NMJ bouton growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling. Lastly, we found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESCRT-mediated intra-axonal membrane trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NMJ. Thus, we have successfully developed an NMJ CRISPR mutagenesis approach which we used to reveal genes important for NMJ structural plasticity.

    Tissue-specific mutagenesis by CRISPR is a powerful approach for dissecting gene functions in animal development [1, 4, 9–12, 14–16, 72]. This approach directly disrupts the coding sequence of, and thus knocks out, the gene of interest in specific somatic cells. However, its successful application in the Drosophila NMJ system has not been demonstrated previously. In this study, we developed a Cas9 collection for applying CRISPR-TRiM in motor neurons, somatic muscles, and glia cells, the three principal cell types that make up the NMJ. Using these tools, we demonstrate the effectiveness of gene KO in each tissue and reveal the role of the SNARE pathway in NMJ maintenance and the roles of the ESCRT pathway in NMJ morphogenesis. Compared to LOF by RNAi, the CRISPR-TRiM method offers two major advantages. First, it is relatively easy to express multiple gRNAs to knock out several genes simultaneously, and thus this method is particularly useful for studying redundant genes, as exemplified by the analyses of Nsf and Snap genes. In comparison, almost all existing RNAi transgenes target single genes, and it is either labor intensive or impossible to combine them because they are inserted in few common loci. Second, because mutagenesis occurs individually in each cell and could yield different degrees of LOF, CRISPR-TRiM has the potential to reveal both weak and strong LOF phenotypes of the gene of interest ( GOI ) using a single gRNA transgene. This property can be useful for dissecting complex functions of genes, as demonstrated by OK371-Cas9 gRNA-shrb. Unlike Gal4-dependent CRISPR strategies [1, 7], the tissue-specific Cas9s in our CRISPR-TRiM method can be used orthogonally with binary expression systems, as exemplified by simultaneous TSG101 KO in neurons and tissue-specific KD of gbb. Thus, the tools we reported here enable a versatile CRISPR toolkit to analyze gene function in the NMJ system

Characterization of developmental mechanisms often involves loss-of-function ( LOF ) analysis of genes in organisms. Besides the more traditional methods of LOF, such as whole-organismal mutations and RNA interference ( RNAi ), tissue-specific mutagenesis through the CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently emerged as another powerful approach [1–5]. In this approach, either Cas9 or gRNAs ( or both ) are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, so that CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of the gene of interest ( GOI ) occurs only in the desired tissues [1, 2, 6, 7]. Although tissue-specific CRISPR can be very effective for studying gene function, its successful application has been limited to a small number of Drosophila tissues, including the germline [1, 8], sensory neurons [9–12], prothoracic gland [13], mushroom body neurons [14], imaginal tissues [7, 9, 10], epidermal cells [9, 10], circadian neurons [15, 16] and cardiomyocytes [17]. The Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) is a powerful model for studying many biological processes, such as axon development, synaptogenesis, synaptic function and plasticity, and locomotion [18–20]. Although CRISPR has been used to tag endogenous proteins at the NMJ [21], tissue-specific CRISPR has not yet been successfully applied to the fly NMJ. NMJs are special synaptic connections formed between motor neurons and somatic muscles [22]. The axon termini of the motor neurons release extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) into the space between axons and muscles [23–26]. Outside the nervous system, EVs can originate from many types of cells and can carry diverse cargos made of all four types of biomolecules ( carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids ) [27]. These vesicles may function in long-distance signal transduction and cell-cell communication and have been shown to play important roles in many physiological and pathological processes [28, 29]

. As vesicle fusion is an essential “house-keeping” function, we anticipated that loss of both Nsf genes in glia should also disrupt glial morphology and function. Indeed, larvae containing both repo-Cas9 and gRNA-Nsf1-Nsf2 showed locomotion defects and died at the late third instar stage. In these animals, the glia wrapping motoneuron axons formed enlarged compartments that were absent in repo-Cas9 controls ( Fig 2G and 2H ) resulting in a greater ratio between the maximal and minimal widths of the glial tract ( Figs 2I and S2D ). These results suggest that repo-Cas9 can efficiently induce biallelic mutations of two genes simultaneously in glia. Altogether, the above results demonstrate that Cas9 expressed by motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells can result in efficient tissue-specific gene KO for studying motoneuron development and NMJ biology. To investigate NMJ morphogenesis with CRISPR-TRiM, we next examined the role of the secretory pathway mediated by SNARE proteins. Because many SNARE genes play essential housekeeping functions in all cells, we reason that their LOF in motoneurons should result in morphological defects at the NMJ. In addition, because these genes are expected to be expressed early in neuronal lineages and are prone to perdurance, testing them with CRISPR-TRiM may reveal differences in the timing of action among the Cas9 drivers in motoneurons. Snap25, Snap24, and Snap29 are Drosophila SNARE proteins in the Qbc subgroup that mediate fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane [44]. We have previously generated a transgene expressing six multiplexed gRNAs targeting all three Snap genes simultaneously and have showed that it efficiently suppressed dendrite growth of Drosophila sensory neurons with an appropriate Cas9 [9]. As the three proteins play partially redundant functions, LOF of the entire gene group is required to reveal morphological defects in neurons [9]

To apply CRISPR-TRiM in tissues relevant to NMJ biology, we generated several Cas9 lines that are expressed in motoneurons, glial cells, or somatic muscles ( S1A Fig ) by Gal4-to-Cas9 conversion [10], enhancer-fusion [9], or CRISPR-mediated knock-in ( KI ). For motoneurons, we generated wor-Cas9, which should be active in neuronal progenitor cells [32], and three lines ( OK371-Cas9, OK6-Cas9, and OK319-Cas9 ) that should be expressed in post-mitotic motoneurons [10, 33–36]. For glial cells, we previously made repo-Cas9 [10]; for this study, we also generated gcm-Cas9 by inserting Cas9 into the glial cells missing ( gcm ) locus through CRISPR-mediated KI ( S1A and S1B Fig ). gcm-Cas9 is predicted to be active in glial progenitor cells [37, 38]. Lastly, we made a muscle-specific mef2-Cas9 by converting mef2-Gal4 [10] ( S1A Fig ). To evaluate the mutagenesis efficiency in motoneurons, we generated a Cas9 negative tester nSyb-tdGFP; gRNA-GFP. nSyb-tdGFP is expressed in all neurons [9] and labels motoneuron axon terminals ( Fig 1A and 1B ). gRNA-GFP expresses two gRNAs ubiquitously, targeting GFP and EGFP coding sequences [10]. Activities of different Cas9 transgenes can be compared by measuring remaining GFP fluorescence in relevant cells when tested with such negative testers [9]. We examined Ib bouton formation in NMJs of repo-C9, OK-C9, OK-C9, OK-C9, g-C9, g-C9, and me2-C9 larvae ( Fig 1C and 1 ) and found that boutons were significantly reduced in repo-C9, OK-C9, OK9-C, and OK9-C larvae compared to controls ( Fig 1D and 1 ). These results indicate that CRPR-TRM can efficiently knock out genes in motone, muscles, and glial cells and demonstrate its utility for studying NMJ biology

To investigate the role of the ESCRT pathway in NMJ morphogenesis, we used CRPRTRM to knock out TSG in motone. TSG is a core component of the ESCRT pathway [39, 40] and has been shown to regulate retrograde signaling at the NMJ [41, 42]. We generated a gRNA targeting TSG and expressed it in motone with OK-C9 ( Fig 2A and 2 ). NMJs of TSG-C9 larvae showed reduced bouton formation ( Fig 2C and 2 ) and increased bouton size ( Fig 2 and 2 ) compared to controls. These results suggest that TSG is required for NMJ morphogenesis and that the ESC pathway suppresses NMJ bout growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling. Furthermore, we found that axon termini of motone rely on ESC-mediated intra-axonal trafficking for release of EVs at the NM ( Fig 3 and 3 ). Intra-axonal trafficking of EVs is essential for retrograde signaling at the NM [43, 44] and our results indicate that the ESC pathway plays a role in this process. We used CRPRTRM to knock out T in motone and found that NMJs of T-C larvae showed reduced bout formation ( Fig 3 and 3 ) and increased bout size ( Fig 3 and 3 ) compared to controls ( Fig 3 and 3 ). These results suggest that T is required for NMJ morphogenesis and that the ESC pathway suppresses NMJ growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling. We also found that axon termin of motone rely on ESC-mediated intra-axonal trafficking for release of EVs at the NM ( Fig 3 and 3 ). Intra-ax trafficking of EV is essential for retrograde signaling at the NM [43,44] and our results indicate the ESC plays a role in this process. We used CRPRM to knock out T in motone and found that NMJs T-C showed reduced bout formation ( Fig 3 and 3 ) and increased size ( Fig 3 and 3 ) compared to controls ( Fig 3 and 3 ). These suggest that is required for NMJ morphogenesis and the pathway suppresses NM growth by downregulating retro Gbb. Furthermore, we found that ax termin of motone rely on ESC-mediated intra-ax for release of EV at the NM ( Fig 3 and 3 ) Intraax of EV is essential for retrograde at NM [43,44] and our indicate the plays a role in this process. We used CR to knock out in mot and found that NMJs showed reduced bout ( Fig 3 and 3 ) and increased ( Fig 3 3 ) compared to controls (3 and 3 ) These suggest that is for NM morph and the suppresses growth by downregulating G. We also found that termin of rely on ESC-mediated intra for release at NM (3 and 3 Intra EV is for retrograde [43] and our indicate a role in this.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Post-larval hematopoiesis in Drosophila largely depends upon the stockpile of progenitors present in the blood-forming organ/lymph gland of the larvae. During larval stages, the lymph gland progenitors gradually accumulate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ), which is essential to prime them for differentiation. Studies have shown that ROS triggers the activation of JNK ( c-Jun Kinase ), which upregulates fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) to facilitate progenitor differentiation. Intriguingly, despite having ROS, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in the late larval stages. Using expression analyses, genetic manipulation and pharmacological approaches, we found that the Drosophila NF-κB transcription factor Relish ( Rel ) shields the progenitor pool from the metabolic pathway that inducts them into the differentiation program by curtailing the activation of JNK. Although ROS serves as the metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation, the input from ROS is monitored by the developmental signal TAK1, which is regulated by Relish. This developmental circuit ensures that the stockpile of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted entirely. Our study sheds light on how, during development, integrating NF-κB-like factors with metabolic pathways seem crucial to regulating cell fate transition during development.

    Drosophila third-instar lymph gland houses a pool of primed progenitors arrested in the G2- M phase of the cell cycle. It has been evidenced ROS primes the progenitors for differentiation ( Fig 7A–7A’ ). Interestingly, long before the G2-M arrest sets in, ROS can be detected in the developing progenitors ( Fig 7B–7D ). Earlier work has demonstrated that the ROS act as the differentiation signal to elicit differentiation by activating JNK-FAO axis [13]. Even though ROS is present in the entire progenitor pool at the late third instar stage ( Fig 7E–7E’ ), differentiation initiates in the outer rim of the medullary zone. This phenomenon spells out the existence of an intrinsic control that overrides the differentiation program in the most of the ROS-enriched progenitors. Our study reveals that Drosophila NF-κB factor Relish expresses strongly in the ROS-enriched progenitors and wanes as the cells move towards differentiation during development ( Fig 7E’-7E” ). We further show that genetic loss of Relish from the progenitors lead to the activation of the JNK-FAO cascade, coaxing them to differentiate. On the other hand, sustained expression of the N- terminal Relish ( UAS-Rel 68 KD ) that is known to translocate into the nucleus [51] resulted in a halt in the differentiation program. We found that ROS, the trigger for JNK activation and differentiation in progenitor cells [12], remained unchanged in the Rel loss scenario. Interestingly, elevating ROS levels in the UAS-Rel 68 kD genetic background could not rescue the halt in differentiation observed in the latter. Our work demonstrates that Relish in the ROS-enriched progenitors prevents the activation of JNK, thereby deferring their differentiation. The observation that Relish is responsible for preventing JNK activation demands a node at which the JNK signaling is sensitive to the negative regulation of Relish

Moreover, the enrichment of Rel expression in the progenitors ( Ance+, Pxn- Fig 1B–1E’, CHIZ 1S–1T ) and its decline in differentiated blood cells implies that ROS ( Fig 2A–2A”’ ) during development cannot elicit differentiation due to the Rel-mediated inhibition on JNK. Our next goal was to investigate the link between Rel and JNK. In Drosophila, Mammalian MAP3 kinase homolog, TAK1 interweaves two pathways that lead to Relish activation and JNK signaling [35–37]. Following immune stimulation, TAK1 activates both the JNK and NF-κB pathways [38–40]. It has also been elucidated that Relish, once activated upon bacterial infection, leads to proteasomal degradation of TAK1, thereby limiting JNK signaling to prevent hyper-immune activation [41]. Interestingly, this pathway also maintains the functionality of the hematopoietic niche during development [21]. Since we observed the activation of JNK in the absence of Relish in the progenitors, we speculated that progenitors might employ the same developmental circuit to prevent their exhaustion. To test our notion, we performed a progenitor-specific genetic loss of TAK1, resulting in a small lymph gland with fewer differentiating cells ( Compare Fig 3I with 3K and 3Q ) and abundant progenitors ( Compare Fig 3M with 3O and 3R ). This observation suggests that the absence of TAK1 inhibits the differentiation program, which was otherwise initiated by the metabolic signal ROS. Strikingly, simultaneous down-regulation of TAK1 and Rel from the progenitors rescues the excessive differentiation ( Compare Fig 3J, with 3L, and 3Q ) and restores the progenitors that are otherwise affected upon Rel loss ( Compare Fig 3N, with 3P, and 3R ). Based on these findings, we can infer that Relish in the MZ prevents precocious JNK activation in the progenitors via inhibiting tak1 function during development

. We wondered that if ROS triggers differentiation, then why doesn’t the pool of progenitors differentiate entirely? Why does the differentiation of the progenitors initiate at the rim of MZ despite the entire MZ being enriched in ROS? What shields the progenitors from entering the differentiation program even though they are enriched in ROS? Our interrogation identified nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) transcription factor Relish, a component of the immune deficiency ( Imd ) pathway, as a key molecule that prevents the progenitor pool from differentiating precociously. Although the Imd/IMD pathway has been studied intensively in immunity and inflammation, its role during fly development has only recently been unraveled. Studies have elucidated the non-inflammatory roles of Relish ( Rel ) in Drosophila neurodegeneration [14–16], apoptosis [17] and autophagy in salivary gland cells [18]. Interestingly, in the absence of infection, persistent activation of IMD in Drosophila intestinal stem cell progenitors increases the frequency of division in Intestinal Stem Cells [19]. Intrinsic Nf-κB activity is shown to be essential in stem cells for repairing damaged gut epithelia in Drosophila adult [20]. During development, Rel in the hematopoietic niche of the lymph gland is crucial for its functionality. Absence of Relish from the niche induces JNK-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangement. The aberrant cytoskeletal rearrangement perturbs the proper delivery of Hedgehog from the niche to the adjoining progenitors, leading to their precocious differentiation. Strikingly, Relish is downregulated in the niche during bacterial infection to facilitate an early dispersion of lymph gland resident hemocytes into circulation. The dynamic expression of Relish endorsed that the developmental pathway gets recalibrated in the hematopoietic niche to combat high bacterial infection [21]

. Additionally, like Drosophila, the vertebrate myeloid progenitors are enriched in ROS [12, 67]. It would be interesting to follow up on whether similar crosstalk revealed in our study is operative in vertebrate hematopoiesis. The cell fate determination of stem and progenitor is vital for normal development and several pathophysiological scenarios. Lymph gland has been exploited to understand the several facets of NF-κB regulation on hematopoietic niches functionality [21, 68, 69] during infection and development. Interestingly Rel has been shown to evoke mir-317 to fine-tune PGRP-LC expression as well as AMPs in adult flies. This leads to suppressing immune over-activation and restoring immune homeostasis [70]. Apart from cellular signalling pathways and growth factors, cellular metabolism has been majorly implicated in stem and progenitor cell fate determination in recent years. Cell metabolism fuels the bioenergetic requirements and provides essential metabolites that mediate the genetic and epigenetic regulation of cell fate and state. This intricate interaction between cell signalling pathway components and cellular metabolism in determining cell fate is vital for understanding normal development and has implications for disease progression. In this light, our study foregrounds an essential cog in this wheel by showing how a member of the immune pathway can impinge upon metabolism to regulate progenitor cell fate and homeostasis of tissue during development.

. Interestingly, in hypertrophied animals where there was a decline in the level of Fatty Acid Oxidation in cardiomyocytes, administering NF-κB inhibitors showed significant improvement in disease progression [58]. It will be intriguing to explore whether a similar antagonistic relation is active during development in vertebrates. Downregulation of FAO and subsequent reduction in H3K9 acetylation can be evidenced upon overexpression of Rel in the progenitors compared to the control. Relish ( Rel ) is also known to govern lipid metabolism during metabolic adaptation in the Drosophila fat body. In order to restrain fasting-induced lipolysis and conserve cellular TAG levels, Rel-mediated repression of histone acetylation marks like H3K9 has been reported [59]. Interestingly, rearing UAS-Rel 68kD in the progenitor background resulted in elevated H3K9 acetylation and increased FAO in the progenitors ( Fig 7–7” ). This suggests that Rel in the progenitors suppresses FAO by repressing H3 acetylation. Our study demonstrates that Rel in the hematopoietic progenitors prevents differentiation by curtailing the J-FAO pathway via inhibiting H3 acetylation and FAO.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Taybi-Linder syndrome ( TALS ) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly with abnormal gyral pattern, severe growth retardation and bone abnormalities. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the RNU4ATAC gene. Its transcript, the small nuclear RNA U4atac, is involved in the excision of ~850 minor introns. Here, we report a patient presenting with TALS features but no pathogenic variants were found in RNU4ATAC, instead the homozygous RTTN c. 2953A>G variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing. After deciphering the impact of the variant on the RTTN protein function at centrosome in engineered RTTN-depleted RPE1 cells and patient fibroblasts, we analysed neural stem cells ( NSC ) derived from CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells and revealed major cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities, leading to aneuploidy, cell cycle arrest and cell death. In cortical organoids, we discovered an additional function of RTTN in the self-organisation of NSC into neural rosettes, by observing delayed apico-basal polarization of NSC. Altogether, these defects contributed to a marked delay of rosette formation in RTTN-mutated organoids, thus impeding their overall growth and shedding light on mechanisms leading to microcephaly.

    The Taybi-Linder syndrome ( TALS ), or MOPD1 ( OMIM #210710 ), is a very rare genetic disease with less than 100 reported cases [1–6] characterized by severe pre- and post-natal growth delay, severe microcephaly with brain abnormalities ( abnormal gyral pattern, intracranial cyst, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and corpus callosum agenesis ), intellectual deficiency, bone abnormalities, bulging eyes and dry skin with eczema, as well as a premature death during the first months of life for the most severe cases [7–9]. Since the identification of RNU4ATAC in 2011 [10, 11], no other gene has been associated with this disease. RNU4ATAC is a non-coding gene transcribed into the small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) U4atac, a component of the minor spliceosome. This ribonucleic complex excises less than one percent of all human introns [12], and deficiency in its function leads in most cases to minor intron retention that impairs the correct maturation of about 750 minor-intron containing transcripts [2, 13–17]. Here, we report on a patient with clinical features of TALS but no variants in RNU4ATAC. Whole exome sequencing rather revealed she has the homozygous pathogenic missense variant NM_173630: RTTN c. 2953A>G, p. Arg985Gly, which also alters splicing. This gene has already been implicated in human disease, notably “microcephaly, short stature and polymicrogyria with or without seizure” ( MSSP, OMIM #614833 ). Up to now, 39 patients from 23 families have been reported with bi-allelic pathogenic variants in RTTN [18–33] of which 4 patients, from 3 families, have the c. 2953A>G variant. Most of these patients exhibit common features, at variable degrees of severity, including microcephaly with gyral pattern abnormalities, sloping forehead, intellectual deficiency, and pre- and post-natal growth delay. A few patients only were deceased at the time of publication, with one third of them having reached teenage- or adulthood

In this article, we investigated the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of the RTTN c. 2953A>G variant identified in a patient with a Taybi-Linder-like syndrome, in fibroblasts derived from the patient, and for the first time, in human iPSC-derived neuronal models. We showed that this variant mostly exerts its pathogenicity by inducing the skipping of in-frame exon 23 that encodes 23 amino-acids, and that it has a pleiotropic impact on diverse cellular processes occurring concomitantly or in cascade, including alterations of cell organization/polarity, division and survival of neural progenitors. All these alterations contribute to NSC pool reduction, thus leading to the microcephaly seen in the patient we describe here and probably, in most patients having RTTN variants. The RTTN c. 2953A>G variant is present in a total of 5 out of 40 reported cases ( in 4 out of 24 families ), who all originate from North Africa, thus suggesting a founder effect ( Fig 1D, and S1 Table ) [20, 24, 29]. It has been reported in the gnomAD database at the heterozygous state in 4 individuals only ( out of 725, 468 sequenced ), all of them not unambiguously clustering with the major populations in a principal component analysis. It is noteworthy that it is the only recurrent RTTN variant, all the other being private variants ( Fig 1D ). Whereas in previous reports it was suspected that patient symptoms resulted from the combined effects of the expression, at the protein level, of both the missense p. Arg985Gly and the p. Ser963_Arg985del ( Δ23 ) Rotatin forms [20, 24, 29], here we show that the missense p. Arg985Gly has low pathogenicity by itself. Indeed, it rescues most of the tested RTTN-dKO-related phenotypes in RPE1 cells, and this as efficiently as the WT form ( Figs 2 and S3 ), except for primary cilium formation ( S4 Fig ) and mitosis ( Fig 2K )

. RTTN encodes the large centrosomal protein Rotatin ( 2, 226 amino-acids ), and was initially discovered by a forward genetic screen in the mouse model, with the particular phenotype of Rttn mutant embryos failing to undergo the axial rotation during embryogenesis [34]. Further investigations demonstrated that Rotatin is essential for procentriole elongation [35], correct cell cycle progression and mitosis [29, 36], and regulation of primary cilium length [18, 29]. Alterations of some of these processes have been shown to contribute to the development of microcephaly [37]. Intrigued by the TALS-like phenotype of the patient with this RTTN variant, we thought to investigate the associated pathophysiological mechanisms leading to microcephaly. For that, we used patient fibroblasts, engineered RPE1 cells and CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSC ) that were differentiated into neural stem cells ( NSC ) or cortical organoids ( CO ). We carried out a thorough analysis of the impact of the RTTN isoforms resulting from the mutated allele identified in the patient and conducted cellular studies of the centrosome/primary cilium complex and their related functions. Overall, our results establish how RTTN c. 2953A>G variant affects the integrity of the neural stem cell pool, thus leading to improper neuronal cell mass in patients.

. This result suggests that a higher proportion of KI NSC could be prone to undergo asymmetric divisions and thus to prematurely shift to neurogenic cell divisions, which, as a result, would exhaust the progenitor pool and lead to microcephaly [39, 44, 45]. We generated matrix-free cortical organoids ( CO ) derived from CRISPR/Cas9-edited iPSC ( S9A–S9C Fig ), in order to mimic, in three dimensions, the early stages of brain development. Indeed, the organization of NSC into neural rosettes resembles the developmental structures of neural tubes. First, to check if the splicing outcomes of RTTN pre-mRNA with c. 2953A>G variant was modified in the context of an increased cellular complexity, we analyzed the RNA isoforms in DIV35 CO. We found the same three isoforms as before, in almost the same proportions as in fibroblasts and NSC, except that the FL isoform was less abundant ( S9D and S9E Fig ). Variations in total RTTN mRNA expression did not correlate with the genotypes ( S9F Fig ). We then monitored CO growth by measuring their size twice a week, over a period of culture of 67 days. We observed that starting at DIV21, KI CO exhibited a slower growth rate compared to WT CO, being more than half smaller than WT1 at DIV67 ( Fig 5A and 5B ). In addition to alteration of CO size, we noticed that KI CO morphology was altered: while neural rosettes were appearing at the periphery in WT CO as early as DIV35, these structures were seen in KI CO from DIV56 onwards only ( Fig 5A, arrowheads ). Next, to have a better understanding of neural rosette formation in the context of the presence of c. 2953A>G, we performed immunostaining on CO cryosections, using SOX2 to label NSC and N-cadherin to label their apical adherent junctions facing the rosette lumen. By quantifying their number, we found that roset formation was significantly delayed in KI CO ( Fig 5C and 5D ). This delay in roset formation is consistent with the observed microcephaly in the patient with RT c.295A variant and in other patients with bi-allelic pathogenic RTTN variants [20, 24, 29]. In conclusion, the RT c 3.295A variant affects the integrity of the neural stem cell pool leading to microaly in the patient described here and probably in most patients with bi-allelic pathogenic RTTN variants. This is the first study to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms of the RT c.295A variant in human iPSC-derived models and fibrobl. Our results show that the variant exerts its pathogenicity by inducing the skipping of exon 23 that encodes 23 aminoacids and has a pleiotropic impact on cellular processes occurring conitantly or in cascade, including alterations of cell polarity, division and survival of neural progenitors. These alterations contribute to NS pool reduction leading to microaly in the patient described and probably in patients with bi-allelic pathogenic RTTN. The RT c.295A variant is present in 5 out of 40 cases ( 4 of 24 families ) all from North Africa, suggesting a founder effect. It has been reported in gnomAD at heterozygous in 4 individuals out of 725 468 sequenced, all not ambiguously clustering with major populations in principal component analysis. It is the only recurrent RT variant, all others being private.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Like many other non-sporulating bacterial species, Escherichia coli is able to survive prolonged periods of resource exhaustion, by entering a state of growth called long-term stationary phase ( LTSP ). In July 2015, we initiated a set of evolutionary experiments aimed at characterizing the dynamics of E. coli adaptation under LTSP. In these experiments populations of E. coli were allowed to initially grow on fresh rich media, but were not provided with any new external growth resources since their establishment. Utilizing whole genome sequencing data obtained for hundreds of clones sampled at 12 time points spanning the first six years of these experiments, we reveal several novel aspects of the dynamics of adaptation. First, we show that E. coli continuously adapts genetically, up to six years under resource exhaustion, through the highly convergent accumulation of mutations. We further show that upon entry into LTSP, long-lasting lineages are established. This lineage structure is in itself convergent, with similar lineages arising across independently evolving populations. The high parallelism with which adaptations occur under LTSP, combined with the LTSP populations’ lineage structure, enable us to screen for pairs of loci displaying a significant association in the occurrence of mutations, suggestive of a historical contingency. We find that such associations are highly frequent and that a third of convergently mutated loci are involved in at least one such association. Combined our results demonstrate that LTSP adaptation is characterized by remarkably high parallelism and frequent historical contingency.

   . Additionally, different LTEE populations often experienced similar phenotypic changes [7, 8, 20, 22, 23]. Finally, convergent mutation acquisition was also observed in the LTEE, with different populations often accumulating mutations to similar loci [8, 22, 24–26]. In July of 2015, we initiated our own long-term evolutionary experiment, designed to study E. coli adaptation under prolonged external resource exhaustion [27, 28]. E. coli and many other non-sporulating bacteria are able to survive long periods of resource exhaustion, following brief periods of growth, by entering a state of growth termed long term stationary phase ( LTSP ) [27, 29–32]. In our LTSP experiment, five populations of E. coli K12 MG1655 were established by inoculating cells into 400 ml of fresh rich media. Each population was established from an individual clone. These populations have not been provided with any external growth resources ever since and have had to survive by recycling the remains of their ancestors and brethren [27, 33]. After a day of growth these populations entered a period of rapid death, followed by entry into LTSP, at about day 11 of the experiment. Since day 11 of our experiments, we have seen a slow decline in viability with time, and populations remain viable to this day. Data from the sequencing of ~10 clones per population, from each of nine sampled time points, spanning the first three years of the experiment ( for a total of 413 sequenced clones ), have enabled us to begin characterizing the dynamics of adaptation under LTSP [28]. These analyses have revealed that during the studied time frame, LTSP populations continuously and rapidly adapt through the continuous accumulation of mutations. Such adaptation occurs in a highly convergent manner, with mutations to the same loci and often even to the exact same sites very frequently occurring across independently evolving populations

Our results show that E. coli adaptation under LTSP continues via highly convergent mutation accumulation at least up to six years into our experiments. We were able to discern the lineage structure of our populations, demonstrating that it is in itself convergent. This means that across populations similar lineages, established by the acquisition of the same lineage defining RNAPC mutations, emerge. Lineages defined by the same RNAPC mutation often behave similarly across populations. The identified lineage structure of our LTSP populations and the high convergence with which mutations are acquired across independently evolving lineages allowed us to identify hundreds of loci pairs for which the acquisition of mutations is statistically significantly associated. Our results demonstrate that contingency is remarkably common, as more than a third of convergently mutated loci are involved in at least one putative contingency. Our approach has a number of limitations. First, while we can deduce the directionality of 83. 8% of the putative contingencies we observed ( S9 Table ), we sometimes cannot assign directionality to our predicted contingencies. A second limitation in our approach is that we cannot tell apart direct contingencies ( e. g. mutations in loci A and B are more likely to be adaptive on the background of mutations in locus C ) from indirect ones ( e. g. adaptive mutations in locus A are more likely to occur on the background of adaptive mutations in locus B, which in turn are more likely to occur on the background of adaptive mutations in locus C ). A third limitation of our approach is that it can only identify putative contingent pairs in which both loci involved accumulate mutations convergently, in at least two independently evolving lineages. Instances in which a specific mutation combination occurs in only a single lineage will not be identified by our approach

. 001 ). An additional indication that many of the observed mutations are adaptive is the extremely high convergence with which mutations within non-mutator clones occur. ~88. 5% of mutations acquired by non-mutator clones, fall within 265 loci that are mutated in at least two independently evolving populations ( S1A Fig and S4 Table ). These 265 loci constitute only ~5. 7% of the E. coli genome. Mutations continue to occur more often than expected by chance in loci mutated across multiple populations, throughout the six years of the experiment. However, this trend as well seems to diminish with time ( Fig 2D ). Despite this apparent reduction with time, adaptation is still highly convergent even six years into our experiments—even at the last time point sampled, 84% of mutations occurring within non-mutators fall within loci that are mutated across at least two populations. Combined, these results show that our LTSP populations continuously adapt in an extremely convergent manner, up to at least six years under resource exhaustion, with a possible moderate reduction with time in the fraction of mutations subjected to positive selection. One of the most striking examples of convergence that we already reported on in our previous publications involves mutations in the RNA-polymerase core enzyme ( RNAPC ) -encoding genes rpoB and rpoC [27, 28]. Strikingly, more than 90% of all sequenced clones carry such a mutation, with the same specific mutations often appearing in a convergent manner across populations, and with clones carrying different RNAPC adaptations often co-existing within single populations ( Fig 3A ). The RNAPC mutations are often the first mutations to occur, and thus, all of the descendants of the clones that initially acquired these specific rpoB and rpoC mutations also carry them, and most other mutations are acquired on the background of these RNAPC mutations

. coli to consume and even grow on butyrate [39]. Two non-trivial aspects of the dynamics of adaptation under LTSP enabled us to utilize data extracted from LTSP evolutionary experiments to identify pairs of putatively contingent loci. The first such aspect is the remarkable convergence with which adaptation occurs within our LTSP populations. Adaptation via convergently occurring mutations is a feature of many evolutionary experiments [17–19]. Yet, such convergence is particularly prevalent in our LTSP experiments, where almost 90% of the mutations that occur within non-mutators fall within loci that are mutated across multiple populations and lineages. In addition, we also frequently observed the occurrence of precisely the same mutations across independently evolving lineages and populations. Such specific convergent mutations are less frequently observed in evolutionary experiments [20, 54, 55]. That convergence is so high in our experiments can stem from strong selection, resulting from intense competition. Under LTSP, only a small fraction of the population is able to replicate, via the recycling of the remains of their ancestors and brethren [27, 33]. This likely leads to intense competition between clones. As a result, it seems that the majority of mutations accumulating within non-mutator clones are adaptive ( which is also reflected by the very high dN/dS ratios ). Strong selection by itself would not necessarily lead to such high convergence, unless the possible pathways to adaptation are greatly limited in number. However, when combined, strong selection and a limited number of possible initial pathways to adaptation can lead to high convergence, of the type we observe. The second aspect of the dynamics of adaptation under LTSP that contributed to our ability to identify putatively contingent loci pairs was our populations’ lineage structure

. Indeed, this inability is one of the key parameters used to distinguish E. coli from other bacterial species [10]. One, and only one of the 12 LTEE populations evolved the ability to consume citrate as a carbon source, following ~30, 000 generations. Further analyses revealed that the reason that this phenotype evolved in only a single population, following a fairly long period of time, was related to historical contingency. Specifically, the ability of E. coli to adapt to utilize citrate as a carbon source required a large number of mutations to occur in a fairly specific order, with the effect of certain mutations depending on the previous occurrence of others [8, 11–14]. Fitting with the instance of contingency identified in the LTEE, historical contingency is often framed as a key factor in the evolution of E. coli under LTSP. Our results show that contingency is common, with more than a third of the convergently mutated loci involved in at least one putative contingency. Contingency can be defined as a situation in which the occurrence of a mutation depends on the occurrence of previous mutations [56, 57]. In the context of LTSP, contingency can be seen as a situation in which a mutation is more likely to occur on the background of previous mutations. Our results suggest that contingency is a major factor in the adaptation of E. coli under LTSP, with more than a third of converently mutated loci involved in at least one putative contingency. Contingency can arise from a variety of mechanisms, including genetic recombination [58], gene duplication [59], and mutation [60]. In the context of LTSP, contingency can be seen as a situation in which a mutation is more likely to occur on the background previous mutations. Our results suggest that contingency is a major in the adaptation of E coli under LT, with more than a third of converently loci involved in at least putative contingency. Contingency can arise from a variety of mechanisms, including recombination, duplication, and mutation. In the context LT, contingency can be seen as situation in which mutation is more likely on background previous. Our results suggest that contingency is major in adaptation coli under LT with more than third converently loci involved at least putative contingency. Contency can arise variety mechanisms including recombination duplication and mutation in context LT can seen mutation more likely previous Our results suggest that contingency major adaptation coli under with third converently loc at least putative. Contingency arise variety mechanisms re duplication mutation context can seen likely previous Our results suggest that contingency major adaptation coli with converently at least.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Although originally classified as a non-coding RNA, the male-specific abdominal ( MSA ) RNA from the Drosophila melanogaster bithorax complex has recently been shown to code for a micropeptide that plays a vital role in determining how mated females use stored sperm after mating. Interestingly, the MSA transcript is a male-specific version of another transcript produced in both sexes within the posterior central nervous system from an alternative promoter, called the iab-8 lncRNA. However, while the MSA transcript produces a small peptide, it seems that the iab-8 transcript does not. Here, we show that the absence of iab-8 translation is due to a repressive mechanism requiring the two unique 5’ exons of the iab-8 lncRNA. Through cell culture and transgenic analysis, we show that this mechanism relies on the presence of upstream open reading frames present in these two exons that prevent the production of proteins from downstream open reading frames. 

    Supporting Text:
    Previously, we described the generation of a Drosophila line that inserts the mCherry coding sequence into exon 3 of the iab-8 ncRNA within the Drosophila bithorax complex [3]. Although RT-PCR performed on embryonic RNA extracts confirmed that the mCherry sequence was properly spliced into the mature iab-8 RNA, fluorescence was never observed in the CNS where the iab-8 transcript is normally expressed. However, an mCherry signal was detected in the male accessory glands [3]. We now know that this stems from the incorporation of the mCherry CDS in an alternative form of the iab-8 transcript called male-specific abdominal ( msa ) that is expressed in the secondary cells of the male accessory gland. We wondered why the mCherry sequence could be expressed from the msa transcript, but not from the iab-8 transcript and whether this might be of biological importance. We recently showed that the msa transcript codes for a micropeptide ( MSAmiP ) that mediates sperm usage in mated females [7]. Thus, we hypothesized that the lack of mCherry signal could be indicative of a mechanism to prevent MSAmiP from being expressed in the posterior CNS from the iab-8 transcript. The main difference between the msa and iab-8 transcripts lies in the first exons. MSA starts from a promoter downstream of the iab-8 promoter and results in the first two exons of iab-8 being replaced by an alternative first exon. We tested the translation potential of these two transcripts by placing the coding sequence of GFP as an in-frame fusion to the MSAmiP sequence in the context of the full length MSA or iab-8 cDNAs, and transfecting these constructs into S2 cells under the control of a UAS promoter ( Fig 1 ). Co-transfection with a ubiquitous actin-Gal4 plasmid and an mCherry transfection control plasmid showed that GFP expression could be seen from the MSA version of the plasmid, but not from the iab-8 version ( Fig 1 )

Within the cis-regulatory region controlling the expression of the two, most-posterior homeotic genes of Drosophila melanogaster ( abd-A and Abd-B ), two transcripts have been identified that differ only at their 5’ ends [1–3]. Both transcripts are spliced and polyadenylated but are expressed in different tissues. Originally both of these transcripts were categorized as non-coding. The longer of these two transcripts is called the iab-8 lncRNA and is expressed in the posterior central nervous system ( CNS ) [1, 4]. Loss of the iab-8 ncRNA leads to male and female sterility, largely due to the loss of a miRNA located within its intronic sequences [1] [5, 6]. A slightly shorter, second version of this transcript also exists, called male-specific abdominal ( MSA ) [2]. As its name suggests, MSA is a male-specific transcript that was found in libraries made from Drosophila male abdomen. Later, it was found that this transcript is specifically expressed in a particular cell type of the seminal fluid producing, male accessory gland ( AG ), called the secondary cells ( SCs ) [3]. MSA shares all but its first exon with the iab8 lncRNA ( See Fig 1 ). As such, it also acts as a template to create the same miRNA as the iab-8 lncRNA ( miR-iab-8 ). We have previously shown that the loss of this miRNA in the AG leads to both the abnormal development of the secondary cells and an abnormal post-mating response in females after mating [3]. Although both of these RNAs were originally classified as non-coding and have essential non-coding functionalities, we recently discovered that the MSA version of the transcript is actually protein coding [7]. Using ribosome immunoprecipitation and GFP knock-ins, we showed that the MSA transcript serves as a template for a small peptide that we call MSAmiP. Through deletion and frameshift mutations, we found that MSAmiP plays a role in regulating sperm usage in fertilized females

. Interestingly, although the iab-8 transcript shares the sORF coding for MSAmiP, using GFP fusions we were never able to detect this peptide in the CNS, where iab-8 is expressed. Here, we investigate the regulation of protein translation in the iab-8 transcript. Using GFP reporter constructs in tissue culture cells and transgenic constructs in living flies, we show that the presence of upstream ATG sequences ( or upstream open reading frames—uORFs ) in the 5’ exons of iab-8 prevent downstream translation from the iab-8 transcript. Given the conservation of these uORFs in Drosophila, it is interesting to note that we can find no overt phenotypic effect on the development or behavior of the fly, when we ectopically express the MSA version of the transcript. We explore the possibility that this repressive mechanism may be a remnant of an ancient method to prevent ectopic activation of the abd-A homeotic gene.

. Given that the related MSA transcript makes a biologically important peptide from it shared 3’ exon, it seems likely that the translational repression of this peptide may be the biologically important role of these uORFs. Although this may be true at an evolutionary scale, we have not been able to discover an overt phenotype associated with ectopic expression of the MSA transcript. Thus, production of the MSAmiP outside of the male accessory gland does not seem to be a problem. Previously, our genetic dissection of the iab-8 ncRNA has indicated that the primary function of the iab-8 transcript is the production of the iab-8 miRNA [4, 23]. This miRNA is important for repressing the translation of many target genes, including abd-A, Ubx and their essential cofactors homothorax and extradenticle [1] [5] [6] [32] [4]. The position of its promoter within the iab-8 region of the Drosophila bithorax complex allows it to be expressed in the posterior of the embryo where it can restrict posterior expression of more-anterior hox genes. We have previously noted that its placement just upstream of one of its primary target genes may be indicative of an ancestral repressive mechanism to silence abd-A, requiring its presence upstream of its target gene [23]. This is consistent with both our previously described finding of transcriptional interference on the abd-A promoter by the iab-8 transcript [4, 23], and the concept of posterior dominance within the hox complexes ( where posterior/upstream genes function over anterior/downstream genes ). But this type of regulation can lead to a potential problem when a ncRNA is made to be the agent of transcriptional interference, as alternative splicing can actually lead to unwanted protein synthesis

. Using this line, we were able to replace the wildtype iab-8 exon 1 sequence in a second step with an exon 1 sequence lacking the two primary upstream open reading frames ( or a control integration using a wild-type exon 1 ). Although the platform line lacking exon 1 ( and the iab-8 promoter ) is homozygous sterile, as predicted for flies lacking the iab-8 ncRNA ( due to a loss of iab-8 miRNA expression ), we were unable to find any overt phenotypes in flies where exon 1 was replaced with an exon lacking the ~300 bp containing the two upstream ORFs. Thus, while we cannot rule out more subtle effects or roles in other species for these ORFs, our results do not support a role for these peptides in the development or functioning of the fly. A third alternative reason for developing such a repressive mechanism would be to inhibit the translation of a protein aside from MSAmiP. Previously, we showed that the iab-8 lncRNA produces many alternatively spliced products. Some of these transcripts skip the last exon of iab-8 and splice into a downstream exon of the next downstream gene, abd-A [4, 23]. Although these spliced products remove the primary abd-A start codon, initiation from a downstream ATG is a possibility. However, we were unable to find any evidence of ab-A translation from these spliced iab-8 transcripts in the CNS or elsewhere in the fly. Thus, it is unlikely that the repressive mechanism is to prevent translation of ab-A from the i-8 transcript. 

In conclusion, we have shown that the presence of upstream open reading frames in the 5 exons of the iab- lRNA prevent translation of the iab transcript. This mechanism may be a remnant of an ancient method to prevent ectopic activation of the abd homeotic gene. The lack of translation of MSiP from the i-8 transcript is likely due to the presence of these uORs in the 5 exons of the iab lRNA. We were unable to find any overt phenotype associated with ectopic expression of the MSA transcript, suggesting that production of MSi outside the accessory gland is not a problem.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Mutations in glycosylation pathways, such as N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and GPI anchor synthesis, lead to Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation ( CDG ). CDG typically present with seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delay but display large clinical variability with symptoms affecting every system in the body. This variability suggests modifier genes might influence the phenotypes. Because of the similar physiology and clinical symptoms, there are likely common genetic modifiers between CDG. Here, we use evolution as a tool to identify common modifiers between CDG and glycosylation genes. Protein glycosylation is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. Evolutionary rate covariation ( ERC ) identifies proteins with similar evolutionary rates that indicate shared biological functions and pathways. Using ERC, we identified strong evolutionary rate signatures between proteins in the same and different glycosylation pathways. Genome-wide analysis of proteins showing significant ERC with GPI anchor synthesis proteins revealed strong signatures with ncRNA modification proteins and DNA repair proteins. We also identified strong patterns of ERC based on cellular sub-localization of the GPI anchor synthesis enzymes. Functional testing of the highest scoring candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel genetic modifiers of CDG genes. ERC analysis of disease genes and biological pathways allows for rapid prioritization of potential genetic modifiers, which can provide a better understanding of disease pathophysiology and novel therapeutic targets.

   . Protein pairs with high ERC values have similar changes in evolutionary rate and are thought to function together, either in a complex or in a pathway, and may genetically modify each other. ERC allows us to identify proteins with evolutionary rates that covary with CDG proteins, potentially identifying genetic modifiers. A number of recent studies suggest that other glycosylation genes modify CDG genes. In 2002, a study examined a small group of PMM2-CDG patients, the most common CDG, and identified a variant in ALG6, an N-linked glycosylation gene, segregating with more severe outcomes [20]. A modifier screen and ERC analysis of NGLY1, a deglycosylating enzyme associated with a CDG, identified multiple glycosylation genes showing high ERC with NGLY1, implicating them as potential modifiers [15]. A CRISPR screen in cells with reduced DPAGT1 function, the first step in N-glycan synthesis, identified multiple glycosylation genes able to rescue glycosylation defects caused by inhibition of DPAGT1 [14]. In yet another study, a yeast model of PMM2-CDG was evolved over 1000 generations to identify genetic changes that increased the viability of the PMM2 mutant yeast strains [16]. Several top genes that accumulated compensatory mutations were also involved in glycosylation. These studies indicate that genetic variation in glycosylation genes might potentially modify the outcomes of CDG. Applying a computational evolutionary method allows for more rapid and broad detection of disease modifiers. Identifying genetic modifiers of CDG will lead to a better understanding of the physiology underlying variable symptoms in patients and could point to new therapeutic targets. Using ERC, we performed an analysis to discover proteins that have correlated evolutionary rates with glycosylation proteins to discover genetic modifiers of CDG

Phenotypic variation is common in Mendelian diseases, even in patients with the same disease-causing variant [1–3]. Understanding the factors underlying variable disease presentation can be difficult despite often knowing the causal disease gene. Genetic modifiers can enhance or suppress the phenotype of a primary disease-causing mutation, but they may not independently lead to disease phenotypes. Congenital disorders of glycosylation ( CDG ) are a group of ultra-rare multisystemic disorders typically characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and neurodevelopmental delays [4, 5]. However, because of the ubiquity of glycosylation, symptoms of CDG can affect most organ systems. Loss-of-function mutations in 189 glycosylation genes lead to CDG [6]. Patients with the same CDG and even the same disease-causing variant can show phenotypic variability, indicating that genetic background and environment can influence clinical presentation [7, 8]. Current treatment options for CDG are limited, primarily focusing on symptom management [9, 10]. Identifying genetic modifiers of glycosylation genes could lead to new therapeutic targets for CDG patients. Protein glycosylation is essential for proper protein folding, stability, and localization [4, 5, 11]. There are three main types of glycosylation: N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) anchor biosynthesis. N-linked glycosylation is the addition of a glycan onto an asparagine [4, 5]. The glycan is synthesized on the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane, with the stepwise addition of sugars onto a dolichol-phosphate. The glycan is then transferred from the dolichol-phosphate onto a protein and undergoes further glycan additions and trimming in the ER and Golgi. O-linked glycosylation is the addition of a glycan to the hydroxyl group of a serine, threonine, or hydroxylysine [4]

. We found strong intra-pathway ERC signatures among glycosylation proteins in each of the three glycosylation pathways, with the highest average score in GPI anchor synthesis. There were also high inter-pathway ERC values between proteins in different glycosylation pathways. Strikingly, GPI anchor synthesis proteins had many high ERC values with N-linked glycosylation proteins. Protein complexes and proteins with similar functions in glycosylation were also enriched for strong ERC. When examining the genome for non-glycosylation modifiers of GPI anchor synthesis proteins, we found high ERC scores with proteins involved in multiple unrelated pathways, including ncRNA and DNA repair. We found that the strength of these ERC scores is driven by the GPI anchor synthesis enzyme’s location in the cell. In vivo testing of top scoring protein pairs, including GPAA1 with ALG1 and PIGA with RBSN, showed a genetic interaction in a Drosophila eye model. Using computational evolutionary methods, we identified patterns of ERC between CDG proteins and novel potential modifier proteins, many of which validated in vivo.

To find potential candidate genetic modifiers of CDG, we created a dataset of ERC scores across the genome. Using evolutionary rate data from yeast, nematode worms, Drosophila, vertebrates, and mammals ( S1A Fig ), we calculated ERC scores for 19, 149 proteins across the genome resulting in 180, 112, 645 pairwise ERC values ( S1B Fig ). The genome-wide dataset values range from -10. 73–19. 30, with an average of 0. 12 ± 1. 47. Higher values indicate stronger covariation of evolutionary rates. In this study, ERC values ≥ 3 are considered notably elevated because they are two standard deviations from the mean. Using this dataset, we compared ERC scores between subsets of proteins. We first examined the pairwise correlated evolutionary rates among all glycosylation proteins. We included 296 glycosylation proteins in our analyses ( 43, 660 protein pairs ), including all known CDG proteins and glycosylation proteins not yet associated with a disease ( S1 Data ). These include enzymes and support proteins involved in synthesizing and modifying glycans, enzymes required to form glycosylation building blocks, and proteins involved in transporting glycoproteins throughout the cell. We calculated ERC scores between all 296 glycosylation proteins ( S2 Fig and S1 Data ). Glycosylation protein pairs showed higher average values of ERC than expected by chance ( mean ERC = 0. 41, p < 1x10-5 Permutation test ) ( Table 1 and S3 Fig ). The mean ERC score for glycosylation protein pairs is more than 12 standard deviations above the mean of the permutations. Proteins in a pathway are often under similar evolutionary constraints and typically have high ERC values [19]

CDG are poorly understood, multi-systemic disorders with extensive phenotypic variability, suggesting a role for genetic background and modifier genes. Identifying genetic modifiers of CDG could help clarify the pathology of these disorders. In this study, we used evolutionary methods to explore genetic modifiers of CDG and prioritize candidate genes for in vivo testing. Until now, ERC has been used primarily to characterize unknown proteins or identify new proteins involved in specific pathways [19, 40–42, 50–54]. One previous study used evolutionary similarities between disease genes to prioritize novel disease-causing genes [55]. Because modifier genes genetically interact with their disease genes, it is logical that they would also be evolutionarily related to each other. Glycosylation is highly conserved from yeast to mammals allowing for strong evolutionary signals to have developed over time [11, 56, 57]. Previously identified modifier genes for CDG have high ERC values, including PMM2 –PGM1 ( 7. 08 ) and DPAGT1 –DPM1 ( 4. 17 ) [14, 16]. In vivo testing of top hits from our analysis had a hit rate ( 10 out of 16 ) higher than previously found in other ERC studies ( 5/16 and 12/34, respectively ) [41, 42]. Using ERC to identify disease modifiers is a novel application that could be applied to help better understand and treat rare diseases. On the basis of this study, we propose that ERC is a useful tool for identifying genetic modifiers of CDG.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The HBV core ( HBc ) protein contains an N-terminal domain ( NTD ) for capsid assembly and an arginine-rich C-terminal domain ( CTD ) for pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) encapsidation. Phosphorylation of the HBc CTD, especially at Ser162 and Ser170, is essential for nucleation with the polymerase ( Pol ) to initiate pgRNA encapsidation. As capsids mature, the HBc CTD undergoes dephosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in the late stage of encapsidation, which remains to be determined. Using a C-S170 antibody specific for non-phosphorylated HBc-Ser170, we observed a transition from a phosphorylated to a dephosphorylated state during pgRNA packaging. The Pol-dependent dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 was confirmed by the substitution of one single amino acid at Val782 in the RNase H domain, which abolished the dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry analyses, and the protein structural analyses showed that the recruitment of the host phosphatase PP1 is dependent on the Pol-Val782 domain. This recruitment does not require HBc but does require Pol via epsilon RNA signal, suggesting that the Pol-pgRNA complex plays a key role in PP1 recruitment. Pol-pgRNA-PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 is essential for the completion of pgRNA encapsidation and appears to be associated with late endosomes/multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ). Therefore, HBV Pol may play a dual role by initially bringing pgRNA to phosphorylated HBc and recruiting PP1 for later completion of RNA packaging into the capsids. These findings not only decipher the mechanism by which Pol-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc regulates pgRNA encapsulation, but also reveal the possibility of PP1 as a potential target for antiviral development.

   . Through this specific domain, HBV Pol recruits a host phosphatase, leading to the dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 for the enclosing of pgRNA in mature capsids. Our investigation of this molecular event elucidates the mechanism underlying the HBc phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cascade during pgRNA encapsidation into nucleocapsids.

. Although our study has clarified the role of Pol-dependent HBc dephosphorylation in the formation of mature HBV nucleocapsids, it is worth noting that previous studies using HBc non-phosphorylatable ( Ser to Ala ) mutants have demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser residues at 162 and 170 of HBc is required for the packaging of pgRNA. [20, 44], in contrast with our findings. However, this disparity could be reconciled by considering the importance of HBc phosphorylation in the early stage of HBc assembly, with dephosphorylation becoming crucial in the later stages, as discussed in more detail below. Firstly, it has been proposed that phosphorylated HBc-CTD helps to prevent non-specific RNA packaging because it carries a negative charge [45, 46]. At the same time, phosphorylated HBc-Ser170 ( and/or HBc-Ser162 ) also plays a key role in the recruitment of Pol-pgRNA complex, which acts to nucleate capsid assembly and is critical for accumulating the first few subunits of the growing capsid as well as the formation of an incomplete RNA-filled capsids [47, 48]. The underlying mechanism may be that phosphorylation of HBc in dimeric and multimeric intermediates helps open the locked CTD of HBc by preventing disulfide bond formation between Cys48 and Cys183 in the dimers [49]. That facilitates the interaction between HBc and the Pol-pgRNA complex and the formation of an incomplete RNA-filled capsid. However, the hyperphosphorylated HBc-CTD carries a negative charge, which may also reduce subsequent pgRNA packaging, leading to incomplete RNA encapsidation [18]. Based on our observations, Pol-pgRNA in incomplete capsids may initiate dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 through Val782-mediated PP1 recruitment. This dephosphorylation event restores the positive charge of the HBc ARD and promotes nucleocapsid maturation and compaction ( the enclosure step )

In this study, we investigated the ability of the HBc phosphorylation cascade to regulate the HBV life cycle, with a particular focus on the role of HBc hypophosphorylation in RNA encapsidation. Our results revealed dynamic changes in the HBc-Ser170 phosphorylation pattern during the progression of viral replication. The correlation between HBc-Ser170 dephosphorylation and the intricate RNA packaging process suggests a role for Pol in facilitating HBc-Ser170 dephosphorylation during pgRNA encapsidation. In line with this, we demonstrated that Pol recruits the phosphatase PP1 to dephosphorylate HBc-Ser170, which is dependent on pgRNA through the epsilon RNA signal, even in the absence of HBc. Thus, our study elegantly elucidates the sequence of events in pgRNA packaging. First, Pol-pgRNA recruits PP1 to form a Pol-pgRNA-PP1 complex. Once this complex binds to the incomplete capsids composed of phosphorylated HBc, PP1 dephosphorylates HBc, which is essential for the subsequent packaging of the Pol-pgRNA-PP1 complex to form compacted capsids to complete the RNA packaging step. The details are summarized in Fig 7. This model aligns with a biphasic model of pgRNA packaging, with an early nuclear phase and a later cytoplasmic phase in the viral life cycle [43], raising the possibility of spatiotemporal regulation of pgRNA encapsidation. The nuclear phase of pgRNA packaging likely corresponds to the early phase of HBV infection. Our findings, demonstrating Pol-mediated PP1 recruitment and HBc dephosphorylation in the cytoplasm, potentially within late endosomes/MVBs, may represent the later cytoplasmic phase of pgRNA packaging and nucleocapsid maturation

. These results indicated a transition from phosphorylated to dephosphorylated Ser170 in HBc at the RNA encapsidation stage, consistent with a previous publication [22], suggesting that the dephosphorylation of HBc at Ser170 might play an important role in the complete packaging of HBV pgRNA. The dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 coincided with the encapsidation of RNA, suggesting that the viral Pol protein may act as a carrier for this putative phosphatase ( Fig 3A ). To assess the effect of Pol on HBc-Ser170 dephosphorylation, we performed a Pol complementation assay. The results showed that the Pol- replicon was unable to dephosphorylate HBc-Ser170 and package nucleic acids ( Fig 3B, lane 2 ), but supplementation with Pol alleviated both effects in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig 3B, lanes 3–4 ). In addition, we found that supplementation with Pol significantly reduced HBc expression ( Fig 3B, lanes 3–4 ), which may be due to competition for translation of the pgRNA template as a result of Pol binding to the 5’-epsilon of pgRNA [35, 36]. To further examine the effect of Pol on the dephosphorylation of HBc capsids, sucrose density gradient was used to separate the incomplete and complete capsids in cells transfected with the Pol ( + ) or Pol ( - ) HBV replicon, including dimers/multimers ( fractions 2–4 ), empty capsids ( fraction 8 ) and genome-containing capsids ( fractions 9–10 ) ( Fig 3C ). Although our sucrose gradient analysis was not able to completely separate empty capsids from genome-containing capsids ( fractions 8–10 ), we still found a higher proportion of hypophosphorylated form of HBc in genome-containing capsids by the presence of Pol ( Fig 3C and 3D; fractions 9–10 ). In contrast, the phosphorylation of both multimeric and empty capsids was unaffected by the presence of Pol and remained hyperphosphorylated ( Fig 3C and 3D, fractions 2–4, 8 )

. Interestingly, the pgRNA packaging activity of the HBc CTD can be affected by phosphorylation of the HBc CTD [16, 19, 20], which increases the negative charge of HBc. As documented, dimeric HBc and empty capsids exhibit hyperphosphorylated HBc, whereas nucleocapsids containing RNA or DNA exhibit hypophosphorylated HBc [21, 22]. Among the seven putative phosphorylation sites identified in the CTD, Ser155, Ser162, and Ser170 are considered major phosphorylation sites [23, 24]. Substitution of Ser162 or Ser170 with Ala significantly impaired viral pgRNA packaging [20, 25]. However, substitution of S-to-E/D in these major Ser residues in the CTD also significantly reduces pgRNA packaging [19]. These studies indicated that the story is complicated and cannot be accounted for simply by the negative charge of phosphorylated HBc. Our results suggest that HB-S170 deosphorylation is essential for the completion of pg encapsidation and is associated with endosomes/multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ), where Pol-pRNA-PP dephosphorylation of HB-S170 is crucial for the completion of pg encapsidation. This is in contrast to the early stage of HB assembly, where phosphorylated HB-S162 and HB-S170 are involved in the recruitment of PolgRNA and nucleation of capsid assembly [47,48]. The biphasic model of pgRNA encapsidation is supported by our findings, with an early phase in the nucleus and a later phase in the cytoplasm. The nuclear phase likely corresponds to the early stage of HB infection, whereas the cytoplasmic phase corresponds to the late stage of encapsidation and maturation. Our results suggest that HB may play a dual role in bringing pgRNA to phosphorylated HB and recruiting the phosphatase PP for the completion of encapsidation, which is a potential target for antiviral development.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Bacterial symbionts, with their shorter generation times and capacity for horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ), play a critical role in allowing marine organisms to cope with environmental change. The closure of the Isthmus of Panama created distinct environmental conditions in the Tropical Eastern Pacific ( TEP ) and Caribbean, offering a “natural experiment” for studying how closely related animals evolve and adapt under environmental change. However, the role of bacterial symbionts in this process is often overlooked. We sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbiotic bivalves from the genera Codakia and Ctena ( family Lucinidae ) collected on either side of the Isthmus, to investigate how differing environmental conditions have influenced the selection of symbionts and their metabolic capabilities. The lucinid sister species hosted different Candidatus Thiodiazotropha symbionts and only those from the Caribbean had the genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the TEP did not. Interestingly, this nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbiont phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution of nitrogen fixation potential under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the nifHDKT operon by including other lucinid symbiont genomes from around the world further revealed that the last common ancestor ( LCA ) of Ca. Thiodiazotropha lacked nif genes, and populations in oligotrophic habitats later re-acquired the nif operon through HGT from the Sedimenticola symbiont lineage. Our study suggests that HGT of the nif operon has facilitated niche diversification of the globally distributed Ca. Thiodiazotropha endolucinida species clade. It highlights the importance of nitrogen availability in driving the ecological diversification of chemosynthetic symbiont species and the role that bacterial symbionts may play in the adaptation of marine organisms to changing environmental conditions.

   . Notably, some symbiont clades of the genus Ca. Thiodiazotropha were the first documented example of nitrogen-fixing chemosynthetic symbionts [21, 22]. However, the precise processes governing the diversification and adaptation of lucinid symbionts to changing environmental parameters, which may lead to the divergence of local populations of globally distributed taxa, remains poorly understood. Sister species of lucinids from the genera Codakia and Ctena have diverged on either side of the Isthmus of Panama [1, 11]. This unique relationship allows for a comparative study of symbiont adaptation, free from the confounding effects of host evolutionary history. We used high-throughput metagenomic sequencing to recover metagenome-assembled genomes ( MAGs ) of bacterial symbionts associated with Codakia and Ctena sister species from both sides of the Isthmus of Panama. Our primary objective was to investigate how differing environmental conditions on either side of the Isthmus have influenced the selection, diversity, and functional traits of symbionts associated with lucinid clams. We found that all lucinid symbionts from the Caribbean had the potential to fix nitrogen and assimilate nitrate, but these functions were absent in all symbionts from the TEP. To further explore the evolutionary origins of nitrogen fixation in different lucinid symbiont lineages, we compared the genomes of symbionts across the Isthmus of Panama with other lucinid symbiont genomes from around the world. Using phylogenetic reconciliation, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of the nifHDKT operon and identified two distinct HGT events that led to nif gene acquisition and correlated with the colonization of nutrient-poor environments. Within the globally distributed Ca. Thiodiazotropha endolucinida clade, populations in nutrient-poor environments possessed nitrogen fixation genes, whereas those closely related populations in nutrient-rich environments did not

Global change gives rise to new environmental conditions and niches that organisms can adapt to and exploit, and the extent and mechanisms of adaptation in marine species may be significantly influenced by their microbiomes [1]. Bacterial symbionts of animals can potentially adapt to changing environments more rapidly and more flexibly than their hosts due to traits such as shorter generation times, enhanced recombination capabilities, and the potential for horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) between distantly-related organisms [2]. In addition, horizontally acquired bacterial symbionts—those obtained from the environment in each generation—have access to a larger genetic pool for genetic exchange during their free-living phase, which can lead to faster adaptive responses [3]. Consequently, symbionts can serve as a source of ecological innovation, enabling the symbiosis to tap into novel resources and adapt to novel habitats [4–6]. Understanding the mechanisms enabling microbial symbionts to adapt to new environmental conditions will provide novel insights into how animal-microbe symbioses respond to changing environments. The closure of the Isthmus of Panama about 2. 8 million years ago had a profound impact on oceanic conditions, altering environmental factors such as ocean currents, salinity, temperature, and nutrient availability on both sides of the Isthmus [7]. The Tropical Eastern Pacific ( TEP ) continued to experience regular nutrient input due to seasonal upwelling, coupled with increased primary productivity, variable temperatures, and strong tides [7]. In contrast, the Caribbean coast became characterized by stable and warmer temperatures, higher salinity, and a notably low availability of organic nutrients [7]

Studies on the adaptations enabling animals to cope with environmental changes resulting from the closure of the Isthmus of Panama ( reviewed in [8] ) have largely overlooked the role of host-associated microbes [1]. Our investigation focused on understanding how environmental conditions on either side of the Isthmus of Panama have influenced the distribution, diversity and metabolic functions of symbionts associated with lucinid sister species separated by the closure of the Isthmus. Codakia and Ctena sister species from either side of the Isthmus hosted distinct clades of symbionts from the genus Ca. Thiodiazotropha. Despite the absence of symbiont clade overlap across the Isthmus, we observed a lack of specificity between hosts and symbionts, which was evident in the incongruence of their respective phylogenetic relationships. We observed multiple instances where different host species of the Codakia and Ctena genera on the same side of the Isthmus share the same symbiont groups. This is consistent with horizontal symbiont acquisition from the environment and indicates that the environment is a key factor influencing symbiont selection and distribution [19, 29, 30]. We compared the metabolic potential of the symbionts from either side of the Isthmus to investigate how the vastly different environmental conditions of the Caribbean Sea ( CAR ) and TEP have shaped the evolution of lucinid symbionts and their metabolic capabilities. We discovered that nitrogen fixation genes were encoded in the MAGs of all Caribbean symbionts but absent in all the MAGs of symbionts from the TEP. Similarly, we observed that the capacity for assimilatory nitrate reduction was ubiquitous in symbionts from the Caribbean, but not in those from the TEP ( Fig 2 ). Assimilatory nitrate reductases are similarly absent in many deep-water symbiont lineages, which also lack nitrogen fixation genes [18], suggesting that these two capabilities may be linked

. taylori, Ca. T. endolucinida, and Ca. T. gloverae symbiont species, together with their global distribution ranges, present an interesting opportunity to study the origins of genetically cohesive units with species-like properties and characterize the ecological factors underlying bacterial bacterial diversification. For example, further studies on Ca. T. endolucinida could provide new insights into how acquiring new genes can drive ecologically important changes in tolerances to physical and chemical conditions ( ETF dehydrogenase ) or changes in resources consumed ( nitrogen metabolism ). Conversely, the absence of the ability to fix nitrogen in the Ca. Sedimenticola endophacoides clade associated with P. pectinatus from a region in Florida that experiences seasonal upwelling events [52–54] presents the opportunity to study how a change in access to abundant nutrient resources could drive gene loss and eventually lead to diversification of this clade. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between the environment and gene exchange that shapes the evolution and diversification of bacterial symbiont populations. The remarkable flexibility in the partnerships between lucinid clams and diverse symbiont candidates, all sharing the same core metabolic capabilities but different accessory genes, could enhance the resilience of these associations to changing environmental conditions. The capacity to acquire novel metabolic capabilities in response to different nutrient conditions could have important implications for how animal-bacteria symbioses might respond to anthropogenic changes in the environment, such as nutrient loading due to changes in land use. Future investigations should focus on whether location-specific metabolic traits, such as nitrogen fixation, directly influence host fitness or whether symbiont selection is predominantly determined by partner availability.

. However, the abundance of free-living “PEGO” symbionts and their close relatives has not been measured, and further investigation of the free-living microbial communities in lucinid habitats is required to gain a more comprehensive understanding of these dynamics. Finally, the ambiguous ancestral states of the deeper branching nodes of the other Ca. Thiodiazotro enducida clade require further study to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the nifDK operon and understand the role of HGT in the diversification of this clade.

    Title: 
    Abstract: TAS2Rs are a family of G protein-coupled receptors that function as bitter taste receptors in vertebrates. Mammalian TAS2Rs have historically garnered the most attention, leading to our understanding of their roles in taste perception relevant to human physiology and behaviors. However, the evolution and functional implications of TAS2Rs in other vertebrate lineages remain less explored. Here, we identify 9, 291 TAS2Rs from 661 vertebrate genomes. Large-scale phylogenomic analyses reveal that frogs and salamanders contain unusually high TAS2R gene content, in stark contrast to other vertebrate lineages. In most species, TAS2R genes are found in clusters; compared to other vertebrates, amphibians have additional clusters and more genes per cluster. We find that vertebrate TAS2Rs have few one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, although total TAS2R count is stable in most lineages. Interestingly, TAS2R count is proportional to the receptors expressed solely in extra-oral tissues. In vitro receptor activity assays uncover that many amphibian TAS2Rs function as tissue-specific chemosensors to detect ecologically important xenobiotics.

   . Our reconstruction revealed a rapid increase in the number of receptors along the branch ancestral to all batrachians ( i. e., frogs and salamanders ). This clade contained by far the largest TAS2R content among vertebrates ( median of 104 across species ), as opposed to caecilians, their sister group, which displayed numbers of TAS2Rs comparable with other vertebrates ( 3–16 genes per species ). Furthermore, we found two marked declines in TAS2R family size in cetaceans and snakes, consistent with previous work suggesting a general reduction in taste receptors in these lineages’ genomes, possibly associated with aquatic and fossorial lifestyles, foraging patterns, and diets [5, 47–50]. Even though amphibians have a wide variety of genome sizes and tend to have considerably larger genomes than other tetrapods [51, 52], the increased number of TAS2Rs in amphibians does not seem to be associated with a bulk increase in genetic material, such as that caused by whole-genome duplications or chromosomal duplications. A set of 236 species in our database have published genome size estimates [51]. We found no effect of genome size on TAS2R count neither across vertebrates in our dataset ( phylogenetic generalized least squares regression [pgls]; β = 0. 231, t = 1. 60, p = 0. 11, adj. r2 = 0. 01; S2 Fig ), nor when considering amphibians alone ( pgls; β = 0. 131, t = 0. 429, p = 0. 67, adj. r2 = −0. 07 ). An example of rapid genome expansion within our data further supports this conclusion. The Xenopus laevis and X. borealis lineage has undergone an allotetraploidy event, in which the genomes of two diploid ( 2n ) species fused to form a tetraploid ( 4n ) species [53]. However, X. laevis and X. borealis and their relative, X. tropicalis, which retains the ancestral diploid karyotype, all have exactly 50 unique TAS2R sequences

The advent of advanced sequencing technologies and the surge in high-quality genome sequences throughout the animal kingdom in recent years have opened new avenues for taxonomically broad genome mining for diverse gene families, such as TAS2Rs. We developed a computational pipeline to identify bitter taste receptors in any unannotated genome, and used it to analyze chromosome-level assemblies from 661 vertebrate species, identifying 9, 291 intact TAS2Rs. The number of genes per species ranged from 0 in jawless fish, cartilaginous fish, and cetaceans, to 248 in the wood frog ( Lithobates sylvaticus ) ( Fig 1A and 1B ). This result is generally consistent with a recent comprehensive evolutionary study of vertebrate chemoreceptor genes [5] despite some differences, such as missing cartilaginous fish receptors in our analysis ( S1 Fig ). We constructed a phylogenetic gene tree by maximum-likelihood containing the 9, 291 TAS2Rs found in our chosen species ( Fig 1D ). We noticed that TAS2Rs diverged extensively after the major vertebrate lineages were established. Most amphibian receptors are found in four major groups ( clade M1-M4 ). Several receptors form small groups in the gene tree ( clade m1- m4 ). All the major clades have receptors from frogs, salamanders, and caecilians, whereas caecilian receptors are relatively accumulated in the clade M4. The minor “clade m1” containing a small number of salamander and caecilian receptors are clustered with lungfish receptors ( approximate bayes > 0. 95 ) and close to actinopteri receptors ( 0. 95 > aBayes > 0. 90 ). We do find that bird and reptile ( Sauropsida ) receptors are relatively distributed, with some grouping with amphibians and others with mammals. To gain a general view of the evolutionary dynamics of TAS2R gene content in vertebrates, we reconstructed ancestral TAS2R family sizes across our focal species’ phylogeny using DupliPHY [46]

The ability of vertebrates to detect the five cardinal tastes—sweet, umami, salty, sour, and bitter—plays a pivotal role in regulating myriad aspects of animal physiology and behavior. Whereas sweet, umami, and mildly salty are generally considered to be attractive stimuli, guiding animals towards nutrient-rich foods, bitter and sour are considered aversive, and are believed to guide animals away from noxious substances, such as toxins or metabolites found in spoiled food [1]. Each taste is generally associated with a suite of related receptors [2]. Bitterness, as perceived by humans, is detected by a family of G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) called TAS2Rs or T2Rs, encoded by compact, intronless genes. Previous studies have shown that vertebrates have a wide repertoire of TAS2Rs, which varies considerably across lineages, from zero in cetaceans to over two hundred in frogs [3–5]. Detailed evolutionary, expression, and functional studies have been performed in a variety of species, with a bias towards rodents and primates. TAS2R genes appear to be under relatively rapid birth and death evolution in many vertebrate lineages, with significant differences even between close relatives like rats and mice [6] or humans and other primates [6, 7]. In humans and mice, the majority of TAS2Rs are in two or three gene clusters ( 0. 7–30 MB each, containing 10–29 receptors ) in the genome with one or two additional singleton genes per genome [8]. There is considerable variation in the presence or absence of distinct TAS2R family members within species, with evidence of rapid pseudogenization and whole gene deletion in chimpanzees [9]. Over the last two decades, ligands have been identified for a wide range of receptors, including humans and mice [10–12], primates [13–17], domestic cats [18], domestic dogs [19], bats [20–23], marsupials and monotremes [24], birds [25, 26], fish [27, 28], and frogs [3, 25]

. It is possible that a shift in the selective landscape of these genes in batrachians may have released these pressures, allowing for the copy number increase of previously constrained TAS2R loci, contributing to the expansion of the batrachian TAS2R repertoire. To explore TAS2R functions in amphibians, we quantified their expression levels across a variety of ecologically and phylogenetically diverse amphibian species. Inspired by the extra-oral receptor studies that have been performed in humans, mice, fish, and chickens [31, 33–36], we performed transcriptome analysis of seven different tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first search for extra-oral TAS2R expression in amphibians. The number of TAS2Rs expressed in the tongue was the highest among the seven tissues, despite differences in the proportions among species, suggesting that the amphibian tongue ( or oral epithelium in Xenopus ) is the primary tissue in which TAS2Rs function. The clawed frog had the vast majority of TAS2Rs expressed in the tongue at significant levels, similar to humans and mice [11, 74]. By contrast, other amphibian species had proportionately fewer receptors expressed in the tongue. Indeed, the number of expressed receptors that are not found in the tongue is directly proportional to the number of TAS2Rs in the genome. This suggests that increases in TAS2R number may have allowed for the acquisition of tissue-specific functions in specific genes ( i. e., gene subfunctionalization ). The receptors we chose for follow-up functional characterization illustrate the potential importance of extra-oral TAS2Rs in amphibians. As in previous literature, in each species some receptors responded to multiple stimuli, while others appeared specialized [10–12, 25, 27]. Interestingly, we find that three of the five species have liver-expressed TASRs that respond to xenobiotics, such as pesticides and heavy metals, which are ecologically relevant to amphibians. These results suggest that TASRs in amphibians have evolved to detect ecologically important xenobiotics in addition to their traditional role in taste. This is the first evidence that TASRs function as chemosensors in vertebrates outside the oral cavity.

    Title: 
    Abstract: A tri-protein complex containing NICD, RBPj and MAML1 binds DNA as monomer or as cooperative dimers to regulate transcription. Mice expressing Notch dimerization-deficient alleles ( NDD ) of Notch1 and Notch2 are sensitized to environmental insults but otherwise develop and age normally. Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids uncovered no evidence of dimer-dependent target gene miss-regulation, confirmed impaired stem cell maintenance in-vitro, and discovered an elevated signature of epithelial innate immune response to symbionts, a likely underlying cause for heightened sensitivity in NDD mice. TurboID followed by quantitative nano-spray MS/MS mass-spectrometry analyses in a human colon carcinoma cell line expressing either NOTCH2DD or NOTCH2 revealed an unbalanced interactome, with reduced interaction of NOTCH2DD with the transcription machinery but relatively preserved interaction with the HDAC2 interactome suggesting modulation via cooperativity. To ask if HDAC2 activity contributes to Notch loss-of-function phenotypes, we used the HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid ( VPA ) and discovered it could prevent the intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma secretase inhibitors ( DBZ or DAPT ) treatment in mice and spheroids, suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells.

   . To identify changes in dimer vs monomer Notch interactome we performed TurboID and quantitative nano-spray MS/MS mass-spectrometry analyses in a human colon carcinoma cell line, HT-29. The constitutively active TurboID-fused Notch2 and its Notch2RA counterpart constructs expressed at similar levels and biotinylated the NTC and other known partners. Notably, Notch2RA labeling of endogenous human NOTCH2 was significantly reduced relative to control, as expected in the absence of dimerization. Qualitatively, the interactome was unchanged; on average, however, quantitative analysis revealed a 33%-39% labeling reduction across all interacting partners, consistent with weak ( hypomorphic ) activity of N2RA. Interestingly, the HDAC2-anchored interactome was significantly less affected by loss of dimerization. We hypothesized that dimer-deficiency and loss of cooperativity altered the balance between transcription machinery interactions vs. the dimer independent negative regulatory/deacetylase complex, somehow sensitizing the animal to environment-mediated insults, and perhaps regulating the level of protein acetylation among interacting partners in a dimer independent fashion which might explain the relatively mild phenotype in the absence of microbiome [14]. To test the assumption that HDAC2 activity contributes to Notch loss-of-function phenotypes we used the broad acting HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid ( VPA ) and discovered it could block the intestinal consequences of NDD as well as gamma secretase inhibitor treatment ( DBZ or DAPT ) in mice and spheroids, respectively, suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells.

NDD mice are more susceptible to DSS-induced stripping of the mucosa and develop colitis when challenged with 1% DSS [14]. In this study we analyzed some of the mechanistic underpinning of this intestinal phenotype. We show that dimerization-deficiency mimics a subset of Notch loss of function ( LOF ) phenotypes in the small intestine, namely, reduction of stem cells and increase in Paneth cells ( Figs 2–4 ) [21] but no goblet cell metaplasia ( S2 Fig, [22, 23, 25–27] ). Mechanistically, our null hypothesis was that monomers-supported activities of NICD will remain unchanged in NDD mice, but dimer-dependent transcription will be affected. Unexpectedly, RNAseq data from colonic spheroids did not identify differential expression of dimer-dependent targets, recording instead overall reduction in Notch-supported function such as proliferation and barrier function ( Fig 5 and S1 Table ). Moreover, spheroids form NDD mice show enrichment for genes associated with host defense against symbionts and interferon-ß targets, consistent with an elevated colonic epithelium innate immunity response in the absence of immune cells or symbionts; none of these transcripts is known to be a direct Notch target. This heightened response to symbionts under basal, laboratory controlled sterile conditions can explain why NDD mice develop colitis when 1% DSS slightly increased exposure to the gut microbiome, or by inference, when fur mites colonized the skin [14]. It might also explain the normal in-utero intestinal development is followed by rapid postnatal demise and GI disintegration after colonization by symbionts in N1RA/–; N2RA/– ( see [14] ). Corroboration for this supposition comes from studies showing that elevated innate immunity increased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis ( https://doi. org/10. 1038/nri2891 ). However, Additional experimental evidence will be necessary confirm this suggested mechanism for DSS susceptibility in NDD mice

. The transcriptome analyses suggested a reduction in adhesion, increased spheroid differentiation, and elevated innate immune apparatus in spheroids, but failed to provide mechanistic insight linking Notch dimerization to these responses. To investigate the hypothesis that dimerization is involved in modulating Notch dimer-dependent protein-protein interactions, we performed TurboID analysis [32, 33]. We first established stable HT-29 human colorectal carcinoma cell line overexpressing truncated human NOTCH2ΔE-TurboID, NOTCH2ΔERA-TurboID or TurboID as control ( henceforth, NICD2-TurboID or NICD2RA-TurboID, selected based on the experiments described in Fig 5 ). After supplementing the biotin-low DMEM culture medium with 500 μM biotin for one hour, protein samples were harvested from the control, NICD2-TurboID and NICD2RA-TurboID stable polyclonal lines. Biotinylated proteins were captured on streptavidin beads and washed. Western blot analysis confirmed that biotinylated proteins from control, NICD2-TurboID and NICD2RA-TurboID were captured ( Fig 6A ). The western blot demonstrated that NICD2-TurboID and NICD2RA-TurboID were present in equivalent amounts ( Fig 6A and 6B, numbers normalized to endogenous Notch2 from TurboID transfected cells ). Notch biotinylation, not detected in the parental cells, depends on self-labeling or on interaction between NICD2RA-TurboID molecules. As expected, streptavidin recovered NICD2-TurboID and endogenous NICD2 proteins far more efficiently from NICD2-TurboID cells than from NICD2RA-TurboID expressing cells, indicating as expected that dimerization increased the efficiency of labeling of the endogenous partner NICD2 ( Fig 6A and 6B ). Purified biotinylated protein samples were submitted to Beijing Genomics Institute ( BGI ) for next generation label-free quantitative proteomic analyses on a Q-Exactive HF X ( Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA ) in data independent acquisition ( DIA ) mode

. Conditional deletion of HDAC2 alone was shown to protect against DSS [62], however, and in contrast to the benefits of HDAC inhibition, deletion of both HDAC1 and 2 in mice seems to enhance sensitivity to induced colitis and disrupts epithelial barrier function [62–64], indicating that at least some activity is necessary to rip the protective benefits. VPA thus joins Dexamethasone [65] and withaferin A [66] as FDA-approved molecules that alleviate the negative effects of Notch inhibition/loss in the intestine. VPA may do so by creating an epigenetic landscape in which the requirement for NICD is lessened. To conclude, Notch dimerization in mammals seem to be less about transcriptional regulation of an enhancer subset to which they bind through SPS, and more about the overall proteome environment with indirect consequences to innate immunity and barrier functions underlying the hypersensitivity of NDD mice. HDAC3 interacts with NICD1, regulating its stability and activity [67]. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that NICD2 and HDAC2 interact ( S5 Fig ), however, it is unclear if HDAC2 biotinylation depends on that interaction. It is possible that Notch2 and HDAC2 act independently and antagonistically such that co-inhibition has a milder phenotype then the loss of either pathway by reducing or eliminating the need for NICD binding at critical enhancers. Intriguingly, the data we present are also consistent with a model in which NICD dimers somehow regulate HDAC2 deacetylase activity, and loss of this negative regulation and reduction in protein acetylation are part of the Notch LOF phenotype. If the putative antagonism reflects direct interaction and non-histone acetylation, it may explain several reports where the canonical model is inconsistent with the data [68, 69], and suggest that a subset of acylated proteins are key to the regulation of secretory cell fates

. By contrast, NDD mice showed a marked increase in Paneth cells ( Figs 2–4 [21 ] but no goblet metlas ( S Fig 2, [ 22, 23 25, 27 ]. Mechanistically, our hypothesis was that monomers activities of NIC will remain unchanged in N mice but dimer-dependent transcription will be affected. Unexpected, RNAseq data from col spheroids did not identify differential d-dependent targets, instead overall reduction in Notch function such as proliferation and barrier ( Fig 5 and S Table. Moreover, spher form N mice show enrichment for associated with defense against symbts and interferonß targets consistent with elevated epithelium immunity in absence of symbionts of these transcripts known to be direct Notch.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Background selection, by which selection on deleterious alleles reduces diversity at linked neutral sites, influences patterns of total neutral diversity, πT, and genetic differentiation, FST, in structured populations. The theory of background selection may be split into two regimes: the background selection regime, where selection pressures are strong and mutation rates are sufficiently low such that deleterious alleles are at a deterministic mutation-selection balance, and the interference selection regime, where selection pressures are weak and mutation rates are sufficiently high that deleterious alleles accumulate and interfere with another, leading to selective interference. Previous work has quantified the effects of background selection on πT and FST only for deleterious alleles in the background selection regime. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that migration reduces the effects of background selection on FST, but this has not been fully explained. Here, we derive novel theory to predict the effects of migration on background selection experienced by a subpopulation and extend previous theory from the interference selection regime to make predictions in an island model. Using simulations, we show that this theory best predicts FST and πT. Moreover, we demonstrate that background selection may generate minimal increases in FST under sufficiently high migration rates, because migration reduces correlated effects on fitness over generations within subpopulations. However, we show that background selection may still cause substantial reductions in πT, particularly for metapopulations with a larger effective population size. Our work further extends the theory of background selection into structured populations, and suggests that background selection will minimally confound locus-to-locus FST scans. 

    Supporting Text:
    Prior to this work, models of background selection have been restricted to the case of populations that are panmictic [1, 3–4, 23–26] or have low migration rates [2, 35–36]. This represents a substantial gap in the literature, as we expect many, if not most, natural populations to exhibit low to moderate spatial subdivision. Here, we have extended quantitative genetic models of background selection [11, 25–26] to account for the effects of migration in an island model, showing that migration, in addition to selection and recombination, acts to end the cross-generational association between a neutral allele and linked deleterious alleles. A useful property of these models is that predictions for B may be made under weak selection, by considering that weakly deleterious alleles have an appreciable rate of fixation via genetic drift. We tested the predictions of our novel derivation using simulations and found that it best predicts FST and πT under varying strengths of selection, recombination rates, and migration rates. Our work provides a mechanistic explanation for the previously observed lack of effect of background selection on FST under high migration rates [37], and highlights parameter space under which we expect background selection theory to be inaccurate. Our work suggests that the relative importance of the ‘migration effect’ in influencing Blocal depends on the magnitude of the heterozygous selection coefficient, t, and the migration rate, m. In cases where t >> m, we expect the effect of migration to be relatively weak, as selection will likely act to remove deleterious variants prior to their emigration from a population. Under this relatively low migration regime, we expect predictions of background selection to be accurate even without consideration of the migration effect, given that migration is sufficiently infrequent. This is indeed what has been previously observed

. Furthermore, we do not modify our theory to be applied to a continuous distribution of selection coefficients. However, this problem is addressed by the work of Santiago & Caballero [26], which may be extended to our present model. Additionally, we note that our model is restricted to the case of semi-dominance of deleterious mutations. Under low recombination regions with substantial selective interference and recessivity of deleterious mutations, there is evidence that associative overdominance may act oppositely to background selection, instead leading to increased genetic diversity [52–53]. In summary, we have provided a novel theoretical derivation of the effects of background selection in an island model; this model accounts for the effects of migration providing an opportunity to lessen the effects of background selection by truncating cross-generational associations between neutral and deleterious alleles in their reproductive success, and presents a first step into the application of background selection theory in systems with more complex demography. We test the accuracy of the theory under various parameter sets, demonstrating that it predicts FST accurately across a wide range of parameters and predicts πT well when we expect selective interference to be weak.

. We found that background selection can cause substantial reductions in πT ( Fig 3 ), despite weak effects on FST. Under our parameter sets, this effect is most pronounced for lower strengths of selection against deleterious alleles under both low and high migration parameter sets, and it is weakly influenced by the introduction of low rates of recombination. Previous work has suggested that selective interference is more common in larger populations ( reviewed by Ref. [51] ) ; given that Ne, global is on the order of 104 in our simulations, this is likely the case. We investigated this further and found that this agrees with predictions under previous background selection theory derived for the interference selection regime [23]; this theory predicts a greater reduction in B at lower strengths of selection for increasing population sizes ( S1 Fig ). We find that the effects of background selection on πS and πT are dependent on the migration rate, which is to be expected given that migration influences FST both directly and through its effects on background selection, and that FST influences the effective population size of the metapopulation [27] ( see Methods Calculation of FST ). Under our low migration rate parameter set, we found that πS was reduced by a fractionally larger margin than πT ( cf. Fig 3 to S2 Fig ), resulting in the elevation of FST. However, in our high migration rate parameter set, πS and πT were similarly reduced for all simulated values of Nglobalt. For instance, we observed that, at Nglobalt = 50 with m = 0. 00045 and M = 0, πT was reduced by a fraction of ~0. 30 and πS by a fraction of ~0. 45. At Nglobalt = 50 with m = 0. 09 and M = 0, on the other hand, πT and πS were both reduced by a fraction of ~0. 47. Overall, the results from our parameter sets suggest that background selection may cause substantial reductions in πT compared to neutrality, even despite having no effect on FST ( cf

. For instance, Zeng & Corcoran [36] show that they are able to predict FST well using classic background selection theory in simulations with Nlocalm = {0. 05, 0. 25} and Nlocalt = {50, 15}. This is also aptly described by Charlesworth et al. [35], where it is stated that the effects of background selection on FST are primarily through reductions in diversity, πS, within populations; this conclusion was evidenced by simulations with Nlocalm = 1. In cases where migration rates are comparable to or stronger than the strength of selection against deleterious alleles, that is, m ≥ t, we expect deleterious alleles to emigrate from local populations at an appreciable rate prior to their removal via selection. Under this regime of non-trivial migration rates, we expect the effects of background selection on FST to be significantly attenuated, as we expect greater similarity in reductions in πS and πT. We now highlight some limitations of our study and avenues for future work. Our study only looked at an island model. However, the effects of background selection on FST and πT remain unexplored for other population subdivision models, such as ‘isolation-by-distance’ models with varying dimensionality. We know that FST interacts with global Ne differently for non-island model demographics [27]. Additionally, the modulating effect of migration on the effect of background selection and FST remains unexplored in these other population subdivision models. Thus, we caution against the application of our model to more complex demographic scenarios. We also use various other simplifying assumptions, including fixed selection coefficients and a simple genomic architecture. We did not explore the effects of varying deleterious selection coefficients on B, but it is possible that the combination of both weakly and moderately deleterious alleles may result in more complex dynamics of background selection

Zeng and Corcoran [36] suggested that the effects of FST in an island model would be predictable from modifying the effective size of a subpopulation, Nlocal, by multiplying times B, the Ne/N ratio created by background selection. We show here that migration lessens the effects of background selection on the amount of genetic differentiation caused by local drift relative to predictions of B based on earlier work ( e. g. Ref [4] ). Then, we derive the expected FST in an island model with background selection and a finite number of demes, when migration follows genetic drift. In this section, we extend the quantitative genetic approach to modeling background selection, following the framework of Santiago and Caballero [24–26] and Buffalo and Kern [11], to account for how migration influences the effects of background selection, B, in an island model consisting of diploid individuals. In brief, these models consider how the additive genetic fitness variance experienced by a neutral allele due to its associations with deleterious alleles further increase its variance in reproductive success, therefore reducing its probability of fixation. We extend these models to account for the effects of migration on the cross-gener association between neutral and deleterious alleles in the reproductive success of a subpopulation. We show that migration acts to lessen the effects of background selection by truncating cross-gener associations between neutral and deleter alleles in the reproductive success of a subpopulation. We derive the expected FST in an island model with background and finite number of demes, when migration follows genetic drift. Our results show that migration lessens the effects of background selection on the amount of genetic differentiation caused by drift relative to predictions of B based on earlier work ( e. g. Ref [4 ]. We provide a mechanistic explanation for the previously observed lack of effect of background selection on F under high migration [37] and highlight parameter under which we expect background theory to be inaccurate. Our results suggest that the importance of migration in influencing B depends on the magnitude of the heterozygous selection coefficient, t, and the migration rate, m. In cases where t >> m, we expect the effect of migration to be weak, as selection will act to remove deleter variants prior their emigration from a population. Under relatively low migration, we expect predictions of background to be accurate without consideration of migration, given migration is infrequent. This is what has been previously observed. We modify our theory to be applied to a distribution of selection coefficients. However, this is addressed by the work of Santiago Cabero [26] which may be extended our model. We note that our model is restricted to the case of semi-dominance deleter mutations. Under low recombination with selective and recessive deleter mutations there is evidence that overdominance may act oppositely to background, leading to increased diversity [52–53]. We provide a theoretical derivation of the effects of background in an island model this accounts for the effects migration providing an opportunity to lessen the effects of selection by truncating crossener associations between neutral and deleter alleles in reproductive success and presents a step into application background theory in systems with complex demography. We test the accuracy under various parameters demonstrating it predicts FST across a wide range of and πT well when expect interference to be weak. We found that background can cause reductions in π despite effects on F. Under our sets this is most pronounced for low strengths against deleter alleles both low and high parameter and weakly influenced by introduction rates recombination. Previous has suggested selective is common larger populations reviewed [51] ; given Ne on order our simulations this likely. We investigated and found agrees predictions previous background derived for interference regime [23] ; this predicts greater reduction at lower strengths for increasing sizes. effects on π and are dependent migration which to given migration influences F directly through effects and that F the effective size metapulation [27 see Calculation F ] Under low rate we found π reduced marginally larger than ( cf to ) resulting elevation F However in high rate π and were similarly for all values Nt.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Increasing genetic and phenotypic data size is critical for understanding the genetic determinants of diseases. Evidently, establishing practical means for collaboration and data sharing among institutions is a fundamental methodological barrier for performing high-powered studies. As the sample sizes become more heterogeneous, complex statistical approaches, such as generalized linear mixed effects models, must be used to correct for the confounders that may bias results. On another front, due to the privacy concerns around Protected Health Information ( PHI ), genetic information is restrictively protected by sharing according to regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ). This limits data sharing among institutions and hampers efforts around executing high-powered collaborative studies. Federated approaches are promising to alleviate the issues around privacy and performance, since sensitive data never leaves the local sites. Motivated by these, we developed FedGMMAT, a federated genetic association testing tool that utilizes a federated statistical testing approach for efficient association tests that can correct for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects among different collaborating sites. Genetic data is never shared among collaborating sites, and the intermediate statistics are protected by encryption. Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate FedGMMAT can achieve the virtually same results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements. 

    Supporting Text:
    In this paper, we proposed a federated genetic association testing algorithm, FedGMMAT. FedGMMAT is flexible to integrate multiple subject-level random effects and can be used in different study designs without explicit changes to the algorithmic setup and formulations. This is an inherent advantage that stems from the flexible formulation of the efficient score testing of GMMAT. We also believe that the two-stage significance estimation is advantageous from a privacy preserving perspective because the overall problem is modularized in specific steps of null model fitting and variant scoring where covariates and genotype information is used in different stages. In the future, this can in turn enable a tiered privacy-enabling design for GWAS such that different information is protected at different levels as required by local regulations. It should be noted that there can be inherent challenges in federated studies. For instance, these studies must be designed and planned way ahead of time to collect harmonized and uniform data at independent sites with matching covariates and phenotypes. Due to these challenges, the sites may choose to perform meta-analyses by sharing only the summary statistics, which requires much less computational burden on the sites with low privacy concerns. However, previous studies have shown that meta-analysis may lose substantial power when there is heterogeneity among the sites. It is therefore important for sites to have the incentives to perform the federated analysis. Future work can improve several aspects of FedGMMAT. Currently, the null model information is sent in unprotected form among the sites. However, it should be noted that FedGMMAT’s null model contains very small number of parameters ( on the order to 10–20 ) and we foresee that it is unlikely that the global model parameters can lead to reliable membership or reconstruction attacks

. Finally, Zhu et al. [56] developed a federated generalized linear mixed model to tentatively perform federated GWAS analysis [56]. This method by Zhu et al. [56] is one of the first methods to perform federated generalized mixed effects testing. We have extensively tested this algorithm in our previous study ( dMEGA ) and found that it does not report p-values for the genetic variants; it only reports the effect size estimates. Furthermore it does not model the polygenic random effects stemming from cryptic relatedness effects. Finally we also observed that Zhu et al. ’s [56] method may exhibit poor convergence due to utilizing an MCMC-based approach. We discuss the privacy and security of FedGMMAT’s federated protocol by analyzing information exchanges to present the limitations that can warrant future research. Overall, FedGMMAT use homomorphic encryption and combine it with an OTP-like symmetric protection mechanism that uses site-specific noise addition to protect individual-level and intermediate information between sites and also from the central server. Sites must ensure that the symmetric keys ( the secret random seeds from the server ) are protected against leakage. Similarly, decryption key must be kept securely at the Central Server. Central Server is assumed to be a trusted entity that executes the protocols as agreed upon ( e. g., [57], [50] ), without the necessity of storing identifying information from the sites ( i. e., does not need to store registration and identity information ). Since Central Server is a trusted authority, the main concern regarding Central Server is the event of hacking or accidental leakage of the datasets from the server. We discuss these cases below. The central server gains access to, y ˜, a proxy for the binary phenotypes ( without other identifiers ), the kinship matrix, and the null model parameters

. Although these restrictions have been partially relieved by NIH in 2018 [25–28], open sharing of raw genotype-phenotype data is still not allowed. In parallel, sharing of data from underserved, historically isolated, and vulnerable populations ( Ashkenazi Jewish community, Havasupai Tribe ) is challenging since these populations are more vulnerable for stigmatization and further isolation [29–31]. Due to these concerns, the genetic and biomedical data analysis and research is even more challenging among these communities [32]. Further concerns are related to unauthorized usage of genetic data for solving cold cases [33], usage of genomic data for probing and potential risk of diverting genealogy databases [34]. With the increasing concerns about misusing genome data, regulations like Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) and General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) have been proposed and implemented to protect individual health records including genetic data [35]. The privacy concerns make it untenable to perform, high-powered and high-quality GWAS because these studies require very large sample sizes [36–38]. As a result, genome data repositories such as UK Biobank [3] often release data with strong restrictions on how data can be used with no possibilities of sharing. Besides the limited data accessibility, many more healthcare data are siloed and underutilized due to concerns around privacy. Some initiatives must be taken to connect these distributed data islands and fully use them while protecting privacy. Federated Learning ( FL ) is a method to bridge isolated data silos without sharing the actual data. Such a property can help comply with the local privacy regulations to provide means to perform collaborative GWAS across data silos

With the surge of genomic data generated by Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) [1–4], number of available genomes have surpassed millions. These data provides opportunities to map genetic factors underlying complex diseases and phenotype. Arguably, Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWAS ) are the most popular methods for uncovering the genetic determinants of phenotypic variation [5–7]. State of the art GWAS tools rely employ mixed modeling to assess the statistical significance between variant genotypes and phenotypes while accounting for the biases in ancestry and cryptic relatedness [8–11]. Among these methods, linear mixed models ( LMMs ) have been popularly used for analyzing continuous traits, their intrinsic assumptions ( uniform distribution of residuals with respect to variant allele frequency ) may bias analyses of the binary traits. For these cases, generalized linear mixed models have been shown to provide unbiased results [12]. Although statistical modeling has advanced in recent years, the real utility of data can be only realized when large sample sizes and more diverse populations are available to identify salient genetic variants. However, it is challenging to build centralized repositories of large datasets mainly due to privacy concerns and data usage agreements [13]. Numerous studies demonstrated that genetic data is very identifying of its owner and their families [14–20]. Due to very high dimensional nature of genomic data ( i. e., very large number of variants ), sharing even summary statistics, and other related intermediate data, or simply the existence of variants ( e. g., beacons [21–23] ) can create risks of membership inference [24], i. e., whether an individual with known genotypes participated a study. These studies have led to an increased public proclivity against sharing genomic data, related intermediate statistics, and an increased protection of GWAS datasets

. Although some related research has been proposed to provide secure GWAS, most of them focus on adopting federated methods in χ2 statistics test [37, 39], Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) [40–42], and linear/logistic regression tests [39, 41]. Among these approaches, there is currently a lack of focus on correcting the confounding by random polygenic effects while performing association testing, mainly due to computational complexity. The polygenic effects stem mainly from clustering or correlations between the input subjects. The most well-known case scenario is the existence of known and unknown family members in the case or control cohorts. Since family members share DNA segments among each other, the participation of related individuals into GWAS may shift the allele frequencies and create a confounding bias resulting in false positive signals. In addition, these members are expected to have correlated phenotypes when the studied phenotypes are highly polygenic. It has been shown in previous studies that the [43, 44] that unknown or cryptic relatedness may cause noticeable biases and must be corrected in GWAS. The most popular approach for correcting the confounding by kinship is to introduce an additive polygenic term that is distributed as a zero-mean multivariate Gaussian whose covariance matrix is proportional to the genetic relatedness matrix ( or kinship matrix ) among the subjects. However, this approach is computationally expensive due to the large number of parameters to be estimated, especially when the number of subjects is large. In this paper, we propose FedMM, a federated genetic testing algorithm that corrects for the confounding by polygenic effects using a federated testing approach. FedMM is flexible to integrate multiple-level effects and can be used in different study designs without changes to the algorithmic setup and formulations. This is an advantage that stems from the formulation of efficient testing GAT. We believe that two-stage estimation is advantageous from a privacy perspective because the problem is modularized in steps of model fitting and scoring where covariates and genotype are used in different stages. In future, this can enable tiered privacy design for GW such that information is protected at different levels as required by local regulations. It should be noted that there are challenges in federated studies. For instance, these must be designed and planned ahead of time to collect harmonize and uniform data at sites with matching covariates and phenotypes. Due these, sites may choose to perform meta-analysis by sharing only statistics, which requires less burden on sites with privacy. However, studies have shown that meta-analysis may lose power when heterogeneity among sites. It is important for sites to have incentives to perform federated. Future can improve several of FedMM. Currently, null information is sent unprotected among sites. However, it is that FedMM’s null contains small number parameters ( order 10–20 ) and foresee that is unlikely global parameters lead to reliable or membership attacks. Finally, Zhu et al [56] developed feder generalized mixed model to perform federated analysis [56]. This method Zhu et [56] is first to perform mixed testing. We extensively tested algorithm in previous (ME ) and found that does not report p-values for variants ; only estimates. it does not model polygenic effects from crypt related effects. also that Zhu [56] may exhibit poor convergence MCM-based.

The final answer is: 

This paper proposes a federated genetic testing algorithm, FedMM, which integrates multiple-level effects and can be used in different study designs without changes to the algorithm setup and formulations. This is an advantage from the formulation of efficient testing GAT. The two-stage estimation is advantageous from a privacy perspective because the problem is modularized in steps of model fitting and scoring where covari and genotype are used different. This enables tiered privacy design for GW that information is protected at levels required by local. However, there are challenges in federated studies, such as designing and planning ahead to collect harmonize data at sites with covari and phen
Researchers have developed polygenic risk scores (PRS) to predict disease risk, including prostate cancer, by combining multiple genetic variants into a single score. However, these models have not been formally assessed for their performance in prostate cancer, particularly in diverse populations. This study benchmarks six widely used PRS algorithms, four of which adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biob and All of Us cohorts. The results show modest improvement in discriminatory ability compared to a simple method prioritizing variants, clumping, and polygenic scores. The findings highlight the importance of improving risk algorithms and sampling diverse cohorts. The study employed ancestry correction using linkage disequilibrium maps from a large publicly available source, suggesting that sample sizes may be inadequate and finer mapping is required. Inclusion of local haplotype models may improve predictive power, especially for admixed individuals. PRSx explains the most variance in logistic models but does not outperform other methods in classification on held-out data. Alternative metrics such as AUROC produce different rankings of polygenic scores. The study used 98,560 and 165,080 individuals, with 1,458 cases and 27,246 controls, with genotype data. Prior to scoring, genetic scores were lifted from hg19 to hg38 and GWAS statistics adjusted for accurate polygenic score calculation. Two methods, clumping and PRs, were applied to four sets of summary statistics. Clumping selects variants with lowest P-value in linkage disequilibrium and PRs shrinks variants to replicate genome results. The study evaluated performance of published polygenic scores in the UKob cohort and trained models using GWAS data from the EIP Prostate Cancer Meta-Analysis and UKob cohorts. Fine mapping identified an association between rs637 and prostate susceptibility. The study hypothesized that adjusting cross-population linkage disequilibrium may improve prediction in African men. Employing cl, PRs, PRsx, IMP, Poly, and XP, generated 206 scores for populations. Hierarchical clustering revealed population-specific clustering, suggesting methods may not adequately adjust ancestry. Logistic models evaluated with Nagelke pseudo-R2 showed scores for EUR explained most variance. A relative metric identified ancestry-adjusted scoring, dividing R2 by clumping R, revealed PRsx explained variance in AFR and ASN.

    Title: 
    Abstract: DPAGT1-CDG is a Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation ( CDG ) that lacks effective therapies. It is caused by mutations in the gene DPAGT1 which encodes the first enzyme in N-linked glycosylation. We used a Drosophila rough eye model of DPAGT1-CDG with an improperly developed, small eye phenotype. We performed a drug repurposing screen on this model using 1, 520 small molecules that are 98% FDA/EMA-approved to find drugs that improved its eye. We identified 42 candidate drugs that improved the DPAGT1-CDG model. Notably from this screen, we found that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor partially rescued the DPAGT1-CDG model. Loss of both dopamine synthesis and recycling partially rescued the model, suggesting that dopaminergic flux and subsequent binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DPAGT1 deficiency. This links dopamine signaling to N-glycosylation and represents a new potential therapeutic target for treating DPAGT1-CDG. We also genetically validate other top drug categories including acetylcholine-related drugs, COX inhibitors, and an inhibitor of NKCC1. These drugs and subsequent analyses reveal novel biology in DPAGT1 mechanisms, and they may represent new therapeutic options for DPAGT1-CDG.

    Here, we identify multiple drugs that improve a Drosophila model of DPAGT1 deficiency. Overall, 8/21 ( 38% ) drugs tested from the primary screen validated in further dose-response analysis. In addition, 6/16 ( 38% ) drugs derived from the primary screen improved the DPAGT1 model. Almost all tested drugs were genetically validated by manipulating their target genes in Drosophila. We found that drug classes involving acetylcholine signaling, dopamine ( DA ) synthesis, histamine receptors, NKCC1/2, and cyclooxygenase inhibition might be good candidates for treating DPAGT1-CDG ( Fig 8 ). One of the enriched classes was acetylcholine ( ACh ) -related drugs. Identifying this drug class provides strong validation of our fly model and drug screen, as this class is already used by both DPAGT1-CDG and -CMS patients [17, 18, 42]. In addition, multiple AChE inhibitors currently taken by patients improved the DPAGT1 model. This suggests that our CDG fly model is a reasonable representation of the disorder, and that these models are valuable tools for identifying potential therapeutics. We found that genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting acetylcholine breakdown is beneficial under DPAGT1 impairment. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are taken to improve muscle function in DPAGT1 patients by increasing acetylcholine signaling at neuromuscular junctions ( NMJs ) [81]. However, in Drosophila, glutamate is the excitatory neurotransmitter in NMJs [82], and the fly eye is likely not impacted by NMJ signaling regardless. Outside of NMJs, acetylcholine can also bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to mediate DA release in flies [83] and mammals [84, 85]. Given that increased DA appears negative for the model, it is possible that the benefit of increased acetylcholine signaling counteracts any negative consequences of increased DA release

. Given this, we focused on DA signaling by genetically reducing the expression of their shared target Dop2R ( human: D2R ) in the DPAGT1 model. Dop2R is the only Drosophila ortholog of human genes D2R, D3R, and D4R. These encode for "D2-like" G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) that inhibit the adenylate cyclase/cAMP signaling pathway [44, 45] ( Fig 3A ). Matching the pharmacological data from the primary screen, reduced expression of Dop2R using RNAi resulted in a strong improvement of eye size across all RNAi lines and replicates tested ( Fig 3D and 3E and S3 Table ), compared to other tested drug and RNAi treatments. In addition, their eyes showed strong qualitative improvement as they had fewer "glassy" eye sections ( Fig 3E ). We also crossed a heterozygous Dop2R null allele [52] into the DPAGT1 model ( note that Dop2R is X-linked and only females are analyzed here ). Mimicking the RNAi, DPAGT1 model flies carrying a heterozygous null Dop2R mutation also resulted in improved eye size ( Fig 3F ). This indicates that this improvement is not due to any indirect UAS-GAL4 [33] effects. Finally, overexpressing Dop2R [52] in the DPAGT1 model decreased eye size ( Fig 3G ), confirming what is expected given the knockdown and null result. Genetically manipulating Dop2R had little effect on its own, with only two cases changing eye size: an increase in Dop2R OE females, and a minor decrease in Dop2R hemizygous null males ( S3 Table ). Overall, this indicates that reduction of D2 receptor signaling improves the DPAGT1 model. After release into the synaptic cleft, DA can bind to several receptors in the fly. This includes the Dop2R receptor as well as the Dop1R1, Dop1R2, and DopEcR receptors [44, 45]. Dop1R1 and Dop1R2 are orthologs of the human D1R and D5R genes. These encode "D1-like" GPCRs that activate the adenylate cyclase/cAMP signaling pathway [44, 45] ( opposite of "D2-like" receptors )

To model DPAGT1-CDG, we used an eye-based Drosophila model that we previously established [28]. The Drosophila eye is regularly used to study and model biological processes, including development [29–32]. In our model, DPAGT1 expression is reduced in the eye by RNA interference ( RNAi, UAS-GAL4 system [33], eya composite-GAL4 driver [34] ). Analysis of whole fly heads of the DPAGT1 model resulted in a ~65% knockdown of DPAGT1 expression ( S1A Fig ). The compound eye makes up a large portion of the Drosophila head, but this knockdown is likely even lower because our RNAi is eye-specific. In vitro analysis of DPAGT1-CDG patient proteins found they had 10–50% protein activity [35]. Thus, having at most ~35% of normal DPAGT1 expression is a reasonable amount of knockdown to model DPAGT1 deficiency. This knockdown results in a small, improperly developed, rough eye phenotype ( hereafter referred to as “DPAGT1 model” ) [28] ( Fig 1 ). To validate this small eye phenotype, we also created a second model using a different RNAi line ( BDSC 51869 ) driven by eya composite-GAL4. This model has a small, rough eye phenotype comparable to our original model ( S1B Fig ). The DPAGT1 model can be chemically or genetically manipulated to make the eye larger ( suppress the phenotype ) or smaller ( enhance the phenotype ) [28]. To find potential therapeutics, we used the Prestwick Chemical Library, a collection of 1, 520 compounds that are 98% FDA- or EMA-approved. We raised DPAGT1 model flies on food containing each drug and measured the eye size of resulting progeny ( Fig 1A ). We used a 5 μM drug concentration—a standard dosage for flies that does not cause toxicity [25]. We scored 8, 076 flies in total in the screen ( 4. 4 average flies per treatment ), and we calculated the Z-score of each compound by comparing their eye sizes to DMSO-treated DPAGT1 model control flies

. For treating seizures, antiepileptic drugs have also been prescribed for DPAGT1-CDG and other CDGs [20]. However, both of these treatments are palliative, and there remains a great need for better therapeutics for the multisystemic symptoms in DPAGT1-CDG. Drosophila share ~75% of human disease-causing genes [21] and have been regularly used in drug screens [22–24]. Drug repurposing screens in Drosophila have had previous success in identifying new potential therapies for CDGs. For example, our laboratory identified GSK3β inhibitors as a potential treatment for NGLY1 deficiency [25]. In addition, a drug repurposing screen in C. elegans identified the aldose reductase inhibitor epalrestat for treating PMM2-CDG [26, 27]. Thus, a drug repurposing screen in Drosophila for DPAGT1-CDG could help find new potential therapeutics for this disorder. In this study, we performed a drug repurposing screen on a Drosophila model of DPAGT1-CDG to identify new therapeutics and biological interactions with DPAGT1. We identified 42 compounds that suppress the DPAG1 model, and found that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the D2 receptor partially rescues the DP1 model. Loss of dopamine recycling also partially rescues the model, suggesting that dopaminergic flux and binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DP1 deficiency. This links dopamine signaling to glycosylation and represents a new therapeutic target for DP1CDG. We also genetically validated other drug categories including acetylcholine drugs, CO inhibitors, and NK1. These and analyses reveal novel biology in DP1 mechanisms and may represent new options for DP1CD.
Researchers developed a topographic variational autoencoder (topo-VA) model to investigate the neural representation of proprioception in the somatosensory cortex. Proprioception is one of the least understood senses, yet fundamental for movement control, and basic questions about limb representation in the somatosensory cortex are unclear. The model was trained on natural human movement data, not neural data, and reproduced two observations from monkey center-out reaching: 1) shape and velocity of proprioceptive fields in hand-centered coordinates, despite no knowledge of arm or hand systems, and 2) distribution of neuronal directions (PDs) from multi-electrode arrays. The model makes predictions: 1) encoding across cortex has a blob-pinwheel geometry of PDs, 2) few neurons encode a single joint. The model provides a principled understanding of sensorimotor representations and theoretical basis for neural manifolds, with applications to restoration of feedback in brain-computer interfaces and control of robots. 

The researchers combined proprioceptive stimuli with a model of neural and topographical organization of neurons in somensory cortex to develop understanding of proprioception. The topo-VA is designed to reflect information processing in cortex, hypothesizing the cortex learns efficient representation of somensory through experience, replicating as a deep network. The learns a nonlinear mapping from kinematic inputs to cortical latent space, embodying a stochastic generative model of movement-related activity. The model was trained and validated on natural human arm kinematics and emergent proprio representations in its layer, then used to generate neural responses with kinematic data from center-out task. The properties of simulated activities were compared to S1 neurons recorded from monkeys, characterizing proprio representations at two levels: spatial curves of neurons and organization of maps across cortex.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Ethylene is a plant hormone involved in many aspects of plant growth and development as well as responses to stress. The role of ethylene in plant-microbe interactions has been explored from the perspective of plants. However, only a small number of studies have examined the role of ethylene in microbes. We demonstrated that Azospirillum brasilense contains a functional ethylene receptor that we call Azospirillum Ethylene Response1 ( AzoEtr1 ) after the nomenclature used in plants. AzoEtr1 directly binds ethylene with high affinity. Treating cells with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and colonization of plant root surfaces. Additionally, RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics showed that ethylene causes wide-spread metabolic changes that affect carbon and nitrogen metabolism. One result is the accumulation of poly-hydroxybutyrate. Our data suggests a model in which ethylene from host plants alters the density of colonization by A. brasilense and re-wires its metabolism, suggesting that the bacterium implements an adaptation program upon sensing ethylene. These data provide potential new targets to regulate beneficial plant-microbe interactions.

   . This suggests that ethylene may be perceived by these bacteria to mediate their interactions with plant hosts. Most published studies examining the role of ethylene in plant-microbe associations have focused on microbe-induced changes in ethylene levels or signaling in plants [16, 42–44]. Direct evidence for saturable ethylene binding to a specific receptor in microbes affecting physiology has only been obtained in Synechocystis and the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis [32, 45]. A plant-associated bacterium, Azospirillum brasilense, contains a gene encoding a putative ethylene receptor [32]. We call this gene Azospirillum ethylene response1 ( Azoetr1 ) following the nomenclature used in plants. Bacteria of the genus Azospirillum are ubiquitous motile soil diazotrophic bacteria capable of colonizing the roots of a wide range of plants where they live as commensals [46]. A. brasilense Sp7 colonizes root surfaces and is used agriculturally to boost crop production [46]. While the plant growth-promoting effects of A. brasilense have been described in most detail in cereals, the beneficial association of A. brasilense with plants is not restricted to cereals since they have been reported in many plant species across botanical families [46] including Solanum lycopersicum ( tomato ) and Arabidopsis thaliana [47, 48]. Inoculation of plants with A. brasilense alters the expression of genes in the plant related to ethylene biosynthesis and signaling [47, 49–51]. However, nothing is known about the responses of A. brasilense to ethylene and the role of the putative ethylene receptor protein. This prompted us to examine the biological role of ethylene as a signal in this species and study how ethylene perception by the bacterium affects various traits including root colonization. Our research demonstrated that AzoEtr1 is a functional ethylene receptor that affects carbon and nitrogen metabolism

Plants respond to environmental challenges by recruiting different subpopulations of beneficial, non-symbiotic bacteria in the rhizosphere, but little is known about how this selection occurs [4, 83]. The observation that plants can select some of their rhizospheric bacterial partners implies an exchange of molecular signals to select the most beneficial microorganisms from a diverse pool of candidates in the rhizosphere. Ethylene levels in the soil can reach sufficiently high concentrations to elicit responses in plants and it is clear that bacteria modulate ethylene responses in plants [21, 44]. This coupled with the presence of an ethylene receptor in A. brasilense led us to hypothesize that root-derived ethylene affects the recruitment of specific rhizosphere bacteria to the root surface. Although ethylene receptors and signal transduction have been well-studied in plants, they have not been extensively studied in non-plant species [24, 25, 27]. Here, we show that AzoEtr1 directly binds ethylene and the application of ethylene regulates A. brasilense physiology including reducing biofilm formation and root colonization. Additionally, the application of ethylene causes wide-spread changes in metabolism that appear to upregulate carbon metabolism and downregulate nitrogen metabolism. Nitrogen metabolism and nutrient availability, including the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, regulate cell-to-cell aggregation, root attachment, and biofilm formation in A. brasilense [84–87]. These data indicate that the perception of ethylene by soil and rhizosphere bacteria, such as A. brasilense, regulates root colonization. Plants contain multiple ethylene receptor isoforms and deleting ethylene receptors causes constitutive ethylene responses with the severity increasing depending on the number of isoforms removed [88, 89]

. Given that cyclic di-GMP affects both biofilm formation and metabolism [66, 67], ethylene may also be affecting the cells by modulating the levels of this second messenger. At this point, the signaling pathway linking AzoEtr1 to these responses is unknown and it is unclear which of these or combination of these changes are central to responses to ethylene. Characterizing the signal transduction target ( s ) of AzoEtr1 should help decipher among these possibilities. The advantages of perceiving ethylene in the rhizosphere are not yet clear. Unlike plants and some bacteria, our results indicated that A. brasilense Sp7 cannot biosynthesize ethylene under the conditions tested. This does not rule out that there are certain conditions where A. brasilense biosynthesizes ethylene. But, if true that A. brasilense does not biosynthesize ethylene, then ethylene must be encountered from external sources. Ethylene levels in the soil are influenced by various factors, including compaction and water saturation and can range from trace amounts to above 10 ppm, which is well above the levels needed to elicit biological responses in plants [20–23]. Our results suggest several possible ecophysiological roles for ethylene in A. brasilense. One major source of ethylene in the soil are plant roots, raising the possibility that plant-derived ethylene regulates root colonization by A. brasilense. In this role it might be regulating the timing, spatial distribution, or both of colonization of the root surface. Ethylene does not seem to cause cells to leave a biofilm, but can prevent additional cells from becoming part of a biofilm. Colonization of plant roots can lead to increased ethylene biosynthesis by the plant [16, 43, 107]. Thus, another role of plant-derived ethylene may be to act as a cue for A. brasilense to return to a motile life-style, perhaps to avoid competition by other bacteria on the root surface

. Our data suggest a model in which ethylene from host plants affects the pattern and density of colonization by A. brasilense. Because other plant-associated bacteria are predicted to contain ethylene receptors [27, 32, 41], this could represent a mechanism applicable to other bacteria.

. There are multiple sources of ethylene in the soil, including biotic biosynthesis by plants, bacteria, and fungi, as well as abiotic sources such as photochemical production triggered when sunlight is absorbed by dissolved organics [20, 21]. Almost all research on ethylene as a signaling molecule has focused on its role as a plant hormone and the signal transduction pathway by which it is perceived by plants [24–26]. However, responses to ethylene are not limited to plants, and have been reported in bacteria, fungi, slime molds, marine sponges, and even human cell lines [27]. Plants are believed to have gained ethylene receptors and other two-component like receptors from the cyanobacterium that is the ancestor of the chloroplast [28–30]. In support of this, many cyanobacteria contain genes that encode proteins predicted to have an ethylene-binding domain and show saturable ethylene binding [29, 31, 32]. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis has shown that plant ethylene receptors cluster with cyanobacterial proteins predicted to have ethylene-binding domains [33]. One such cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 ( hereafter referred to as Synechocystis ), contains a bifunctional receptor called Synechocystis ethylene response1 ( SynEtr1 ) for both ethylene and light with a signaling pathway that includes a down-stream response regulator protein and a small non-coding RNA [32, 34, 35]. Unlike in plants, signaling from SynEtr1 relies on histidine kinase activity and phosphorelay to a response regulator protein [32, 36]. In this species, ethylene causes various molecular and physiological changes including changes in the cell surface leading to increased biofilm formation and phototaxis [32, 37–40]. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that putative ethylene receptors are found in other bacterial phyla, including many non-pathogenic proteobacteria that associate with plants [27, 32, 41]

    Title: 
    Abstract: The INO80 protein is the main catalytic subunit of the INO80-chromatin remodeling complex, which is critical for DNA repair and transcription regulation in murine spermatocytes. In this study, we explored the role of INO80 in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. INO80 immunolocalization at the XY body in pachytene spermatocytes suggested a role for INO80 in the meiotic sex body. Subsequent deletion of Ino80 resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes. Furthermore, the active form of RNA polymerase II at the sex chromosomes of Ino80-null pachytene spermatocytes indicates incomplete inactivation of sex-linked genes. A reduction in the recruitment of initiators of meiotic sex chromosome inhibition ( MSCI ) argues for INO80-facilitated recruitment of DNA repair factors required for silencing sex-linked genes. This role of INO80 is independent of a common INO80 target, H2A. Z. Instead, in the absence of INO80, a reduction in chromatin accessibility at DNA repair sites occurs on the sex chromosomes. These data suggest a role for INO80 in DNA repair factor localization, thereby facilitating the silencing of sex-linked genes during the onset of pachynema.

    In this study, we demonstrated a unique role for INO80 in silencing sex-linked genes during pachynema in spermatocytes. INO80 regulates chromatin accessibility at DSB regions of the sex chromosomes. This regulation is independent of the histone variant H2A. Z, a major INO80 effector. We also demonstrated that INO80 interacts with DSBR factors ATR and MDC1, facilitating MDC1 recruitment at the sex chromosomes during pachynema. An earlier report showed that male germ cell-specific deletion of Ino80 results in a meiotic arrest phenotype in 8-week-old murine testes. A significant population of pachytene spermatocytes display defects in synapsis and DNA damage response, leading to the loss of spermatocytes in adult testes [18]. However, during the first wave of spermatogenesis in juvenile mice, no significant cell death was observed in Ino80cKO testis up to P21. Moreover, unaltered gene expression signatures for zygonema and pachynema stages in Ino80cKO spermatocytes at P18, derived from RNAseq data comparing Ino80WT and Ino80cKo spermatocytes, suggest their relative proportions remain similar, except for a reduced transition from pachynema to diplonema in the absence of INO80 [31]. Utilizing this small window of time, we observed a lack of downregulation of sex-linked differentially expressed genes in Ino80cKO spermatocytes, which was also replicated by comparing homogeneous pachynema populations upon synchronization of spermatogenesis. We also validated this overall aberrant sex-linked transcription program in individual Ino80cKO pachytene spermatocytes by immunolocalizing active RNA polymerase II at the sex chromosomes. This corroborates the observation of an incomplete MSCI in pachytene Ino80cKO spermatocytes. Several other studies also reported similar characteristics that described roles for MSCI-regulating factors [6, 38–40]

. Several studies have described a regulatory role for INO80 in DNA damage response in somatic cells and meiosis [18, 41, 42]. The INO80 chromatin remodeling complex interacts with DNA damage factors such as γH2A. X and MEC1 ( ATR ) at DSB repair sites in yeast [43, 44]. We also found that INO80 interacts with DNA repair factors ATR and MDC1 in meiotic spermatocytes. γH2A. X recruitment at DSB sites during zygonema remained intact in Ino80cKO spermatocytes [18]. We propose that the initial deposition of γH2A. X at the synapse axis of sex chromosomes initiates INO80-facilitated recruitment of MDC1. This recruitment amplifies γH2A. X in chromatin loops in an INO80-facilitated ATR-dependent fashion. INO80 is known to regulate transcription in several cell types. It facilitates the recruitment of RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) and its cofactors to the promoters of pluripotency network genes. This recruitment regulates embryonic stem cell pluripotency and reprogramming [26, 27]. It can also regulate gene expression by facilitating histone modifications and the exchange of histone variants such as H2A. Z in different cell types [22, 23, 31, 45]. INO80 also regulates somatic gene silencing at the autosomes in spermatocytes by promoting H3K27me3 modification at promoters, while H3K4me3 remains unaffected [31]. However, INO80-dependent silencing of sex-linked genes in meiotic spermatocytes is independent of INO80-mediated direct transcriptional regulation by enabling DNA binding factor recruitment at the promoter-proximal areas. We showed that INO80 regulates sex chromosome accessibility during meiotic progression. Chromatin accessibility is a central regulator of DNA damage repair response. Less accessible DNA hinders successful and efficient DNA repair [46, 47]. Chromatin accessibility is also essential in transcription factor recruitment and efficient transcription regulation at the promoter-proximal areas [48]

Immunofluorescence localization of INO80 in pachytene spermatocytes revealed staining on the sex chromosomes ( Fig 1A and 1B ). Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) for INO80 ( GEO Dataset GSE179584 ) [31] also showed binding on the sex chromosomes ( Fig 1C ). INO80 binding occurred at the zygotene and pachytene stages ( GEO Dataset GSE190590 ) [32] on both autosomes and sex chromosomes. INO80 localization on the sex chromosomes is more enriched at the postnatal day 18 ( P18 ) pachytene stage ( Fig 1C ). Additionally, INO80 binding sites on sex chromosomes were present at the DSB sites identified by the meiotic DSB marker γH2A. X ( GEO dataset GSE75221 ) [33] ( S1A Fig ). These binding sites include promoters, intergenic regions, and gene bodies ( S1A Fig ). Moreover, INO80 and γH2A. X binding in the sex chromosomes were correlated ( S1B Fig ), where INO80 binding is enriched at the γH2A. X binding sites ( S1C Fig ). These data suggested a possible role of INO80 in DSB repair and silencing the expression of genes on the sex chromosomes. RNAseq analysis of changes in P18 transcription from autosomes in wild type ( Ino80WT ) and germ cell-specific Ino80-null ( Ino80cKO ) spermatocytes ( GEO Dataset GSE179584 ) [31] revealed up-and down-regulated genes ( padj< 0. 05 ). However, the mean changes in expression remained close to zero ( Fig 2A ). In contrast, the differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) ( padj< 0. 05 ) from the X- and Y- chromosomes remained upregulated in Ino80cKO cells ( Fig 2A ). When plotted along the length of three representative autosomes and the sex chromosomes, like autosomal genes, DEGs from sex chromosomes occur along the length of the chromosomes ( Fig 2B ). These data confirm that the lack of silencing of sex-linked genes is neither limited to a specific region such as the pseudo-autosomal region and not due to any positional effect

. In addition, a moderate reduction in the overall γH2A. X signal at the sex chromosomes occurred in Ino80cKO spermatocytes, suggesting a perturbed amplification of γH2A. X ( Fig 6J ). INO80 is capable of histone exchange, most notably removing H2A. Z from chromatin [23, 24]. To determine how INO80 changes chromatin dynamics on the sex chromosomes and whether its regulation of sex-linked genes is H2A. Z-dependent, we compared H2A. Z occupancy ( GEO Dataset GSE179584 ) [31] at sex-linked gene promoters in P18 Ino80cKO and Ino80WT spermatocytes. There was little change in H2A. Z levels at the promoter and transcriptional start sites ( TSS ) and INO80 binding sites on the sex chromosomes ( S5A and S5B Fig ). These results suggest that H2A. Z does not mediate the sex-linked gene regulation by INO80. We also examined the occupancy of activating histone modification H3K4me3 and suppressive histone modification H3K27me3 at the sex-linked promoters. Neither showed any change ( S5C and S5D Fig ) and did not mediate INO80-dependent gene regulation in the sex body. Chromatin accessibility can be another regulator of DNA-interacting protein binding at the chromatin. A global change in chromatin accessibility occurs in developing spermatocytes during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition [49, 50]. To determine whether IN80 regulates chromatin accessibility on the sex chromosomes, we used ATAC-seq ( Assay for transposome accessibility ) [51] on In80KO and In80WT spermatocytes. ATAC-seq showed a significant reduction in chromatin accessibility on the sex chromosomes in In80KO spermatocytes ( Fig 7A and 7B ). ATACq also showed that IN80 regulates chromatin on autosomes ( Fig 7C and 7D ). AT-seq also showed that IN80 regulates chromatin on autos and sex chromosomes ( Fig 7E and 7 ) AT-seq also showed that IN80 regulates chromatin on autos and sex ( Fig 7 and 7 ) AT-se also showed IN80 regulates chromatin on autos and sex ( Fig 7 and 7 ) AT-se showed IN80 regulates chromatin autos and sex ( Fig 7 and 7 ) AT-se showed IN80 chromatin on autos and sex ( Fig 7 and 7 ) AT-se showed IN80 chrom on autos and sex ( Fig 7 and 7 ) AT-se showed IN80 chrom on autos ( Fig 7 and 7 ) AT-se showed IN80 on autos ( Fig 7 and 7 ) AT-se IN80 on autos ( Fig 7 and 7 ) AT-se IN80 on ( Fig 7 and 7 ) AT-se IN80 ( Fig 7 and 7 ) AT-se IN80 ( Fig 7 and 7 ) AT-se IN80 ( 7 and 7 ) AT-se IN80 ( 7 and 7 ) AT-se IN80 7 ( and 7 ) AT-se IN80 7 ( and 7 ) AT-se IN7 7 ( and 7 ) AT7-se IN7 ( and 7 ) AT7-se IN7 ( and 7 )7 AT7-se7 ( and 7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 and )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT7-se7 (7 )7 AT

    Title: 
    Abstract: The pathway for axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans is activated by SVH-1, a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasminogen family. SVH-1 is a dual-function factor that acts as an HGF-like growth factor to promote axon regeneration and as a protease to regulate early development. It is important to understand how SVH-1 is converted from a protease to a growth factor for axon regeneration. In this study, we demonstrate that cytidine deaminase ( CDD ) SVH-17/CDD-2 plays a role in the functional conversion of SVH-1. We find that the codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp–His–Ser catalytic triad of SVH-1 can suppress the cdd-2 defect in axon regeneration. Furthermore, the stem hairpin structure around the His-755 site in svh-1 mRNA is required for the activation of axon regeneration by SVH-1. These results suggest that CDD-2 promotes axon regeneration by transforming the function of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor through modification of svh-1 mRNA.

   . However, in contrast to this scenario, the protease-active and growth factor-active isoforms of SVH-1 act in the same cell ( ADL neuron ) to regulate larval development during the L1 stage and axon regeneration during the L4–adult stages, respectively [5, 10]. Therefore, CDD-2-mediated inactivation of the SVH-1 protease activity should not occur during the L1 stage; cdd-2 is only expressed at a later, distinct developmental stage. Thus, cdd-2 expression at a specific developmental stage is essential for the functional conversion of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor during axon regeneration. Forced cdd-2 expression at the L1 stage does not lead to the editing of svh-1 mRNA, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of CDD-2 may be activated by axon injury. The cytidine editing site in ApoB mRNA is located within a stem-loop secondary structure [21], which is important for RNA recognition by editing factors [22]. Similarly, in svh-1 mRNA, the His-755 encoding CAU codon is within a stem-loop secondary structure. Our genetic analysis suggests that the stem-loop structure of svh-1 mRNA is required for SVH-1 function in axon regeneration. We propose that this secondary structural component of svh-1 mRNA is recognized by CDD-2. APOBEC-1 has general AU-binding activity [22], and CDD-2 also possesses RNA-binding activity with an affinity for AU-rich RNA templates [14]. However, no biochemical evidence exists that CDD-2 catalyzes the editing of svh-1 mRNA in animals. If CDD-2 activity is activated by axon injury, detecting svh-1 mRNA-editing within animals would be more difficult. In this scenario, axon injury to D-type motor neurons should induce CDD-2-dependent svh-1 mRNA-editing. Nevertheless, both svh-1 and cdd-2 are expressed and function in ADL neurons, which are spatially distant from D-type neurons. Consequently, the question remains as to how SVH-1 in ADL neurons is transported to D neurons

. In contrast, plasminogen possesses an intact catalytic triad and functions as a protease. Protease activity is essential for plasminogen to remodel components of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ( Fig 1A; [12] ). Thus, amino acids in the catalytic triad determine whether the protein functions as a protease or growth factor. SVH-1, similar to plasminogen, has an intact catalytic triad. However, its protease activity is not required for SVH-1 to activate SVH-2, as with c-Met-mediated HGF signaling [5]. Furthermore, SVH-1 regulates larval growth in a protease activity-dependent manner, independent of SVH-2 [10]. The svh-1 gene is the only C. elegans gene encoding a protein of the HGF/plasminogen family. Therefore, SVH-1 has a dual-function: it acts as an HGF-like growth factor to promote axon regeneration and as a plasminogen-like protease required for larval development ( Fig 1A; [10] ). However, it is unclear how SVH-1 can function as a growth factor despite having an intact catalytic triad. Therefore, there must be a switch mechanism that converts SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor to function in axon regeneration ( Fig 1B ). Here, we attempted to identify the factor in regulating the functional conversion of SVH-1 during axon regeneration. We have genetically identified several genes ( svh ) involved in the JNK signaling pathway that regulates axon regeneration [5], including the svh-17/cdd-2 gene encoding cytidine deaminase ( CDD ). In this study, we investigated the relationship between cdd-2 and svh-1 in the regulation of axon regeneration, and show that CDD-2 is required for axon regeneration by converting SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor.

. The introduction of the Pcdd-2::cdd-2 ( genomic DNA ) transgene as an extrachromosomal array significantly rescued the defect associated with the cdd-2 ( km70 ) mutation ( Fig 2C and S1 Table ). Another cdd gene, cdd-1, is present in C. elegans ( Fig 2A; [14] ). However, in cdd-1 ( ok390 ) mutants ( S1B Fig ), axons regenerated normally after axon injury ( Fig 2C and S1 Table ), suggesting that CDD-2 plays a specific role in axon regeneration after laser axotomy. Since our RNAi screen for svh genes was originally designed to identify components that function in the JNK pathway [5], we investigated where CDD-2 functions in this pathway. Previously, we have demonstrated that SVH-2 c-Met-like RTK, which is activated by the SVH-1 HGF-like growth factor, mediates the activation of the JNK cascade in axon regeneration ( Fig 3A; [5] ). We examined the relationship between CDD-2 and the SVH-1–SVH-2 signaling pathway. We found that svh-2 overexpression in D-type motor neurons under the unc-25 promoter suppressed the regeneration defect in cdd-2 ( km70 ) mutants, whereas svh-1 overexpression under the control of the ADL neuronal promoter srh-220 failed to suppress the cdd-2 defect ( Fig 3B and S1 Table ). These results suggest that CDD-2 functions downstream of SVH-1 and upstream of SVH-2 in axon regeneration. The cdd-2 ( km70 ) defect was not rescued by cdd-2 ( cDNA ) expression in D-type motor neurons using the unc-25 promoter ( Figs 3C and S3A, and S1 Table ), suggesting that CDD-2 does not function in injured D-type neurons. Since svh-1 is expressed in ADL neurons [5], we examined whether CDD-2 functions in ADL neurons. We found that cdd-2 ( cDNA ) expression under the srh-220 promoter in ADL neurons was able to rescue the cdd-2 ( km70 ) defect in axon regeneration ( Figs 3C and S3A, and S1 Table )

. As observed previously [5], WT svh-1 expression from the srh-220 promoter in svh-1 ( ok2531 ) ; kmDp1/+ mutants was able to rescue the axon regeneration defect, whereas svh-1 ( s-mut ) expression could not ( Fig 5B and S1 Table ). However, the svh-1 ( s-mut ) mutation was able to rescue the L1 arrest phenotype observed in svh-1 ( ok2531 ) deletion mutants ( Fig 5C ). Thus, the disruption of the stem-loop structure around His-755 does not affect the protease activity of SVH-1 but prevents its function as a growth factor. Therefore, we constructed the svh-1 ( s-mut, H755Y ) mutation in which His-755 in svh-1 ( s-mut ) was changed to tyrosine. We found that the svh-1 ( s-mut, H755Y ) mutation was able to rescue the axon regeneration defect in svh-1 ( ok2531 ) but not the larval developmental defect ( Fig 5B and 5C, and S1 Table ), suggesting that the stem-loop structure of svh-1 mRNA is required for the replacement of the His-755 ( CAU ) codon with a tyrosine ( UAU ) codon. SVH-1 has two functions: protease activity for larval development at the L1 stage and a growth factor for axon regeneration at the L4 to adult stages ( Fig 6A; [10]., 5 ). The protease activity of SVH-1 is not required for its function as a growth factor in axon, as SV-2 mediated HGF signaling is independent of SV-1 protease activity [5. Therefore, there must be a mechanism that converts SV-1 from a protease to a growth factor during ax regeneration. Our results suggest that C-2 converts SV-1 from a protease to growth by modifying the sv-1 mRNA through cytidine deamination of the His-CAU codon to tyrosine AU codon. We propose that the stem-loop structure of sv-1 mRNA is recognized by C-2 and that the enzymatic activity of C- is activated by axon injury. This is supported by the fact that sv-1 and c- are expressed in AD neurons which are spatially distant from D-type neurons and that C- expression is not required in D-type neurons. We propose a model for the conversion of SV-1 from a protease to growth factor during ax regeneration ( Fig 6 ).
Researchers used zebraf fish to study the impact of genetic modification on collective behavior in biological systems. They genetically modified the fish to lack the col11a gene, which causes early onset osteoarthritis and vertebral defects. The mutants exhibited compromised vertebral properties, bent bodies, and took longer to change direction. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutant fish showed more collective motion than wildtype. A simple active matter model captured the behavior of both types, with mutants modeled as self-propelling agents with higher orientational noise. This demonstrates the possibility of tuning biological systems by changing characteristics at the level of constituents, like colloids and de novo. The Vicsek model with modified orientational noise explained the difference between mutant and wildtype, with mutants having lower orientational noise. The study links macroscopic collective behavior to microscopic individual properties, showing the utility of this approach to relate genetic traits to physiological changes.
Researchers have developed a computational model to simulate the formation of capillary networks in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The model combines mechanical and chemical cues to predict endothelial cell migration, morphology, and biog deformation, and VEG transport. The results show that capillary networks develop when mechanical and chemical coupling work together, with morphology driven by soluble and bound VEG, respectively. Soluble VEG induces morphological changes, while bound VEG provides orientational signals. The model demonstrates cells gather from scattered to cords and then to a network, consistent with experiments. The model is valid for short-term incubation and may be used for transplantation to promote neovascularization around surgical sites. Previous studies omitted bound VEG or chemical mechanisms, which could not reproduce biog experiments. This study bridges mechanical and chemical stimulation in capillary development. The model uses cell-based CPM to predict endothelial migration and continuum-based PDE to quantify biog deformation and VEG dynamics. The results agree with literature, considering endothelial secreting and intaking VEG. The model shows correlation between biog deformation and cellular formation, agreeing with observations. Capillary development relies on biog deformation, bound VEG, and bound VEG gradient. The network is well-developed when mechanical and chemical work together.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The Transforming Growth Factor beta ( TGF-β ) family consists of numerous secreted peptide growth factors that play significant roles in cell function, tissue patterning, and organismal homeostasis, including wound repair and immunity. Typically studied as homodimers, these ligands have the potential to diversify their functions through ligand interactions that may enhance, repress, or generate novel functions. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, there are only five TGF-β ligands, providing an opportunity to dissect ligand interactions in fewer combinations than in vertebrates. As in vertebrates, these ligands can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) and TGF-β/Activin subfamilies that predominantly signal through discrete signaling pathways. The BMP subfamily ligand DBL-1 has been well studied for its role in the innate immune response in C. elegans. Here we show that all five TGF-β ligands play a role in survival on bacterial pathogens. We also demonstrate that multiple TGF-β ligand pairs act nonredundantly as part of this response. We show that the two BMP-like ligands–DBL-1 and TIG-2–function independently of each other in the immune response, while TIG-2/BMP and the TGF-β/Activin-like ligand TIG-3 function together. Structural modeling supports the potential for TIG-2 and TIG-3 to form heterodimers. Additionally, we identify TIG-2 and TIG-3 as members of a rare subset of TGF-β ligands lacking the conserved cysteine responsible for disulfide linking mature dimers. Finally, we show that canonical DBL-1/BMP receptor and Smad signal transducers function in the response to bacterial pathogens, while components of the DAF-7 TGF-β/Activin signaling pathway do not play a major role in survival. These results demonstrate a novel potential for BMP and TGF-β/Activin subfamily ligands to interact and may provide a mechanism for distinguishing the developmental and homeostatic functions of these ligands from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens.

    The multiplicity of TGF-β family ligands, receptors, and Smad signal transducers may support the generation of diverse context-dependent outcomes through combinatorial interactions. Biochemical and computational approaches are useful in identifying the principles mediating the potential protein-protein interactions between these components, but these approaches must be complemented by functional in vivo analyses. The nematode C. elegans has five TGF-β ligands and two characterized TGF-β family signaling pathways [27, 28], providing a powerful in vivo system in which to study TGF-β ligand functions in the context of an intact organism. Critically, TGF-β signaling mechanisms are conserved in this organism. Here we demonstrate that all five TGF-β ligands play a role in survival on bacterial pathogen. Furthermore, two ligand pairs consisting of a BMP subfamily and a TGF-β/Activin subfamily member ( TIG-2/TIG-3 and DBL-1/DAF-7 ) show evidence of interacting in the response to gram-negative bacterium P. luminescens. These studies were initiated with the well-characterized BMP-like DBL-1 signaling pathway, which is associated with significant roles in development and body size regulation but has also been shown to play an important role in the immune response against both bacterial and fungal pathogens [36, 37, 53]. Comparing the response to the gram-negative bacteria S. marcescens and P. luminescens, we obtained evidence implicating a level of specificity of ligand responses for particular bacteria. Although both BMP-like ligands, DBL-1 and TIG-2, play a significant role in the response against S. marcescens, TIG-2 has a more significant role than DBL-1 in the response against P. luminescens. These results suggest that the function of DBL-1 in the immune response is not a general one-size-fits-all response to bacterial pathogen but rather a more nuanced response with some level of pathogen specificity

. The TGF-β-like ligand DAF-7 is the regulator of the dauer pathway, and its expression in favorable conditions prevents entry into the dauer larval stage, an alternative third larval ( L3 ) stage specialized for harsh environmental conditions [29, 30, 31]. The BMP-like ligand DBL-1 activates the BMP-like pathway in the worm and plays a significant role in development [32, 33, 34]. UNC-129, TIG-2, and TIG-3 have been classified ( as BMP-like or TGF-β-like ) based on their structural characteristics but have not been fully associated with all members of either the BMP-like or TGF-β-like signaling pathways in C. elegans [26, 27]. Previous work from our lab and others has demonstrated that the BMP homolog DBL-1 functions in the innate immune response of C. elegans to pathogenic bacteria and fungi by inducing the expression of antimicrobial peptide genes in response to pathogen exposure [35–38]. Here we demonstrate that the DBL-1 ligand is only one of four TGF-β family ligands with a significant role in the immune response to two gram-negative bacterial pathogens. We show that in response to either Serratia marcescens or Photorhabdus luminescens, multiple TGF-β family ligand mutants have a significant reduction in survival compared to control animals. We also demonstrate that two BMP-like ligands, DBL-1 and TIG-2, act independently of each other. In contrast, we have shown a non-additive relationship between TIG-2/BMP and the TGF-β/Activin-like TIG-3, suggesting that these two distinct ligands act together in the immune response. Finally, we have identified signaling components with similar phenotypes to TIG-2 and TIG-3 in response to bacterial pathogen. Our studies thus uncover novel signaling paradigms that may act more broadly to distinguish distinct physiological outcomes regulated by TGF-β ligands.

. In contrast, in tig-3;unc-129 double mutants, the decreased survival of tig-3 mutants is suppressed ( S3B Fig ), suggesting a potential antagonistic interaction between UNC-129 and TIG-3. Overall, our results from these survival analyses indicate a complex relationship between the TGF-β family ligands in the immune response. Most surprisingly, ligands that demonstrate nonredundant relationships are those from different classes of TGF-β ligands–BMP-like TIG-2 with TGF-β/Activin-like TIG-3; and possibly BMP-like DBL-1 with TGF-β/Activin-like DAF-7. The two TGF-β pathways in C. elegans are known to signal through canonical mechanisms upon activation. DBL-1 signals through the BMP-like pathway with ligand binding to the single Type II receptor DAF-4 and the Type I receptor SMA-6. The BMP pathway Smads–SMA-2, SMA-3, and SMA-4 –transduce the intracellular signal allowing for gene regulation. The TGF-β/Activin-like ligand DAF-7 signals through the TGF-β/Activin-like pathway components, including the Type I receptor DAF-1 and the Smads DAF-8, DAF-14, and DAF-3 [32, 43–46]. Both pathways converge on the single Type II receptor DAF-4. Previous work has shown that in response to fungal infection of the hypodermis, DBL-1 signals in a pathway utilizing only one receptor-regulated Smad ( R-Smad SMA-3 ) without its typical partner R-Smad SMA-2 or the Co-Smad SMA-4 [37]. Signaling without a Co-Smad is considered non-canonical. We were therefore interested in which components of the BMP-like and TGF-β/Activin-like pathways are required during bacterial infection and whether non-canonical mechanisms are invoked. Our survival analysis of DBL-1 pathway components shows a consistently reduced survival pattern for R-Smad mutants sma-2 ( Fig 4A ) and sma-3 as well as for Co-Smad mutant sma-4 ( Fig 4B ). This result is consistent with a significant role for the BMP pathway Smads in the C

C. elegans has five TGF-β-like ligands: DBL-1, DAF-7, UNC-129, TIG-2, and TIG-3. It is established that loss of DBL-1, one of two BMP-like ligands in C. elegans, reduces animal survival on bacterial pathogen [35–36]. In a variety of physiological contexts, heterodimers of BMP ligands are functionally required or outperform homodimers [39–42]. We therefore considered the possibility that DBL-1/BMP functions with the other BMP-like ligand, TIG-2, in the worm. The DBL-1 pathway has been thoroughly studied in response to exposure to the gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcesens [35–38]. We show that DB-1 and T-2 act independently of each other in response to the gram-negative bacterium Photorhabus lumcens. In contrast, T-2 and the T-Activ-like ligand T-3 show a non-additive relationship in the response to P lumcens, suggesting that these two ligands act together in the response to this pathogen. The TGF-β/Activ-like ligand DAF-7 is a regulator of the dauer stage, an alternative larval stage for harsh conditions [29, 30, 31]. The BMP-like ligand DB-1 activates the BMP pathway in the worm and plays a role in development [32 33, 34]. UNC-129, T-2, and T-3 have been classified as BMP-like or T-β-like based on structural characteristics but not fully associated with either the BMP or T-β pathways in C elegans [26,27]. We demonstrate that DB-1 is one of four T-β ligands with a role in the response to gram-negative pathogens. We show that multiple T- ligands have a significant reduction in survival compared to control in response to either Serratia marces or Photorhabus lumens. We also show that DB- and T-2 act independently of each other. In contrast, we have a non-additive relationship between T- and the T-Activ-like T-, suggesting these two ligands act together in the response. We identify components with phenotypes similar to- and- in response to pathogen. Our studies uncover novel paradigms that may broadly distinguish physiological regulated by T- ligands.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The DNA damage response ( DDR ) constitutes a vital cellular process that safeguards genome integrity. This biological process involves substantial alterations in chromatin structure, commonly orchestrated by epigenetic enzymes. Here, we show that the epigenetic modifier N-terminal acetyltransferase 4 ( Nat4 ), known to acetylate the alpha-amino group of serine 1 on histones H4 and H2A, is implicated in the response to DNA damage in S. cerevisiae. Initially, we demonstrate that yeast cells lacking Nat4 have an increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulate more DNA breaks than wild-type cells. Accordingly, upon DNA damage, NAT4 gene expression is elevated, and the enzyme is specifically recruited at double-strand breaks. Delving deeper into its effects on the DNA damage signaling cascade, nat4-deleted cells exhibit lower levels of the damage-induced modification H2AS129ph ( γH2A ), accompanied by diminished binding of the checkpoint control protein Rad9 surrounding the double-strand break. Consistently, Mec1 kinase recruitment at double-strand breaks, critical for H2AS129ph deposition and Rad9 retention, is significantly impaired in nat4Δ cells. Consequently, Mec1-dependent phosphorylation of downstream effector kinase Rad53, indicative of DNA damage checkpoint activation, is reduced. Importantly, we found that the effects of Nat4 in regulating the checkpoint signaling cascade are mediated by its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity targeted specifically towards histone H4. Overall, this study points towards a novel functional link between histone N-terminal acetyltransferase Nat4 and the DDR, associating a new histone-modifying activity in the maintenance of genome integrity.

    An important aspect for efficient response to DNA damage is the rearrangement of chromatin surrounding the damaged genomic sites to facilitate accessibility to the repair machinery [71]. Histone modifying enzymes and their mediated modifications play a crucial role in these chromatin rearrangements [60, 64, 72, 73]. This study expands the repertoire of histone modifiers implicated in DDR by shedding light on a novel function for Nat4 N-terminal acetyltransferase in regulating the response to DNA damage and checkpoint dynamics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that cells lacking NAT4 exhibit increased sensitivity to genotoxic DNA damage which is associated with defective DDR signaling, culminating in impaired DNA damage checkpoint activation ( Fig 7 ). In addition, we demonstrate that the impact of Nat4 in DDR is mediated through its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity targeted specifically on histone H4. Our results show a hierarchal recruitment ( 0. 6kb > 2kb > 3kb ) of Nat4 to the DSB, strongly supporting its spreading outwards from the cut-site ( Fig 2D ), a profile that resembles the spatial organization of DDR-related proteins that are recruited in response to the generation of a DSB [63, 74, 75]. It is also worth noting that Nat4 recruitment to DSBs occurs irrespective of its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity since catalytically inactive Nat4 is still enriched at sites adjacent to the DSB ( Fig 2D ). Also, the insignificant enrichment occurring upon the non-induced raffinose conditions indicates that Nat4 recruitment is specific to the induction of a DSB. Nat4 has been reported to work as a monomer [6, 8], however the above binding pattern might suggest that Nat4 may be recruited in a dynamic manner together with other DDR factors

. Once activated, DDC limits extensive resection to prevent excessive accumulation of ssDNA through various mechanisms, as well as amplifies the signal for cell cycle arrest and induction of DNA repair [19, 49–51]. The presence of fragmented evidence associating Nat4 to DRR has prompted us to thoroughly investigate this functional link. In the current study, we unveil Nat4 as a novel player in DDR, serving as a paradigm for the NAT family of enzymes. We initially show that loss of Nat4 in S. cerevisiae ( nat4Δ ) sensitizes cells to MMS-induced DNA damage leading to accumulation of DNA breaks. Further supporting the role of Nat4 in DDR, we demonstrate that its expression is induced upon DNA damage, and it is physically recruited at the DSB-flanking chromatin. Additionally, absence of Nat4 impairs the DDR signaling cascade, evident by reduced global deposition and spreading of H2AS129ph around the break in contrast to wild-type cells. Consequently, this reduced H2AS129ph leads to decreased Rad9 binding at the DSB in nat4Δ. Consistent with these, recruitment of the key upstream kinase Mec1 to DSB, responsible for mediating the checkpoint signaling cascade, is significantly impaired in nat4Δ cells. As a result, downstream activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in nat4-deleted cells is defective, as indicated by reduced Rad53 phosphorylation. Notably, Nat4 acetyltransferase activity targeting histone H4 is crucial for its DDR function and checkpoint dynamics as evidenced by the deregulated DDR signaling in cells bearing a catalytically inactive Nat4 or expressing the non-acetylated H4S1A histone mutant. Overall, through this work Nat4 emerges as a novel player regulating the DNA damage checkpoint signaling, mediating its function through its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity on histone H4.

. Nevertheless, studies in yeast have shown that post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) on proteins play a significant role in enhancing the recruitment of Mec1 to damaged chromatin [88, 89]. Therefore, further investigation is warranted to identify whether specific histone PTMs are necessary for direct Mec1 recruitment. Given the biological importance of DDR in cell survival, it is not surprising that many of its regulating factors and events are evolutionarily conserved. Most of our knowledge on the complex network of the DDR came from research conducted in yeast that helped the characterization and functional understanding of their mammalian counterparts [20]. Considering that Nat4 and its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity towards histone H4 is preserved from yeast to humans [5], we envision that its human ortholog NAA40 may be linked to processes safeguarding the genome. In summary, our work unveils a new role for Nat4 in DDR, which serves as a paradigm among the NAT family of enzymes and their mediated protein N-terminal acetylation in regulating the cellular response to DNA damage.

. To explore whether Nat4 is involved in the DNA repair process itself, we proceeded to examine the MMS sensitivity of double mutants of nat4Δ together with the key factor of the homologous recombination ( HR ) pathway, Rad51 [58]. Because the rad51Δ single mutant is very sensitive to DNA damage we performed the growth assay at low MMS concentrations [59, 60]. Deletion of NAT4 exacerbates the DNA damage sensitivity of rad51Δ cells ( Fig 1D ), and this additive effect suggests that the DNA damage hypersensitivity caused by lack of NAT4 is unlikely to be due to HR-mediated DNA repair defects per se. Overall, these findings suggest that Nat4 has a role in regulating the susceptibility of yeast cells to DNA damage and propose that Nat4 may be involved in DDR signaling. Given that Nat4 affects cellular sensitivity to MMS-induced DNA damage ( Fig 1A–1C ), we then sought to investigate whether Nat4 expression is responsive DNA damage. We found that NAT4 transcription levels are robustly increased in wild-type cells after 3h of MMS exposure ( Fig 2A ). To determine whether this transcriptional induction was indeed a specific response to DNA damage, we employed a yeast strain in which the endogenous NAT4 promoter was replaced with the STE5 DNA damage-insensitive promoter ( STE5p-Nat4-HA ) [11]. As control, we also used an isogenic strain in which the expression of HA-tagged Nat4 was regulated by its endogenous promoter ( NAT4p-Nat4-HA ). Upon treatment of these strains with MMS, we found that the expression levels of Nat4 in cells carrying the STE5 promoter remained unchanged, while cells with the endogenous NAT4 promoter showed a significant increase in NAT4 gene expression levels, similar to wild-type cells ( Fig 2A ). Consistent with the gene expression data, HA-tagged Nat4 protein levels significantly increased as MMS treatment persisted for up to 9 hours ( Fig 2B )

To delineate the functional landscape of Nat4 we analyzed its genetic interaction network utilizing publicly available synthetic genetic array ( SGA ) data in S. cerevisiae ( S1 Table ) [52]. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of the significant genetic interactions ( S1A Fig ) revealed terms that have been previously associated with Nat4, including the regulation of protein phosphorylation and gluconeogenesis ( S1B and S1C Fig ) [11, 12, 53]. Interestingly, a less studied biological process amongst the most significantly enriched terms was the response to DNA damage prompting us to further investigate the role of Nat4 in DDR ( S1B and S1C Fig ). Therefore, we first assessed the phenotypic consequence of cells lacking Nat4 when undergoing DNA damage. Deletion of Nat4 caused dose-dependent sensitivity to cells exposed to the genotoxic agent MMS, which induces global DNA damage, compared to wild-type cells ( Fig 1A ). After observing sensitivity in the spotting assay, indicative of potential DNA damage susceptibility, we next sought to quantify the number of DNA breaks present after MMS treatment in natΔ and wild-type cells. Indeed, cells lacking Nat accumulated significantly more DNA breaks than wild-type cells ( Fig 1B ) suggesting that Nat plays a role in maintaining genome integrity.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Phylogenies depicting the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells from the same cancer, i. e., cancer phylogenies, offer valuable insights about cancer development and guide treatment strategies. Many methods exist that reconstruct cancer phylogenies using point mutations detected with bulk DNA sequencing. However, these methods become inaccurate when reconstructing phylogenies with more than 30 mutations, or, in some cases, fail to recover a phylogeny altogether. Here, we introduce Orchard, a cancer phylogeny reconstruction algorithm that is fast and accurate using up to 1000 mutations. Orchard samples without replacement from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies, a novel result derived in this paper. Each factor in this approximate posterior corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a partially built phylogeny. Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially, generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies that ultimately culminate in a complete tree containing all mutations. Our evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogenies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias ( B-ALLs ). Remarkably, Orchard accurately reconstructs cancer phylogenies using up to 1, 000 mutations. Additionally, we demonstrate that the large and accurate phylogenies reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among distinct cancer cell subpopulations.

    Modern cancer evolution studies generate large amounts of bulk sequencing data often containing hundreds of mutations and multiple cancer samples. This vast amount of data presents a promising opportunity to improve our understanding of the evolutionary events that drive cancer progression. Until now, existing mixed sample perfect phylogeny ( MSPP ) reconstruction algorithms were unable to reliably reconstruct trees with more than 30 mutations. These limitations necessitated clustering mutations into subclones prior to reconstructing trees, which is an error prone process [30–32]. We introduced Orchard, a novel MSPP reconstruction algorithm that uses variant allele frequency data to build large and accurate mutation trees. We derived an approximation to the mutation tree posterior, then showed how Orchard adapts Ancestral Gumbel-Top-k sampling to efficiently sample without replacements from it. Our results demonstrate that Orchard can reliably match or beat ground-truth ( or expert-derived ) baselines on tree reconstruction problems with up to 300 mutations and up to 100 samples from the same cancer. Orchard can recover larger trees on simulated data, and in Section A6. 4 in S1 Appendix we use Orchard to successfully reconstruct 1000-node simulated mutation trees in ≈26 hours of wall clock time. Orchard’s ability to reconstruct extremely large trees motivated a new strategy where the mutation tree structure is used to guide the inference of clones and clone trees. To this end, we introduced a “phylogeny-aware” clustering algorithm that uses agglomerative clustering to infer clones and clone trees from mutation trees. There are a few potential areas of improvement for Orchard. First, the majority of Orchard’s run time is used by the projection algorithm [44] to estimate the clonal proportion matrix U each time it adds a new mutation to a tree

. Pre-defining subclones before tree reconstruction can also result in the loss of critical information such as the partial order of mutation acquisition, which is crucial for analyzing somatic mutation patterns and determining prognosis and treatment strategies for certain hematological cancers [6, 7, 34–36]. Here, we introduce a new MSPP reconstruction algorithm, Orchard, which reliably reconstructs extremely large mutation trees, alleviating the need to pre-cluster mutations. Orchard accurately solves MSPP problems with as many as 1000 mutations and 100 samples. We benchmark Orchard’s reconstructions against Pairtree and CALDER on 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias ( B-ALLs ) and 90 simulated cancers. These results demonstrate that: ( 1 ) Orchard matches or outperforms Pairtree and CALDER on reconstruction problems with 30 or fewer mutations while being 5–10x faster, and ( 2 ) Orchard greatly outperforms both competing methods on reconstruction problems with more than 30 mutations. Orchard achieves greater accuracy and scalability for large reconstruction problems by sampling from a factorized approximation of the mutation tree posterior, a novel result derived in this paper. Each factor in this approximate posterior represents a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a partially built tree. Consequently, Orchard samples from this approximate posterior by generating sequences of progressively larger trees, culminating in a complete tree containing all mutations. Orchard uses Gumbel Soft-Max Tricks [37–39] to sample trees for each factor, enabling it to sample complete mutation trees without replacement. This approach differs from existing methods, such as Pairtree [25], which uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) to explore the space of complete mutation trees, or CALDER [26], which formulates the MSPP problem as a mixed integer linear program ( MILP )

Cancerous cells contain somatic mutations that override normal cellular controls [1, 2]. Evolution progresses as cancer cells acquire additional mutations that provide selection advantages [3], leading to genetically distinct cancerous cell subpopulations ( i. e., subclones ) characterized by sets of shared mutations [4]. Phylogenies describing the ancestral relationships of subclones in an individual cancer can reveal important evolutionary events, help to characterize the cancer’s heterogeneity [5] and progression [6, 7], support the discovery of new driver mutations [8], and provide clinical insight for treatment regimens [9]. Many cancer evolution studies use bulk DNA from multiple cancer samples to reconstruct phylogenies depicting the evolution of subclones in an individual cancer [10–16]. These phylogenies are also prerequisites for inferring migration histories of metastases [17, 18]. A mutation tree is an arborescence that can represent portions of a cancer phylogeny that satisfy the infinite sites assumption ( ISA ). The ISA posits that each mutation is acquired only once and is never reverted. A phylogeny that adheres to the ISA is a perfect phylogeny; cancer phylogenies are often perfect because of low mutation rates ( ∼1–10 mutations / megabase ) [19]. By definition, a mutation tree is a perfect phylogeny, and each non-root node in a mutation tree represents a somatic mutation present in one or more cancerous cell subpopulations. Bulk DNA data obtained by sequencing multiple tissue samples from the same cancer can be used to reconstruct a mutation tree by solving the mixed sample perfect phylogeny ( MSPP ) problem. In the MSPP problem, each cancer sample is an unknown mixture of clonal genotypes, i. e, clones, that are related to one another via a perfect phylogeny

. These existing algorithmic approaches have critical pitfalls: MCMC-based methods often converge slowly and are prone to becoming stuck in local maxima because samples are highly auto-correlated, while MILP-based methods can be extremely slow, may fail to recover a solution, or may only be able to produce a single solution in a reasonable amount of time. Orchard avoids these pitfalls because of two crucial properties of the algorithm: it samples without replacement, which mitigates the risk of becoming stuck in local maxima, and its search strategy retains and grows partial tree structures that adhere closely to the ISA, effectively pruning large portions of the search space. Orchard’s ability to accurately reconstruct large mutation trees enables a novel strategy to flexibly define subclones. To illustrate this new strategy, we introduce a simple phylogeny-aware clustering algorithm that infers subclones from a reconstructed mutation tree. On real data, this simple algorithm recovers expert-defined subclones as well as, and often better, than state-of-the-art VAF based clustering algorithms [27–29]. Orchard, along with the phylogeny-aware clustering algorithm, is accessible for free under the MIT License at http://www. github. com/morrislab/orchard.

. The data sets vary in the number of mutations ( 10, 30, 50, 100, 150, 200 ), cancer samples ( 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 ), and sequencing depths ( 50x, 200x, 1000x ). These simulations all adhere to the ISA. We ran Orchard, CALDER, and Pairtree on each simulated data set a single time, and the box plots in Fig 3b, 3c and 3d show the distribution of results for each evaluation metric. Table 1 contains counts of data sets, separated by problem size, where a method had the best log perplexity ratio ( P ) or relationship reconstruction loss ( R ). CALDER was the only method to fail on a reconstruction problem, its failure rate increased as the problem size increased, and it failed to produce a valid tree on any reconstruction problem with more than 100 mutations. Fig 3 and Table 1 illustrate a problem-size-dependency in relative performance. Orchard generally outperformed Pairtree and CALDER on the small reconstruction problems ( 10–30 mutations ) on all metrics. Although Orchard’s reconstructions are only slightly better than Pairtree for these problems, Orchard is 5–10x faster. In contrast, Orchard consistently outperformed Pairtree and CALDER on all problems with 50 or more mutations. For these problems, in either setting of k, Orchard finds trees that are significantly better than those of Pair and CAL on both perplexity and reconstruction loss metrics. We also ran Orchard on simulated data with 1000 mutations and 100 samples in 26 hours of wall clock time, demonstrating its ability to reconstruct extremely large trees.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Neoantigen immunogenicity prediction is a highly challenging problem in the development of personalised medicines. Low reactivity rates in called neoantigens result in a difficult prediction scenario with limited training datasets. Here we describe ImmugenX, a modular protein language modelling approach to immunogenicity prediction for CD8+ reactive epitopes. ImmugenX comprises of a pMHC encoding module trained on three pMHC prediction tasks, an optional TCR encoding module and a set of context specific immunogenicity prediction head modules. Compared with state-of-the-art models for each task, ImmugenX’s encoding module performs comparably or better on pMHC binding affinity, eluted ligand prediction and stability tasks. ImmugenX outperforms all compared models on pMHC immunogenicity prediction ( Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0. 619, average precision: 0. 514 ), with a 7% increase in average precision compared to the next best model. ImmugenX shows further improved performance on immunogenicity prediction with the integration of TCR context information. ImmugenX performance is further analysed for interpretability, which locates areas of weakness found across existing immunogenicity models and highlight possible biases in public datasets.

    CD8+ neoepitope prediction plays an important role in the development of personalised cancer therapeutics, potentially allowing for highly targeted and more effective treatments. In this work, we’ve described ImmugenX, a modular language model which achieves state-of-the-art performance on pMHC immunogenicity prediction and can integrate new inputs such as TCRs when available. The phased pre-training approach detailed here allows for the integration of multiple pMHC complex-specific tasks in the model weights, providing a useful embedding for downstream pMHC immunogenicity modelling at state-of-the-art performance levels. This was shown with a strict separation of datasets, ensuring all test peptides were unseen by the model in any previous task at every point of training. pMHC complex stability in particular was found to be an important additional embedded feature for improved performance on the test set in this work. This aligns with previous work showing pMHC stability’s relationship to CD8+ reactivity prediction [11, 13]. Previous models showed that fine-tuning from an EL model [8] provides a strong basis for the more specific task of immunogenicity prediction. Similarly, the output from an EL and stability models have been used as separate inputs to machine learning methods [13, 14] and neural networks [7] previously. Our protein language modelling approach has the advantage of not just integrating other model outputs, but additional features which are observable in the underlying embeddings before the immunogenicity model head. The phased training approach used in ImmugenX allows for the possible inclusion of TCR data, without being limited by the low volume of paired peptide-TCR data available for training an end-to-end model. The ImmugenX architecture has the advantage of being extendable, both to additional pre-training-based embeddings through new pMHC tasks and to additional feature inputs such as TCR sequences

. Predictions based on these pMHC tasks are all known to correlate with T-cell immunogenicity. Direct predictors of immunogenicity have also been developed, with many using the above pMHC models as a basis. PRIME uses the MixMHCpred affinity rank, along with likely TCR interacting amino acids from the epitope as input to a neural network [7]. Gartner et al. [13] and Müller et al [14] built machine learning models taking existing pMHC models and engineered features as inputs, including some patient-specific antigenicity features such as expression. Integrated deep learning approaches have also been developed, such as BigMHC, which transfer-learns immunogenicity from its previously trained RNN-based EL model [8]. Due to low volumes of training data and small independent test datasets, these models have generally shown improved performance at the time of publication but some reduced performance on new data as it becomes available. This indicates current models do not yet represent highly generalisable underlying features of immunogenic neoantigens. TCR specificity is also a relevant task to immunogenicity prediction, especially when considering the application of personalised therapy design. The likelihood of immunogenicity in the context of a patient’s TCR repertoire would be a desirable metric for ranking candidate mutations. TCR specificity models can perform poorly on entirely unseen epitopes after accounting for biases in test dataset composition [15, 16, 17, 18]. Poor generalisation is likely due to a shortage of diverse datasets since the current repositories of paired pMHC-TCR triplets are heavily biased to HLA-A02:01 and a few viral epitopes [19]. While these datasets are currently limited in scope, next-generation screening methods may greatly increase volumes of paired data in the coming years [20], meaning an increase in TCR data from which to retrain existing models

. Integrating TCR prediction into an immunogenicity model would allow it to take full advantage of these new datasets. Here we present ImmugenX a modular immunogenicity prediction protein language model based on the transformer architecture. ImmugenX comprises a pMHC submodule, trained sequentially on multiple pMHC prediction tasks. In the first instance, this provides the input embeddings for an immunogenicity prediction head model to perform pMHC-only immunogenicity prediction. ImmugenX is also extendable to additional patient-specific inputs, by appending embeddings from purpose-trained encoding networks, demonstrated here with TCR sequences. We show that ImmugenX achieves a state-of-the-art level of performance at pMHC immunogenicity on an independent cancer-specific holdout and is extendable to include additional features when they are available.

A sub-module of ImmugenX was trained to encode peptide-MHC input pairs for downstream immunogenicity prediction by training iteratively on related pMHC prediction tasks. This allows us to use all available data on immunogenicity related pMHC prediction tasks in the training of ImmugenX. Performance on these sub-tasks was assessed by comparison to state-of-the-art models at each stage. First, the BA task was assessed against MHCFlurry 2. 0 [6] on an IEDB [21] search for BA data deposited after 2021, filtered for 8mer similarity to the training set, ensuring a clean test set for both models. Second, using the NetMHCpan 4. 1 single-allelic eluted ligand ( EL ) dataset, we compared to BigMHC-EL and NetMHCpan 4. 1. Finally, during stability training, similarity to the NetMHCstabpan [11] results was assessed using cross-validation. The BA task results can be seen in Fig 1B showing comparable performance to MHCFlurry, a well validated model for BA prediction. This demonstrates the first stage of training for the ImmugenX pMHC module accurately represents the binding affinity of unseen pMHC complexes. This severs as a basis for transfer learning to additional tasks in the next training steps. The EL task performance similarly showed comparable performance between the tested models and ImmugenX. MHCFlurry was not assessed on this test dataset due to some overlap between their EL training set and this test set, which was also noted by the BigMHC authors. Overall performance and a breakdown of performance by HLA allele are shown in Fig 1C. Fig 1D shows a comparison of the performance of ImmugenX on the stability task, both training from scratch and with the EL-trained model as the starting model. Due to the shortage of stability data available, a holdout test set was not practical for this task

. Paired pMHC-TCR triplet data is currently severely limited, especially when it comes to epitope and HLA diversity [19]. Due to the limited datasets available, TCR specificity prediction in entirely novel epitopes has not been shown once dataset biases have been sufficiently accounted for [16, 15, 28, 18]. ImmugenX as an architecture demonstrated strong performance at two TCR specificity tasks from previous publications [17, 16] indicating that it is highly capable of integrating TCR inputs, including up to full chain alpha and beta chains, into predictions. We show that integrating CDR3β chains into an immunogenicity prediction task can provide an improvement in performance in the limited set of test neoantigens currently available. We found our setup of different pretraining steps and diverse negative data generation was important in achieving this increase. TCR input was found to have the least impact on the overall prediction score; however, the shift in performance seen here indicates the patient TCR repertoire could be an important input in improving neoepitope ranking. While these results are limited by available data, this work demonstrates the potential gains from integrating TCR information into immunogenicity prediction. The extendable design of ImmugenX allows for additional features to be integrated by adding to the feature sentence structure as shown with TCRs. Features which have been established to impact immunogenicity, such as expression levels [13] and antigen clonality [29] could similarly be appended to the ImmugenX inputs. Currently, the limiting factor is data availability to support fitting and testing of the model in these alternative configurations. Public datasets rarely include these patient-level features. In our S1 Text we investigate the usage of a large pretrained model, ESM2 [30], to replace the embedding layers of our model

Researchers have developed a new computer model called Immugen that can predict how the body's immune system will react to cancer cells. This is important for developing new cancer treatments that target specific to each person's cancer. Immugen is a modular, meaning it can be trained on different parts of the immune system separately and then combined. It performed better than other models at predicting how the immune system will react to cancer cells. It can also use information from T-cells, which are part of the immune system, to make better predictions. The model is extendable, meaning it can be trained on more data as it becomes available. This is important because current models are limited by the data they were trained on. The researchers tested Immugen on different tasks, such as predicting how well the immune system will bind to cancer cells and how stable the cancer cells are. It performed well on these tasks. They also tested how well it did when using information from T-cells, which are part of the immune system. The results show that using T-cells information can improve predictions. The model is extendable, meaning it can be trained on more data as it becomes available. This is important because current models are limited by the data they were trained on.

    Title: 
    Abstract: The quality of meat is important to the consumer. Color is a primary indicator of meat quality and is characterized mainly into lightness, redness, and yellowness. Here, we used the genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) and gene-based association analysis with whole-genome resequencing of 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens to map genes related to meat lightness and redness to a 6. 24 kb QTL region ( GGA15: 6298. 34–6304. 58 kb ). This analysis revealed that only the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma ( PPP1CC ) was associated with meat color ( P = 8. 65E-08 ). The causal relationships between PPP1CC expression and meat lightness/redness were further validated through Mendelian randomization analyses ( P < 2. 9E-12 ). Inducible skeletal muscle-specific PPP1CC knockout ( PPP1CC-SSKO ) mice were generated and these mice showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin content in the limb muscles. In addition, the predominant myofiber shifted from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myofibers. Through transcriptome and targeted metabolome evidence, we found that inhibition of PPP1CC decreased the expression of typical slow-twitch myofiber and myofiber-type specification genes and enhanced the glycolysis pathway. Functional validation through a plasmid reporter assay revealed that a SNP ( rs315520807, C > T ) located in the intron of PPP1CC could regulate the gene transcription activity. The differences in meat color phenotypes, myoglobin content, frequency of rs315520807 variant, expression of PPP1CC and fast-twitch fiber marker genes were detected between fast-growing white-feathered chickens and local chickens. In this study, PPP1CC was identified as the causative gene for meat color, and the novel target gene and variant that can aid in the innovation of meat improvement technology were detected.

    We found that PPP1CC expression was causally related to breast muscle lightness and redness in chickens using large-scale genome-wide association, gene-based association analysis and Mendelian randomization analysis. Using PPP1CC-SSKO mice, we also found that lightness increased and myoglobin content decreased in the limb muscle, and the mechanisms by which PPP1CC influences meat color included myofiber-type specification. Functional validation through a plasmid reporter assay revealed that the SNP rs315520807 ( C > T ) located in the intron of PPP1CC could regulate gene transcription activity. The differences in the meat color phenotypes and related indices between fast-growing white-feathered chickens and local chickens support the conclusions above. Our results identified PPP1CC as the causative gene for meat color and identified a novel target gene and variant for the innovation of meat improvement technology.

In this study, we assessed meat color using the L* and a* phenotypes. We performed a GWAS by using 230 individuals and more than nine million SNPs to calculate a genome-wide distribution via genome resequencing, and the results revealed that only one significant signal was observed on chromosome 15, which might be associated with chicken meat color. The gene-based association analysis, which associations at the gene level by aggregating genotypes for each gene [17], indicated that only PPP1CC at the loci was significantly associated with the meat color L* and a* values. To confirm the causal relationships, MR analysis was used to provide more solid evidence for causal inference between PPP1CC expression and target traits. The results revealed that PPP1CC has negative effects on meat color L* and positive effects on a*. Additionally, the findings suggested effects on meat color traits beyond PPP1CC gene expression, emphasizing the need for further study in the future. The PPP1CC is indispensable for muscle glycogen metabolism and functions by binding with protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3A ( PPP1R3A ). In chickens, PPP1R3A has been identified as the functional gene for the pH of the pectoralis major muscle in pH-divergent selected lines [23]. In our study, the expression of PPP1R3A decreased in PPP1CC-SSKO mice ( fold change = 0. 75, P = 0. 01 ). Previous studies on PP1 have focused on its regulatory subunits and shown that disruption of gene expression causes weight gain, insulin resistance, and fat deposition [24]. The clarification of the role of PPP1CC in meat color is reported here for the first time. For a gene such as PPP1CC with a broad function and a phenotype such as meat quality that is affected by post-slaughter metabolism, skeletal muscle-specific knockouts that are time inducible are essential. Given that PP1γ has 99

. This discrepancy in meat color is also consistent with the increased frequency of the potential causative variant rs315520807 mutant type TT ( 51% vs 11% ) and the decreased expression of PPP1CC in fast-growing chicken breeds, which may also be related to variations in muscle fiber types, as evidenced by the heightened expression of type II marker genes in fast-growing breeds. The frequency of the rs315520807 wild type CC in the fast-growing chickens is 10%, which can serve as an effective genetic marker in breeding programs for improving meat color and reducing the incidence of PSE-like meat. There are several limitations of the current study. The downregulation of PPP1CC was related to the lightness change 15 min after slaughter, but the corresponding lightness changes observed in PPP1CC-SSKO mice were recorded 24 h after slaughter. This discrepancy might be related to the species differences because fast-twitch myofibers, which are the main component of the chicken pectoralis major muscle, undergo fast glycolysis after slaughter, whereas slow-twitch myofibers, which are the main component of mouse muscle, have a slow glycolysis rate. The rate of glycolysis after slaughter differed between chickens and mice. Additionally, L*15 min and L*24 h as well as a*15 min and a*24 h are highly phenotypically correlated in the chicken population studied ( S8 Table ). It remains uncertain whether rs315520807 is the causative mutation due to the interference of linkage disequilibrium among sites, and further investigation is needed to determine that.

Meat is one of the most important sources of high-quality proteins for humans. Meat quality is important to the consumer and represents a critical issue for the livestock production industry [1–4]. Meat quality traits are complex and are usually determined by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors [5]. Meat color is the first sensory information available to consumers and is determined by the dimensions of lightness, redness, and yellowness. Redness and yellowness are chromatically determined by pigment content, and lightness is chromatically determined by microstructure [6] Meat color not only influences appearance but is also correlated with pH, muscle fiber characteristics and lipid deposition. Severe myopathy related to meat color, including pale, soft, exudative ( PSE ) meat, results in consumer rejection and severe economic losses in the industry. Understanding the genetic basis of meat color is important for the innovation of modern meat improvement technology. Some causative or related genes for meat color have been identified in chickens and domestic pigs. Strong relationships between beta-carotene oxygenase 1 ( BCO1 ) [7] and chicken yellowness and between myosin heavy chain 3 ( MYH3 ) [8] and redness/intramuscular fat in pig skeletal muscle have been reported. Changes in meat lightness might be related to changes in muscle glycolytic potential [9]. The Rendement Napole gene ( RN ) [10] and phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit gamma 1 ( PHKG1 ) [11] were found to be involved in glycolytic potential. However, the causal genes for meat lightness and redness have not been identified. Efficient strategies for exploring functional genes include genome-wide association studies ( GWASs ) and gene-based association analysis [12–17]. Major QTLs and candidate genes affecting complex quantitative traits have been identified [15]; however, causal relationships are difficult to determine

. In recent years, the Mendelian randomization ( MR ) method has been widely applied in the search for disease/pathogenic causal factors [18, 19]. The MR method uses genetic variants to determine whether an observational association between a risk factor and an outcome trait is consistent with a causal effect [20]. Meat color is a complex trait because it is influenced by both muscle development and tissue metabolism. Muscle cells remain metabolically active after slaughter. Studying animals in vivo is the preferred approach for verifying gene function and exploring the underlying mechanisms involved. However, this approach requires a time-inducible and skeletal muscle-specific knockout mouse model with a high degree of mimicry, in which normal gene expression during embryonic and early development ensures normal tissue development. The knockout of a candidate gene that has broad roles and is functionally important [21] at an early age will result in severe harm. A relatively short induction period to downregulate target gene expression was more suitable for the study of post-slaughter traits. In the present study, the causative gene and potential causative variant of chicken breast muscle color lightness and redness were identified through a combination of GWAS, gene-based association analysis, and MR analysis. Further experiments in mice and transcriptome and metabolome analysis were used to explore the underlying mechanisms of PPPCC in meat color. The results showed that PPPCC was the causative for meat color and a novel gene variant that can be used in the innovation of meat technology.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Spatially nonlinear stimulus integration by retinal ganglion cells lies at the heart of various computations performed by the retina. It arises from the nonlinear transmission of signals that ganglion cells receive from bipolar cells, which thereby constitute functional subunits within a ganglion cell’s receptive field. Inferring these subunits from recorded ganglion cell activity promises a new avenue for studying the functional architecture of the retina. This calls for efficient methods, which leave sufficient experimental time to leverage the acquired knowledge for further investigating identified subunits. Here, we combine concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography and introduce super-resolved tomographic reconstruction ( STR ) as a technique to efficiently stimulate and locate receptive field subunits. Simulations demonstrate that this approach can reliably identify subunits across a wide range of model variations, and application in recordings of primate parasol ganglion cells validates the experimental feasibility. STR can potentially reveal comprehensive subunit layouts within only a few tens of minutes of recording time, making it ideal for online analysis and closed-loop investigations of receptive field substructure in retina recordings.

   . As an alternative, several approaches have been developed to infer subunits and thus connected bipolar cells from ganglion cell recordings alone [26–31]. However, these approaches are often based on ganglion cell responses to fine spatiotemporal white noise stimuli, which generally evoke comparatively weak responses, making long recordings necessary. Limited recording time may thus obstruct reliable subunit identification or curtail the functional investigations of subunit layouts. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method to identify the layout of subunits composing a ganglion cell’s receptive field that makes use of stimuli specifically targeted towards the computational characteristics of subunits and that has the potential of considerably reducing the required recording time. The method combines the functional principles underlying stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) microscopy [32, 33] and tomographic imaging such as computed tomography ( CT ) scans [34], and we accordingly term it super-resolved tomographic reconstruction ( STR ). In this manuscript, we investigate the potential of STR via comprehensive modelling and electrophysiological recordings from primate retinal ganglion cells.

. We will refer to this technique as super-resolved tomographic reconstruction ( STR ) : While the center-surround structure of the Ricker stripes sharpens subunit responses and thereby effectively super-resolves them below the scale of the subunits themselves, the presentation of stripes at varying positions and angles allows for a tomographic reconstruction of subunits. We extended the overly simplified ganglion cell model used in Fig 1 to test STR in a more realistic setting. Firstly, we adopted a procedure to randomly generate layouts of larger numbers of subunits and also took elliptical subunits with varying degrees of overlap into account. Fig 2 shows sample layouts for 6, 10, and 14 subunits ( first column ). Just as before, the subunits cannot be identified from the structure of the receptive fields alone, even if noise-free high-resolution measurements are considered ( Fig 2, second column ). The sinograms gathered via the tomographic presentation of Ricker stripes ( Fig 2, third column ) show a more complex structure than in the previous, simple example of Fig 1, and individual subunit traces are progressively harder to distinguish as the model comprises more subunits. Nevertheless, the corresponding reconstructions ( Fig 2, fourth column ) display a clear hotspot structure with each hotspot representing the location of a subunit. Next, we extended the model to include the stochasticity of spiking responses by applying a Poisson process for spike generation in order to reflect the inherently noisy responses of real retinal ganglion cells. The Poisson process was used for simplicity, even though ganglion cell spiking is typically more regular than Poisson noise would suggest, so that this can be viewed as a conservative assessment of the effect of spiking variability

. As a second concept, we introduced a tomographic variation of the super-resolution stimulus in order to evoke stronger responses and sample the receptive field more efficiently. Bars of light have long been used to qualitatively study receptive field properties of visual neurons [53, 54], and Sun and Bonds [55] introduced the application of filtered back-projection to quantitatively determine the receptive fields of cells in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus ( LGN ). Since then, this approach has been employed to locate receptive fields in various systems including the goldfish, zebrafish, and mouse retina [56, 57], primate LGN, V1, and V2 [57–59], and even fMRI of human visual cortex [60]. Previous studies of retinal ganglion cells have shown that the tomographic analysis scheme can markedly accelerate receptive field estimations [56, 57], compared to stimulation with individual spots of light or spatiotemporal white noise. We believe the same effect to apply in our tomographic approach with super-resolution stimuli for subunit identification, as Ricker stripes constitute a much more potent stimulus for driving ganglion cells than small spots with suppressive rings or spatiotemporal white noise at the required high spatial resolution ( Fig 4 ). Nevertheless, differences between the ganglion cell system investigated here and X-ray tomography may complicate the analysis of the sinograms and limit the applicability of FBP. The FBP algorithm provides a discrete approximation of the inverse Radon transform [34]. In the context of X-rays, the Radon transform describes the absorption of the beams travelling through an object. In more general terms, it calculates projections of an object in various directions. If the stimulus used here was an infinitesimally narrow bar without suppressive sidebands, the Radon transform would perfectly describe the responses of our standard ganglion cell model

All experiments were performed in conformance with national and institutional guidelines and as approved by the institutional animal care committee of the German Primate Center and by the responsible regional government office ( Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit, Permit 33. 19-42502-04-20/3458 ). In order to study the super-resolved tomographic reconstruction ( STR ) method in a scenario with known ground truth, we employed an LNLNP model to simulate ganglion cell responses to a flashed presentation of a given stimulus ( grayscale image ). The model consisted of the following stages: the linear spatial filters that represent the subunits ( L ), the subunit nonlinearities ( N ), the weighted linear summation of subunit signals ( L ), the output nonlinearity ( N ), and the spike-generating Poisson process ( P ). The subunits mark the first linear computation of the stimulus. The simulated visual area was 40 by 40 pixels large and stimulus pixels could attain values from -1 ( black ) to +1 ( white ) with 0 corresponding to mean gray. Each subunit was modeled as a 2D Gaussian, whose parameters were two standard-deviation values, an angle of rotation, and the x- and y-position of the center situated in the simulated 40-by-40 pixel space. All subunits were normalized to a volume of unity. For our standard model, we only used positive values for the subunit filters, corresponding to On-type subunits ( and, downstream, to simulated On-type ganglion cells ). The biologically inspired subunit layouts used throughout this manuscript were generated using Voronoi diagrams of perturbed hexagonal lattices. To create such a layout, we first constructed a large hexagonal lattice ( i. e., the centers of a honeycomb structure ) with a nearest-neighbor distance of 1/8th of the simulated area

. The extent of this effect also depends on the subunit nonlinearity–the rectifying and squaring nonlinearity mentioned before, e. g., will magnify this issue. Nevertheless, as demonstrated before, FBP reconstructions still reproduce the locations of many subunits. Yet, by taking the effects described here into account, an alternative reconstruction method might help locate subunits more consistently, reduce trough effects in the reconstruction, and determine the subunit shape more accurately. In order to experimentally test our method, we performed an electrophysiological recording of ganglion cells in an isolated marmoset retina using a multielectrode array while projecting light stimuli onto the retinal photoreceptors. Using responses to a spatiotemporal white noise stimulus, we identified On and Off parasol cells, which we expected to exhibit the most pronounced subunit structure due to their spatially nonlinear characteristics. Both cell types displayed a fast biphasic filter, tiling of visual space by their receptive fields, and consistent autocorrelation functions and output nonlinearities ( Fig 8A ). Off parasol cells had an average effective receptive field diameter of 111 ± 9 μm ( mean ± standard deviation ) and On parasol cells of 138 ± 11 μm, both values in line with dendritic field sizes in the marmoset peripheral retina [48]. For the experiments, we adjusted the Ricker stripe stimulus in two major ways: Firstly, we decided to mainly target Off parasol cells, which, for the macaque retina, had been shown to have stronger spatial nonlinearities in the receptive field than their On-type counterparts [15, 49]. We therefore flipped the polarity of the Ricker stripes, now using a black center and white sidebands, which are excitatory and suppressive, respectively, for Off cells

The researchers have developed a new technique called super-resolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) to study the structure of the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. The retina is made up of many small units called ganglion cells, which work together to process visual information from light. The researchers wanted to find a way to study these units without needing long recordings, which can take a lot of time. They combined two techniques, super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography, to create STR. This method can identify the units in the retina in just a few minutes, making it ideal for studying how they work.

The researchers tested STR on a computer model of the retina and found it worked well. They then used it on real retinal cells from a primate and found that it could identify the units. This is a big step forward in understanding how the retina works and could lead to new treatments for vision problems.

    Title: 
    Abstract: An important application of CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) technology is for identifying chemical-genetic interactions ( CGIs ). Discovery of genes that interact with exposure to antibiotics can yield insights to drug targets and mechanisms of action or resistance. The objective is to identify CRISPRi mutants whose relative abundance is suppressed ( or enriched ) in the presence of a drug when the target protein is depleted, reflecting synergistic behavior. Different sgRNAs for a given target can induce a wide range of protein depletion and differential effects on growth rate. The effect of sgRNA strength can be partially predicted based on sequence features. However, the actual growth phenotype depends on the sensitivity of cells to depletion of the target protein. For essential genes, sgRNA efficiency can be empirically measured by quantifying effects on growth rate. We observe that the most efficient sgRNAs are not always optimal for detecting synergies with drugs. sgRNA efficiency interacts in a non-linear way with drug sensitivity, producing an effect where the concentration-dependence is maximized for sgRNAs of intermediate strength ( and less so for sgRNAs that induce too much or too little target depletion ). To capture this interaction, we propose a novel statistical method called CRISPRi-DR ( for Dose-Response model ) that incorporates both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation. We use CRISPRi-DR to re-analyze data from a recent CGI experiment in Mycobacterium tuberculosis to identify genes that interact with antibiotics. This approach can be generalized to non-CGI datasets, which we show via an CRISPRi dataset for E. coli growth on different carbon sources. The performance is competitive with the best of several related analytical methods. However, for noisier datasets, some of these methods generate far more significant interactions, likely including many false positives, whereas CRISPRi-DR maintains higher precision, which we observed in both empirical and simulated data.

   . g. Rule Set 1 selects top 20% of sgRNAs by empirical efficiency and uses these to build a model to predict sgRNA strength; Rule Set 2 extends this with a machine learning model based on additional sequence features to predict sgRNA strength, and prefers sgRNAs with highest score [9] ). This contrasts with our approach, where we advocate selecting sgRNAs with a diversity of efficiencies, since we observed that the sgRNAs that exhibited the most synergy with drug treatments were not always the strongest or weakest, but somewhere in the middle of the range. For application to CGI experiments, the availability of CRISPRi data for multiple sgRNAs of varying strengths for each target gene presents new challenges for statistical analysis. In previous work [20], we showed that regressing the relative abundances of mutants in hypomorph libraries over multiple concentrations of a drug ( on log-scale ) can be used to improve detection of CGIs. This regression approach captured dose-dependent behavior, i. e. genes whose decreased expression caused either suppressed or enhanced fitness that increases in magnitude with drug concentration ( i. e. exhibits a trend, which is important for statistical robustness ). The CRISPRi-DR method described in this paper extends this previous work by showing how effects of both drug concentration and sgRNA efficiency can be accommodated in the same model. Ideally, interacting genes would be expected to exhibit synergistic behavior with a drug, where depletion of a target protein induces excess depletion ( or enrichment ) of the mutants grown in the presence of an inhibitor, and this effect is concentration-dependent ( exhibits dose-response behavior ). In theory, both CRISPRi depletion of essential genes and exposure to antibiotics should impair growth of CRISPRi mutants ( at least for depletion of essential genes )

. In an essential gene, some sgRNAs might be more efficient than others. In contrast, typically, all the sgRNAs targeting a non-essential will turn out to be non-efficient ( i. e. have 0 growth defect, or relative fitness of around 1 ), at least under control conditions, since the cells are unaffected by depletion of these proteins and continue to grow at the same rate. However, they might cause growth impairment if expressed in certain stress conditions where they might play a role in survival/tolerance. In fact, in chemical-genetic interaction experiments, variable sgRNA efficiency can be further exploited to identify genes whose level of depletion synergizes with increasing drug concentration. We developed the CRISPRi-DR model with this use case in mind, extending the Hill equation, which quantifies dose-response behavior of a growth inhibitor, to incorporate an extra term representing the relative efficiency of each of the sgRNAs targeting a gene. This approach, however, is not limited to CGI experiments. It can be applied to other treatments that induce a sigmoidal response. For example, in re-analysis of data from the Mathis, Otto and Reynolds [11] paper, we showed the same equation could be adapted for modeling the effect of E. coli cultures grown on medium with different carbon sources; the time parameter could be substituted for the concentration, since depletion of essential genes caused a gradual killing with an S-curve shape over time. Therefore, the CRISPRi-DR approach we developed has 3 main requirements. First, the CRISPRi library should contain multiple sgRNAs per target gene. Anecdotal evidence suggests that at least 5 sgRNAs per gene are necessary to maintain overall sensitivity for detecting expected interactions and maximizing AUC ( based on experiments where we subsampled a limited number of sgRNAs per screen; see Supplement )

. Tuning CRISPRi allows to deplete the targeted gene product to intermediate levels [5], which allowed the introduction of the concept of gene ‘vulnerability’ as describing the sensitivity of cells to partial depletion of individual proteins [12]. By this definition, highly vulnerable genes are genes for which even small depletion of the encoded protein causes growth impairment, which can be quantified efficiently on a genome-wide scale using high-throughput sequencing [12]. The vulnerability of a gene can be both condition dependent and strain or cell type dependent [12]. One interesting application of CRISPRi is to reveal targets of antibiotics or mechanisms of resistance through chemical-genetic interactions ( CGI ) [7, 13]. CRISPRi libraries can be designed to contain multiple sgRNAs targeting each gene, resulting in a set of thousands of individual depletion mutants [12]. In this context, ‘mutant’ refers to a cell line transformed with a integrative plasmid capable of expressing the dCAS9 protein and the unique targeting sgRNA, even though it contains the wild-type gene sequence. The abundance of each mutant can be quantified by amplifying the sgRNA targeting sequence which functions as a molecular barcode, and then performing deep sequencing to count the number of barcodes for each sgRNA in a treatment [6]. The analysis of such datasets is challenging, due to various sources of noise which introduce variability in the counts. There are several previously published methods for statistical analysis of CRISPR datasets

. One might expect to observe a depletion effect due to either increasing sgRNA efficiency, or drug concentration, each producing regression "slopes" ( in log-transformed space ), with slopes for sgRNAs targeting non-essential genes being expected to be flat, regardless of predicted sgRNA strength. However, we observed that sgRNA efficiency and concentration effects are not independent—they interact in a non-linear way. sgRNAs that are too weak do not produce enough depletion of a drug target to cause sensitization, and sgRNAs that are too strong deplete a mutant to such low abundances that concentration-dependent effects are difficult to quantify. Often, there is a "sweet spot", or an intermediate sgRNA efficiency ( effect on growth phenotype ) which maximizes the concentration-dependent effect ( which could be different for each gene ). Our CRISPRi-DR model incorporates both sgRNA efficiency and drug concentration as parameters, and captures the non-linear interaction between them, where the "slopes" for the effect of drug concentration on relative abundance of mutants can be larger in magnitude for sgRNAs of intermediate efficiency, while being flatter ( slopes closer to 0 ) for sgRNAs of high or low efficiency. MAGeCK-MLE is the only other analytical method that take sgRNA efficiencies as an input; in that method, the empirical measures of efficiency are used to initialize the prior probability that each sgRNA is effective ( assuming each gene is represented by a subset of sgRNAs that are effective and others that are not ), which is combined with other conditional probabilities in a Bayesian framework to determine the posterior probability of interaction for each gene. However, we observed that MAGeCK-MLE often reports far more significant interactions that CRISPRi-DR or several other methods and has lower precision

. Some genes could exhibit weak phenotypic effects, conferring slight growth defects or advantages under antibiotic stress, even though they do not play any direct role in the mechanism of action or resistance to the drug. This is the reason that we advocate identifying genes that are outliers with respect to the rest of the population of genes, achieved through the empirical Bayes filtering step at the end, instead of just reporting all genes with slope coefficient statistically different from 0. We compared CRISPRi-DR to several other analytical methods, including MAGeCK-RRA, MAGeCK-MLE, DEBRA, CRISPhieRMix, CGA-LMM, and drugZ. Some of these methods incorporate multiple drug concentrations, while other incorporate sgRNA efficiency as an input to their models. CRPR-DR outperforms the others in terms of precision in both empirical and simulated data.
Researchers developed a community detection method called the weighted corrected stochastic block model (SBM) that does not assume genes are organized into assortative modules. Instead, the SB attempts to use all information in the co-expression network to separate genes into hierarchically organized blocks. Using RNA gene expression data from Drosophila melanogaster, the SB found ten times as many groups as competing methods, and several of these groups were not modular. The functional enrichment of non-modular groups was as strong as modular. This shows the transcriptome is structured more complex than thought, and the assumption of modularity is not the main driver of structuring gene-expression. The SB is different from other methods that attempt to find assortative modules and can capture alternative organizations. It uses a general measure of similarity to find gene groups that are not assortative but have biological interpretation. The SB can capture assortative pattern if present, but is general enough to capture other organizations. The method was compared to widely used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WNA) that relies on modularity. The SB found more groups, including non-modular, and the functional enrichment of non-mod groups as strong as modular. This highlights the need to incorporate sources beyond modularity when exploring biological networks.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Cytoplasmic poly ( A ) -binding protein ( PABPC; Pab1 in yeast ) is thought to be involved in multiple steps of post-transcriptional control, including translation initiation, translation termination, and mRNA decay. To understand both the direct and indirect roles of PABPC in more detail, we have employed mass spectrometry to assess the abundance of the components of the yeast proteome, as well as RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq to analyze changes in the abundance and translation of the yeast transcriptome, in cells lacking the PAB1 gene. We find that pab1Δ cells manifest drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, as well as defects in translation initiation and termination. Defects in translation initiation and the stabilization of specific classes of mRNAs in pab1Δ cells appear to be partly indirect consequences of reduced levels of specific initiation factors, decapping activators, and components of the deadenylation complex in addition to the general loss of Pab1’s direct role in these processes. Cells devoid of Pab1 also manifested a nonsense codon readthrough phenotype indicative of a defect in translation termination. Collectively, our results indicate that, unlike the loss of simpler regulatory proteins, elimination of cellular Pab1 is profoundly pleiotropic and disruptive to numerous aspects of post-transcriptional regulation. 

    Supporting Text:
    Numerous biochemical, structural, in vitro, and in vivo studies of specific mRNAs have identified pleiotropic roles for PABPC in cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylation, translation initiation, and translation termination [3]. However, because of PABPC’s multiple apparent functions, defining its transcriptome-wide roles has been difficult. High-throughput approaches exploring transcriptome-wide effects of PABPC depletion have been carried out in mammalian cells [40, 41], but none have been done in yeast. Consistent with observations in mammalian cells, we found that deletion of yeast PAB1 resulted in major changes in the transcriptome ( Fig 1B ), but only minimal changes in relative translation efficiency ( TE ) ( Fig 5A ). We showed that pab1Δ cells also drastically changed their proteome ( Fig 1A ). The significant reduction in ribosomal proteins suggests that global translation rates would decrease, yet we find TE of most mRNAs to be unchanged ( Fig 5A ), indicating that global mRNA levels are also decreased as a consequence of PAB1 deletion. Further, we provided the first evidence for a transcriptome-wide translation termination defect ( Figs 4 and 8A ). These results demonstrated the vast pleiotropic aspects of PAB1 deletion. Our proteomics data have provided insights to the direct vs. indirect consequences of PAB1 deletion and suggested a new layer of complexity to interpreting genome-wide gene expression alterations in PABPC-depleted cells. PABPC’s role in translation initiation has been elusive, partly because the extent of its activity is dependent on the stoichiometry between PABPC, poly ( A ) tracts, and basal translation levels [40], and these experimental conditions frequently vary between studies. Moreover, Pab1 appears to have preferential association with certain mRNAs [36]. Hence, it seems counterintuitive that depleting PABPC/deleting PAB1 reduces translation overall, yet relative TE is unchanged for most mRNAs [40, 41]

. Gene ontology analyses showed that up-regulated proteins belong to metabolic pathways, while down-regulated proteins are related to ribosome biogenesis, translation, and RNA-binding ( S1 Table and S4 Fig ). Indeed, the pab1Δ mutation led to substantial reduction in the levels of ribosomal proteins ( Fig 2A, bottom left ), multiple initiation factors ( Fig 2A, top left ), and some mRNA decay factors ( Fig 2B ). These results raised the question of whether the roles of Pab1 in translation and mRNA stability borne out of Pab1 perturbation experiments are at least partially attributable to this reduction in key proteins in these pathways in addition to Pab1’s direct roles in these processes. Hence, we explored the phenotypes of mRNA decay, translation initiation, translation efficiency, and translation termination upon PAB1 deletion, focusing on analyses of pab1Δpbp1Δ cells relative to pbp1Δ cells, and then considered whether the observed changes were direct or indirect effects of PAB1 deletion. Among its many functions, PABPC has important regulatory roles in mRNA decay [1–3]. Hence, we asked how the absence of Pab1 impacts the levels of mRNAs that are substrates of different decapping activators, namely Dhh1, Pat1/Lsm1, and the Upf factors of the NMD pathway. Dhh1, Pat1/Lsm1, and NMD substrates are defined respectively as mRNAs whose levels were increased in dhh1Δ cells, commonly increased in pat1Δ and lsm1Δ cells, and commonly increased in upf1Δ, upf2Δ, and upf3Δ cells, relative to WT [58, 59]. Approximately half of the mRNAs in each group showed significant changes in abundance in pab1Δpbp1Δ relative to pbp1Δ cells ( Fig 3 ). Of mRNAs that showed significant changes, those that are targets of either Pat1/Lsm1 or NMD or both tend to be increased rather than decreased ( Fig 3, row 2, columns 3–8, compare Up ( orange ) to Down ( purple ) )

. Overall, we demonstrated that targets of mRNA decay pathways followed the expected phenotypes upon PAB1 deletion, namely the tendency to stabilize, suggesting direct role of Pab1 in mRNA decay regulation. However, the depletion of some factors in the pathways upon PAB1 deletion cannot be completely ruled out as an indirect effect of this stabilization. Pab1 is thought to promote translation initiation by aiding the association of the 40S ribosomal subunit and the eIF4F complex with the mRNA 5’ cap through a direct interaction with eIF4G [2, 26, 29, 30, 66, 67]. Translation initiation defects may thus be expected when PAB1 is deleted. To investigate translation initiation, we analyzed ribosome profiling data of WT, pbp1Δ, and pab1Δpbp1Δ cells. Consistent with the expectation of translating ribosomes, ribosome footprints in all strains were found mostly with their P-site locations in the coding region ( CDS ), showed 3-nt periodicity, and consisted predominantly of footprints in the main reading frame ( frame 0 ) ( Fig 4 ). However, we observed subtle increased accumulation of ribosomes at the canonical AUG start codon and in the 5’-UTR region in the pab1Δpbp1Δ strain ( Fig 4B ), indicating a possible translation initiation defect in the absence of Pab1. To determine whether deletion of PAB1 affected initiation rates of all mRNAs equally, we assessed the change in relative translation efficiency ( TE ) of each mRNA between pab1Δpbp1Δ and pbp1Δ strains ( Fig 5A ). Although ~500 mRNAs show substantive increases ( “Up” ) or decreases ( “Down” ) in relative TE, most mRNAs ( >90% of the transcriptome ) do not show significant changes in relative TE ( Fig 5A, grey )

. These observations are akin to the effects of depleting eIF4G in yeast [88]. Since PAB1 deletion also reduced eIF4G mRNA and protein levels ( Fig 2A ), it is possible that effects attributed to the absence of Pab1 are at least partially due to dysregulation of eIF4G mRNA stability and the consequent reduction of eIF4G, which in turn reduced global translation initiation. This sequence of events is also likely for ribosomal proteins, as PABPC depletion has been shown to cause accelerated decay of mRNAs with short poly ( A ) tails [40], which usually are characteristics of highly expressed, highly translated mRNAs, including those encoding ribosomal proteins [3, 89]. Even when we focused our analyses on mRNAs that did have significant changes in TE, where their drastic changes may be due to specific factors outside of the global regulators of translation initiation, their properties are still related to eIF4G-dependent pre-initiation complex recruitment, eIF1-mediated start codon recognition, and efficiency of ribosome recycling ( Figs 5–7 ). Due to their intrinsic properties, these mRNAs with significant increase or decrease in TE are respectively more or less dependent on these processes than most mRNAs and are thus more sensitive to reduction in these factors in pab1Δ cells ( Fig 2A ). As a result, the direct role of Pab1 in initiation is masked by the changes in these core components of initiation, i. e., reduction of initiation factor levels cannot be completely ruled out as an explanation for the translation initiation defects observed in pab1Δ cells. It is also possible that the role of Pab1 in initiation is masked by the strain background used in our study, where yeast cells may have already altered their gene expression profiles to compensate for the lack of Pab1 over extended period of time upon full gene deletion and reached a steady state, because more widespread TE changes ( Fig 5A ) and proteome ( Fig 1 ) were observed in p1Δ cells compared to pb1 cells. In contrast to initiation, termination defects in p1 cells are less likely to be indirect effects of reduced levels of termination factors, as we found that p1 cells exhibited a nonsense codon readthrough phenotype indicative of a defect in termination ( Figs 4 and 8 ). Codon readthrough occurs when the ribosome stalls at a premature stop codon and continues to read the next codon in the same reading frame [90, 91]. We observed increased codon readthrough in p1 cells ( Figs 4 and 8 ), which is consistent with a defect in translation termination. Moreover, termination defects in p1 cells are not due to reduced levels of termination factors, as p1 cells have normal levels of eRF1A and eRF3 ( Fig 2 ), which are key components of the termination complex [92, 93, 94 ]. Our results suggest that P1 plays a direct role in translation termination, consistent with biochemical studies of mRN [3, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107 108, 109, 110, 111, 112 113, 114, 115, 116 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125 126, 127 128, 129 130, 131 132, 133, 134 135, 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362
Researchers have proposed a new mechanism for generating slow brain rhythms, such as those seen in slow-wave sleep or pathological conditions like seizures and spreading depolarization, which are accompanied by oscillations in extracellular potassium concentration. This mechanism is based on the interplay between fast-spiking dynamics and one-dimensional slow dynamics of extracellular potassium, mediated by the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase. Using bifurcation analysis of the system, they reveal that this coupling suffices to generate a hysteres loop around a bistable region that emerges from a saddle-node bifurcation, a common feature of class I excitable neurons. Depending on the strength of the Na+/K+-Pase, bursts are generated from pump-induced bifurcation, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolar block. The researchers suggest that transitions between these dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting Na+/Pase activity. A minimalistic model outlining the sodium-potassium pump's contribution to burst dynamics can contribute to better understanding pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes and inform therapeutic strategies. The mechanism applies to any neuron with class I excitability and demonstrates the sufficiency of Na+/Pase for generation of slow rhythmic bursting across a set of neuronal types.
Researchers developed the COPS (Clustering for Omics-driven Patient Stratification and robust evaluation of clustering results) package to evaluate and compare single and multi-omics clustering methods for disease subtyping. Current frameworks often overlook clustering stability and prognostic relevance, and do not allow for comparison between data-driven and pathway clustering. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity-based, kernel approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway integration, some of which are not accessible through R and correspond to new approaches. The framework was applied to multiomics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Unlike previous studies, the approach contrasts data and knowledge-driven multi-clustering methods and incorporates cross-validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using ARI, survival analysis via Cox models including covariates, and stability of results. The study highlights the importance of assessing multi-clustering using multiple criteria, from stability to prognostic relevance, and providing ways to compare metrics to select the optimal approach for disease discovery in novel datasets. Emphasizing multi-objective evaluation, the Pareto efficiency was used to gauge the equilibrium of metrics in each case study. Network Fusion, Integrative Non-Matrix Factor, and Multiple Kernel-Mans with linear Pathway Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with different outcomes in several studies.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Development of multicellular organisms requires well-orchestrated interplay between cell-intrinsic transcription factors and cell-cell signaling. One set of highly conserved transcription factors that plays diverse roles in development is the SoxC group. C. elegans contains a sole SoxC protein, SEM-2. SEM-2 is essential for embryonic development, and for specifying the sex myoblast ( SM ) fate in the postembryonic mesoderm, the M lineage. We have identified a novel partial loss-of-function sem-2 allele that has a proline to serine change in the C-terminal tail of the highly conserved DNA-binding domain. Detailed analyses of mutant animals harboring this point mutation uncovered new functions of SEM-2 in the M lineage. First, SEM-2 functions antagonistically with LET-381, the sole C. elegans FoxF/C forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the M lineage. Second, in addition to specifying the SM fate, SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and diversification of the SM lineage. Finally, SEM-2 appears to directly regulate the expression of hlh-8, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix Twist transcription factor and plays critical roles in proper patterning of the M lineage. Our data, along with previous studies, suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. Furthermore, our work identified new interactions in the gene regulatory network ( GRN ) underlying C. elegans postembryonic development and adds to the general understanding of the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins.

   . We present genetic evidence showing that this single amino acid change results in a partial loss of SEM-2 function. By analyzing the M lineage phenotypes of jj152 mutants, we uncovered an unexpected role of SEM-2 in the dorsal M lineage, where SEM-2 functions antagonistically at the level of expression and function with LET-381 in CC specification. We also found that SEM-2 regulates the expression of hlh-8, possibly directly, in the SMs, and that SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and the diversification of the SMs. Our work uncovered new interactions in the gene regulatory network underlying C. elegans postembryonic development, some of which are likely conserved in other species, and we add to the general understanding of the functions and structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins.

. At the same time, SMA-9 and LET-381 are each known to repress the expression of sem-2 in the dorsal side of the M lineage to prevent it from specifying the SM fate [6]. In addition to the factors described above that are important for proper fate specification in the M lineage, the sole C. elegans Twist ortholog, HLH-8, is known to function in proper patterning of the M lineage. HLH-8 is a basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factor that is expressed in the undifferentiated cells of the M lineage through regulatory elements located in the promoter, and it is expressed in the vulval muscles by autoregulation through E boxes located in its first intron [9, 10]. HLH-8 is known to have multiple functions during M lineage development: proper cleavage orientation of M lineage cells, proper proliferation of the SMs, and proper differentiation and function of the vulval muscles [11, 12]. In this study, we provide new insight into the relationships between various factors important in M lineage development and the sole SoxC transcription factor SEM-2. SoxC proteins are Sry-related HMG box ( Sox ) -containing transcription factors that are known to play critical roles in multiple developmental processes [13]. There are three highly conserved SoxC proteins in vertebrates, Sox4, Sox11, and Sox12. Abnormal expression or function of SoxC factors has been linked to a variety of developmental disorders and cancers [13–18]. In particular, mutations in Sox4 and Sox11, most of them being point mutations in the HMG box, are associated with a developmental disorder called Coffin-Siris syndrome ( CSS ) [19–21]. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not completely understood. We identified a new allele of sem-2, jj152, which is a point mutation resulting in a single amino acid change in a highly conserved residue at the end of the DNA-binding domain of SEM-2

. We were intrigued by the Susm phenotype of sem-2 ( jj152[P158S] ) because sem-2 ( n1343 ), which has a Tc1 transposon insertion that disrupts sem-2 expression in the SM lineage and exhibits a SM to BWM fate transformation phenotype, does not show any Susm phenotype ( Table 1, [6] ). We therefore decided to further explore the impact of the sem-2 ( jj152[P158S] ) point mutation on SEM-2 function, and the relationship between sem-2 and sma-9 in M-CC fate specification. sem-2 encodes the sole SoxC protein in C. elegans, whereas vertebrates have three SoxC proteins, Sox4, Sox11, and Sox12 [32]. SoxC proteins have a conserved DNA-binding domain, a serine-rich region, and a transactivation domain ( Fig 2A ). Amino acid P158 is located near the end of SEM-2’s DNA-binding domain and is conserved in SoxC homologs from vertebrates ( Fig 2A ). Structural modeling based on the co-crystal structure of mouse Sox4 and its cognate DNA showed that P158 is located in a flexible linker region of the domain but does not directly touch DNA ( Fig 2B, [33] ). It is likely that the P158S mutation alters the conformation of SEM-2, thus affecting its DNA-binding affinity or its affinity to other factors that function together with SEM-2. To begin to assess the functional consequences of the P158S mutation on SEM-2 protein, we tagged SEM-2 at the endogenous locus with GFP::2xFLAG using CRISPR. This endogenously tagged SEM-2 is functional as GFP::2xFLAG::SEM-2 animals are viable, fertile, and non-Egl. As shown in Fig 2C, GFP::2xFLAG::SEM-2 is nuclear localized in many different cell types, such as cells of the hypodermis, intestine, vulva and pharynx, similar to what we have previously reported using transgenic animals expressing a GFP-tagged SEM-2 in a fosmid backbone [6]

. We reasoned that there might be additional SoxC-binding site ( s ) in the endogenous hlh-8 genomic region that contributes to the activation of hlh-8 expression in the absence of the two putative SoxC-binding sites in Site1 and Site2. Alternatively, hlh-8 expression in the later stages of M lineage development does not depend on SEM-2.

. During our analysis of the mechanistic basis of the Susm phenotype of sem-2 ( P158S ) mutants, we noticed that sem-2 ( P158S ) mutants exhibit significantly reduced levels of expression of the transgenic hlh-8 transcriptional reporter jjIs3900[hlh-8p::nls::mCherry] ( Figs 5 and S4 ). In wild-type animals, hlh-8p::nls::mCherry is expressed in the M mesoblast and all undifferentiated cells in the M lineage from the 1-M to 16-SM stage. The sem-2 ( jj321[P158S] ) mutants display reduced expression of this reporter at all stages of M lineage development ( 100%, N = 234 ) ( Figs 5A–5F and S4A–S4C ). Similar reduction of hlh-8p::nls::mCherry expression was observed in the M lineage of sem-2 ( jj152[P158S] ) mutants ( 100%, N = 643 ). Moreover, the expression of another hlh-8 transcriptional reporter ayIs6[hlh-8p::gfp] [9] is also reduced in sem-2 ( jj152[P158S] ) mutants ( 100%, N = 599 ) ( S4D–S4G Fig ). Thus, the expression of two independent, transgenic, hlh-8 transcriptional reporters is significantly reduced in sem-2 ( jj152[P158S] ) mutants. To determine if the reduced expression of hlh-8 in sem-2 ( P158S ) mutants is specific to the hlh-8 gene in the M lineage, we examined the expression of mls-2 in sem-2 ( jj321[P158S] ) mutants using an endogenously tagged mNG::MLS-2 [35]. MLS-2 is a NK homeodomain protein that regulates patterning, cell fate specification, and proliferation in the early M lineage [36]. mls-2 is expressed starting at the 1-M stage in the M lineage [36]. We found no change in expression level or pattern of mNG::MLS-2 in sem-2 ( jj321[P158S] ) mutants compared to WT ( Fig 5G–5I ). These results suggest that SEM-2 specifically regulates the expression of hlh-8 in the M lineage. To determine if the change in hl-8 expression is sufficient to explain the Sus phenotype of sem-2 (152 ) mutants, we examined the expression of hl-8 in sem- (152[P158] mutants using the endogenous hl-8::GFP reporter [37]. hl- is a basic helix-loop-helix ( bHL ) transcription factor that plays critical roles in patterning, proliferation, and differentiation of the M lineage [38]. hl- is expressed in the undifferentiated cells of the lineage from the 1-M to 16 stage [38]. In sem- (321158 ) mutants, the hl-::FP reporter is expressed in the M but not in the SM ( Figs 5J–L and S4–H ). The expression of hl- in sem- (321 ) is similar to that in wild-type ( Figs 5J–L and S–H ). These results suggest that the change in hl-8 expression is not sufficient to explain the Sus phenotype of sem-2 (152 ) mutants. We conclude that SEM- regulates hl- in the M lineage, but the change in hl- expression is not sufficient to explain the Sus phenotype of sem-2 (152 ) mutants.
