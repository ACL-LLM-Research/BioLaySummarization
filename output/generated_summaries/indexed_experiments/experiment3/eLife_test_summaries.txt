Biologists have long known that nervous systems use both chemical and electrical synapses to communicate between cells. Chemical synapses are identified by their structural components, while electrical synapses are defined by the presence of a gap junction, a cluster of intercellular channels between neuronal processes. However, it is unclear whether electrical transmission requires additional cellular structures beyond the gap junction. To investigate this question, researchers studied single synaptic contacts on zebraf Mauthner cells, where gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release. Using expansion microscopy, they mapped the distribution of proteins at these contacts, revealing multiple gap junctions of varying in size and molecular composition. Notably, most of the synaptic surface was occupied by gap junction and adherens junction components, suggesting a close association between the two structures. In contrast, glutamate receptors were confined to small portions of the contact, indicating most of the area functions as an electrical synapse. The study found that an electrical synapse operates with multiple gap junctions in association with structural and signaling molecules of adherens junction. The relationship between intercellular structures will help establish boundaries of electrical syn found in animal connectomes and provide insight into syn diversity.
The article discusses the role of the pre-Bötzinger complex (preötC), a primary generator of inspiratory breathing rhythm, and its neurons that project directly to the facial nucleus VII motoneurons to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity. To understand the identity of VII-projecting preöt neurons, the authors used a combination of optogenetic and viral approaches to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects facial pad activity with minimal effects on breathing. The effects were altered by the type of anesthetic and anesthetized and conscious states. The population of VII-projecting preöt neurons consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved in regulation of autonomic activity. Modulation of subgroups of preöt neurons based on axonal projections is a strategy to improve understanding mechanisms that coordinate breathing with motor and physiological behaviors. This is important because abnormal modulation of autonomic and orofacial behaviors are associated with development and progression of diseases.
Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent aversive information and signal an alarm to the brain. These neurons are thought to serve as a general alarm system, modulating both passive and active defensive behaviors depending on the context of the threat. However, most research has focused on the role of CGRP in passive responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active behaviors. To address this, the role of CGRP in active behavior was examined using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Electrophysiological results showed that CGRP neurons encode aversive stimuli intensity through variations in firing duration and amplitude. Optogenetic activation of CGRP during robot chasing elevated responses in both conditioning and retention tests, presumably amplifying the perception of threat as more dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP exhibited reduced responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand the understanding of CGRP in the PBN as a critical alarm system, capable of dynamically regulating active behaviors by amplifying perception and ensuring adaptive responses to varying danger.
The study investigated the relationship between obesity and brain structure using diffusion-weighted MRI data from approximately 30,000 participants in the UK Biobank cohort. The researchers tested the hypothesis that waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is associated with regional differences in microstructural metrics: isotropic volume fraction (ISO) and index of free water, and intra-cellular volume (IC) index of neurite density. Significant associations were found in two distinct brain systems: the prefrontal/temporal/striatal system with ISO and medial/ temporal/occipital/statal system with IC. The ISO-WHR system co-located with genes for innate functions, decreased glial density, and high opioid (MOR) and other neurotransmitter density. Conversely, the IC-WHR system co-located with genes for G-protein receptors and decreased MOR and other receptors. Genetic correlations were estimated between WHR and ISO (r = 0.026, P = 0.36) and IC (r = 0.112, P < 9×10-4) as well as between WHR maps and equivalent CRP for ISO and IC (P < 0.05). The results suggest a two-way mechanistic model: genetically determined neurite density in the medial system may contribute to obesity, whereas water in the prefrontal system reflects a consequence of obesity by innate system activation.
The study investigated the role of cancer stem cells (CSCs) undergoing epithelial-mesymal transition (EMT) in driving metastatic dissemination in cancer models and its relevance to human tumours. While EMT has been observed in experimental models, it has not been seen in human tumour specimens. The authors previously identified EpCAM and CD24 as CSC markers alongside mesenchymal Vimentin to identify EMT CSCs in oral cancer cell lines, allowing them to investigate these markers in human tumours. They examined 12,000 fields from 74 oral tumours and found a significant enrichment of EpCAM CD24 and Viment co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour in metastatic specimens. Using an artificial neural network, they predicted metastasis with 87-89 accuracy. This study observed disseminating EMT CSCs in human cancer and found them highly predictive of metastatic disease.
Apoptosis and efferocytosis are evolutionarily conserved processes that play a crucial role in tissue repair. However, the mechanisms by which apoptotic cells are recognized and cleared during inflammation are not fully understood. This study used single-cell RNA sequencing to map the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds. The results show that apopt pathways and efferytosis receptors are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including Ly6+ macrophages during inflammation. Notably, diabetic wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferytosis genes and display efferyt signaling via receptor Axl and its ligand Gas. During early inflammation in wounds, Axl is upregulated in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR-independent mechanisms. In vivo studies reveal that Axl is required for wound repair but dispensable for eytosis. In contrast, inhibition of another eyt receptor, Timd, in wounds decreases eyt and abrogates repair. These findings highlight distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell coordinates repair and provide potential targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients.
Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have greatly enhanced our understanding of gene expression dynamics and cellular heterogeneity within tissues, enabling the creation of transcriptomic atlases. However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and identifying cell types corresponding to gene clusters in single-cell sequencing sets remains a challenge. To address this, a genetic barcoding approach was developed using Drosophila to tag defined cell populations in vivo. This method, Targeted Genetically Encoded Multiplexing (Ta-EM), involves inserting a DNA barcode upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-indible UAS-GFP construct, allowing the barcode to be read during single sequencing, labeling a population of interest. By creating many independently barcoded fly strains, Ta-EM enables identification of cell types in atlases, multiplet droplets, and barcoding time, conditions, replicates. Furthermore, Ta- barcodes can be read using next-generation sequencing for population-scale measurements.
The article discusses the evolution of novel phenotypes in the Dendrobatidae family of frogs, which have developed the ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for defense at least three times. However, previous studies have focused on colorful species with alkaloids, neglecting inconspic ones assumed to be undefended. To address this, the authors provide new data showing that undefended dendrobatids have measurable amounts of alkaloids, contradicting previous studies. They confirm that undefended dendrobats consume ants, a source of alkaloids, suggesting diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. The data support the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration, differing from seque in lacking transport and storage mechanisms yet resulting in low toxin accumulation. The concept of passive accumulation is discussed and its role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison and toxin-sequest organisms. The authors incorporate new and old data into an evolutionary model explaining acquired defenses in animals and the fate of ingested toxins.
Epithelial-to-mesymal transition (EMT) plays a significant role in chemotherapy resistance and is a challenge in treating advanced breast cancer. The complexity of EMT, involving redundant pro-EM signaling pathways and its reversal process, mesymal-to-epithelial (MET), has hindered treatment development. This study used a Tri-PMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) to comprehensively analyze EMT status of cells. Findings revealed ribosome biogenesis (Ri) during EMT and MET phases. R and its nascent protein synthesis by ER and mTOR signaling are essential for E/M completion. Inhibiting R genetically or pharmacologically impaired E/M capability. Combining R inhibition with chemotherapy reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal cells under chemotherapies. The study suggests targeting R presents a strategy for treating breast cancer.
Title: The Impact of Seedling Root Traits on Plant Establishment in Challenging Environments: A Study on Pearl Millet’s Adaptation to the Sahelian Climate

Abstract
    Pearl millet is a highly drought-tolerant cereal crop that serves as a vital food source in the sub-Saharan region. Its early root system features a fast-growing primary root, which is hypothesized to be an adaptation to the Sahelian climate. Using modeling, we demonstrate that drought is an important constraint in agro systems in the Sahel where pearl was domesticated. We show that increased millet primary root growth is correlated with increased water tolerance in field conditions. A genome-wide association and quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) studies identify genomic regions controlling this root trait. Combining gene expression, re-sequencing and reannotation of these regions, a glutaredin-encoding gene PgXC is identified as a candidate resilience root regulator. Functional characterization of its Arabidopsis homolog AtXY reveals a role in regulating cell elongation. Our study suggests a conserved function for GR genes in root elongation and resilience of millet in the Sahelian environment.
The article investigates the neural representation of concrete and abstract concepts in the brain during real-world processing, particularly in the context of watching a movie. The results show that concrete and abstract concepts are encoded in separable sets of brain regions, but these differences are reduced when multimodal context is considered. When abstract words are processed in visual scenes related to their meaning, the response becomes more concrete-like. Conversely, when the context is unrelated to the word, the pattern resembles abstract processing. The findings suggest that concepts encode habitual experiences, but the neurobiological organisation is dynamic and depends on available information.
Biomedical researchers have made significant progress in developing cancer immunotherapies, but their application is hindered by the limited number of targetable antigens on the surface of tumor cells. A cellular pathway called nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) degrades RNA from genes with truncating mutations, concealing neoantigens from the immune system. To identify mediators of NMD in human cells, a high-throughput screen based on rati analysis of transcripts was conducted. This screen implicated SMG1’s phosphorylation of UPF1 as a disruptor of NMD, leading to the design of a novel SM1 inhibitor, KVS1. KVS1 elevates expression of transcripts and proteins from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo. Notably, K1 concomitantly increases presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I peptides from N-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells. K1 provides opportunities for studying NMD and diseases where N plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases.
The study investigated the relationship between a new measure of aging, PhenoAge, and cancer risk in a cohort of 374,463 participants from the UK Biobank. Pheno was generated using chronological age and nine biomarkers, and PhenoAcc was calculated by subtracting the effect of chronological age by regression and incidence-weighted overall cancer polygenic risk score (CPRS) based on 20 site-specific polygenic risk scores (PRS). The results showed that older participants had a higher overall cancer risk, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.22 (95% CI 1.18-1.27) in men and 1.26 (1.22-1.31) in women. A joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAcc was observed on overall risk, with HRs of 2.29 (2.10-2.51) for men and 1.94 (1.78-2.11) with high genetic and older Pheno compared to low genetic youngereno. PhenoAcc was negatively associated with healthy lifestyle factors (Beta -0.01 in men, p<0.001; -0.98 women, p<0.001). Within genetic groups, oldereno was related to increased cancer risk, adjusting for chronological age. Adherence to a healthy lifestyle could retard aging.
The article discusses the importance of comprehensive biodiversity data for ecosystem protection and the role of the Biome app in gathering species observations from the public using identification algorithms and gamification elements. Since its launch in 2019, the app has amassed over 6 million observations. However, community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. To address this, species distribution models (SDMs) are used to estimate species distribution while accommodating bias. This study investigates the quality of Biome data and its impact on SD performance. The results show that species identification accuracy is above 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but below 90% for plants, mollusks, and fishes. SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals in Japan reveal that incorporating Biome data into traditional data improves accuracy. For endangered species, traditional data requires over 200 records for accurate models (Boyce ≥ 0.9), while blending the two sources reduces this to around 300. The coverage of urban-natural gradients by Biome data compared to traditional data towards natural areas may explain this improvement. Combining multiple sources better estimates species distributions, aiding protected area and ecosystem assessment. Establishing a platform accumulating community-sourced data contributes to conserving and monitoring ecosystems.
Biomedical research has shown that abnormal lung development can lead to congenital pulmonary cysts, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. While it is believed that cysts result from disrupted airway epithelial cell growth, the role of developmental defects in lung mesenchymal cells in abnormal airway epithelial growth and cyst formation is unclear. This study used mouse models to investigate the role of bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) receptor 1 ( Bmpra )-mediated signaling in lung mesyme during prenatal development and found that abation of mesymal Bmpra disrupted normal lung branching, leading to prenatal cyst formation. Severe airway muscle and subithelial fibers were found in cystic airways of mesym B1 knockout lungs. In addition, ectymal expression and airway epithelial perturbation of Sox-9 proximal axis were detected in mesym B1 knockout. Deletion of Smad, major BMP downstream effectors, from lungyme did not phenocystic abnormalities in mes Bmpr lungs, suggesting Sm-independent mechanism contributes prenatal cysts. These findings reveal the first role mesyme BMP in lung development and potential pathogenic underlying congenital cysts.
The study investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF) activity in living cells using super-resolution single-molecule microscopy. The results showed that EG and PI(4,5)P nanodomains aggregated in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells before stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF) through transient visits of EG to PI(4,5)P nanodomains. The degree of coaggregation decreased after EGF stimulation depended on phospholipaseγ, the EG effector hydrolyzing PI(4,5)P. Artificial in the PI(4,5)P content of the plasma membrane reduced the dimer and autophosphorylation of EG after with EGF. Inhibition PI(4,5)P hydrolysis after E stimulation decreased phosphorylation of EG-Th654. The study found that EG kinase and PI(4,5)P around EG molecules were mutually regulated.
The article discusses the unique metabolic pathway of glycolysis in Stramenopiles, a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that includes multicellular algae, fish, and pathogenic oomycetes such as Phytophthora and Blastocystis. Unlike most eukaryotes, Strameniles have a branched glycolysis, where the enzymes of the pay phase are located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. The study identifies a mitochondrial carrier in Blastocyst that transports glycol intermediates, such as dihydroacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the inner mitochondrial membrane, linking the cytos and mitochondrial branches of glycol. This carrier is distinct from the phylogenetically related human oxoglutar carrier SLC25 and dicarbox carrier S10, which transport malate and oxutar respectively. Blastocis lacks key components of oxidative phosphorylation for ATP generation, including complexes III, IV, synthase, and AD/ATP carriers. The glycol phase in the matrix generates ATP for energy-requiring processes, such as macromolecular synthesis, and NAD used by complex I to generate proton force for protein and molecule import. The glycol carrier has unique specificity and central role in carbon and energy metabolism, making it a potential drug target for Stramenile pathogens, which are economically important.
A new framework for genetic association studies has been proposed, which uses a deep learning model to calculate a genomic score for each haplotype in an individual. This score, called the Haplotype Function Score ( HFS ), replaces the traditional genotype in association studies. The HFS framework was applied to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank dataset, resulting in 361 independent HFS-trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8. Fine-mapping revealed 269 causal associations, an increase of 63 compared to single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP )-based analysis. H-based analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait and 153-tissue associations with biological interpretability, including ‘circadian-chronotype’ and ‘aridonic-intelligence. The HFS was integrated with SNP-based polygenic scores using least absolute shrinkage and selection ( LASSO ) regression, showing an improvement of 16.1–39.8 in cross-ance polygenic prediction. The study concludes that HFS is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits.
The study investigated the impact of three different types of mental training modules on hippocampal organization and stress regulation in 332 healthy adults. The training modules focused on either attention-based mindfulness, socio-affective, or socio-cognitive skills. The researchers used structural and resting-state fMRI to evaluate changes in hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic connectivity after 3 months of training. They also measured diurnal and chronic cortisol levels. The results showed that the socioffective module increased bilateral cornu ammonis ( CA-3 ) volume compared to socio-cognitive and waitlist groups. Functional connectivity of CA-3 also increased with socioffective compared to socio-cognitive. Changes in CA-3 structure and function correlated with cortisol reductions. A multivariate analysis found other subfields contributed to cortisol changes. The study found a link between socio-emotional intervention, hippocal structure and function, and cortisol in healthy adults.
The article explores the role of large-effect alleles and inversions in local adaptation in three species of sunflower: Helianthus annu, Helthus argyllus, and Helthus petolar. These species harbor large species-specific inversions that suppress recombination and facilitate the maintenance of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between locally adapted loci. The study aims to determine the fraction of adaptive response attributed to inversions and large-effect alleles and whether loci within inversions can drive adaptation in the absence of recombination-suppression. Genome-wide association studies were conducted to investigate patterns of local adaptation in the three species. The results show significant genome-wide repeatability of association signatures to phenotypes and environments, particularly within regions harboring inversions in one species. This suggests inversions facilitate local adaptation, but some loci can contribute substantially without recombination suppression in species lacking inversions. While many genomic regions show repeated adaptation, strongest associations are species-specific, indicating substantial genic redundancy for local adaptation in species.
The study investigated the effects of aging on the mammary epithelium, a bilayer of two phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages: luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Mammary luminal epithelial cells exhibit stereotypical changes with age and are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers. The researchers hypothesized that aging effects on lineage maintenance increase cancer susceptibility. They analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myepithelial cells from younger (<30 years old) and older (>55 years) women. Results showed age-dependent changes in gene expression and increased transcriptional variance that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. Age-dependent responses were common to both lineages, while directional changes were exclusively in luminal epithelial and involved regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SAT1. Epithelial expression of gap junction protein G6 increased with age, and modulation of G6 in co-cultures revealed it provided communication from myepith that drove change in luminal. Age luminal transcriptomes comprised a signal detectable in tissue aging and transition into cancers. A machine classifier based on lum-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer and was highly predictive of breast subtype. The study suggests luminal epith are the site of aging responses in surrounding tissue and emergent phenotype endows with ability to become cancer-cells and represents biosensor presages cancer susceptibility.
Biologists have long sought to understand the genetic basis of natural variation in plant resistance to pests, but this requires extensive and labor-intensive phenotyping experiments. To address this challenge, researchers explored the possibility of using non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing as phenotyping proxies. They analyzed whole-genome and epigenome sequencing data from 207 lines of the plant species Thlaspi arven grown in a common environment and colonized by aphids, mildew, and microbes. The results showed that non-target reads assigned to pest species differed between populations, had significant SNP heritability, and were associated with climate origin and glucosinolate content. Lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, less favorable to aphids, had higher aphid load, indicating decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants in defense genes and novel regions associated with aphid and mildew load. Differentially methylated regions were found associated with pathogen loads, particularly transposons and hypomethylation in a gene promoter of stomatal closure induced by pathogens. This study provides insights into defense mechanisms of Thpi arven, a crop model species, and demonstrates non-target sequencing can estimate plant biotic interactions. With increasing large datasets, this approach has broad application in fundamental and applied research.
The article discusses the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat malaria, a major obstacle to disease eradication efforts due to drug resistance. Drug combinations based on collateral sensitivity, where resistance to one drug increases sensitivity to the partner, have been proposed to suppress resistance emergence in pathogen populations. This study explores collateral sensitivity between compounds targeting Plasmodium dihydroorate dehydrogenase (DHODH). The study profiles cross-resistance and collateral phenotypes of several DHH mutant lines to a panel of DHH inhibitors. One compound, TDCM-334, is active against all tested lines, including DH C276, which arose with clinical candidate DSM. Six selections with TDC-334, the most resistance mechanism is copy variation of dhod locus. One mutation, DH263, confers resistance TDC-334 but not DSM. Selection of DH276 with TDC-334 yields additional changes in dhod locus. Double mutants exhibit decreased sensitivity TDC-334, highly resistant DSM. The study tests whether collateral can suppress emergence in combination by exposing wildtype to DSM and TDC-334 simultaneously. This selects parasites with DHVA mutation, cross-resistant both, as fit wildtype in vitro. The emergence highlights mutational flexibility DH enzyme.
Biomedical researchers have long recognized that the emergence and spread of antimalarial drug resistance varies significantly across different geographic regions, with the majority of infections occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. However, resistant strains often emerge in low-transmission areas. Current models of resistance evolution lack consensus on the relationship between transmission intensity and resistance, possibly due to overlooking the interplay between antigenic diversity, host immunity, and selection for resistance. To address this, a novel compartmental model was developed that tracks sensitive and resistant strains, as well as the dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity. The results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance, regardless of resistance cost or efficacy. Validation using chloroquine-resistant data supports this trend. Discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-trans regions, while steadily decreases in high-divers, high-trans regions. The study highlights the critical role of malaria diversity in geographic patterns of resistance.
The article presents a study on the effects of Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ-THC), the most abundant phytocannabin in cannabis, on early embryonic development. The study used a stepwise in vitro system to investigate the impact of Δ-TH on embryonic processes. The results show that Δ-TH increases the proliferation of naive mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) but not their primed counterparts. This increased proliferation is dependent on the CB receptor and associated with moderate transcriptomic changes. However, Δ-TH increases the metabolic activity of ESCs by increasing glycolytic and anabolic capabilities. This metabolic rewiring is retained throughout differentiation to Prim Germ-Like Cells in the absence of direct exposure and associated with alteration of transcriptional profile. The study provides the first molecular characterization of the impact of Δ-TH on early stages of gerine development.
The study investigated the genetic diversity of NLR (nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat) genes in the zebraf fish (Danio rerio), a species known to have hundreds of NLR genes, which play a crucial role in the immune system. By sequencing 93 zebraf from multiple wild and laboratory populations, a total of 151 NLRs were identified, exceeding the previously known 400. Approximately half of these NLRs were present in all wild populations, but only 4% were found in 80% or more of the fish. Wild zebraf had up to two times more NLR per individual and up to four times more NLR per population than laboratory strains. In contrast to the high gene copy number, nucleotide diversity in zebraf NLR genes was low, with half being monomorphic and the remaining having few polymorphisms, suggesting purifying selection.
The article reports the discovery of a new species of ovules from the Famennian stage of the Late Devonian period in Xinhang, Anhui, China. The new taxon, Alamenia tri gen. sp. nov., is characterized by the presence of three integumentary wings extending outwards and inwards along the abaxial side, enclosing most of the nucellus. The ovule is borne terminally on dichotomous branches and lacks a cupule. This finding suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cup may have evolved for photosynthetic and wind dispersal functions. In contrast to previous ovules from the same period, which were usually surrounded by a cupule, this new species indicates that the winged ovules may have originated earlier than other dispersal mechanisms such as plume and papp. Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged ovules are more adapted to wind dispersal than those with one or four wings under the same conditions.
Abstract Summary: Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia is a type of hematological malignancy characterized by the presence of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. Despite the success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in prolonging patient survival, intolerance and relapse, and TK resistance remain significant issues. This study identifies a novel leukemogenic process where RSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph leukemia, and RSY mediates neddylation of B-ABL. Neddylated B-ABL enhances its stability by inhibiting CBL-mediated degradation, and phosphorylates RSY to activate its NEDD8 ligase activity, promoting BABL stabilization and disease progression. In contrast, in vivo PROTAC-based degraders are ineffective, depletion of RSY expression or its ligase activity decreases BABL stability, inhibiting tumor formation and growth. These findings provide an alternative to tyrosine kinase activity for oncoprotein leukemic cells and a rationale for targeting RSY-mediated B- nedlation in Ph leukemia treatment.
Abstract-derived peptoglycan hydrolases, also known as lysins, have emerged as potential alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to their ability to degrade peptoglycans and low risk of resistance development. However, the discovery of these enzymes is often hindered by the limited availability of phage genomes. To address this challenge, a new strategy was developed to mine peptoglycan hyrolases from bacterial proteomes using lys-derived antimicrobial peptide-priming. As a proof-of-concept, peptogcan hyrolases from Acinetobacter baumannii proteome were identified using Ply307 lys-derived peptide as a template. Five peogcanrolases were identified, with PH10 and PH11 showing potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after 100°C for 1 hour, while the other three were thermosensitive. The crystal structures of PH8, PH10, and PH11 were solved, revealing that hyperthermostable PH10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by dimeromer transition, while thermosensitive PH8 formed a monomer. Mouse models of bacterial infection demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PH10. This antimicrobial-prim strategy provides new clues for the discovery of antimicrobial drugs.
A retrospective study was conducted using data from the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) and electronic health records of 6.9 million patients from 1994 to 2018, of whom 23,592 were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The Danish Cancer Registry included 18,523 of these patients. To complement the registry data, a text mining approach was used to extract symptoms from clinical notes in health records of 3,078 cancer patients and 30,780 controls. Both sources were used to generate and compare symptom trajectories to uncover patterns prior to pancreatic diagnosis in the same patients. The text mining of clinical notes complemented the registry by capturing more symptoms before cancer diagnosis, including ‘blood pressure without diagnosis’, ‘abnormal heartbeat’, and ‘intestinal obstruction’ not found in registry analysis. Chaining trajectories identified two groups with lower survival (<90 days) ‘Cough→Jaice→intestinal’ and ‘pain→JaiceAbnormal function’. The study provides a comparison of two pancreatic symptom trajectories which can leverage full potential of data and provide fuller picture of early risk factors for cancer.
The study investigated the relationship between slow oscillations (0.5–1 Hz) and fast spindles (12.5–16 Hz) during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) sleep in children and adolescents and adults. Previous research has shown that the synchronization of fast sples during slow oscillations is a key feature of adult NREM sleep, but little is known about how this relationship develops across age. The study used individualized detection of single events to characterize age-specific patterns of slow and fast sples, oscillations, and their coupling in children aged 5–6, 8–11, and 14–18 years and adults 20–26 years. The results showed that the type of fastles was developmentally specific and nested in a range below the canonical spindle range for most children, but the slow-oscillation-spindle pattern was evident for sples in the adult canonical range in all groups, but less precise in children. Measures of spindle maturity indicated similarity to adult canonical sples and oscill maturity reflected slow dominance, with oscill-spindle patterns. Importantly, spindle maturity was uniquely associated with oscill-sp coupling strength and precision across groups. The study suggests that the ability to generate adult canonical sples enables precise oscill-sp patterns from childhood to young adulthood.
The article discusses the persistence of a phenomenon where genes that were already identified prior to the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 continue to be featured in present-day publications, despite the advent of high-throughput technologies that have identified novel genes associated with biological processes and diseases. The authors propose that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-stud genes between the completion of -omics experiments and reporting of results. Conversely, understud genes may even accrue a greater number of citations. Among 45 biological factors proposed to affect genes being studied, 33 are associated with the choice of genes in titles and abstracts of -omics studies. To promote understud genes, the authors condense insights into a tool, find understud genes ( FM ) that allows scientists to engage bias during selection of hits. The utility of FM is demonstrated through the identification of underst genes in vertebrate aging. FM is developed and available for download as a MacOS/Windows app.
Artificially sweetened beverages containing non-caloric monosaccharides have been proposed as a healthier alternative to sugar-sweetened beverages. However, the potential effects of these non-caloric monacides on blood vessel function are not well understood. To investigate this, a zebraf model was developed that exhibits excessive angiogenesis in response to high glucose, mimicking the hyperangiogenic characteristics of proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ). Using this model, glucose and nonoric monacides were found to induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels ( ISVs ). Excessively branched vessels were formed by ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells ( ECs ) into tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of ECs exposed to high glucose revealed increased capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and upregulated proangiogenic genes. Further experiments confirmed that fox1 mediated excessive angiogenesis by monacides via upregulating marck1. This study provides evidence of negative effects of nonoric monacides on vascular system and underlying mechanisms.
The study investigated how the brain processes and stores multiple sequences of information in working memory (WM). Participants were asked to memorize a sequence of items with different colors and locations, and then reproduce the sequence of colors and locations in order. The researchers manipulated the consistency between the location and color trajectories of the sequences. The results showed that sequences with consistent trajectories improved memory performance and a correlation between color and location sequences. Additionally, sequences with consistent trajectories showed neural reactivation of common trajectories and spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations. Furthermore, neural reactivation correlated with WM behavior. The findings suggest that a shared structure is used for storing multiple sequences through encoding and replay, facilitating organization in WM.
**Summary: Mutations in the Human PUR Gene Cause Neurodevelopmental PURA Syndrome: A Study Reveals Protein’s Susceptibility to Structural Impairment**

   Mutations in the human PUR gene have been identified as the primary cause of neurodevelopmental PUR syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by developmental delays and intellectual disability. Unlike other genetic disorders, nearly all mutations in the nucleic acid-binding protein result in full penetrance of the disease. This study aimed to investigate the impact of mutations on PUR’s localization and structure. Researchers observed that mutations in PUR impair its localization to processing bodies, either destroying its integrity, RNA binding, or dimerization. The study also solved the crystal structures of the N and C-terminal domains of human PUR and combined with molecular dynamics and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The results showed unusually high dynamics and promiscuity of PUR, indicating the protein’s susceptibility to structural impairment. This may explain why even conservative mutations in PUR result in full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PUR syndrome.
The study investigated the interaction between transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) and anoctamin 1 (ANO) in the regulation of water efflux in exocrine glands, specifically sweat glands in mouse foot pads. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that TR4 colocalized with cytokeratin 8, ANO, and aquaporin-5 (AQP5) in sweat glands, suggesting a functional interaction between TR4 and ANO. Mouse sweat glands showed TR4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases that were inhibited by menthol. Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type, but not TR4-deficient mice, and inhibited by menthol in wild-type and TRPMKO mice. Basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by ANO inhibitor. The results suggest that TR4 is involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interaction with ANO. TR4 expression was significantly higher in normidrotic skin from patients with acquired generalized anhidrosis (AGA) compared to anhidrotic skin from AG. The study also found that wild mice climbed a slippery slope more easily than TR4-deficient mice, indicating that pers may be important for maintaining friction in foot pads.
Biologists have long been fascinated by the diverse shapes and sizes of the cerebral cortices across different species. Despite this diversity, a new study presents a universal description of primate cortices. The research reveals that all cortices can be described as a series of nested folds of different sizes. As these folds merge, the cortices of 11 primate species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory that overlaps with 70 other mammalian species. The findings indicate that all cortices approximate the same archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of 2.5. This new understanding enables precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale. To demonstrate its importance, the study shows scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology. A more than fourfold increase in size is observed from two standard to eight standard deviations at a scale of 2mm compared to morphological analyses. This new understanding may generate biomarkers for a range of conditions in future.
The study investigated the role of the NF-κB transcription factor RELA in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumours. RELA is a master regulator of immune and stress responses and was found to be upregulated in PDAC tumours. Using live-cell imaging, the authors observed that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNα) stimulation induced rapid and sustained non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA in PDAC cells. Further analysis of single-cell datasets revealed that REL heterogeneity in PDAC cells was dependent on actin dynamics. RNA sequencing identified clusters of REL-regulated genes in PD cells, including TNα-induced upregulation of actin regulators NU2 and ARHG31. Depletion of ARHG31 and NU2 altered TNα-stimulated REL dynamics in PD cells, establishing a negative feedback loop that regulates REL activation by TNα. The study also characterised the NF-κ pathway in PD cells, identifying interactions between NF-κB proteins and REL in the presence or absence of TNα. The results provide evidence for interdependence between the actin network and NFκ pathway REL translocation in PD.
Biomedical research has shown that a delicate balance between excitation (E) and inhibition (I) is crucial for proper brain function. Disruptions in the GABAergic system, which regulates this balance, are common in neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mutations in Phosphase Tens Homolog (PTEN), a negative regulator of the phosphatidyositol 3-phosphate/Akt pathway, are linked to ASD. However, it is unclear whether PTEN affects inhibitory and excitatory signaling differently. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system, both excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABA inputs regulate muscle activity, d-PT mutations impact GABA but not cholin development and function. This results in a deficiency of inhibitory signaling. The GABA system in d-PT mutants is due to reduced DAF activity during development. Ketogenic diets (KDs) have been effective for disorders with E imbalances. A diet enriched with ketone body-hydrobutyrate during development induces DAF activity, improving GABA development in d-PT mutants. This study provides insights into PT and neurodevelopment defects and the mechanisms of KDs.
The innate immune response triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, with pro-inflammatory cytokines playing a critical role in viral containment. Using quantitative and qualitative models, researchers discovered that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes potently inhibit SARS-CoV-induced cell fusion in infected cells. Through cytokine screening, interleukin-1 (IL-1) was identified as a key mediator that inhibits syncytia formation by various SARS-CoV strains. Mechanistically, IL-1 activates Rho/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor pathway, driving actin enrichment at cell junctions, preventing syncytia formation. In vivo experiments in mice confirmed IL-1 restricted SARSV-2 spread in lung epithelium. This study reveals the function and mechanism of IL-1 on SARSV-induced cell fusion, highlighting an antiviral role for cytokines during infection.
The study investigated the role of insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in Drosophila, which are analogous to mammalian pancreatic beta cells, in regulating metabolic homeostasis. The researchers used electrophysiological recordings to quantify the effects of nutritional and internal state changes on IPC activity and found that nutritional state strongly modulates IPC activity. IPC activity decreased with increasing periods of starvation. Refeeding with glucose or fructose, two nutritive sugars, significantly increased IPC activity, whereas nonutritive sugars had no effect. In contrast, glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity. This is similar to the mammalian incretin effect, where glucose ingestion drives insulin release more than intravenous application. In contrast, Diure hormone 44-expressing neurons in the intercerebralis ( DH44s ) responded to glucose perfusion. Functional experiments showed that DHs do not affect IPC activity while other DHs inhibit them. This suggests that populations of autonom and systemically sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain homeostasis. Activating IPC had a satiety effect on food-search behavior and reduced starvation-induced activity, whereas activating strongly increased activity. The study demonstrates that IPC and DHs are part of a modulatory network that orchestrates homeasis and adaptive response to shifts in metabolic state.
Biomedical researchers have long relied on endogenous tags to visualize and study proteins in live cells, but generating human cell lines with endogenous tags has been challenging due to the low efficiency of homology-directed repair. A new approach has been developed using the splitNeGreen protein to generate a large-scale endogenous library in HEK cells. This technique has the potential to be applied to human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), enabling the study of protein function in healthy cells and differentiated types. To achieve this, an iPS line was engineered to express a fragment of the splitNeGreen protein (NG-10), which enabled fast and efficient endogenous tagging of the fragment (NG). Additionally, neural network-based image restoration allowed for live imaging of dynamic processes such as cytokinesis in iPS. This work represents a step towards a genome-wide endogenous library in human cells.
The article presents a novel platform for creating electrolytic lesions through chronically implanted intracortical multielectrode probes without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology. A custom-built current source provides stable current for controlled, repeatable lesions in awake animals. The performance of this lesion technique was validated using histology ex vivo and in vivo, current traces from the device, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesion. This method avoids disruptive procedures, provides millimeter precision over the extent and submill precision the location of the injury, and electrophysiological recording of-unit activity from the remaining population after lesion. The technique can be used in areas cortex, species, and theoretically with multielectrode. The low-cost device can easily be adopted into electrophiology setup. This is expected to enable investigations of the population’s role in function while providing insight into reorganization after loss.
Bees play a crucial role in pollinating agricultural crops, but their populations are threatened by the use of pesticides. One of the main risks bees face is the poisoning of nectar and pollen by insecticides. Studies on the detection of neonicotinoids have produced conflicting evidence about whether bees can taste these pesticides in sucrose solutions and avoid them. This study used an assay of food aversion combined with single-sens electrophysiology to test whether the mouthparts of the buffailed bumblebee ( Bombus terrestris ) detect the presence of pesticides in a solution mimicking the nectar of oilseed ( Brassica napus ). The results showed that bees did not avoid solutions containing concentrations of imacloprid, thiamox, clothin, or sulfox spanning six orders of magnitude, even when these contained lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations altered spiking in gustatory neurons through a reduction in firing or change in adaptation rate. These findings provide strong evidence that bumblees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant pesticides using their mouthparts. As bees rarely contact nectar with other parts, it is predicted that they are at risk of unwittingly consuming nectar of pesticide-treated crops.
The article presents a study on the dynamics of Plasmodium knowlesi infection in non-human primates (NHPs) in Southeast Asia, a zoonotic malaria parasite of public health concern and a barrier to malaria elimination in the region. Due to the lack of systematic surveys, zoonotic disease dynamics in wildlife are rarely quantified at macroecological scales. The study aims to investigate the geographic determinants of Plasium know prevalence in NHP reservoirs. A meta-analysis of 632 NHP from 148 sites reveals heterogeneous prevalence across Southeast Asia, with low overall prevalence and high estimates for Malaysian Borneo. Regions with higher NHP prevalence overlap with human infection hotspots. The study links parasite transmission in wildlife and humans to land conversion and fragmentation. Using remote sensing data and statistical models, it identifies relationships between Pl know in NHP and forest fragmentation, suggesting prevalence may be contingent on habitat complexity, explaining geographic variation in parasite burden. These findings address gaps in regional Pl know epidemiology, indicating N reservoirs may drive human spillo risk.
The rise of angiosperms to dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic era marked significant transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. To understand how trophic interactions were influenced by host shifts and paleogeographical events, researchers integrated molecular and fossil data to construct a phylogenetic tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the family Belidae. The results indicate that the crown group Belidae originated approximately 138 million years ago in Gondana, associated with Pinops conifer host plants, with larvae developing in dead/decaying branches. Belids tracked their hosts as major movements occurred during Gondana’s breakup, surviving on distant disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to angiosperms and cycads when conifers declined, evolving new troph interactions including broodoll mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorous paras angperms.
The article presents a study on the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution in hepatocellular carcinomas, a type of liver cancer. The researchers analyzed data from hundreds of samples taken in two and three dimensions to understand how tumour cells grow and evolve over time. They found that tumour cells primarily grow uniformly throughout the tumour volume, rather than at the surface. The study also investigated how mutations and cell death contribute to tumour growth. The results provide new insights into early tumour evolution in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the field of spatial biology.
The article reports on the discovery of a novel neuroendocrine mechanism regulating seasonal polyphenism in the insect Copsa chinensis, specifically the transition from its summer-form to winter-form. Previous research has shown that low temperature and the receptor CTR regulate this transition by impacting cuticle content and thickness, but the underlying mechanism was unknown. The study identifies Bicon, also known as tanning hormone, as a key player in this process, responsible for hardening and darkening the cuticle. Two subunits of Bicon, Cursα and Cursβ, were found to be regulated by low temperature and CTR, and form a heterodimer that influences cuticle chitin and thickness. The study also shows that Curs acts as the Bicon receptor and plays a role in upstream of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer to winter. Additionally, miR-2 was found to target Curs, regulating Bicon signaling in seasonal polyism. The findings reveal a novel neuroendocrine mechanism underlying seasonal polyism and provide insights into the Bicon and its receptor. The study contributes to understanding how insects adapt to environmental challenges by increasing phenotypic diversity.
Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to current treatments. A mutation of the lysine 27 residue on histone H3 (H3-K27M) is a driver in DMGs, reshaping the epigenetic landscape of these cells to promote tumorigenesis. H3-K27 gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. In search of effective treatment, the therapeutic potential of dual targeting histone deacetylases (HDs) and MYC in these tumors was examined. Treatment of H-K27 patient-derived cells with Sopin, an inhibitor of MY-driven in vivo, in combination the HD inhibitor Vorin, resulted in decrease in cell viability. Transcript and epigen profiling revealed synergistic of this combination in downregulation of oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. In vivo studies of patient-derived orthopic xenograft showed significant tumor reduction in mice treated the combination. These results highlight combined with HD inhibitors as a therapeutic for these aggressive tumors.
The white-footed deermouse (Peromyscus leucopus) is a long-lived rodent that serves as a reservoir for several zoonotic diseases in North America, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and viral encephalitis. Notably, this deerm remains persistently infected with these pathogens without apparent disability or diminished fitness. To investigate the immune response elicited by various pathogens, the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to compare genome-wide transcription in blood of P. leopus, Mus musculus, and Rattus norvegicus and adjusted for white cell concentrations. The results showed that deerm were distinguished from mice and rats by LPS profiles consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages. L-treated P. leopus, in contrast to mice and rats, displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes. These characteristics of P. leopus were also noted in Borrelia herms infection. The phenomenon was associated with reduced transcription of endogenous retroirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern receptors in deerm. The results reveal a mechanism for infection in this species and perhaps other animal reservoirs for human disease.
Caspases (CASP) are a family of proteases involved in the cleavage and activation of gasdermin, an executor of pyroptosis. In humans, CAS3 and CAS7 recognize the same consensus motif DD, present in gasdermin E (GME). However, GME is cleaved by CAS3 but not CAS7. The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear. This study identified pyrotic puffer GME that was cleaved by puffer CAS/7 and human CAS/7. Domain swapping between puffer and human CAS and ME showed the ME C-terminus and CAS7 subunit determined cleavage of ME by CAS. CAS7 contains a key residue that governs CAS discrimination. This residue is conserved in vertebrate CAS and most vertebrate except mammalian CAS. In mammals, residue is conserved non-primates but not prim. However, CAS cleaved human ME not ME. These findings revealed mechanism CAS discrimination and divergence CAS7-mediated ME activation vertebrate. Results also suggested mutation-mediated alteration CAS enabled divergence and specialization CAS members regulation complex activities mammals.
The article reports on a single-blind, placebo-controlled study examining the neural and behavioral effects of ketamine in 40 healthy participants. Participants received an initial ketamine bolus of 0.23mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 0.58mg/hr. Resting-state functional connectivity was quantified via global connectivity and related to ketamine-induced symptom variation and gene expression. The results show that ketamine’s effects are multi-dimensional, reflecting inter-individual variability. A principal component analysis revealed that ketamine-driven neural effects matched somatostatin (SST) and parvalbum (PB) cortical expression in humans, while the mean did not. Behavioral symptom variation mapped onto distinct ketamine gradients resolvable at the single-subject level. The study highlights the importance of considering individual variation in response to ketamine and has implications for precise pharmacological biomarkers in psychiatry.
The RNA world hypothesis proposes that the first self-replicating units of life emerged in the form of RNA-like polymers, which autonomously replicated without enzymes. However, this raises the problem of non-enzymatic replication, as the formation of hybridization between template and copy strands reduces replication kinetics, leading to parabolic growth with competitive coexistence. To address this, we investigated the information-maintaining ability of parabolic growth in stochastic multispecies models under constant population size and chemostat conditions. We found that large population sizes and small replication rate differences favor the coexistence of most replicator species, alleviating the error problem of exponential amplification. Additionally, GC content and resource competition rate determine the number of coexisting variants, suggesting fluctuations in block availability favored cycles of exploration and exploitation. Stochastic parabolic growth may have played a role in preserving sequences generated by abiotic synthesis, providing genetic material to early evolution of ribozymes.
The article describes the role of non-structural protein 5 (Nsp) in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which cleaves viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides necessary for replication. Nsp is shown to cleave human tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TR1), a host enzyme required for post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs. In SARS-CoV-infected cells, TR1 levels and TR-catalyzed tRNA modifications are decreased, consistent with TR cleavage by Nsp. Nsp cleaves TR1 at a specific site matching the SARS-2 polyprotein cleavage consensus sequence, and a mutation in this site inhibits Nsp-dependent cleavage of TR1. The cleaved TR fragments exhibit altered RNA activity and are unable to rescue tRNA in TR1-deficient human cells. Compared to wild-type cells, TR1-deficient cells infected with SARS-CoV exhibit reduced intracellular RNA. These findings indicate Nsp cleavage of TR1 and perturbation of tRNA patterns contribute to SARS-CoV pathogenesis.
Many disease-causing microbes are not obligate pathogens, but rather environmental microbes that take advantage of an ecological opportunity. The existence of microbes whose life cycle does not require a host and are not normally pathogenic, yet are well-suited to host exploitation is an evolutionary puzzle. One hypothesis posits that selection in the environment may favor traits that incidentally lead to pathogenicity and virulence or serve as pre-adaptations for survival in host. An example of such trait is surface adherence. To experimentally test the idea of ‘accidental’ virulence, populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were evolved to attach to plastic for hundreds of generations. Along with adherence, two multicellular phenotypes—biofilm formation and flor—increased; another, pseudohyhal growth responded to nutrient limitation. Thus, selection led to the evolution of highly-adherent, hypermultic strains. Wax larvae injected with hyperic strains were significantly likely to die than those with nonic strains. Hence, selection on adherence incidentally led the evolution of multicellularity and virulence. Our results support the idea that selection for trait in open can generate opportunistic ‘accidental pathogens.
Proteins containing prion-like domains (PLDs) are known to play a crucial role in the formation of biomolecular condensates and are susceptible to misregulation due to amino acid mutations. To investigate the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of PLDs, researchers employed a residue-resolution coarse-grained model, Mpipi, to simulate 140 mutants from six proteins: hnRNP A1, TDP-43, FUS, EWS1, RBM14, and TIA. The simulations revealed the existence of scaling laws that quantify the range of change in critical temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino sequence mutations. These laws are consistent with physicochemical properties of mutations and extend across the entire tested family, suggesting that scaling can be used to predict changes in stability of PL condensates. The study provides a quantitative insight into the emergent behavior of PL solutions in response to physico changes of PL molecules.
The article presents a novel approach for predicting an individual’s cognitive traits or clinical conditions using brain signals, focusing on the dynamic patterns of brain activity over time. Traditional methods rely on structural or time-averaged measures, such as connectivity or cortical thickness, but neglect the unique unfolding of brain activity over time. This is due to the complexity of describing dynamic patterns with high-dimensional models and uncertainty in using them for prediction. The authors propose using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to describe dynamic connectivity and amplitude, combined with a Fisher kernel for prediction. The Fisher kernel is constructed from the HMM in a mathematically principled manner, preserving the underlying structure. They demonstrate the H-Fisher kernel’s accuracy and reliability using fMRI data, comparing it to other prediction methods: time-vary and time-aver functional-based connectivity models. The approach leverages time-vary and functional information for prediction, with applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalized medicine.
The article describes the role of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRK2) in the context of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Crohn’s disease, where variants of LK2 lead to increased phosphorylation of its substrates. The study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating LK activity and identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LK-dependent phosphorylation of its substrate, Rab10. Using a combination of imaging and immunopurification methods, the authors isolated lysosomes and demonstrated that Rab12 is recruited to damaged lysosomes, leading to an increase in LK-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10. PD-linked variants, including LK R144G and V35D, resulted in increased LK recruitment to lysosomes and elevated lysosomal levels of pRab10. These findings suggest a conserved mechanism where Rab, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates LK recruitment and phosphorylation of its substrates at lysosomes.
The study aimed to improve the understanding of cell cycle dynamics in non-adherent cells by combining a specialized surface-enhanced cell attachment method, FUCCI (CA2) sensor, automated image analysis pipeline, and machine learning algorithm. This approach enabled precise measurement of cell cycle durations in non-adherent cells. The method was validated using acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi, which exhibit unique cell cycle characteristics. The impact of cell-modulating drugs on NB4 cells was also tested. The cell analysis system, compatible with adherent cells, is fully automated and freely available, providing detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. This presents a valuable tool for cancer research and drug development, enabling comprehensive automated cycle analysis in adherent and nonherent cells.
The study investigated the relationship between social and ecological constraints on the evolution of cognition in primates using an interdisciplinary approach combining cognitive neuroscience and behavioral ecology. The researchers used brain imaging data from 16 primate species to measure the size of two prefrontal brain regions, the frontal pole ( FP ) and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DFC ), involved in metacognition and working memory. The results showed that the size of these regions, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by three variables: body mass, daily distance traveled an index of ecological constraints, and population density an index of social constraints. This suggests that ecological constraints had a strong influence on FP and DFC volumes, indicating that metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging skills in primates. FP volume was more sensitive to social constraints than DFC volume, consistent with laboratory studies showing FP’s implication in complex social interactions. The study highlights the relative weight of social vs ecological constraints on the evolution of prefrontal brain regions and associated cognitive operations in primates.
The study aimed to investigate how muscle fibers grow in response to increased mechanical loading, such as during exercise, and whether this growth is due to an increase in the size of myofibrils (myofibril hypertrophy) or the number of myofils (myillogenesis). Muscle fibers are primarily composed of myofils, and understanding the mechanism of growth is crucial for muscle development and repair. Electron microscopy (EM) can provide high-resolution images but is a time and cost-intensive process. To address this, a novel method was developed to visualize myils using a standard microscope, fluorescence imaging myils with deconvolution (F-ID). This method produced images with high resolution and contrast, allowing for automated measurements of myil size and number. After validation, the method was used in mouse and human models of increased loading to show that muscle fiber growth is largely due to myogenesis, not myil hypertrophy.
The article discusses the role of SNAP25, a neuronal SNARE protein involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and its mutations associated with epileptic encephalopathy. Three mutations in SNAP25 were studied: V48, D166 in the synaptagmin-1 (Sy1) binding interface, and I67, which destabilizes the SNARE complex. These mutations reduced Sy1-dependent vesicle docking to SN-carry liposomes and Ca2-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and in mouse hippocampal neurons. The V48 and D166 mutants showed reduced readily releable pool (RP) size due to increased spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) release and decreased priming rates. These mutations lowered the energy barrier for fusion and increased release probability, gain-of-function not found in Sy1 knockout (KO) neurons; normalized EP release rates were higher in D166 than V48 in Sy1 KO. These mutations increased association with partner SNAREs, resulting in unregulated fusion. In contrast, the I67 mutant decreased EP frequency and evoked EP amplitudes due increased energy for fusion barrier, while RP size was unaffected. This was partly compensated by lowering energy. Pathogenic SNAP mutations changed the energy for priming and fusion.
The study analyzed data from 30 countries to investigate the relationship between the proportion of women in a scientific discipline and the quality and funding of research in that discipline. The results show that a higher proportion of women in a discipline is associated with lower quality of research and lower funding. This effect is observed in both men and women, and is robust to the number of research outputs and bibliometric measures where data are available. The study builds on previous findings that women’s work is undervalued, regardless of who performs it.
The article discusses the development of a new strategy called ‘P3’ editing, which enables the activation of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing through protein-protein interactions. This approach links the formation of a functional CRISPR-C9-Cas9 guide RNA complex to protein-protein proximity. By engineering the crRNA:acrRNA interaction, the authors demonstrate that various protein-protein interactions and chemically induced dimerization of protein domains can be used to activate editing in human cells. Additionally, they show that P3 can incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, allowing specific RNAs to induce genome edits within a circuit. This strategy enhances the controllability of CRPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic circuits in living cells.
The article discusses the role of the KCNQ/KC1 channel complex in mediating the slow-rectifier current (IK) during the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential in cardiomyocytes. Mutations in IK are associated with Long QT syndrome (LTS), a condition characterized by a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG), increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. A potential therapeutic intervention for LTS is targeting IK channels to restore function and normalize the QT interval. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PAs) are potent activators of KCQ channels, activating IK by binding to two sites: one in the voltage sensor domain, shifting voltage dependence to more negative voltages, and the other in pore, increasing maximal conductance (G). However, the mechanism by which PAs increase Gmax of IK channels is unclear. Additionally, IK channels have small single-channel conductance and low probability, and whether PAs affect these properties is unknown. The study suggests the selectivity filter in KCQ is unstable, contributing to low probability, and PU-induced increase in Gmax caused by stabilization of selectivity in open-conductive state.
Vitamin B6 deficiency has been associated with cognitive impairments in various brain disorders, but the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies are not well understood, and whether vitamin B supplementation improves cognition is unclear. Pyridoxal 5-phosphate phosphatase (PDX), an enzyme controlling pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PL) levels, the coenzymatically active form of vitamin B, may represent an alternative entry point into vitamin6-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological PDX inhibitors to test this concept are lacking. This study identifies PDX-dependent decline of PL levels in the murine hippocampus, providing rationale for PDX inhibitors development. Using small-molecule screening, crystallography, and biolayerometry, 7,8-dihydroflavone (7,8HF) is discovered as a direct PDX inhibitor. 7,8HF binds reversibly inhibits PDX with micromolar affinity and submicrom potency. In hippocampal neurons, 7,8HF increases PL in PDX-dependent manner. These findings validate P as a druggable target. 7,8HF is a well-stud molecule in brain models, although its mechanism is debated. Discovery of 7,8 as P inhibitor offers mechanistic insights into surrounding 8-mediated effects in brain.
The development of the gonad in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a complex process that involves the production of diverse cell types and their precise positioning and migration. However, the coordination of these processes during development is not well understood. The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure, which is guided by the migration of distal tip cells (DTCs), resulting from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (Z1 and Z4). The polarity of Z1 and Z4, which is mirror-symmetric, is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Fizzled receptor and Wnt proteins (WN-1, WN-2, and EGL-20) with distinct roles. In LIN-17 mutants, WN-2 promotes normal polarity in Z and Z, while WN-1 promotes normal polarity in Z and Z, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of Z and Z. In LIN-17 EGL-20-WN-2 mutants, polarity of Z is reversed, resulting in frequent mis-migration of DTCs to the posterior. Further analysis shows that mispositioning of Ds in the gon due to polarity of Z leads to misigration. Similar misigration is also observed in C-1 RNAi animals producing ectopic Ds. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of Ds to establish a mirrorymmetric organ.
The article explores the concept of drug resistance tradeoffs in the context of multidrug therapies, where resistance to one drug can result in increased sensitivity to another. However, the reliability of these tradeoffs remains unclear, as observed drug-resistant mutants in the clinic and laboratory settings are often biased towards those with large fitness benefits. To address this, the authors performed experiments using lineage-tracking to capture a broader spectrum of mutations that provide yeast cells an advantage against fluconazole, an antifungal drug. They quantified fitness tradeoffs for 774 mutants across 12 environments, grouping them into classes with characteristic tradeoffs. The unique tradeoffs suggest each group affects fitness through different mechanisms. Some groupings were unexpected, such as mutants resistant to single drugs but not combinations, and same gene mutants with different tradeoffs. These findings highlight the difficulty in relying on consistent tradeoffs for multidrug design, but also demonstrate that hundreds of mutations can be reduced to a few with characteristic tradeoffs. This may enable multidrug strategies leveraging tradeoffs to combat resistance. By grouping mutants affecting similar mechanisms, the study guides efforts to map phenotypic effects of mutations.
The article discusses the phenomenon of central bias or contraction in working memory, where the magnitude of items stored in memory appears to be biased towards the average of past observations. This bias is thought to be an optimal strategy of the brain to learn the statistical structure of sensory input. On the other hand, recency biases such as serial dependence are also observed and thought to reflect content of working memory. Recent results from an auditory comparison task in rats suggest that both biases may be more related than previously thought. When the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) was silenced, both short and long-term biases were reduced. A model of circuit is proposed that may be involved in generating the behavior, showing that working memory susceptible to shifting to past experience producing short sensory biases naturally leads to contraction. Errors at the level of trials are sampled from the distribution of stimuli and not due to shift of memory towards sensory mean. The results are consistent with a set of findings and provide performance across different distributions and timings, intervals, as well as dynamics in working areas. The model is validated by a set of experiments in auditory parametric working task.
The study investigated the role of PD-LIM-containing protein 2 (PIM2) as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer and its potential as a target for cancer therapy. Previous research suggested that PIM is repressed in lung cancer and contributes to chemotherapy and immunotherapy resistance. This study analyzed PIM genetic and epigenetic changes in human lung cancer samples and used a mouse model of refractory lung cancer to evaluate the efficacy, mechanism, and safety of systemically administered PIM expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (nanoPIM) combined with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs. Results showed that PIM repression in lung cancer is due to genetic and epigenetic alterations. NanoIM showed low toxicity, high specificity, antitumor activity, and improved efficacy of PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, with complete remission in mice and substantial tumor reduction in remaining mice by triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoIM increased major histocompatibility complex I (MHC) expression, multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR) induction and survival and tumor-related gene expression in cells, and enhanced lymphocyte infiltration, turning tumors hot and sensitive to IC and chemotherapeutic and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (IL) by IC. These studies established a clinically applicable PIM-based therapy for lung and possibly other cancers.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how animals evaluate food quality and adjust their feeding behavior to survive in challenging environments. However, the mechanisms that regulate this physiological system, which monitors nutrients from ingested food and influences feeding behavior, are not fully understood. To address this, a study established a high-quality food evaluation system using heat-killed E. coli ( HK-E coli ), a low-sugar food. The results showed that HK-E coli triggers an unfolded protein response ( UPR ) and immune response in animals, causing them to avoid low-quality food. The system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPR ( I-RE1/X-1-1 ) innate immunity ( PM-1/p38 MAP ) axis, particularly neuronal function, which regulates feeding behaviors. Moreover, animals can adapt to low-quality food through sugar supplementation which inhibits UPR-PM-1 regulated response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. This study reveals the role of cellular stress pathway as physiological system for evaluating nutritional deficiencies in food, enhancing survival in environments.
Biologists have long recognized the importance of carbohydrates in biological processes, but their role in modulating drug targets such as G-protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate how carbohydrates activate GPCRs by focusing on P2 purinoceptor 14 ( P2Y14 ), a receptor involved in inflammation and immune responses. The researchers combined molecular dynamics simulations and functional studies to identify the uridine diphosphate ( UDP )-sugar binding site on P2. They found that UDP-glucose activates the receptor by bridging transmembrane ( TM ) helices 2 and 7 of P2. A conserved bridging salt chain ( K.60-D.64.-K.35.36 ) was identified to distinguish UDP-sugars, including UDP-glucose, UDPgalactose UDPgluronic acid and UDP-acetylucamine. This chain was found to be a conserved motif for sugar binding both P2 and P purinoceptor 12 (2. Based on this, three sugar nucleotides were designed as P12 agonists. These findings expand understanding of purergic receptor activation and provide insights for carbohydrate drug development for GPC.
The study investigated the role of glial cells in regulating the behavior of Drosophila neural stem cells (neuroblasts (NBs), which are encased by glial cells. The results show that ferritin produced by glial cells cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for energy production, essential for self-renewal and proliferation of NBs. Knockdown of glial ferritin genes causes energy shortage in NB via downregulating aconase and NAD+ levels, leading to low proliferation and premature differentiation of NB mediated by Prospero entering. Ferritin is a potential tumor suppressor. Glial ferritin level is affected by NB status, establishing bicellular iron homeostasis. The study demonstrates that glial cells are indispensable for self-renew of NB, revealing a novel role of glial niche in brain development.
The article investigates the relationship between cancer and COVID-19 mortality in the US population during the 2020 pandemic. Using multiple cause of death ( MC ) data for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s, the study found that cancer mortality rose by only 3% over the pre-pandemic baseline, resulting in approximately 13,600 excess deaths. In contrast, deaths from diabetes increased by 37% and Alzheimer’s by 19. Notably, mortality was higher for less deadly cancers ( breast, colorectal, and hematological ) than for cancers with poor survival rates ( lung and pancreatic. To understand these differences, the study simulated excess mortality for each condition using COVID-19 attack rates, life expectancy, population size, and age of individuals with each condition. The results show that mortality disparities are primarily due to differences in life expectancy, with the risk of death from deadly cancers outweighing the risk of death from COVID-19.
The article discusses the role of the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of R-loops from eukaryotic genomes. R-loops are transcriptional products consisting of an RNA-DNA duplex joined to a displaced strand of genomic DNA. While the effects of R-loops on health and disease are well established, the cellular processes responsible for their removal are not fully understood. The study reveals that the Smc/6 complex plays a crucial role in the removal of R-loops formed during transcription. Yeast mutants defective in the Sm5/6 complex and enzymes involved in R-loop resolution show synthetic lethality and accumulate high levels of RNA-DNA structures in their chromosomes. The Sm/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA hybrids in vivo and promotes R-loop degradation by RNase in vitro. The results show a crucial role for the Sm/6 in removal of R-lo at highly transcribed genes and telomeres.
The study investigated the relationship between age-related loss of sensory acuity and preserved attentional filtering abilities in older adults. The research aimed to determine if preserved attentional filtering could compensate for age-related sensory decline and if this compensatory mechanism is longitudinally stable and predictive of individual changes in listening behavior. The study used electroencephalographic and behavioral data from 105 individuals aged 39-82 years. The results showed that despite expected age-related decline in sensory acuity, listening performance remained stable over 2 years. However, attentional filtering and behavioral measures were only correlated at separate time points (T1 and 2) but not longitudinally. The findings suggest that attentional filtering is not a reliable predictor of individual changes in listening behavior, as neither filtering at T1 nor its 2-year change could predict 2-year behavioral change under combined modeling.
The study investigated the role of chemosensation, the combination of taste and smell, in the perception of flavor, in predicting the use of medicinal plants in ancient Greece and Rome. Chemosensation enables animals to detect high-value foods and avoid toxins, and humans have learned to use unpalatable and toxic substances as medicines. However, the importance of chemosensation in this process is poorly understood. The study generated taste panel data for drugs and applied phylogenetic generalized linear models to test whether intensity and complexity of chemosensory qualities, as well as tastes and flavors, can predict ancient Greek and Roman drug use. The results show that chemensation is strongly predictive of therapeutic use: drugs with high versatility have simple tastes and intense flavors, and 21-22 chemosens qualities predict at least one therapeutic use. In addition to the common notion of bitter medicines, sweet, musky, and soapy drugs are also associated with versatility. The study suggests that uses of drugs were based on observed effects consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste pharmacology.
Bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family, including non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica, Escherichia, and Citrobacter, are associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and bacteremia and are a leading cause of death from sepsis in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. These bacteria are prone to entering the bloodstream, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study reports that clinical isolates of these bacteria are rapidly attracted to human serum, simulating GI bleeding using an injection-based microfluidics device. Femtol volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce attraction. The response is through chemotaxis and chemoattract L-ser, an amino acid abundant in serum recognized by chemoreceptor T. Crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimium Tsr with L-ser are reported, identifying a conserved amino motif for L-ser among Tsr orthologues. Tsr is conserved among Enterobacteraceae and WHO priority pathogens with bloodstream infections. Enterobacter use serum as a nutrient source for growth and chemaxis and T provide a competitive advantage for migration into hemorrhagic lesions. This behavior is defined as ‘bacterial vampirism’, related to proclivity for bloodstream infections.
Biologists have long believed that male cells across different species share a common origin and therefore retain a conserved genetic program that defines their identity. However, the unique dynamics of male cells and widespread leaky transcription have made it difficult to identify the core spermatogenic program. To address this, researchers analyzed the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species to describe the conserved origin of metazoan male cells at the molecular level. They found that the average metazoan male cell requires the expression of approximately 10, 000 protein-coding genes, a third of which are deeply conserved genes retained throughout evolution. These conserved genes contain a set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene regulators that represent the core of the conserved program of metazo spermatogenesis. By studying the acquisition and maintenance of male cell identity, they identified 161 previously unknown sperogenesis genes and three potential causes of human infertility. These findings highlight the importance of evolutionary history on reproductive disease and establish a cross-species pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell and pathologies.
Biologists have long sought to understand how the flagellate organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii coordinates its flagellar beating to swim and steer. The organism employs a breast-like flagellar motion, modulating beating amplitudes to change direction. This strategy relies on inherent flagellar asymmetries, such as response to chemical messengers, and mechanical coupling between flagella. However, how flagellar asymmetries persist in synchrony remains unclear. It has been speculated that one flagellum leads the other, as its properties appear to be copied. This study combines experiments, computations, and modeling to elucidate each flagellum’s role in synchronous beating. A non-invasive technique selectively loads each flagell, showing coordinated beating responds to load on flagellum. Asymmetry derives from unilateral coupling between flagella. Results highlight distinct role each flagell in coordination and implications for biflagellate behavior.
The study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting. It was found that intermittent fasting promoted the production of interleukin-22 ( IL-22 ) by type 3 innate lymphoid cells ( ILCs ), which led to the browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of ILCs increased the browning of white adipose in diet-induced obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the browning of subcutaneous whiteose. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor ( IL-22 ) attenuated the browning induced by intermittent. Single-cell sequencing of intestinal cells revealed that fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon signaling in ILCs. Analysis of cell-cell interactions indicated that fasting stimulated ILCs with dendritic and macrophages. These results established the role of ILCs in browning whiteose, suggesting the ILC/IL/IL-22 axis contributes to the benefits of intermittent.
The article presents a study on defensive behavior in mice subjected to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm to investigate the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic responses. Mice were exposed to a compound stimulus (CS) consisting of tone and white noise (WN) periods paired with footshock. The paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone and explosive jumping and darting during WN. In contrast, the unpaired and reverseCS groups showed less tone-induced freezing and rarely jumped or darted during WN. During extinction, the paired group’s tone-induced freezing decreased and shifted to a combination of freezing and darting. The unpaired, unpaired, and shock-only groups displayed tail rattling and dart during SCS with minimal freezing and jumping. The reverse group did not jump to WN and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction. These findings suggest that non-associative factors promote some responsiveness but associative factors are required for cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight.
Biologists have long been interested in understanding how insects navigate their environment and keep track of their direction. Previous studies have shown that insects encode their head direction as a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons in an eight-column structure. However, it was unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding of direction was an evolutionary coincidence or offered a functional advantage. To address this question, researchers established the mathematical requirements for direction encoding and showed that it could be performed by many circuits with different activity patterns. Among these patterns, they found that the sinusoidal was the most resilient when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity between neurons. This optimal pattern was compared to anatomical data from the locust and fruit fly head circuits, showing agreement with experimental evidence. The predicted circuit was also shown to emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying neural connectivity did not need to be encoded in the insect genetic program but could develop during development. The theory explained the presence of eight-column head circuits across multiple species as not a chance but by evolutionary principles.
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations in the PTEN kinase 1 (PINK) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CIS1, a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulf-binding protein, is a target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination. In this study, CIS1 was found to form dimers in Pink mutant flies and dopaminergic neurons from PD patients with PINK mutations. These dimers consist of two monomers covalently linked by a disulfide. In this conformation, CIS cannot coordinate the ironulf cofactor. Overexpressing CISD, the Drosophila ortholog of CIS1, and a mutant CIS incapable of binding the ironulf cluster in Drosila reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This effect was more pronounced in CIS and Pink mutant flies. Complete loss of CIS, however, rescued detrimental effects of Pink mutation on climbing ability, posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. The results suggest CIS, probably ironpleted CIS, operates downstream of Pink, shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CIS1 as potential therapeutic target.
The study investigated the role of the virulence protein SAP54 produced by the parasitic phytoplasma in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP54 is responsible for inducing leaf-like flowers in phytopma-infected plants. However, previous research showed that insects were attracted to leaves and leaf-like flowers were not required. This study found that exposure to leafopper males is necessary for the attraction, suggesting a response that distinguishes leafopper sex in the presence of SAP. In contrast, phytopma effector alongside leafopper discourages female colonization. SAP suppresses biotic stress pathways in leaves exposed to males. The host MADS transcription factor vegetative phase ( SVP ) emerges as key in leafopper preference for exposed plants to males, with SAP promoting S degradation. This preference extends to colonization of male-exposed SVP mutant plants over not exposed. The study demonstrates the dual role of phytopma effector SAP in host alteration and attraction integral to phy cycle. SAP targets S, heightening leafopper vulnerability to males, facilitating attraction and subsequent colonization by insects. SAP acts as a molecular ‘match’ helping leafoppers locate mates by degrading S-containing leaves. This study provides insights into parasite extended phenotypes and transcription factors regulating plant processes intersecting plant-insect interactions.
Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that poses a significant threat to human health and has a substantial socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments are ineffective, in part, because C. albicans can initiate a drug tolerance response that allows some cells to grow at drug concentrations above their minimal inhibitory. To characterize this cytoprotective program at the single-cell level, a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform was used to profile thousands of fungal cells and establish subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antif drugs. Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell stage with metabolic and stress responses. At 2 days after fluconazole exposure, a time tolerance is measurable, cells bifurcate into two subpopulations : one characterized by upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal, rRNA machinery and mitochondrial respiration, termed Riboomin ( Rd ) and the other for genes stress and processes termed Stressomin ( S. This bifcation persists 3 and 6 days after treatment. The ribosome stress response ( RAST ) is activated in these subpopulations may facilitate survival.
The article presents a new approach to measuring the effectiveness of selection in species by developing the Codon Adaptation Index Species (CAIS), which corrects for confounding factors in previous metrics that compare codon bias across species. In an idealized models, population size determines the minimum selection coefficient required for deleterious variants to be purged and neutral diversity. However, empirical estimates of population size are often based on putatively genetic diversity and assumed to capture selection effectiveness. A direct measure of selection is the degree to which preferred codons are maintained. Previous metrics are confounded by species variation in GC content and amino acid composition. The CAIS uses Kull-Leibler divergence to correct for these confounders. The authors demonstrate CAIS and Effective Number of Codons show protein domains of highly adapted vertebrate species have higher intrinsic disorder.
Seps is a leading cause of millions of deaths worldwide and a global health priority declared by the World Health Organization. It is characterized by dysregulated immune responses, indicating the need for strategies to target inflammation. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) is an important mediator of inflammation, released by inflamed host cells and bacteria in a strain and growth-dependent manner. This study investigated mechanisms of bacterial ATP release using mutant Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) strains. Results show that ATP release is dependent on ATPase within the bacterial inner membrane and impaired outer membrane integrity contributes to ATP release, associated with bacterial death. In a mouse model of abdominal seps, effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using transformed E coli bearing arabin-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released. Abating bacterial release shows that ATP suppresses local immune responses, reducing neutrophil counts and survival. In addition, ATP has systemic effects via outer membrane vesicles ( OMV ). Loaded OMV are distributed throughout the body and upregulate genes degranulation in neutils, potentially exacerbating seps severity. This study reveals mechanisms of ATP release and its local and systemic roles in seps pathogenesis.
The study investigated the relationship between psychotic-like experiences (Ps) in children and the risk of psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders, as well as the role of genetic and environmental factors in mediating this relationship. It was hypothesized that adaptive cognitive functioning, influenced by genetic and environmental factors, mediates the relationship between these factors and childhood Ps. The study used large-scale longitudinal data from 6,602 children in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Study to examine the relationships between genetic and environmental factors, such as familial and neighborhood environment, with intelligence and current and future Ps. The study leveraged multimodal data to estimate the joint effects of phenotypic scores (PS), familial socioeconomic status (SES), and environment on cognitive and Ps. The study controlled for ethnicity-defined schizophrenia PS and unobserved confounders using computational modeling. The findings indicate that lower intelligence and Ps are associated with lower PS for cognitive phenotypes, familial SES, neighborhood, and less supportive environments. Intelligence mediates the effects of these factors on Ps, with positive parenting and school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing Ps. The study highlights the influence of genetic and environmental factors on Ps through their effects on intelligence. The findings suggest that improving school and family environments and promoting economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children.
The article discusses the role of the morphogenetic factor FGF8 in establishing positional cues for cellular responses during early telencephalic development in human cerebral organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The study aimed to investigate the effects of FGF signaling on neural identity and differentiation using an in vitro platform. The results show that FGF treatment increases cellular heterogeneity, leading to the co-development of telencephalic and mesencephalic domains in multi-regional organoids. In telenceph regions, FGF influences anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, affecting spontaneous network activity. FGF also modulates key regulators of several neurodevelopmental disorders. The study demonstrates that FGF signaling is involved in regional patterning and cellular diversity in human organoids and modulating genes associated with normal and pathological neural development.
The study investigated the development of sleep and feeding patterns in Drosophila larvae and their relationship to circadian rhythms. Early in life, sleep and feeding patterns are disorganized, but become consolidated into day and night cycles as the animals mature. In Drosila, the circadian rhythms are initiated by the formation of a circuit connecting central clock to arousal neurons, enabling long-term memory ( LTM ). However, the cues that trigger the development of this circuit are unknown. The study found that in the 2nd instar larval stage, sleep and feeding are spread across the day, becoming organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar stage. Forcing mature larvae to adopt immature feeding strategies disrupts sleep rhythms and LTM. The development of the clock circuit itself is influenced by larval nutritional environment. Arousal neurons in larvae drive daily rhythms through glucose genes. The data suggest that changes in energetic demands trigger formation of sleep-circuits and behaviors.
Biologists have long observed that many animals moving through fluids, such as schools of fish, exhibit highly coordinated movements that are thought to reduce the cost of locomotion. However, direct measurements demonstrating the energy-saving benefits of fluid-mediated movements have remained elusive. To investigate this phenomenon, researchers studied the metabolic energy expenditure of giant danio fish (Devarioequipatus) in both solitary and schooling conditions. The results show that schools of fish exhibit a concave-shaped metabolism-speed curve, with a minimum metabolic cost at approximately 1 body length per second. In comparison to solitary fish, schools reduce total energy expenditure (TEE) per tail beat by up to 56%. When swimming at maximum sustained speed, fish in schools have 44% higher aerobic performance and 65% less anaerobic energy compared to solitary individuals, lowering TEE and cost of transport by up to 53%, the lowest recorded for any aquatic organism. Fish in schools also recover from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish. The anaerobic energy savings when swimming at high speeds in schools can improve both peak and repeated performance, likely beneficial for evading predators. These energy savings may underlie the prevalence of group locomotion in fishes.
The article discusses the role of alveolar macrophages (AM) in the lung and their response to interferon-gamma (IF-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) stimulation. AM are the predominant immune cells in the lung and play a crucial role in preventing infection and are a target for host-directed therapy. The study examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) in their resting state and after priming with IF-γ or IL-4 to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung. The results show that human macrophages, regardless of origin, had a strong glycolytic response to IF-γ stimulation. IFγ significantly enhanced energetics in both AM and M by upregulating glycol and oxidative phosphorylation. Upon stimulation, AM did not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike M which shifted to ‘Warburg-like’ metabolism. IF-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM. Blocking glycol with 2-deglucose reduced IF- driven cytokine production in AM, indicating IF- induces plasticity in AM mechanistically mediated by glycol. Direct comparing responses between macrophages, AM were more responsive to IF- priming and dependent gly for cytokine secretion M. Interestingly, TNF was under control of gly in AM and not M. M exhibited glycol-dependent upregulation HLA-DR and CD40 whereas IF- up HLA and CD on AM independently gly. The data indicate human are functionally plastic and respond to IF in a manner from M. These provide evidence that human are tractable for inhalable immunomodulatory for respiratory diseases.
For the first time, researchers have demonstrated that nocturnal ants use the polarized light pattern produced by the moon for navigation. While the sun and moon can provide directional information through their position, they can be obscured by clouds, canopies, or the horizon. However, these bodies can still provide information through the polarized light they produce. The sun produces polarized light across the sky as it enters the atmosphere, and polarized light is a well-known cue for navigating animals. The moon produces an analogous pattern, albeit a million times dimmer than sunlight. The study shows that polarized moonlight is part of the nocturnal ants’ celestial compass. Nocturnal ants leave their nest at twilight and rely on the solar polar pattern to navigate. However, foragers return home when the sun cannot guide them. The study demonstrates that ants use polarized moonlight to navigate at night by rotating the overhead pattern above homing ants, altering their headings in response. Furthermore, ants detect this cue throughout the lunar cycle, even crescent moons when polarized levels are lowest. The study also shows the long-term incorporation of moonlight into the ants’ path system for homing as polar is incorporated throughout day.
**Summary of the Article: Unveiling the Aerodynamic Secrets of Early Pterosaur Flight**

Pterosaurs, the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, relied on their tails to maintain control and stability during flight. Early pter had long, stiff tails with a mobile base that allowed them to shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. However, these tails ended in a tall, thin vane that would compromise aerodynamic efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. Maintaining stiffness in the vane was crucial for early pter flight, but how this was achieved remained unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pter and absent in birds and bats. A recent study used Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence to investigate the structure of the vanes in earlyter. The results revealed a cross-link lattice within the vanes that supported a dynamic tension system to maintain stiffness. This system allowed the tail to augment flight control and the vane function as a display structure.
Adolescent development is marked by significant changes in reward-related behaviors, social behaviors, and decision-making, which are essential for transitioning into adulthood but also increase vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. The reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence is thought to underlie these changes and increased vulnerability. This study used fast cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine dopamine release and mechanisms in the nucleus accumbens (Nac) core of adolescent (28-35) and adult (70) male rats. Baseline differences were found between adult and adolescent-stimulated dopamine release in rats, as well as opposite effects of α nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACh) on dopamine release. The α-selective blocker α-conotoxin increased dopamine in adolescent rats but decreased dopamine in adult rats. Blockade of GABA and GAB receptors revealed α-mediated increase in adolescent release requires N GABA signaling. In vivo microdial confirmed the role of αA and G in mediating this effect. Results suggest a multisynaptic mechanism unique to adolescence involving acetylcholine at α-containing A to drive GABA on dopamine release.
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by distinct behavioral traits, suggesting shared underlying pathogenic mechanisms. However, its vast clinical and etiological heterogeneity indicates diverse phenotypes. Recent studies using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have found that individuals with two distinct ASD subtypes, idiopathic and 16p.2 deletion, exhibit reduced neural precursor cell (NPC) neurite outgrowth and migration, despite whole-genome sequencing showing no genetic overlap between datasets. To identify differences contributing to these defects, an unbiased phospho-proteome screen was performed. Surprisingly, hundreds of shared peptides were identified between subtypes, including the mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling was confirmed in NPCs across both ASD subtypes and mTOR modulation rescued ASD phenotypes and autism-associated NPC phenotypes in controls. Our studies demonstrate that distinct ASD subtypes have common neurite outgrowth and migration defects driven by shared pathogenic mTOR signaling dysregulation.
The article presents a study on the neural diversity of afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) in the cochlea, highlighting the structural and functional differences between the two sides of the synapse. The presynaptic zones on the pillar side of IHC activate at lower potentials than those on the modiolar side, which have more presynaptic Ca2 channels. Postsynaptic SGNs differ in their firing rates, thresholds, and operating ranges. The study aimed to bridge the gap between synaptic heterogeneity and neural diversity by ex vivo paired recordings of murine IHC and postsynaptic S boutons with stimuli mimicking in vivo SGN conditions. Synapses with high spontaneous release rate (SR) were predominantly found on the pillar side of I. These high SR synapses had larger and more compact spontaneous EPSCs, lower thresholds, tighter coupling Ca2 channels and vesicular release sites, shorter latencies, and higher release rates. The study indicates that heterogeneity in IHC directly contributes to diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked SGN firing.
The study investigates the role of PfORC, a member of the MORC protein family, in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and molecular genomics approaches, the researchers demonstrate that PfOR modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the erythrocytic cycle and is essential for parasite survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments reveal PfOR binds to subtelomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation, suggesting a role in modulating stage transition. Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) studies show downregulation of PfOR impairs histone marks and collapses heterochatin structure leading to parasite death. These findings confirm PfOR plays a crucial role in chromatin and gene regulation, validating it as a candidate for antimalarial strategies.
**Summary of Article: Exploring the Role of Tumor-Infiltrating Nerves in Cancer-Associated Mental Health Alterations in Mouse Model of Head and Neck Cancer**

    Researchers investigated the impact of tumor-infiltrating nerves on mental health changes in cancer patients by using a mouse model of head and neck cancer. The study found that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas and activate neuronal circuitry, leading to altered behaviors such as decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced running. Tumor-infiltrating nocicept neurons exhibited heightened activity and brain regions receiving these projections showed increased Fos and calcium compared to non-tumor counterparts. The elimination of nocicept neurons decreased F expression and mitigated behavioral changes induced by tumor presence. Analesic treatment restored nesting and cookie behaviors but not wheel running, indicating pain is not sole driver of behavioral shifts. The interaction between tumor-infiltr nerves and brain is crucial for developing interventions to alleviate mental burdens associated with cancer.
The article explores the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on the biophysical properties of the multifunctional nucleocapsid protein. The study utilizes the large genomic database of SARS-2 to examine the effects of mutations across the spectrum of amino acid sequences on the biophysical phenotypes of the protein. The results show that variation in physicochemical parameters of the intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) of the protein allow for plasticity, but also reveal functional constraints present in related coronaviruses. Experiments with N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants indicate that point mutations in IDRs have nonlocal impact on thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid separation. In the Omic variant, distant mutations in IDRs have compensatory effects shifting the balance of interactions controlling protein properties and creating a new protein-protein interface in the N-terminal through the P13 mutation. The findings suggest that genetic diversity is accompanied by variation in biophysical characteristics of Nprotein species, particularly in IDRs.
The study aimed to investigate the changes in skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency during hibernation in small and large mammalian species to optimize energy utilization. Muscle fibers from hibernating species, Ictomys trcematus and Eliom quinus, and larger hibernators Urs arctos and Ursus american, were isolated and subjected to Mant-AT chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure myosin dynamics and ATP demand. Proteomics analyses were also performed. The results showed preservation of myos structure in Urs arct and american during hibernation, while I trcematus and quinus exhibited changes in myos metabolic states during torpor leading to higher energy expenditure in type II fast-twitch muscle at 20 °C. Loaded-ATP experiments at 8C revealed reduced myos ATP consumption in type II fibers by 77-107 during tor compared to active periods. My2 hyperphosphorylation was observed in trcematus during tor, stabilizing the myos molecule. This may mitigate myos-associated increases in muscle expenditure during tor in response to cold exposure. The study demonstrates restingos altered in hibern mammals contributing to significant changes in muscle ATP consumption. Additionally, myos is further altered in response to cold, highlighting as a contributor to muscle non-shivering thermogenesis.
The study investigated the role of chondrocyte columns in bone elongation during embryonic and postnatal development. Chondcy columns are a hallmark of growth plate architecture and are formed by the clonal expansion of cells following division, resulting in a stack of cells parallel to the growth direction. The researchers analyzed hundreds of Conf multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos using 3D imaging and morphometric analysis. They found that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation, implying incomplete rotation of the division plane. Despite this, embryonic clones were elongated and formed clusters perpendicular to the growth direction. Analysis of postnatal growth plates revealed complex columns composed of ordered and disordered stacks and small disorganized clusters at the edges. The study found a correlation between the dynamics of ratios between clusters and columns and bone elongation expansion, suggesting clusters promote expansion while columns support elongation. The results support the idea that modulations of division plane of proliferating chrocy determine the formation of clusters or columns, a multifunctional design regulating morphogenesis throughout pre and postnatal growth. This work provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying plate activity and elongation during development.
Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) are a class of transporters of great interest in the pharmaceutical field due to their promiscuous substrate binding site, which has been linked to improved oral bioavailability of several drug classes. Members of the POT family are conserved across all phylogenetic kingdoms and function by coupling peptide uptake to the electrochemical gradient. Recent cryo-EM and alpha-fold models have provided new insights into conformation states of two mammalian POTs, SLC15A1 and SLC2. However, these studies leave important questions regarding the mechanism of proton and coupling, while providing an opportunity to investigate using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study employs unbiased and enhanced-sampling to map the SLC2 conformation cycle and thermodynamic forces. Conformation energy landscapes are computed in proton states in the absence or presence of peptide, identifying a sequence of proton steps driving inward access. Simulations reveal differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POT, validated in cell-based assays. Results from constant-P MD and absolute free energy (ABE) calculations establish a link between binding and recognition, revealing details of secondary transport in POT. This study provides a step in understanding-coupled peptide transport in mammals and paves the way to integrate carrier biology with drug design to target and availability.
The study investigated the neural responses in the auditory cortex during vocalization across the animal kingdom, including humans. The hypothesis is that suppression of auditory responses enables the detection of vocalization errors. This has been confirmed in non-human primates, but not in humans. To address this, intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were obtained from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech. The topography of auditory suppression was characterized in the superior temporal gyrus (ST), varying across sites. A delayed feedback (DF) task was performed to determine if suppressed sites were sensitive to feedback. Overlapping sites showed enhanced responses to feedback, indicating sensitivity. There was a strong correlation between suppression and feedback sensitivity, suggesting suppression might underlie speech monitoring. When participants produced speech with auditory feedback, posterior ST was selectively activated if engaged in DF, suggesting attention can modulate feedback.
The article presents a comprehensive analysis of McrBC systems, a type of prokaryotic IV restriction systems, through phylogenetic analysis, revealing their abundance and diversity in prokaryotes and genomic associations. A previously uncharacterized branch, denoted as coiled-coil nuclease tandems (CoNuTs), is highlighted for its salient features: extensive coiled-coil structures and nucleases. Three types and multiple subtypes of CoNu are identified, with domains predicted interactions with translation components, such as OB-fold resembling SSB protein binding tmRNA, Y-like domains recognizing methylated tmRNA, tRNA, or rRNA, and RNA-binding Hsp chaper homologs, along with RNases like HEP, suggesting CoNu target RNA. Many CoNu also target DNA via McC nuclease homologs. Restriction systems like Type I, RM, BRE, and Type III are encoded in same superons. In many superons, CoNu are regulated by cyclic nucleotides, possibly RNA fragments with cyclic termini binding CAR (CRIS-Associated Rosann Fold) domains. It is hypothesized that CoNu, with ancillary factors, employ echoned defense strategy analogous to Type CRIS-C systems, eliminating DNA/RNA first, then aborting infection via PCDormancy via RNAavage.
The article discusses the role of calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Inhibition of calcineurin has been shown to extend the lifespan of C. elegans through multiple signaling pathways. To investigate the function of calcinein in innate immunity, the researchers found that calcine is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) in C. elegans. Calcine inhibition leads to defects in DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to infection. The study demonstrates that intestinal bloating caused by calcine inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The TF ortholog, HL-30, is required for lifespan mediated by calcine inhibition. The nuclear receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcine inhibition and necessary for increased lifespan. The study reveals a role for calcine in C. elegans DMP and a mechanism for calcine inhibition-mediated longevity.
The article explores how the brain resolves conflicts between task-relevant and task-irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior. Conflicts can arise from various sources, such as sensory input or internal representations, and a limited set of cognitive processes can effectively address diverse conflicts remains a challenge. According to the cognitive control theory, conflicts can be parameterized and represented as points in a low-dimensional space, which can be resolved by a set of control processes along dimensions. This leads to the hypothesis that conflicts with similar sources are also represented in space. A task was designed with five types of conflicts that can be conceptually parameterized. Human performance and fMRI activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex support that types of conflicts are organized based on similarity, suggesting as a principle for representing conflicts.

This leads to the hypothesis that conflicts with similar sources are also represented in space. A task was created with five types of conflicts that can be conceptually parameterized. Results showed that human performance and fMRI activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex support that types of conflicts are organized based on similarity, suggesting as a principle for representing conflicts.
The article reports on a large-scale longitudinal study investigating the vaginal immune response in pregnant women at risk of preterm birth (PT). Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, with most cases occurring spontaneously due to preterm labor (PTL) or preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). Current prediction of PT is limited due to its complex nature and lack of understanding of the host immune response. The study collected vaginal swabs from pregnant women who gave birth at term, PT, PT, or PPROM, and quantified cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides using sensitive immunoassays. Predictive models were constructed from mediator concentrations. The study found that throughout uncomplicated gestation, the vaginal immunoprote had a homeostatic cytokine profile. However, in women who experienced PT and PPROM, the immunrote shifted to a pro-inflammatory state, characterized by increased monocyte chemoattractants, macrophage and T-cell activation, and reduced antimicrobial peptides. The immunrote had predictive value over maternal characteristics for identifying women at risk of early (<34 weeks) PT. The immunrote undergoes homeostatic changes throughout gestation and deviations are associated with PT. Furthermore, the immunrote can be used as a biomarker for early PT, a subset associated with adverse neonatal outcomes.
The Hernandez-Hernandez model is an in silico model of electrical Ca2+ signaling in arterial myocytes from murine resistance arteries. The model aims to describe the fundamental ionic mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular Ca2 signaling during the development of myogenic tone in blood vessels. Experimental data indicate sex-specific differences in male and female myocytes, with KV.5 channels having similar amplitudes, kinetics, and voltage dependencies in both sexes. However, simulations suggest KV.5 is the dominant current regulating membrane potential in male myocytes, while KV.1 plays a primary role in female myocytes due to larger expression and longer activation time constants. Voltage-gated K+ and L-type Ca2 channels are predicted to drive sex differences in intracellular Ca and excitability over physiological membrane potentials. The model also shows female arterial muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to Ca2 blockers compared to male. The Hernandez-Hern model provides a framework to investigate the sex-specific impact of antihypertensive drugs.
The study investigated the relationship between litter decomposition and precipitation across a precipitation gradient, examining how decomposers of different sizes respond to varying moisture levels. The authors hypothesized that larger decomposers (macrodecomposers) have a higher tolerance to aridity, which would counterbalance the effect of smaller decompos, leading to similar decomposition rates across the gradient. To test this, they placed litter baskets of different mesh sizes at seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient and characterized the macrocomposer assemblages using pitfall traps. The results showed that decompos responded differently to precipitation based on their size, with microbial decomposition increasing with precipitation in winter and macrodecomposition peaking in arid sites during summer. This led to similar decomposition rates across the gradient except in hyperarid sites. Macrocomposer richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in arid environments. The study highlights the importance of macrocomposition in aridlands, potentially resolving the dryland decomposition conundrum, and emphasizes the need to consider decomposer size when investigating biogeochemical processes.
Summary: 
    Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a type of pancreatic cancer with a poor prognosis and high rates of metastasis and limited treatment options. The activation of the KRAS gene is a common in most tumours, leading to increased migratory and proliferative capacity as well as macropocytosis. Macropocytosis is known as a nutrient scavenging mechanism, but its role in trafficking of signalling receptors is not well understood. This study investigated the role of CYRI-B, a protein highly expressed in pancreatic tumours in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Deletion of the gene encoding CYRI accelerated tumourigenesis, leading to increased ERK and JNK proliferation in precancerous lesions, suggesting a role as a buffer of RAC activation in early stages. However, as disease progressed, loss of CY-B inhibited metastasis. CY-B depleted tumour cells showed reduced chemotactic response to lysosphatidic acid, a major driver of tumour spread due to impaired macinocytic uptake of lysosphatid acid 1 receptor. The study implicates CY-B as a mediator of growth and signalling in pancreatic cancer, providing insights into pathways controlling metastasis.
The article discusses the human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) family, specifically the HML-2 clade, which includes intact or nearly intact proviruses, but no replication-competent H-2 proviruses have been identified in humans. However, H-2-related proviruses have been found in other primates, including rhes macaques, but the extent and timing of H-2 activity in macques is unclear. The study identified 145 H-2-like proviruses inhes macques, including a clade of young,hes-specific insertions. The age, open reading frames, and insertional polymorphism of these insertions suggest recent or ongoing activity in macques. One hundred and six of the provir form a clade characterized by ~750 sequence between the env and 3 long terminal repeat (LTR) derived from ancient recombination with HER-K H-8-related virus. This clade is found in Old World (OW) monkeys but not great apes, suggesting it originated after ape/OW split. Similar proviruses were found in white-cheek gibbons, the insert cluster within OW recombinant cl, suggesting interspecies from OW to gibbons. The LTR of youngest provir have deletions U, which disrupt Response Element (RE) for nuclear export unspliced RNA. It is shown that H-8 region functions as Response-independent constitutive transport (TE), indicating ancestral–RE export system replaced by TE.
Wound infections are a significant public health concern due to their high prevalence and association with delayed or failed healing, resulting in substantial morbidity and economic impacts. These infections occur in various contexts, including diabetic foot ulcers, burns, and surgical sites. Enterococcus faalis is frequently found in non-healing wounds, but its contribution to chronic wounds remains understudied. To address this, a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed on infected wounds compared to uninfected wounds in a mouse model. The study examined over 23,000 cells, creating a comprehensive single-cell atlas capturing the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of wounds. The analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection versus normal healing. The study identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection, contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, E. faalis infection prompted premature epithelial-mesymal transition in kerocytes. Additionally, E. faalis modulated M2-like macrophage polarization inhibiting pro-inflammatory in vitro, in vivo, and scRNA atlas. Furthermore, macrophage cstalk with neutrophils regulated chemine signaling, promoting anti-inflammatory with endothelial cells. The findings offer new insights into immunosuppressive role E. faalis in infections.
Biologists have long been aware that plants attacked by herbivores release volatiles that can enhance defenses in neighboring plants. However, the dynamics of this phenomenon are not well understood. A recent study used a custom-built high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) system to investigate temporal patterns of volatile transfer between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. The study found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbore-induced volatiles resulted in temporal response patterns in neighboring plants, characterized by a terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure. This burst was not due to terp accumulation during the night, but coincided with jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The burst occurred independently of day-night transitions and could not be fully explained by sender dynamics. Instead, it was the result of stress from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary to bioactive volatiles on the second. The study revealed that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volat resulted in response that integrated priming and induction into a distinct temporal pattern. This provides an answer to the long-standing question whether volat predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring, revealing they can both in sequence.
The study investigates the presence of recursive structures in vocalizations in non-human primates, specifically in wild orangutans, and their potential evolutionary implications for the emergence of human language. Recursive structures refer to the embedding of a signal within another of the same kind, providing a neurocomputational blueprint for syntax and phonology in spoken language and song. However, no such sequences have been found in non-human primates, suggesting a neurocognitive transformation exclusive to humans. This study reveals that male orangutans produce rhythmically isochronous call sequences within isochron call, consistent with two hierarchical strata. The rhythms in the lower stratum are temporally and acoustically distinct from the overarching rhythm in the higher stratum, indicating that these structures are not the result of non-hierarchical processes or anatomical artifacts. The findings represent a case of tempor recursive homin vocal combinatorics in the absence of syntax, semantics, phonology, or second-order combinatorics. The study suggests that hierarchically organized and cyclically structured sounds in hominids may have preceded the evolution of recursion in modern humans.
The constant evolutionary arms race between viruses and their hosts has led to numerous innovations that have shaped the course of life on Earth. A key aspect of this interaction is the relationship between viral receptors and host cells, where viruses exploit surface proteins to initiate infection. This study focuses on the dynamic between the MDA receptor and 5’pp-RNA virus in the lower vertebrate Miichthys mii. The frequent loss of RIG in vertebrates prompted the search for alternative substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation (HDCR) being the primary pathway. Analysis revealed that MDA in Miichys and Gallus, a homolog of RIG, can replace RIG in recognizing 5pp-RNA, potentially leading to RIG loss from the genome during evolution. As a countermeasure, 5pp-R virus utilizes m6A methylation to degrade MDA and weaken its antiviral ability, promoting replication and immune evasion. This study provides insight into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, highlighting ecological and evolutionary factors contributing to the diversity of the immune system.
The study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and body composition changes in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in a phase IV study from 2017 to 2019 and received luteinizing hormone-releasing antagonist degare. Body fat mass (FBM), lean mass (LBM), and bone density (BMD) were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptometry at baseline and after 12 months of AD. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. At baseline, a weak non-significant direct relationship was found between FSH levels and FB in arms (r=0.36) and legs (r=0.33). However, a stronger correlation was observed between FSH and total FB (r=0.52, p=0.006), fat in arms (r=0.54, p=0.004), and fat in trunk (r=0.45, p=0.018) after 12 months. An inverse relationship between serum FSH and appendicular lean index/FBM was observed (r=-0.64, p=0.001). The study found that FSH levels after AD could impact body composition, particularly FB. Therefore, FSH could be a marker to monitor risk of sarcopenic obesity and guide clinicians in evaluation of body in patients undergoing AD.
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolem ion channels, none have proven effective in preventing SC. Sarcasmic ryanine receptor 2 (Ry2) Ca+ release channels, downstream of sarlem ion channels, have been underexplored in this context. Recent evidence implicates reactive species (ROS)-mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of Ry2 in the pathophysiology of SC. This study tested the hypothesis that Ry2 inhibition in failing hearts reduces sarcasm Ca+ leak and repolar lability, mitigates VT/SC and improves contract function. A guinea pig model was used that replicates clinical aspects of nonchemic heart failure (HF), such as prolonged QT interval, high arrhythmic SC, and Ca+ leak via hyperactive Ry2. Animals were randomized to receive drol (DS) or placebo in early HF. The incidence of VT and SC (primary outcome), ECG heart rate and QT, echocardi left ventricular (LV) structure and function, immunohisto LV fibrosis and sarcasm Ry2 oxidation were assessed. DS prevented VT and SC by decreasing repolar and vent arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, DS lowered resting rate, preserved chronotropic during β-adnergic challenge and improved rate and function. Inhibition Ry2 with drol mitigates the cycle sarcasm Ca+ leak increases diolic Ca+ and ROS Ry2, reducing repolar and protecting VTSC. The increase sarcasm Ca+ improves function. The effects of Ry2 inhibition warrant further investigation, such as clinical studies repurposing drol as therapy for HF and SC.
In C. elegans, the transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) family, including the conserved bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) family, mediate transcriptional responses to secreted ligands. However, only a small number of direct target genes have been well characterized. This study identifies functional binding sites for SMA-3/Sm and its transcription partner SMA-9/Schnri based on ChIP-seq peaks and RNA-seq analysis of mutants. SMA-3 and SMA-9 have overlapping and unique target genes. Genome-wide SMA-3/Sm acts as a transcriptional activator, while SMA-9/Sur targets both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in sma-9 partially suppress the body size phenotype of sma-3, suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors. Functional analysis of target genes reveals a role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and endoplasmic retic ( ER ) secretory pathway, including disulf reductase d-11. The study indicates Sm and SMA-9/Sur have complex and regulatory interactions that regulate secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body size.
The article discusses the role of the embryonic transcription factor DUX in cancer evasion of the immune response to immunotherapy in patients with metastatic cancer. DUX was previously identified as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation and is found to be aberrantly expressed in a subset of primary tumors. This study found that DUX expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors, with approximately 10-50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers expressing DUX. The expression of DUX is associated with immune exclusion and decreased response to PD-1 blockade in a cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients. DUX expression is a significant predictor of survival, even accounting for tumor mutational burden and other molecular and clinical features in this cohort, with DUX expression associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year.
Livestock abortion is a significant disease syndrome affecting livestock productivity and public health in Africa. Despite its importance, surveillance data on the aetiology of the disease is limited, constraining effective interventions to improve livelihoods, food security, and public health. To address this gap, a surveillance platform was established in Tanzania to investigate causes and impacts of abortion in pastoral, agropastoral, and smallholder systems. Livestock abortion events were reported by farmers to livestock field officers ( LFO ) and investigated by the research team or LFO within 72 hours. Samples and questionnaire data were collected to investigate a ) determinants of attribution, b ) patterns of events including species, breed, previous history, and seasonality, c ) determinants of reporting and attribution, and d ) cases involving zoonotic pathogens. Between 2017–2019, 215 events in cattle, sheep, and goats were investigated. Attribution was achieved in 19.5% of cases, significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to sample deterioration. Vaginal swabs provided practical material for pathogen detection.
Cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for the development and progression of various diseases, with nicotine (NIC) being a major constituent of cigarette smoke. However, the mechanisms underlying NIC-regulated stem cell functions are not well understood. This study demonstrates that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in vivo and ex vivo. NIC also induces Yes-associated protein (YAP) transcriptional coactivator with PDZ motif (TAZ) and Notch signaling in ISC via α-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and protein kinase (PKC) activation, which was not detected in Pan cells. Inhibition of Notch by dibenzine (DB) nullified the effects of NIC on ISC. NIC enhances in vivo formation from ISC after loss of tumor suppressor gene APC, DB inhibited NIC-induced growth. This study identifies NIC-triggered pathway regulating stemness and tumorigenicity ISC and suggests dibine as potential therapeutic for intestinal tumors.
The article discusses the role of the Hsp70 protein in counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, which is associated with stress, aging, and disease. Hsp70 facilitates protein solubilization and refolding through substrate binding and release, regulated by co-chaperones: J-domain proteins (JDPs) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). The study elucidates the collaborative impact of Hsp NEFs and different DP classes on H70-dependent aggregate processing. The results show that Hsp plays a major role in the initial stages of disaggregation, determining its efficacy. NE catalyzes the recruitment of H70 onto the aggregate surface, modifying it into smaller species more readily processed by chaper. H70 stimulation by NE is stronger with class B than A DP and requires interaction between B and H70 EE motif. The study also demonstrates that NE disrupts the DP-H70 interaction, destabilizing chaper complexes at the surface, potentially improving disaggregation but leading to inhibition above stoichiometric NE optimum. The interplay between coaper and H70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential.
Biomedical researchers have long used gait analysis to diagnose and monitor musculoskeletal conditions such as knee osteoarthritis. However, traditional gait analysis relies on subjective visual observation, which is limited by the need for expensive equipment, large facilities, and highly trained staff. Wearable digital insoles may offer a solution to these challenges. This study demonstrates that digital insoles can measure osteoarthritis-specific gait signatures similar to clinical gait standards. A machine learning model was trained on force plate data from participants with osteoarthritis and controls. The model was highly predictive of force data from a validation set ( area under receiver operating characteristics [ROC] = 0.86 ; area under precisionrecall [PR] = 0.90 ) and an independent insole dataset of controls and osteoarthritis (ROC = 0.83 ; PR = 0.86 ). This shows digital insole g characteristics are comparable to traditional g measurements. A single stride of sensor data was accurately assigned to each subject, indicating individuals can be identified by g characteristics. This work provides an alternative to traditional g methods, adds to wearable technology pipelines, and supports at-home assessments, potentially improving ease, frequency, and depth of monitoring.
The article reports on the development of a non-opioid therapy for post-surgical pain management using a human amniotic membrane (AM) product, Clarix (FLO), which attenuates post-surgical hypersensitivity without opioid-related side effects in mice. The study found that LO inhibited nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DR) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways. Further purification of the major component, hyaluronic acid/paxin 3 (HA/PT3), from AM resulted in a more pure and soluble form, HA/PT3, which replicated LO-induced pain inhibition. Mechanistically, HA/3-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements inhibited sodium and high-voltage calcium currents in nocice DR neurons, suggesting a key role in mediating pain relief. The study highlights the potential of naturally-derived biologics from human tissues as non-opoid treatment for post-s pain and unravels the neuronal mechanisms of inhibition by LO and HA/3.
Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells exhibit varying levels of pigmentation when cultured in vitro. To investigate the relationship between color appearance and function of RPE, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE (iPSC-R) were analyzed for color intensity and gene expression at the single-cell level. The Automated imaging and cell-picking System (ALPS) was used to photograph each cell prior to RNA-sequencing gene expression analysis. Four clusters of iP-R were identified by gene expression, but color intensity did not correlate with specific gene profiles. This suggests a lack of direct correlation between color and gene expression that define pigmentation levels, leading to the hypothesis that R cell color may not strongly indicate functional characteristics of R.
The field of neuroscience has increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behavior in naturalistic environments to gain deeper insights into ethologically relevant processes and neural mechanisms. The common marmet ( Callithrix jacch ) has emerged as a pivotal model for this effort due to its small size, prosocial nature and genetic proximity to humans. However, traditional research methods often fail to capture the nuances of marmet social interactions and cooperative behaviors. To address this gap, the Marmet Apparatus for Automated Pulling ( MAAP ) was developed, a novel apparatus for studying cooperative behaviors in marmets. MAAP enables high-throughput, detailed outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more comprehensive analyses in naturalistic settings. It also accommodates a wide range of behaviors and individual capabilities. MAAP provides a platform for investigations of neural activity underlying social behaviors. MAAP is a versatile and robust tool for advancing understanding primate behavior and cognitive processes. This apparatus bridges the gap between ethologically animal studies and neural investigations, paving the way for research in cognitive and social neuroscience using mets as a model.
The article presents a study on the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PA) on the developing offspring’s genome. The researchers employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate PA, mimicking common patterns of alcohol consumption during pregnancy in humans. The results show that early PA affected site-specific DNA methylation in newborns without altering behavioral outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulf sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with perturbations originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding regions with regulatory potential indicative of broad effects on genome regulation. Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested effects on metastable genes linked to disease-relevant traits including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. In the murine model, a diet rich in folate and choline protected against some damaging effects of early PA on DNA methylation. The study demonstrates that moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes, highlighting a role for preventative dietary interventions.
Biologists have long believed that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is effective in silencing a wide variety of genes, and that all genes are typically considered targets for RNA interference (RNAi). However, recent studies in the nematode Caenorhabitis elegans have shown that loss of some regulators of RNAi can selectively impair the silencing of certain genes. This phenomenon can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism. In this network, the Maelstrom domain protein RDE-10, the intrically disordered protein MUT-16 and the Argona protein NR-3 work together to silence genes, but each is required for silencing a different gene. The requirement for NR-3 can be overcome by enhanced RNA processing. Quantitative models and exploratory simulations suggest that (1) changing cis-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce dependence on NR-3, (2) animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells and (3) cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with U dinucleotides, which are templates for amplifying RNAs, are enriched in ‘UG’ zones matching dsRNA. These findings indicate that similar pathways and amplification could result in selective silencing by endogenous RNAs.
Mortality and morbidity from tuberculous meningitis (TBM) are significant concerns due to the body’s inflammatory response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. This study aimed to identify genes and pathways associated with TBM pathogenesis and mortality, and determine predictors of death using whole-blood RNA sequencing from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM, 295 pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and 30 healthy controls. Weighted gene co-expression analysis identified genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality, revealing distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. Multivariate Cox regression selected candidate predictors of death, and logistic regression and bootstrap validation chose the best predictors. Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T cell activation were associated with TBM mortality. Among HIV-positive individuals, mortality was associated with angiogenesis, while HIV-negative exhibited TNF signaling and extracellular organization. Four genes-MMP, NEL2, ZNF, and CD-were strong TBM predictors. These findings indicate TBM induces a systemic response similar to PT, highlighting genes and pathways related to death, offering potential therapeutic targets and a four-gene biomarker for outcomes.
The article discusses the reliability of commercial antibodies used to detect and characterize proteins in the human proteome. While it is widely acknowledged that many commercial antibodies do not recognize their intended targets, the scope of the problem has been largely anecdotal, making it difficult to assess the feasibility of achieving one potent and specific antibody for each protein. To address this, the authors developed a standardized approach using parental and knockout cell lines to evaluate the performance of 614 commercial antibodies for 65 neuroscience-related proteins. A side-by-side comparisons of antibodies against each target from multiple commercial sources showed that more than 50% failed in one or more applications. However, around 50-75% of proteins were covered by at least one high-performing antibody depending on application, indicating significant coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies. Recombinant antibodies outperformed monoclonal and polyclonal. Hundreds of underperforming antibodies were found to have been used in numerous published articles, raising concerns. Encouragingly, more than half were reassessed by manufacturers with alterations to usage or removal from the market. This study demonstrates the scale of the specificity problem and suggests an efficient strategy to achieve proteome coverage using the existing repertoire and data for new generation.
The development of a system that allows for the independent control of gene expression in two different tissues within the same animal is a crucial for the study of inter-organ communication. This can be achieved by combining the GAL4/UAS system with a second binary system, such as the LexA or Q system. This study presents a resource of reagents that facilitate the use of GAL4/UAS and a second system in Drosophila tissues, focusing on genes with well-characterized GAL expression patterns. A set of more than 40 LexA-D and Q2 insertions were generated by CRISPR knock-in and verified for tissue specificity in larvae. Constructs that encode Q2 and Lex-G transcription factors in a single vector were also built. Following integration of this construct into the genome, FLP/F recombination was used to isolate lines that express only Q2 or Lex-G. Additionally, new shRNA vectors were used to evaluate Lex and Q systems for in vivo knockdown, generating a library of RNAi lines as a resource. These Lex and Q system vectors and lines provide new tools for researchers to activate or repress two genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal.
The article discusses the role of the transcription factor B11 (B11) in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. B11 is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy-CA synapses. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The study reveals that the synaptic organizer molecule C1 (C1) is a direct target of B11 that regulates synaptic vesicle and long-term potentiation at moss-CA synapses in vivo and in vitro. C1 exerts its functions through interaction with a specific variant of neurexin (N), N3 (25). Interruption of C-N interaction by expression of a non-binding C mutant or deletion of N in dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates parts of B and C phenotypes. The study identifies a C-N dependent pathway through B that controls moss synapse function. The findings contribute to the understanding of neurodevelopment disorders by synaptic dysfunction.
The article discusses the role of the zinc-finger protein S1 (S1) in regulating transcription and post-transcription processes. S1 binds to promoters and transcribed gene bodies to regulate gene expression. The study reveals two modes of S1 activity : binding to promoters like known transcription activators or to transcribed regions via RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ). Upon promoter binding, S1 binds to gene bodies and affects Pol II configuration through dissociation or conformation change of its Rpb subunit and increased backtracking. S1 also binds subset mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them. The interaction between S1 and mRN is controlled by their promoters and coincides with S1 dissociation from chromatin. S dissociation from chrom correlates with extent of backtracked Pol. Following promoter recruitment, S accompanies Pol and regulates backtracking. back Pol is compatible with S relocation to nascent transcripts where S accompanies mRN to cytoplasm and regulates stability. S co-transcription binding imprints mRNA fate as paradigm for cross-talk between synthesis and decay mRN and paradigm for dual-role zincinger proteins. The interplay between S two modes remains to be examined.
The article investigates the relationship between programmed cell death during development (PCD) and fungal colonization in Arabidopsis thalian roots, specifically focusing on the root-specific transcription factor ANAC/SMB and senescence-associated nuclease B1. The results show that mutations in both PC regulators increase colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendita, primarily in the differentiation zone. The smb-3 mutant exhibits hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and delay of S-induced root growth. This suggests that root PC and post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Reporter and transcriptional analysis reveal that B1 is downregulated during S colonization in mature epidermal cells, indicating a transcriptional control facilitating accommodation of beneficial microbes in roots.
The article investigates the role of large vesicle extrusion from neurons in the development of neurodegenerative disease, with a focus on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism. Large vesicles produced by proteressed neurons can contribute to the spreading of pathogenic aggregates and inflammatory responses, leading to neurodegenerative disease. However, the factors that regulate vesicle extrusion are poorly understood. This study reveals that mechanical force can significantly potentiate vesicle extrusion from proteressed neurons in C. elegans. The production of vesicles from the ALMR neuron peaks at day 2-3, coinciding with the C eleg reproductive peak. Disruption of C eleg germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early production strongly suppresses ves extrusion from the AL neurons during the peak. Conversely, restoring egg production at the reproductive phase through mating or inducing retention can increase AL ves production. Interventions that promote AL ves production are associated with expanded uterus lengths, while those that suppress ves are associated with shorter lengths. Fertilized eggs are not the primary stimulus for ves production, but rather the presence of oocytes, dead eggs, or fluid supporting distention. The study concludes that mechanical uter occupation potentiates ves extrusion from proximal proteressed maternal neurons, highlighting the importance of mechanobiology in neurodegener disease.
The article presents new evidence for the involvement of the Wnt signaling pathway in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by investigating the role of the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-3 (DKK3). Previous studies have shown that DKK colocalizes with amyloid plaques in AD patients. This study examines the contribution of DKK to synapse integrity in healthy and AD brains. The results show that DKK expression is upregulated in AD brains and DKK levels increase early in the disease. In AD mouse models, extracellular DKK levels are increased and DKK accumulates at dystrophic processes around plaques. Functionally, DKK triggers loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of Wnt/GSKβ signaling and increase inhibitory syn via W/JNK. In contrast, DKK knockdown restores synapse and memory in AD mice.
The rise of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens necessitates the discovery of new drugs to combat the issue. One approach is to identify compounds produced by microbes to inhibit competitors. This study demonstrates that iron-chelating pyoverdines, siderophores produced by Pseudomonas spp, exhibit antibacterial properties by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens. A screen of 320 Pseudas isolates against 12 human pathogens revealed several pyoverines with high antibacterial properties and distinct characteristics. The most potent pyoverine reduced growth of Acinetobacter baumann, Klei pneumonia, and Staph aureus in a concentration-dependent manner. Pydine increased survival of infected Galleria larvae and showed low toxicity to mammalian cell lines and erythrocytes. Experimental evolution of pathogens with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance compared to antibiotic. Pyines from environmental strains have potential to become new class antibacterials against human pathogens.
Schizophrenia is a complex disorder characterized by the failure of prefrontal networks, but the underlying mechanisms of synaptic disruptions at the network level are not fully understood. This lack of understanding hinders the identification of genetic and environmental factors that contribute to prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. To address this gap, a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal circuits was developed to investigate the link between NMDA synaptic and 0-l spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological model of prefront network failure in schizophrenia. The model analyzed the balance between AMPA and NMD components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition on oscillatory spike synchrony to inform biological data. It was found that reducing NMD synaptic currents prevented the network from shifting to an oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs such as occur during behavior. These findings parallel the dynamic modulation of 0-l spike synchrony observed between neurons in prefrontal cortex during behavior, as well as suppression of 0-l spiking by NMD antagonists. The network model provides a plausible explanation for the link between NMD synaptic and 0-l spikey synchron deficits in pharmacological model prefront failure schizophrenia.
Angiogenesis is a process by which new blood vessels form from pre-existing ones, typically in low-oxygen environments. The initial steps of angiogenesis depend on the differentiation of oligotent endothelial cells into Tip and Stalkotypic cell fates, controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell communication. The spatial patterning of this cell specification is not fully understood. A study combined experimental model with mathematical analysis found that Tip-Stalk cell patterning undergoes an order-disorder transition at high levels of proangiogenic VEGF The differentiation is robust but temporally unstable for most cells, with a subset of Tip cells leading sprouting. Sprouts form in a manner maximizing distance, consistent with a Turing-like model dependent on fibronectin enrichment. NOT signaling mediates robust differentiation but not subsequent steps in angiogenesis, requiring additional self-organization.
The locus coeruleus (LC) projections to the hippocampus play a crucial role in learning and memory, but the timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and LC-derived neurotransmitters involved in hippocampal memory formation are unclear. The LC typically modulates neural activity via norepinephrine release, but recent studies suggest it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other regions. This study investigated the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace conditioning in mice. The LC and its projections to the hippocampus responded to task-relevant stimuli, and optogenetic stimulation enhanced long-term memory formation. The LC increased norepine and dopamine in the hippocampus, and the timing of hippocal dopamine during trace conditioning was similar to LC activity. Hippocampal dopamine was important for trace memory, while norephrine was not.
