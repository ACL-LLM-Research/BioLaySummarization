Genetic variation in the 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTR) of mRNAs is known to influence gene expression, but the role of 3′ end processing in this variation remains poorly understood. We conducted a genome-wide survey of 3′ ends in human lymphoblast cells from genetically distinct individuals and mapped the cis-regulatory architecture of 3′ ends. We found that 3′ ends did not fall randomly in 3′UTRs, but rather preferentially flanked 3 regulatory elements, including microRNA (miRNA) sites. The usage of 3′ ends and motifs varied across individuals and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and 3′ motifs were significant predictors of expression of genes in which they lay. Single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation on steady-state expression of respective genes and validated the function of 3 cis-regulatory elements in expression of these RNA forms. We focused on the immune regulator IRF and established the effect of variation in 3′ processing on response to antigen. Our results underscore the importance of mechanisms in genetics of 3′ variation: usage of distinct 3 signals and effects of 3 elements on transcript fate. We suggest integrating 3 positions with 3 motifs will be a tool in continued efforts to interpret human variation.
SIVΔne is one of the most effective vaccines in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge. We used deep sequencing and CD8 T cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the CD8 T response in SIVne-infected animals. In the acute phase of SIVne infection, the CD8 response is predominantly against variable epitopes, followed by sequence evolution and viral escape. Epitope escape expands the CD8 repertoire that targets conserved epitopes and generates de novo responses to escaped variants during vaccination. These findings correlate SIVne-induced protection with expanded conserved specificity and increased response.
Oral mucosal infections caused by Candida albicans are one of the most frequent forms of fungal diseases. The host protection against these infections is conferred by cellular immunity, but the induction of antifungal immunity is not well understood. We used a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) to show that interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels. We demonstrate that the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and mobilization of newly generated neutils from the bone marrow depended on IL-1. IL-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at site and defective secretion of granocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in circulation in response to C. alb. Strikingly, endothelial cells were identified as primary source of G-CS during OPC, which responded to IL-α released from keratinocytes in infected. The IL-dependent crosstalk between different subsets of hematopoietic compartment confirmed in vitro using murine-derived kerocyte line and endothelial line.
Between 2000 and 2007, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) delivered more than 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via mass drug administration (MDA) of anti-filar drugs (albendazole, iverectin, diethylcarazine) to at-risk for 4–6 years. The economic benefits of this achievement were quantified by calculating the number of clinical manifestations averted and the associated savings with disease prevention in the context of direct costs, indirect labor, and health care for affected individuals. Multiple sources were reviewed, including literature and databases from the World Organization, International Fund, and Labour. Estimated US$21. 8 billion in economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31.4 million treated during the first 8 years of GPE. Of this, US$2.3 is realized by protection of nearly 3 million and individuals from LF as a result of being born in areas of transmission. Additionally, more than 28 million benefit from GFLF halting progression of disease, resulting in US$19.5 lifetime benefit.
Gaucher disease (GD) is the most common lysosomal storage disease caused by homozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene. Recent studies have shown that GB mutations also confer a strong risk for sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD). To investigate how GB mutations cause PD, we generated GB mutant mice that are completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity. In contrast to humans and mice lacking Case activity, GB mice survived for months, enabling analysis of pathological progression. GB mice displayed pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD, including infiltration of Gaucher-like cells into brains, progressive neuronal loss and gliosis. Detailed findings revealed lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and α-syn accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes. Unexpectedly, disruption of α-s did not improve life span, axonal swellings, neuronal loss or neuroinflamm in GB mice.
Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular pathogen that induces a robust cell-mediated immune response following sublethal infection. To induce long-lived CD8 T–mediated immunity, Listeria monocogen must escape the phagosome and enter the host cytosol. We show that the cell response to phag-confined Listeria monocogen is not due to inefficient antigen presentation, but direct suppression of the adaptive response. This suppression affects not only the response to vacuole-confined Lister monocogen, but also the response to cytosolic L monocogen. Co-infection with phag-conf and cytos L monocogen prevents the generation of acquired immunity and expansion of antigen-specific T cells relative to cytos L monocogen alone. Bacteria confined to phag suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lead to rapid MyD-dependent IL-10 production. Block of IL-10 receptor or absence of MyD during infection restores protective immunity.
Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide and the most common subtype of glaucoma is a complex trait with multigenic inheritance. Genome-wide association studies have previously identified a significant association between PO and the SIX locus (rs104827, OR=1.32, p=3.87×10−11 ). SIX plays a role in ocular development and has been associated with the morphology of the optic nerve. We sequenced the SIX coding and regulatory regions in 262 PO cases and 256 controls and identified six nonsynonymous variants, including five rare and one variant AsnHis (rs12345 ), which was associated with PO (OR=1.27, p=4.2×10−10 ) in the NEIGHBOR/GLUGEN datasets. These variants were tested in an in vivo Danio rerio (zebrafish ) complementation to evaluate ocular metrics such as eye and optic structure. Five variants found in PO cases were hypomorphic or null, while sixth found in controls was benign. One in SIX enhancer increased expression SIX and disrupted its regulation. We identified a feature in PO patients dependent upon SIX genotype: patients homozygous for SIX risk allele (His ) have a thinner retinal nerve layer than homozygous for SIX non-risk allele (Asn ). Our results, in combination with SIX work, lead to hypothesize that SIX variants disrupt the development of retina leading to reduced retinal ganglion, thereby increasing glcoma vision loss.
Clostridium difficile is an intestinal pathogen that adheres to epithelial cells via flagella. Flagellar gene expression indirectly impacts glucosyl toxin production, which is essential for diarrheal disease. We report the identification of a “flagellar switch” that controls flagellar and glucosyl toxin production. The flag switch is a 154 bp invertible sequence flanked by 21 bp inverted repeats, located upstream of the flB operon containing early flagellar genes. Bacteria with the switch in “ON” orientation express flagellum, produce flagella, and secrete toxins. Bacteria with the switch in “OFF” orientation attenuate flagellar gene expression, areflagellate, and show decreased toxin secretion. The switch orientation is reversible in vitro. We show that flagellar regulation occurs post-transcription and requires a C difficile-specific factor to destabilize early flagellar mRNA when the switch is OFF. We also show that tyrosine recombinase RecV, which catalyzes inversion at cV, is responsible for flagellar inversion in both directions. Phase flagellar motility and toxin are important virulence factors that have both advantageous and detrimental effects during infection.
Clostridium difficile is an obligate anaerobic pathogen that produces highly resistant endospores that are central to its infectious cycle. We have studied the function and regulation of the sporulation sigma factors in C. difficile, an organism that deviates from the paradigm established in Bacillus subtilis. In C. difficile, the main periods of activity of the sigma factors are conserved, but we show that σE activity is partially independent of σ, σ activity is dependent on σ, and σ activity does not require σ. We also show that σ is not strictly required for heat resistant spore formation. Our results indicate reduced temporal segregation between the activities of the early and late sigma factors and reduced requirement for σ-to-, σ-, σ-to-, and σ-to cell signaling. In contrast to B. subtilis, σ is not strictly required for heat spore formation. We also show that σ activity is partially independent of σ. Our results support the view that the level of the sporulation network is conserved in evolution, with sigma factors acting as key regulators of the pathway established 2. 5 billion years ago at the base of the Firmicutes Phylum.
Allosteric multisite proteins are proteins that undergo conformational changes in response to phosphorylation at multiple sites. We present a framework to model the dose response of alloster multisite proteins using a single variable. This framework closely replicates the steady state behavior of multisite systems such as the Monod-Wy-Change alloster model or Hill-based models. Optimal ultrasensitivity is obtained when alloster protein activation by individual sites is concerted and redundant. This makes the framework useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems where multisite proteins interact. We apply this framework to a newly discovered signaling pathway in yeast that monitors cell growth by signals at the plasma membrane. We show that components of this pathway form a hysteretic switch. This system incorporates a signal proportional to growth, a mechanism to read the signal, and an-or response only when the signal reaches a threshold indicating sufficient growth has occurred.
Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism by which allows bacteria to communicate with each other and gain a selective advantage. While switching phenomena are common, the mechanistic underpinnings have remained elusive. We employed a combination of experimental and mathematical approaches to study the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) quorum sensing system in E. coli. coli. The network was separated into sub-networks to examine negative and positive feedback mechanisms. A new negative feedback interaction was hypothesized and tested via a simple model. The importance of the Lsr regulator and its role in the E. coli QS “switch” was revealed, normally masked by regulatory loops. Our model provided a mechanistic understanding of the interplay among substructures and their contributions to the native network.
Malaria remains a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa where helminthiasis are common and children are often infected with both Plasmodium falciparum and Schistosoma haematobium. The effect of helminthias on malaria infection is evident, but the impact of co-infection is not clearly elucidated and findings are conflicting. This study investigated the effect of schosiasis, soil-transmitted helth (STH) on prevalence and incidence of Plmod falciparum infection in school-age children living in rural Gabon. Thick smear microscopy, urine filtration and Kato-K technique were used to detect malaria, S haobium and STH eggs, respectively. P falcum carriage was assessed at inclusion and incidence of malaria and time to first event recorded in correlation with Schosia status. Stratified multivariate analysis was used to assess risk Plmod infection considering STH and survival to malaria. Overall prevalence at enrolment was 30% for S haobium, 23% P falcum and 9% co-infection with both parasites. Our results showed schosias increased risk of Plmod infection when combined with Trichiuris trichi or hook infection (OR = 3.9 [CI 1.7–2.9]. Malaria incidence 0.51[.45–0.57] per-year was higher in Schia-infected compared to non-infected (0.61 vs.43 p.02) with significant delay first-malaria only in children 6–10-old infected Schia.
Leishmania donovani infection induces an inflammatory response that is mainly mediated by the transcription factor IRF5. IRF-5 is responsible for the activation of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF. We investigated the role of IRF-5-mediated inflammation in regulating antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses during L. donani infection. Our data show that the inflammatory response induced by IR-5 limits CD+ T cell expansion and induces HIF-1 in dendritic cells. Deletion of HIF-1 in dendritic cells resulted in a higher frequency of short-lived effector cells ( SLEC ) CD+ T expansion and increased IL-12 expression by splenic dendritic cells. Moreover, mice with deletion of H-1 in dendritic cells had a lower splenic parasite burden, suggesting that induction of H-1 may represent an immune evasion mechanism adopted by Leish parasites to establish persistent infections.
American visceral leishmanias (VL) is associated with high fatality rates in Latin America. This systematic review aims to identify prognostic factors for patients at risk of unfavorable outcomes. We analyzed 14 studies conducted in Latin America to identify predictors of adverse evolution despite treatment and death. We examined methodological quality using a tool and synthesized prognostic variables using meta-analysis. Variables were grouped by strength of evidence, heterogeneity, and multivariate analyses. The strongest predictors were jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age <5 and >40 years, neutropenia, dyspnea, and bacterial infections. Edema and low hemoglobin were also associated with unfavorable outcomes.
During the last 30 years, the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis ( VL and CL ) in Algeria has been based on antimonial drugs. It is suspected that high drug pressure might favor the emergence of chemoresistant parasites. Although treatment failure is frequently reported during antimonial therapy of both CL and VL, antimonial resistance has never been investigated in Algeria. We determined the level of antimonial susceptibility amongst Leishmania in Algeria. We analyzed 106 isolates including 88 collected between 1976 and 2013 in Algeria from humans, dogs, rodents, and phleomines and 18 from dogs in France. All Algerian isolates were collected in 14 localities leishiasis endemic. We determined the 50 inhibitory concentrations ( IC ) of antimony tarate ( Sb III ) and sodium stibogluconate ( Sb ) in promastigotes and intramacroph amastigotes, respectively. The epidemiological cutoff allowed to differentiate Leish species causing CL or VL that were susceptible ( ) or insusceptible ( ) to Sb III. The IC values were 23. 83 μg/mL and 15. 91g for VL and CL, respectively. We report a trend of Sb in VL isolates during the period. In contrast, an increase in frequency of isolates causing CL was observed during the same period. Our results provide insight into spatiemporal of Leish Sb in Algeria.
Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with a complex etiology. Infection with foodborne pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis increases the risk of developing CD in the post-infectious period, but the mechanisms underlying this relationship are unknown. We developed two models to study the comorbidity of acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacterium in mice colonized with adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), a bacterial pathogen linked to CD. We show that disease activity in the post-infect period after gastroenteritis is driven by the tissue expansion of the AIE pathogen, accompanied by an increase in immunopathology defects, barrier defects, and mucosal restitution delays following pathogen clearance. These features require AIE resistance to host defense peptides and amin inflammatory response to enteric pathogen. Our results suggest that individuals colonized by AIE at the time of infectious gastroenter may be at risk for CD. Importantly, we identify AIE as a tractable disease modifier, a finding that could be exploited in the development of interventions following infectious gastroenter in at-risk individuals.
In flowering plants, the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis consists of two gametic cells, the egg and central cell, which are flanked by five accessory cells. Both gametic and accessory cells are essential for fertilization. However, the mechanisms that underlie the formation of accessory versus gametic cell fate are unknown. In a screen for regulators of egg cell fate, we isolated the lach ( lis ) mutant which forms supernumerary egg cells. In lis mutants, accessory cells differentiate into gametic cells, indicating that LIS is involved in a mechanism that prevents accessory cells from adopting gametic fate. LIS is expressed in gametic cells and is homologous to yeast splicing factor PR4, suggesting that components of the splice apparatus participate in cell fate decisions.
Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are a major public health problem in rural Ethiopia. The role of footwear in protecting against NTDs is gaining attention, but little is known about the factors that influence its use. We used the PRECE-DE-PROCEED model to assess the social, behavioral, educational, and ecological factors that influence whether children wear shoes in a highland Ethiopian community endemic for podoiosis. We gathered information from 242 respondents using focus groups, semi-structured interviews and case studies. We found that shoe-wearing is changing, with going barefoot increasingly seen as shameful. Shoes are thought to confer dignity as well as protection against injury and cold. However, practical and social barriers prevent the desire to wear from being translated into practice. Limited resources mean people are unable to purchase more than one pair of shoes to ensure longevity or afford of quality. As a result, shoes are preserved for special occasions and not provided for children until they reach a certain age. While some barriers ( e. g. fit, fear of labeling of certain shoe type ) may be specific to certain diseases, underlying barriers related to poverty ( e. g. price, unsuitability for daily activities, low perception ) are likely relevant to a range of NTDs. We identified several barriers to shoe-wearing amenable to intervention that will benefit those considering NTD prevention through shoe distribution.
Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a neurotrophic alphaherpesvirus that replicates in the nervous system. The Us9 protein plays a central role in targeting viral glycoproteins to axons of infected sympathetic neurons. However, it is unclear how Us promotes axonal sorting of viral proteins. In this report, we show that Us is associated with lipid rafts and this association is critical for Us-mediated sorting of structural proteins. We used polarized PC12 cells, a ratheochromocytoma line that acquires characteristics of sympathetic neurons in presence of nerve growth factor (NGF). In these cells, Us is enriched in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Moreover, reducing Us affinity for lipid rafts inhibited anterog transmission from neurons to epithelial cells in vitro.
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a form of nongenic heterogeneity in growth rate correlates with susceptibility to acute heat stress at the single-cell level. We show that heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) levels through the conserved Ras/cAMP/protein A ( PK ) pathway and its transcription factors M2 and M4 underlies thisongenic heterogeneity. Lower cAMP levels correspond to slower growth, as shown by direct comparison of cAMP in subpopulations enriched for slower vs faster cells. An endogenous reporter of this pathway’s activity correlates with growth in cells. The paralogues M2 and M4 differ inongenic heterogeneity in a way that demonstrates slow growth and stress are not linked. Heterogeneity in rate requires M4, whereas M2 is required forenic heterogeneity of T1, a subunit trehalose synth that contributes to acute-stress. Perturbingongenic heterogeneity by mutating in this pathway or culturing wild-type with cell-perable cAMP 8romoAMP or PK inhibitor H89 significantly impacts acute stress.
Chikungunya virus (CHV) is an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family that causes severe febrile disease in humans. In December 2013, the Asian lineage of CHV spread from the Old World to the Americas, rapidly spreading throughout the New World. To understand how CHV may have evolved during this outbreak, we studied the genetic diversity present in infected individuals in Guadeloupe and Martinique, two islands in the center of the epidemic. We used deep-sequencing and bioinformatics to characterize the variants present in CHV infected individuals. We observed changes in the consensus sequence as well as a range of minority variants at various levels in the population. Furthermore, diversity was dramatically reduced after single passages in cell lines. We constructed an infectious clone from this outbreak and identified a novel 3’ untranslated region ( UTR ) structure not found in nature that led to increased replication in cells. We performed intrahostasis analysis of the new CHV outbreak in the Caribbean. We identified variants present in individuals as well as new 3UTR structure suggesting CHV has evolved in short time once entered naïve population.
UOR is a previously unannotated gene that regulates cell growth and mTOR signaling. We show that UOR depletion promotes neurite outgrowth in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells by activating mTOR signaling and promoting cell growth. In contrast, UOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines. We also show that UOR inhibits mTOR signaling by stabilizing the mTOR component DEOR in cultured cells and zebraf, and that UOR depletion results in higher mTOR activity and aggravates HRAS (12 ) induced neoplas in zraf. Furthermore, UOR promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in a xenraft mouse model.
Trypanosoma bruce, the protozoan parasite responsible for human African trypanosomias, is poorly understood in terms of its biology and pathogenesis due to the unknown functions of the majority of its proteins. Here, we present a global map of protein-protein interactions in the procyclic life stage of T. brucei. Using biochemical fractionation, we identified 128 high-confidence complexes encompassing 716 protein groups, including 635 previously uncharacterized proteins. These complexes correlate with known pathways and coexpressed proteins across the T. bri life cycle, providing potential functions for a large number of uncharacterized proteins. We validated functions of novel proteins associated with RNA-editing machinery, identifying a candidate involved in post-transcriptional regulation of T. bruce. Our results provide an unprecedented view of the protein map of T. bruce and serve as a resource for further characterization of tryosid proteins.
Lymph nodes are among the most common sites of extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in humans, and thoracic LNs are frequently infected. However, the dynamics of Mtb infection in LN and its effect on LN structure and function are relatively unstudied. We analyzed thoracic LNs from M-infected cynolgus rhes macques using PET scans, bacterial burden, LN structure, and immune function. FDG avidity correlated with presence of bacteria in LNs at necropsy. We show that LNs have different trajectories ( increasing, decreasing in activity over time ) even within same animal. Rhes macques are more susceptible to M infection than cynolg macques due to extensive LN pathology. Mtb grows to same level in cynolg and rhes mac LNs, however cynolg mac control Mtb later post-infection while rhes do not. Notably, compared to granulomas, LNs are poor at killing M, even with treatment. Granulomas in L lack B-rich structures, disrupt LN by pushing T and B cells, introduce macrophages that serve M niches, destroy vasculature. Our data show L are not only sites of antigen and immune activation during infection, but also important for persistence of M bacilli.
Microsporidia are a group of intracellular pathogens that infect a wide range of animals, but are poorly understood. The nematode Caenorhabis elegans has been used as a model to study microidia through the identification of its natural pathogen Nematida paris. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microidia are in C. elegans and other nematodes in the wild. Here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microidian infections. Nematida was found to be the most common microidian infecting C elegans in the wild. In addition, we describe six new species in the Nematida genus. Our phylogenetic analysis identify two subclades distinct from Nematida and name them Enteropra and Ptospora. Unlike Nemat, these genera belong to the clade of microidia that includes human pathogens. All microidia are horizontally transmitted and specifically infect intestinal cells, except Ptos that replicates mostly in epidermis of C elegans host.
Chemokine receptors are a subclass of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that play important roles in the human immune system and are involved in cancer metastasis as well as HIV infection. A number of studies have shown that homo- and heterodimers of the chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR modulate receptor function. In addition, membrane affects chemine receptor activity. Here, we report homo and heterodimer configurations of the chemine receptors CXCR, C5 and C2 at atomic detail, obtained from molecular simulations. The homodimer patterns were similar for closely related chemine receptors, yet differed between the receptors CX4. Despite high identity, modulated the homimer in a subtype manner. Chemine heterodimers display dimer patterns for CX4/5 and CX4/2. Furthermore, between CX and C5 reveal increased compared to CX/2 heterodimer patterns.
Systemic leishmaniasis is a disease known to present with fever, hepatosplenomegaly and wasting. In addition to the classical form, a sub-clinical form has been identified with one or two of the above symptoms missing and other findings such as lymphadenopathy and anemia. We report a third form which we refer to as “atypical”. Patients suspected to be immune-deficient were referred to immunology laboratory to study aspects of immune functions not covered in general. Multiple tests were performed including microscopic examinations and cultures of biopsies on specialized media. 19.4% of 160 patients had normal laboratory profiles but macrophages laden Leish parasites. Findings allowed us to uncover atypical systemic leishias. It presents with masquerading condition in which immune is non functional. This predisposes patients to recurrent infections with clinical signs and symptoms. Findings alert us that leishias presents wider spectrum than suspected and more common than diagnosed. Among 31 patients was number of adults. This proves that leishias not limited to pediatric group. We recommend diagnosis atypical leish in patient with unexplained immunity and no obvious immunologic defect.
Genome-wide analysis of human disease-causing alleles reveals that their locations are correlated in paralogous proteins. Millions of mutations and polymorphisms occur in human populations are potential predictors of disease, reactions to drugs, predisposition to infections, and age-related conditions such as impaired brain and cardiovascular functions. However, predicting the phenotypic consequences and clinical significance of a variant is not an easy. Computational approaches have found perturbation conserved amino acids to be useful for identifying likely variants with phenotyp consequences. We have assembled a collection of known disease-causing variants from OMIM and Human Mutation Database ( HG ) and identified pairs of variants that occur homologous within paralog human proteins. Our analyses demonstrate that locations are correlated in paralog proteins. Moreover, if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely disease-causing as well. Thus, variantairs can be used to identify disease-causing, extend procedures for prioritization and provide candidates for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
Malaria is caused by the parasite Plasmodium falcum is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical regions. The parasite is exposed to multiple pressures within the human host, but the extent to which it responds or is selected by this environment is unclear. Previous studies have shown that parasites causing severe malaria have increased expression of a subset of PfEMP1 variant antigens, which are major targets of protective immunity. Here, we used RNA sequencing ( RNAseq ) to study gene expression in 44 isolates causing severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papua New Guine patients. We found that the transcriptomes of parasites causing severe malaria had decreased glycolysis without activation of compensatory pathways; altered chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation through histone methylation; reduced Pf1 surface expression; and downregulated multiple chaperone proteins. We also identified novel associations between disease and Pf1 transcripts, domains and smaller segments and confirmed previously reported associations between Pf1 sequences and disease. These findings will inform efforts to identify targets for severe malaria and indicate how parasites adapt or are selected by the environment in severe malaria.
Long-term delivery of broadly neutralizing antibodies is a promising approach for the prevention of HIV-1 infection. In this study, we used an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to intramuscularly deliver anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in IgG form to rhesus monkeys. We achieved persisting levels of delivered mAb as high as 270 μg/ml. However, host responses to the delivered antibody were observed in 9 of the 12 monkeys and appeared to limit the concentration of delivered antibody that could be achieved. This is reflected in the range of delivered mAb that were achieved: 1–270g. Following repeated, dose intravenous challenge with the difficult-to-neutralize SIVmac, the six in the AAV-Ig1 m group showed protective effects despite absence of detectable neutralizing activity against the virus. The effects included lowering of viral load at peak; lowering of load at point; delay in time to peak load from time of the virus exposure. All were statistically significant. In addition, the with the highest level of m completely resisted successive SIVmac i. challenges, including final with dose i. units.
Proteins are traditionally assumed to respond linearly to thermal or structural perturbations, such as ligand binding or detachment. Conformational motions in proteins are analyzed in terms of normal modes and thermal fluctuations in macromolecules are interpreted as excitation of normal modes. However, we have found that the linearity is deficient for lig-induced conformation motions and even for thermal fluctuations. The deficiency is pronounced in KIF1 where normal description fails to describe mechanochemical motions.
Caveolins and Caveolae Regulate Clathrin-Independent Endocytosis: A Novel Mechanisms of Crosstalk between Endocytic Pathways  
Caveolins and caveolins are crucial components of caveolae, microdomains that also constitute an endoc route. Here we show that specific caveolar proteins are negative regulators of clath-independent endocyt. Cavin-1 and Cavin-3, but not Cavin-2 or Cavin-4, inhibit the clath-independent/GPIAP enriched endosomal (CL/GEE ) endytic pathway in a process independent of cave formation. Caveolin-1 (C1) and Cavin-3 also inhibit CL/GEE upon overexpression. Expression of caveolar leads to reduction of CL/GEE carriers as detected by quantitative microscopy. The CLEE pathway is upregulated in cells lacking Cavin-1/Cavin or reduced Cavin-3. Inhibition by caveins can be mimicked by isolated caveolin scaffolding and perturbed diffusion of lipid components as revealed by fluorescence after photobleaching (FRAP). In absence of caveins and caveol C1 is endocyted through CLEE but loses polarization and sorting with consequences for membrane and endytic in migrating cells and tissue.
Aspartate-Less Receiver (AL) Domains: Distribution, Structure, and Function. Two-component signaling systems are ubiquitous in bacteria and Archaea and play important roles in sensing and responding to environmental stimuli. To propagate a signaling, a typical system employs a histidine kinase that phosphorylates a Receiver (REC) domain on a conserved aspartate (Asp) residue. We have compiled all REC domains missing this residue, renamed aspartate-Less (AL) domains. Our data show AL are common and enriched when attached to rare effector outputs. Analysis of informatics and AL structures, combined with biochemical and genetic data of AL archetype Rit from Streptococcus pneumonia, suggest AL have reorganized active pockets to take constitutive role or accommodate signals other than phosphorylation, while retaining post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimer interface.
Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) are a type of oncolytic virus that have shown efficacy in clinical trials. Most of them are attenuated by deletions/mutations that counteract the host response and selectively grow in cancer cells defective in anti-viral response. We developed next-generation HSVs that carry no deletions/mutations and are specific to tumor receptors, e. g. HER2 ( human epidermal growth factor 2 )—are fully virulent in cancer cells. We report the first study of HER2-retargeted, fullyirulent HSVs in immunocompet mice. Both unarmed and IL-12-armed HS inhibited the growth of HER2-Lewis lung carcinoma-1 ( HER-LL1 ) tumor, with IL-12 being more efficacious. All mice that did not die of primary tumors were protected from growth of contralateral tumors. Long-term survivors were protected from secondal tumor, providing evidence of absc immunotherapeutic effect.
Vaccine-induced CD4 T cells have been shown to be susceptible to HIV infection, raising concerns about the safety of adenovirus (Ad)-based HIV vaccines. We investigated the susceptibility of Ad5-specific CD4 cells from the RV144 trial and ALV-specific CD4 cells from the RV144 trial. While Ad5-specific CD4 cells were readily infected by HIV, ALV-specific CD4 cells were less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV in vitro. The lower susceptibility of ALV-specific CD4 cells was associated with reduced expression of HIV co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4. Phenotypically, ALV-specific CD4 cells displayed a Th1 phenotype with higher IFNγ and CCL4 (M-β) but little IL-17. ALV and Ad vectors induced distinct profiles of vector-specific CD8 vs CD4 T-cell proliferative responses in PBMC, with ALV inducing CD8 proliferation and Ad CD4. Depletion of AL-specific CD8 cells in PB led to a modest increase in HIV infection of AL-specific CD4 cells, suggesting a role of AL-specific CD8 cells in protecting AL-specific CD4 cells from HIV.
X-chromosome inactivation is a universal among therian mammals, where one X chromosome is transcriptionally silenced in each female somatic cell. However, the choice of which X chromosome to silence varies among species. X-chromosome inactivation strategies range from paternal X inactivation (PX), which renders females haploid for paternal alleles, to random X inactivation (RX), equalizing maternal and paternal allele expression in each tissue. We present a population genetic analysis of X inactivation evolution, considering conditions of dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection. Our results indicate a critical interaction between allelic dominance and sexifferential can select a broad range of inactivation strategies, including unequal rates between maternal and paternal X-chromosomes. RX is favored over PX as long alleles deleterious to females are recessive, and criteria for RX evolution is more restrictive when variation is sexually antagonistic. Evolution from PX to RX generally increases female fitness at expense of male.
ZAP is a host protein that restricts the infection of many viruses by degrading viral RNA, inhibiting translation, and inducing innate immune responses. So far, only yellow fever virus has been reported to be ZAP-resistant. Here, we investigated the antiviral potential of human ZAP isoforms Z-L and Z-S against flaviviruses Japanese encephalitis (JEV), dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIK). We found that Z overexpression of Z blocked JEV but not DENV or ZIK infection, and depletion of endogenous Z enhanced JEV replication. Z hampered JEV translation and targeted viral RNA for 3′-5′ exosome degradation. The zincinger motifs of Z were essential for RNA targeting and anti-JEV activity. JEV 3′-UTR, especially the region with dumbbell structures and high content of dinucleotide, was mapped to Z and confer sensitivity to Z. We identified JEV as the first Z-sensitive flavivirus. Z may act as intrinsic antiv factor through RNA binding against J infection.
Rift Valley fever virus (RVV) is a zoonotic pathogen that causes severe hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis in humans and animals. It is endemic in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, but has the potential to be introduced into non-endemic regions with devastating effects on livestock and concurrent human infections. We investigated the host response to infection with wild-type Z501 and vaccine strain MP12 in C57BL/6 mice. Mice infected with live-attenuated MP12 survived productive infection with minimal disease and cytokine response in tissues. In contrast, Z501 infection was lethal with lymphocyte and platelet depletion and a strong systemic cytokine response correlating with high virus titers and tissue pathology. Lymphopenia and platelet depletion indicated disease onset with lymphocyte recovery correlating with G-CS production. RVV is hepatotropic with significant clinical and histological data supporting these findings; however, a significant pro-inflammatory response in the liver was not apparent. Rather, infection resulted in chemokine response with neutrophil infiltration supported by histological data. In brains of Z501 infected mice, chemine and pro-inflammatory response was evident with little pathology. These data suggest that RVV pathogenesis in mice is associated with liver function loss due to necrosis and hepatitis and long-term disease is neurologic in nature supported by human and BAL/c mouse observations.
Chemoresistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a major obstacle to improving patient survival. Chemoresistance mechanisms in TNBC are not well understood. Our results show that C motif chemokine ligand 20 (C20 ) is significantly elevated during taxane-containing chemotherapy in TNBC patients with no pathologic complete response. C20 promotes self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells (BCs) or cancer stem cells through protein Cζ (PK ) or 38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP )-mediated p65 nuclear factor B (NF- ) activation, increasing tax resistance of BCs. Moreover,20 promotes NF activation ATP-binding subfamily member 1 (ABCB1)/multidrug 1 (DR ) expression, leading to extracellular efflux of taxanes. These results suggest chemotherapy-induced20 mediated chemores via upregulation of CB1. In addition, NF activation20 increases20, forming positive feedback between NF and20 pathways which sustains chemores in cancer cells. Our results suggest20 can be novel marker for taxane response and blockade of20 or downstream might reverse tax resistance in breast patients.
Toxoplas gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that infects virtually all nucleated cells in warm-blooded animals. The ability of Toxoplas tachzoites to infect and manipulate its host is dependent on its ability to transport GRA proteins from unique secretory organelles called dense granules into the host cell. These proteins have diverse roles in Tooplas’s intracellular lifecycle, including co-opting host functions such as cell cycle and p38 MAP kinase. Some GRAs, such as GRA16 and GRA24, are secreted into the parasitoph vacuole ( PV ) where Tooplas replicates and transported across the PV membrane ( PVM ) into host. However, the translocation process and machinery are not well understood. We previously showed that TMY1, cleaved by T5 into two fragments, localizes to PVM and is essential for GRA transport into host. To identify additional proteins necessary for effector transport, we screened Tooplas mutants in c-M upregulation for ability to export GRA and GRA to host. Here we report that MY2 and MY3 play crucial role in translocation of subset GR into host. MY and MY are secreted into PV and co-localize with PVM. Consistent with predicted transmembrane domains, all are membrane-associated and MY3 but MY stably with MY1 whose N and C-terminal are disulf-linked. We show that intrinsically disordered effectors to structured DH domain blocks transport consistent with translo-based model effector.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) and bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1) E2 proteins bind to the origin recognition complex (ORC) component ORC2. However, OR2 is not detected at the viral origin. Depletion of OR2 enhances PV replication in a transient replication model in keratinocytes and maintains viral episomes, while there is no effect on copy number in a line with integrated HPV genomes. Consistent with this, occupancy of E1 and E at the origin increases following OR2 silencing. These data imply that OR2 is not necessary for activation of the origin by E and E but instead suppresses replicative function. Furthermore, we observed that over-expression of HPV2 decreases OR2 at known mammalian origins of replication, suggesting that restricts pre-OR assembly that otherwise competes for host complexes necessary for viral amplification. We infer that OR2 with E restricts viral in the maintenance phase of the program and elevated levels that during differentiation subvert OR loading and synthesis at cellular origins.
Brucellos is one of the most common zoonoses globally, and Central Asia remains a Bruc hotspot. The World Health Organization classifies bruclos as a neglected zoonotic that is rarely in the spotlight for research and mainly affects poor, marginalized people. This study investigates the presence of Bruc DNA in bovine milk in the urban and periurban area of Dush, Tajikistan. Bruc DNA was detected in 10. 3% of 564 cow samples by IS-based real-time PCR. This is concerning because consumption of unpasteurified dairy products is common in the region. Furthermore, Bruc DNA was detected in the milk of seropositive cows, but 8.3% of seronegative cows also showed Bruc DNA. In addition, analysis of the rB gene suggests one cow was infected with B. abortus and another was likely infected B. melensis.
Chromosome and genome stability are crucial for normal cell function, and their instability often correlates with disease and dysfunction of DNA repair mechanisms. The pathogenic fungus Zoseptoria trici has eight accessory chromosomes that are highly unstable during meiosis and mitosis, transcriptionally repressed, and enriched with repetitive elements and heterochromatin marks, e. g. trimethylation of H3 lysine 9 and 27 ( H3K9me3, H3me27 ). To elucidate the role of heterochatin on genome stability in Z. trici, we deleted genes encoding methyltransferases responsible for H3me and Hme, k1 and k6, respectively, and generated a double mutant. We used experimental and genomic analyses to determine the impact of deletions on chromosome and genome stability in vitro and in planta. Whole genome sequencing, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq were used to compare changes in genome and chromatin structure and differences in expression between mutant and wildtype strains. Analyses of genome and ChIP data in H9-deficient strains revealed dramatic chromatin reorganization where Hme is mostly localized in regions enriched in wildtype. Many rearrangements and formation of new chromosomes were found in absence H9, accompanied by activation of transposable elements. In contrast, loss increased stability of chromosomes under normal conditions in vitro without large changes in expression. We conclude H9 is important for maintenance because it disallows Hme in constitutive heterochatin. This reduces overall stability of, generating “metastable” for quasiessential regions.
Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is an essential for preventing the onset of rabies in individuals exposed to the virus. Unfortunately, life-saving rabies vaccines and biologicals are often inaccessible and unaffordable, particularly to the poorest sectors of society who are most at risk and bear the largest burden of rabies. We analyzed different P vaccination regimens and evaluated their relative costs and benefits for victims and healthcare providers. We found P to be an extremely cost-effective intervention ( $200 less than $60/death averted ). Switching from intramuscular (IM) to equally efficacious intradermal (ID) regimens resulted in significant savings in vaccine volume required to treat the same number of patients, mitigating shortages and reducing costs of P. We present mechanisms to make P more affordable and accessible, subsidize cost for those in need, and support new and existing rabies prevention programs.
Toxoplas gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that replicates in mammalian cells within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that does not fuse with host organelles. One of the parasite’s mechanisms for nutrient acquisition is the attraction of host organelles to the PV. Here, we show that Toxoplas exploits host lipid droplets (LD), ubiquitous fat organelles, for nutrient acquisition. Toxoplas replication is reduced in host cells depleted of LD or impaired in lipolysis or fatty acidolysis. In infected cells, the number of host LD and expression of LD-associated genes (ADRP, DG2) increase until onset of parasite replication. Throughout infection, PV are surrounded by LD. Toxoplas accesses lipids in LD and incorporates them into its membranes and LD. Exogenous oleic acid stimulates LDogenesis in host and results in accumulation of lipids in large LD inside parasite. To access LD-derived lipids, Tooplas intercepts and internalizes LD within PV, some associated with Rab7, wrapped by intravacolar network (IV). Mutant parasites impaired IV display diminished lipid uptake from LD. Moreover, parasites lacking IV-localized phospholipase2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from LD in PV.
The liver flukes Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica cause fasciolosis, an emerging zoonotic disease of cattle and sheep. Chemotherapy is the main control measure and tricendazole is the preferred drug since it is effective against both juvenile and mature parasites. However, resistance to tricendazole has been reported in several countries, prompting the search for new chemical entities to control fluke infections. We screened a library of flavonoid derivatives for inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica cyste proteases Fh3 and Fh1. Chalcones with phenyl and naphthyl groups emerged as good cathein inhibitors, interacting with two putative sites within the active site of the enzymes. One compound C34 binds juvenile Fh3 with an IC50 of 5. 6 μM. C34 is a slow-reversible inhibitor that interacts with Cys catalytic dy and S2 S3 residues, determinants of substrate specificity of this cystine protease family. C induces reduction in ability to migrate through gut and loss of motility leading to death in vitro, while not cytotoxic to bovine cells.
Visual information about fast and slow changes in light intensity is transmitted through the retina by separate neural pathways. We used in vivo imaging to investigate how bipolar cells transmit these signals to the inner retina. We found that the volume of the synaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to different temporal filtering. Individual cells transmit through terminals of varying size, but smaller terminals generate faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher gain, followed by more adaptation. Larger terminals transmitted lower frequencies more effectively. Modeling calcium dynamics triggering vesicle release indicated that variations in volume of presynaptic compartments directly contribute to these differences in response.
Fluorescence microscopy (FM) and electron microscopy (EM) are used to study the brain’s vast synaptic networks, but each has limitations. FM offers high speed and low cost, but discrimination between synaptic and non-synaptic signals is challenging. In contrast, EM is reliable for synapse identification, but offers limited molecular discrimination and is slow and costly. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel probabilistic method to detect synapses from multiplex FM (mux) data. We used datasets from correlative array tomography (cAT), which provides voxel-conjugate FM and EM images of the same synapses. Our method accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as queries and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel is part of a syn. We show that our algorithm detects synapses from mux data as well as human annotators seeing only mux, and reproduces known features of cortical syn distributions.
Zinc is a trace element that is essential for the proper functioning of approximately 3, 000 proteins. It is required for physiological processes such as nucleic acid metabolism, gene regulation, signal transduction, cell division, immune and nervous functions, and wound healing. Impairment of zinc homeostasis results in various pathologies. In mammals, zinc transport occurs via two transporter families, ZnT and ZIP. However, the mechanism of action of ZnT, responsible for vesicular zinc accumulation and secretion into milk during lactation, is unknown. Here we modeled the mechanism of action of ZnT computationally and experimentally, using zinc transport assays. We show that ZnT is a proton-coupled zinc antiporter. Bafilomycin A, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar ATPase, abolished Zn-dependent transport into intracellular vesicles. Using Lyso Red and Ly-pfluorin, we show that upon ZnT overexpression in intracellular vesicles and addition of exogenous zinc, vesicles underwent alkalization due to proton-zinc antiport. This was reversed in the presence of TP, a specific chelator. We propose that Zn functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry 2+/Zn+. Hence, Zn is a motive-driven, electrutral ves zinc exchanger, concentrating zinc in vesicles on expense of proton to cytoplasm.
Replication fork integrity is essential for maintaining genome stability and is monitored by checkpoint-mediated phosphorylation events. 14-3 proteins are able to bind phosphorylated proteins and have been shown to play a role in DNA replication stress. Exonuclease 1 ( Exo ) processes stalled forks in checkpoint-defective yeast cells. Here, we identify 14-3 proteins as in vivo interaction partners of Exo, in yeast and mammalian cells. Yeast 3–deficient cells fail to induce Mec–dependent Exo hyperphosphorylation and accumulateo–dependent ssDNA gaps at forks, as revealed by electron microscopy. This leads to persistent checkpoint activation and recovery defects. Moreover, we show that 3 proteins promote progression under limiting nucleotide concentrations using DNA electrophoresis. We propose that 3 proteins assist in phosphorylation of Exo and additional targets, promoting fork stability and restart in response to replication stress.
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) play a complex role in the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection. In a humanized mouse model, HIV infection leads to persistent infection and immunopathogenesis, including induction of type I interferons (IFN), immune activation and depletion of leukocytes, including CD4 T cells. We developed a monoclonal antibody that depletes pDC in lymphoid organs of humanized mice. When p were depleted prior to HIV infection, induction of IF and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were abolished during acute HIV infection with either a highly pathogenic CCR/CX4-tropic HIV or standard C5ropic HIV isolate. Consistent with anti-viral role of IF, HIV replication was upregulated in p-depleted mice. Interestingly, cell death induced by highly pathogenic HIV was reduced in p-de mice. During chronic HIV infection, depletion p also reduced induction of IF and IS, with elevated HIV replication. Surprisingly, HIV depletion of human cells in lymphoid, not blood, was reduced despite increased replication. The number in lymphoid was associated with reduced HIV-induced death human leukocytes including CD cells. We conclude p play opposing roles in suppressing HIV replication and promoting immunogenesis.
Sulforaphane (SF) Inhibits HIV Infection of Macrophages through Nrf2 Activation  
Sulforane (SF) is a compound found in cruciferous vegetables that mobilizes nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to reprogram cellular gene expression. Here we show that SF blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells. SF also blocks infection in PMA-differentiated promocytic cell lines but not in other cell lines. siRNA-mediated depletion of Nrf boosted HIV infectivity in macrophages and reduced anti-viral effects of SF treatment. This supports a model in which anti-viral activity is mediated through Nrf after is mobilized by SF. SF blocks infection after entry but before formation of 2-L circles. Neither SAM1 nor MX were upregulated.
Ascaris lumbricoid, hookworm, and Trichuris trichi are common geohelth infections among pregnant women in rural western Kenya. In a community-based cross-sectional study, 390 pregnant women were interviewed and asked to provide blood and fecal samples. Among them, 76. 2% were infected with at least one geelth, 52.3 with Ascaris lumicoid, 39.5 with hookworm, and 29. with Trichuris trichi. Infection with at least geel was associated with use of unprotected water source (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.–.3 ) and lack of water treatment (OR 1.8, 95 CI.–.1 ). Geelth infections were not associated with clinical symptoms or body mass index. Hook infection was associated with lower upper arm circumference (mean 0.7,95 CI.–.2 ). Hook infection with egg count ≥100/gram was associated lower hemoglobin (mean 1.5,95.–. ) Among gravid 2 and 3, Ascaris lumicoid was less likely to have malaria (OR 0.,95.–. ) compared to others.
Mycolone is a macrolide produced by the pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and immunomodulatory properties. Here we investigated whether mycolone affects the inflammatory responses of nervous cell subsets involved in pain perception and transmission. We also investigated the effects of mycol on neuroinflammation associated with chronic pain in vivo. We isolated sensory neurons, Schwann cells and microglia from mice for ex vivo assessment of myone cytotoxicity and immunomod activity by measuring production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Myone induced cell death at concentrations >10ng/ml within 48h, but suppressed production of pro-inflammatory mediators at nanomolar concentrations without affecting viability. Myone prevented pro-inflammatory polarization of microglia, which contribute to neuroinflammation. We tested myone impact on this process in vivo using a rat model of neuropathic pain induced by sciatic nerve constriction. Myone was injected daily in the spinal canal for 3 days. This failed to prevent injury-induced neuroflamm but decreased local production of inflammatory cytokines without cytotoxicity.
African trypanosomias (AT) is a lethal disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambense that has a range of clinical outcomes in its human host in West Africa. In order to test if this diversity is influenced by host genetic determinants, the association between candidate gene polymorphisms and AT was investigated in populations from AT foci in Guinea. Samples were collected from 425 individuals, comprising 232 AT cases, 79 subjects with lasting positive specific serology but negative parasitology and 114 endemic controls. Genotypes of 28 SNPs in eight genes passed quality control were used for association analysis. We found that IL6 rs1819 allele was associated with lower risk of progressing from latent to active disease (p = 0.000, OR = 0.39, CI [.24–.63, BF 0.003 ). MIF36071 allele was associated with increased risk (p = 0.023, OR 1.65, CI [1.–2.53, BF 0.669 ) but did not remain after Bonferr correction. MIF459 allele was associated with latent infections ( =.007, OR 1.86 CI [.–.95, BF.215 ). We confirmed earlier observations that AP1 G allele ( ) was associated with higher risk and AP1 polymorphism with lower of developing AT. No associations were found with other genes. Our data show that genes are involved in modulating Tryosoma bruce gambense infection in individuals from Guinea.
The genetic diversity of South Asians is considerable due to differences in culture and language. Previous studies on the genetic structure of Indians have mostly relied on microarray genotyping or targeted sequencing of mitochondria and Y chromosomes. In this study, 38 individuals from the Singapore Indian population underwent whole-genome sequencing with a coverage of 30X as part of the Singapore Sequencing Indian Project ( SSIP ). The genetic diversity of these samples was compared against samples from the Sequencing Malay Project and Phase 1 of the 1, 000 Genomes Project ( KGP ). The SS samples exhibited greater intra-population genetic diversity and higher heterozygous-to-homozyous genotype than other Asian populations. When compared to a panel of well-defined Indians, the genetic of SS samples was closely related to South Indians. However, the SS samples clustered distinctly from Europeans in global structure with autosomal SNPs. Eight samples were assigned to mitochondrial haplogroups predominantly present in Europeans and had higher European admixture than remaining samples. Analysis of relatedness between SS and archaic homins ( Denis, Neander ) identified higher admixture in East populations than SS.
Burkholderia pseudomallei is an intrinsically resistant to aminoglycosides and macrolides due to the expression of the AmrAB-OA efflux pump. We investigated the molecular basis of aminoglyide susceptibility in Thai clinical isolates 708, 218a, and 379a. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR ( qRT-PCR ) revealed the absence of amr transcripts in 708 and greatly reduced levels in 218 and 379. Serial passage on increasing gentamicin concentrations yielded 218 and 379 mutants that became simultaneously resistant to aminoglyides and macrolides, whereas mutants could not be obtained with 708. Transcript analysis showed the resistance of 218 and 379 mutants was due to upregulation of amr-opA expression by unknown mechanisms. Use of PCR walking revealed the amr-opA operon was missing in 708 and this was associated with deletion of more than 70 kb genetic material. Rescue of the amrB region from 708 fosmid and sequencing showed a large chromosome deletion of 131 and 141 kb compared to K43 and 10, respectively. This deletion removed the amr operon and entire clusters for malleactin and cobal synthesis. Other deleted genes included anaerobic arginine deaminase, putative type fimbria and secreted chitinase. Whole genome and PCR confirmed absence of these from 708. Despite missing putative virulence genes 708 was fully virulent in murine model.
T helper cell differentiation is a complex process by which naive CD4 T cells differentiate into Th1 or Th2 lineages. This process is typically driven by lineage-specific transcription factors and repressed by alternative lineages. We investigated the differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into Th1 versus Th states by quantifying transcripts and immunofluorescence in individual cells. Contrary to mutually exclusive expression of antagonistic transcription factors, we observed their co-expression in individual cells at high levels distinct from basal co-expression during priming. We found that cytokines are expressed in a small subpopulation of cells independent of transcription factors in these cells. This cell-to-cell variation in cytokine expression during early T cell differentiation is larger than in fully differentiated state. Upon cytokine inhibition, we observed antagonistic transcription factors, revealing intracellular network otherwise overruled by extracellular signals. These results suggest early CD T cells acquire mixed Th/Th state instructed by extracellular cytokines. The interplay between extracellular and intracellular components unveiled Th differentiation may be common for mammalian cells against noisy cytokine expression.
C. elegans PAQR-2 is a homologous to the insulin-sensizing adiponectin receptors in mammals and is essential for adaptation to 15°C, a low temperature that is usually lethal for this organism. By screening for paqr-2 suppressors, we identified genes involved in phosphatidylcholine synthesis ( ce-1,cy-1 and s-1 ) and fatty acid metabolism (ech-, hac- m- n- hr- sb-1 ). We show that pa-2, phosphatidcholines sb- and Δ-desaturases form a cold adaptation pathway that regulates the increase in unsaturated fatty acids necessary to retain membrane fluidity at low temperatures.
Herpesviruses are among the most prevalent and well-characterized human pathogens. However, much remains to be learned about the structure of the genome packaging and release machinery in the capsids of these large and complex double-stranded viruses. The machinery is well characterized in bacteriophages, which share an evolutionary origin with herpesviruses. In bacterophages, the genome exits the particle through a portal and is transferred into the cell by a complex ( i. e. the tail ) located at the vertex. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy of human simplex-1 ( HSV-1 ) virions to reveal a previously unsuspected feature at the vertex, which extends the HSV tegument to form a connection between theid and the viral. The location suggests it plays a role in release into the nucleus and also for virion.
Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigen (SEA) and recombinant Omega-1 modulate CD4+ T-lymphocyte responses and HIV-1 infection in vitro. Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic helminth that evades and dampens the human immune response through numerous mechanisms, which may have consequences for HIV-1 transmission and disease progression. Here we analyzed the effects of SEA on HIV-1 infection and cytokine/chemokine production in vitro. We found that SEA, specifically kappa-5, potently binds to DC-SIGN and blocks DC-S mediated HIV-1 transfection (p<. 0.05 ) whilst not interfering with cis-infection. DC exposed to SEA under Th2 conditions induced a T-cell population that was less susceptible to HIV-1 R infection (p<.0.05 ) compared to DCs unexposed, whereas HIV- X virus was unaffected. This was not observed for DC exposed under Th1 or Th1/2 conditions. T populations induced by SEA exposed DC demonstrate reduced capacity to produce IF-γ and M-β. The profile of T infected with HIV R was not associated with downmodulation of C5 surface expression. We further show that DC exposed to recombinant omega-1 (r-1), similar to natural-1, induced T populations were less susceptible to HIV R (p.05 ) but not X virus. This was associated with reduction in IFγ and Mβ, but correlated with C5 expression. We have shown that SEA and r-1 modulate HIV infectivity with potential to influence disease in coinfected individuals.
Neuronal stimulation causes a 30% shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECSF) between neurons and astrocytes in grey and white matter under experimental conditions. We present a dynamic model that accounts for experimental data related to the shrinkage in wild-type as well as gene knockout individuals. We find that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, chloride, and passive action of the Na+/K pump and osmotically transport through the astrote membrane seem sufficient for shrinkage. However, taking into account ECS and astrote ion concentrations with neuronal stimulation, the Na+/Cl and NaH cotransporters appear critical for observed shrink.
Transposons and repetitive DNA elements are abundant in eukaryotic genomes and can be detrimental to the organism if transcribed. In Arabidopsis thalian, these elements are silenced by the siRNA-mediated transcriptional silencing pathway, where noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) produced by RNA Polymerase V (Pol V ) guide ARGONAUTE (AGO ) to chromatin and attract enzymes that establish repressive chromatin modifications. We show that SPTLTF1, a silencing factor and homolog of SPT elongation factors, binds chromatin at loci subject to transcription silencing. Chromatin binding of SPTLTF occurs downstream of RNAse V but independently of the presence of 24-nt siRNA. We also show SPTLTF and AGO are recruited to chrom in parallel and independently of each other. Using methylation restriction enzymes, binding both AGO and SPTTF is required for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications of loci.
Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, has a complex life cycle that involves transmission between ticks and mammals. While the roles of the rpoB and rpo genes have been extensively studied in the mammalian host, the contribution of the Rpo regulon to the tick phase of the Borrelia burgdferi life cycle has not been examined. Here, we show that Rpo-dependent gene expression is required for spirochete transmission by nymphs. In the absence of Rpo, spirochetes are confined to the midgut lumen where they transform into an unusual morphotype called round bodies during the later stages of the blood meal. We show that round body formation is reversible and appears to be, in part, due to reduced Coenzyme disulf reductase, which also provides NAD for glycolysis. Our data suggest that spirochet default to an Rpo-independent program for round body formation when transmission energetics are unfavorable.
Deficiency of gibberellin (GA) and jasmonate (JA) causes male sterility in Arabidopsis thaliana. GA triggers DELLA degradation to promote stamen development, but little is known about the relationship between GA and JA in stamen development. We show that MYB21, MY24, and MY57 are GA-dependent stamen-enriched genes. Loss-of-function of DELLA1 and DEL2 restores expression of these MY genes with stamen growth in GA-deficient plants. Genetic analysis shows myb21my24my57 triple mutant confers short stamen leading to sterility. Further studies show GA suppresses DELLA to mobilize DAD expression, a key JA biosynthesis gene. This is consistent with lower JA content in young buds of GA-deficient ga3gai2r1r1 compared to WT. We conclude GA promotes JA biosynthesis to control MY21 MY24 and MY57.
Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1 ) is a transcription factor that plays key roles in oxygen homeostasis, tumor formation, glucose metabolism, cell survival, and inflammatory response. It is one of the targets of the target of rapamycin (TOR ) pathway, a conserved kinase that regulates growth and metabolism in response to nutrients and growth. Here, we describe a novel role for HIF-1 in modulating lifespan extension by dietary restriction (DR ) in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that H-1 deficiency results in extended lifespan, which overlaps with inhibition of the RSK-1/S6 kinase, a component of the TOR pathway. H-1 modulates longevity in a nutrient-dependent manner using a modified DR method based on variation of bacterial concentrations on solid plates. We find that h-1 loss-function extends lifespan under rich conditions but fails to show extension under DR. Conversely, egl-9, which increases H-1 activity, diminishes lifespan under DR. This is rescued by tissue-specific expression ofegl-9 in neurons and muscles. Increased lifespan byh-1 is dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulatorinositol-requiring-1 (I-1) and associated with lower ER stress.
Transcription factors and chromatin modifications are known to play a key role in cell differentiation and lineage commitment. However, little is known about chromatin changes in transient states such as cell migration. Here we show that human keratinocyte progenitors either differentiating or migrating have unique enhancers and super-enhancers for each state. These super-enhancers are linked to expression of genes associated with the respective state and are enriched for disease variants. GR3, a transcription factor that promotes differentiation and migration, binds to super-enh in differentiating keratinocytes and to promoters in migrating cells with REST, repressing expression of migration inhibitors. Key epidermal differentiation factors, including GR3, are within super-enh and many bind and regulate super. GR3 represses formation of progenitor and nonkeratin super in differentiating keratinocytes.
Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections of the germline transmitted vertically from generation to generation. It is hypothesized that ERVs are used by the host as factors to block the infection of pathogenic retroviruses. Indeed, ERVs efficiently interfere with the replication of exogenous retroviruses. However, data that these mechanisms have influenced the coevolution of endogenous and exogenous retroviruses and their hosts have been difficult to obtain. Sheep are an interesting system to study retrovirus coevolution because of the coexistence in this species of exogenous ( i. e., horizontally transmitted ) oncogenic retroviruses, Jaags sheep retrovirus and enzoot nasal virus with related and biologically active endogenous retrovir (enRVs ). We isolated the evolutionary and molecular history of 27RVs. RVs have been in the genome for 5–7 y. Two RVs (RV1 andRV-20 ) entered the genome within 3 y before and during speciation the genus, acquired tempor distinct G poly resulting a transdom phenotype block replication exogenous. Both transdom RV became the genome before or sheep ( ∼, y ). Interestingly RV escaping transdom RV has emerged recently, likely last. We determined events during are indicative evolutionary antagon between endogenous exogenous retrovir. This strongly that endization and selection ERVs acting factors mechanism host fight retroiral.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium. The standard diagnosis relies on microscopic detection of eggs in stool or urine samples and serological assays. However, the sensitivity of standard microscopic procedures is poor, making molecular methods of interest. This study evaluated two in-house real-time Schos PCRs targeting S. mansoni and S. haematium in stool, urine, biopsies, and sera to diagnose active infections and monitor treatment efficacy. Schos PC were performed on 412 samples (124 urine, 86 stools, 8 biops, sera ) from patients with suspected schosiasis before treatment. Results were compared to microscopic and serological assays ( ELISA, HA, WB ). Compared to microscopy, PC increased sensitivity from 4% to 10.5% and 33.7 to 48.8% for Sh in urine and Sm stools, respectively. Serum PC sensitivity was 72.7% and 94.1 in patients with positive microscopy. Specificity was 98.9. After treatment, serum positivity declined from 93.8 at 30 to 8.3 at 360 whereas antibodies remained positive 1 year. Schos PC clearly outperformed microscopy on stools and urine and could be part of methods with WB-based serology, which remains standard for diagnosis. When serology is positive and microscopy negative, PC provides information for further exploration.
Machine learning has been used to speed up molecular simulations of small systems by estimating potential energy surfaces. We demonstrate that this approach is feasible for larger, structurally complex molecules. We take the natural product Archazolide A, a potent inhibitor of vacuolar ATPase from myxobacterium Archigephyra, as an example. Our model estimates new conformations by exploiting information from previous calculations via Gaussian regression. Predictive variance is used to assess if a conformation is in interpolation, allowing a trade-off between accuracy and speed.
In Central Africa is a hotspot for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) of global and local importance, and the current outbreak of ebolavirus is affecting multiple countries simultaneously. Ebavirus is suspected to have caused recent declines in great apes. While ebavirus vaccines have been proposed as an intervention to protect apes, their effectiveness would be improved if we could diagnostically confirm Ebola virus (EVD) as the cause of die-offs, establish ebavirus distribution, immunologically naïve populations, and whether apes survive virus. Here we report the first non-invasive detection of antibodies against ebavirus (EV) from ape feces. Using this method, we have been able to identify gorillas with antibodies EV with an overall prevalence of 10%, demonstrating EV exposure or infection is not uniformly lethal in this species. Furthermore, evidence was identified in gorillas previously thought to be unexposed EV (protected by topological barriers of transmission ). Our approach will contribute to a strategy to protect apes from EV by early detection of incidence, identifying immunologically naïve at-risk as targets for vaccination, and providing means to track efficacy if intervention is appropriate.
Bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria secretes a novel type III effector protein Xop, which exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and in planta. This activity is associated with the C-terminal region of Xop, which interacts with E ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and mediates K11-linked polyubiquitin formation. The crystal structure of the Xop C-terminal domain revealed a novel fold termed XL-box, not present in previously characterized E3 ligases. Mutation of amino acids in the XL-box disrupts E ligase activity and prevents Xop-induced plant death. The XL-box lacks cysteine residues, suggesting a non-thioester ubiquitin-E ligase mechanism. The N-terminal of Xop contains a leucine-rich repeat ( LRR ) domain, which may serve as a protein-protein module for target recognition. While E3 activity is required for plant death, suppression of PAMP responses depends on the N-terminal LRR.
Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a major cause of global morbidity and mortality worldwide. The role of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells in HIV infection is not well understood. We investigated the function of circulating Tfh cells in HIV-infected individuals and the impact of early antiretroviral treatment (ART) on Tfh and B cell function. We used the RV cohort of HIV-infected individuals in early (stage 1 and 2 ) and late (stage 3 ) to study Tfh responses. We found impaired Tfh function in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2. Tfh/B cocultures showed lower B cell survival and Ig secretion in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2. This coincided with lower IL-10 and increased RANT and TN-α suggesting inflammation altered Tfh and B responses. Elevated viral load in stage 3 correlated with Tfh-mediated B Ig production, indicating increased viremia in Tfh impairment and humoral response. We also found phenotypic perturbations in the B compartment, notably decreased memory cells in stage 3 compared stage 1/, coinciding with viremia. Our coculture suggested intrinsic B defects could contribute to impaired response at lower level. Overall, Tfh B responses are significantly altered stage 3 compared stage 1, coinciding increased inflammation and reduction B. These data suggest early ART for HIV-infected individuals could prevent dysregulation while preserving Tfh function and B memory.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that affects over 200 million people worldwide and is currently treated with a single drug, praziquantel, which has several shortcomings. The need for next generation anthelmintics is underpinned by the process of validating physiologically relevant targets and pharmacologically profiling them is challenging. We have pharmacologically profiled a schosome serergic GPCR ( Sm.5TR ) as a downstream modulator of PZ efficacy in a miniaturized assay compatible with high screening. This employs a luciferase based biosensor sensitive to cellularAMP that resolves proximal kinetics of GPCR in intact. Data evidence divergent pharmacological signature between paras serergic receptor and closest human homolog ( H.5TR ) supports optimizing parasitic pharmacores. New ligands and series with potency and selectivity for Sm.5TR over H.5TR are identified in vitro and validated in vivo against schosules and adult worms. Sm.5TR also displayed irreversible inactivation phenomenon at H.5TR. These data underscore feasibility of flatworm GPCRs in screening to resolve classes of modulators. Further, these data promise Sm.5 as chemotherapeutic node for next generation anthelmics.
During embryonic development, the formation of the germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) is essential for the organization of the metazoan body. In some organisms, such as flies, fish, and amphibians, the ectodermesoderm boundary not only separates the germ layers, but also serves as a substrate for mesoderm migration. We show that cell detachment at the boundary, resulting from contact-induced signals, is the core of ectodermeserm segregation. Cells alternate between adhesion and detachment, requiring ephrin/Eph signaling. Multiple ephrin ligands and Eph receptors are expressed on each side of the boundary, and separation depends on forward signaling across the boundary in both directions, involving partially redundant ligands and receptors and activation of Rac and Rho.
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with increasing prevalence over the last four decades; however, the underlying pathophysiology remains unclear. Diagnosis is currently based on behavioral observations and psychometric tools. This study aims to incorporate biochemical data into diagnosis by analyzing metabolite concentrations of folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and transulfuration pathways in blood samples of 83 ASD participants and 76 age-matched neurotypical peers. Discriminant Analysis enables multivariate classification of participants as ASD or neurotypical, resulting in 96. 1% correct identification of neurotyp and 97.6% of ASD. Furthermore, Partial Least Squares is used to predict adaptive behavior, measured by Vineland Adaptive Composite score, where five metabolites of pathways are sufficient to predict Vineland score with R2 0.45 after cross-validation.
Leishmanias is a vector-borne disease endemic in 98 countries with approximately 350 million people at risk and 2 million cases annually. Brazil is one of the most affected countries. We applied Bayesian geostatistical negative binomial models to analyze incidence of cutaneous and visceral leishiasis in Brazil from 2001–2010. We used integrated Laplace approximations for fast Bayesian inference and variable selection to determine the most important climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic predictors of cutaneous and visceral leishias. For both types of leishias, precipitation and socioeconomic proxies were identified as risk factors. We predicted 30,189 ( SD 7,676 ) cases for cutaneous leias and 4,889 ( SD 288 ) for visceral leias in 2010. Our maps predicted highest numbers of infected in Minas Gerais and Par for visceral and cutaneous leias, respectively. Spatial maps identified priority areas for leishias control to reduce incidence.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that is spreading to new regions and changing the force of infection in endemic areas. Clinical experience suggests that adults have a different pattern of complications than children, but few reports have described the age-related spectrum of disease in contemporaneous groups of patients at the same location. We compared clinical and laboratory features, management, and outcome of 647 adults and 881 children with deng admitted to a hospital in southern Vietnam. We found that signs of vascular leakage and shock were more frequent and severe in children than adults, while bleeding and organ involvement were more common in adults. Adults had significantly more thrombocytopenia. Infection but not serotype was independently associated with thromocytopenia, with smaller effect than age. The effect of age on platelet count was apparent several weeks after recovery, indicating adults have intrinsically lower counts than children.
SIV infection of sooty mangabeys (SM), a natural host of SIVsm, is non-pathogenic despite robust virus replication. In contrast to HIV in humans and SIV in macaques. We identified a novel CCR5 allele in SM, Δ, encoding a truncated molecule that is not expressed on the cell surface and does not support SIV entry in vitro. This allele was present at 26% frequency in a large SM colony, along with 3% for CCRΔ24 allele that also abrogates surface expression. Overall, 8% of animals were homozygous for CCR alleles and 41% were heterozygous. The allele was also present in wild SM in Africa. CD+ and CD+ T cells displayed a gradient of C5 expression across groups, which was highly significant for CD cells. The prevalence of SIVm infection was not different in animals lacking C5 compared to heterozygous and homozygous wild-type animals. Furthermore, lacking C5 had robust viral loads that were only modestly lower than wild-type animals. SIVm isolates infected homozyg mutant and wild PBMC in C5-independent in vitro and Envs from C-null and wild animals used CX6, G15 and G1 in addition to5 in transfected cells.
The role of the transcription factor MEF2 in tumorigenesis is complex and can be either pro-oncogenic or tumor suppressive depending on its interaction with coactivators or co-repressors. MEF can supervise histone modifications associated with activation or repression, such as H3K methylation and H3 acetylation. Class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) are critical for the generation of a MEF repressive environment. In leiomyosarcoma (LMS), the dual role of MEF is relevant for tumor aggressiveness. Class II HDs are overexpressed in 22% of LMS, where high levels of HD4 and HD9 inversely correlate with overall survival. The knock out of HD9 suppresses the transformed phenotype of L cells by restoring transcriptional proficiency of MEF-target loci. HD9 coordinates the demethylation of H3me at the promoters of M-target genes. We show that II HDs do not bind all regulative bound by M. Hence, M-target genes can be both transcribed and repressed. However, repressed M-targets are poised in chromatin. Our results suggest II HD and HD9 as druggable targets for intervention in L.
Hydrophins are a class of proteins produced by filamentous fungi that play a crucial role in their interaction with their environment and have potential applications in biotechnology. In this study, we used a combination of docking, molecular dynamics, and cryo-electron microscopy to investigate the atomic structure of films composed of two class II hydrophins: HFBI and HFB produced by Trichoderma rei. Our results suggest that the film is composed of six proteins, with a unit cell size of 56 Å. However, our computational and experimental results show different symmetries: P6 and P3, respectively. We propose an alternate structure with a unit cell size and P symmetry, and use Monte Carlo simulation to show that this metastable structure may increase the rate of coverage of hydrophin films. This may have implications for both biology and nanotechnology.
Leishmania donovani is a protozoan parasite that causes visceral leishiasis. Aminoacyl tRNA synthases are enzymes required for protein synthesis and are known drug targets in bacteria and fungi. Here, we report the first characterization of Leishmaniaov ThrRS ( LThr ), the ThrRS of Leishmania. Recombinant LThr ( rThr ) was expressed in E. coli and purified. The kinetic parameters of rThr were determined. The subcellular localization ofThr was done by immunofluorescence. Heterozyg mutants ofThr were generated in Leish promastigotes. These genetically manipulated parasites were checked for proliferation, virulence, aminoacylation activity and sensitivity to Thr inhibitor borid. The 3D model of LThr was compared to human Thr. RecombinantThr displayed aminoacylation activity and is possibly localized to cytosol and mitochondria. Hetergotes showed restrictive phenotype and attenuated infectivity. These parasites were more susceptible to inhibition by borid. Several attempts to obtain Thr null mutants were not successful, indicating Thr is essential for Leish parasite. Borid showed strong affinity forThr ( KD:0.04 μM ) and inhibited aminoacy activity of rThr (IC:0.06 μM ). Borid inhibited promastig (IC:21M ) stage parasites. Our data show thatThr is essential for Leish survival and likely binds small molecules with strong affinity, making a potential drug target.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is recognized as non-self by the innate immune receptor RIG-I through the presence of a 5′- triphosphate (5′-pp ) on viral RNA in association with a 3′ poly-UUC tract. Here we define the HCV pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and criteria for R-I non discrimination of HCV by examining RNA structure-function attributes that impart AMP to poly-UUC tract. We found that the 34 nucleotide polyuridine core of this tract was essential for R-I activation and that interspersed ribosine nucleotides between poly sequences in RNA were required for optimal R-I induction. Importantly, 5′pp-polyU RNA variants that stimulated R-I efficiently bound purified R protein in vitro and interaction with both repressor and helicase domains of R-I was required for signaling. When appended to ′pp RNA lacking AMP activity, polyU-core conferred non recognition of RNA and innate signaling by-I. Importantly, HCV polyU variants that activated-I triggered potent responses in vitro and hepatic immune responses in vivo using mouse model of AMP signaling.
Eosinophils and IL-4 Promote Nematode Growth Coincident with Innate Response to Tissue Injury. Eosinophils are known to have functions beyond host defense and allergy to tissue regeneration. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which eosophils promote Trichinella spiralis larvae growth in skeletal muscle. Our results indicate that IL-4 and eosophils are necessary for normal larval growth and eosoph from IL-4 mice are sufficient to support growth. The eosophil effect operates in the absence of adaptive immunity. Following invasion by larvae, host expression in muscle was compatible with a regenerative response and shift in source of energy in infected. The presence eosoph suppressed local inflammation and influenced nutrient homeostasis in muscle. Redistribution of glucose 4 ( GLUT ) and phosphorylation of Akt were observed in cells, consistent with enhancement of glucose and glycogen by larvae. Our data are consistent with a mechanism in which eosoph promote larval by IL- dependent that limits interferon-driven that alter metabolism in muscle.
Genome-wide studies have suggested that mammalian chromosomes consist of megabase domains of coordinated origin firing separated by large originless regions. However, we report a genome-wide analysis of replication kinetics in human cells that contradicts this view. In HeLa cells, replication origins are spaced at 40 kb intervals and fire in small clusters whose synchrony increases during S phase. Replication velocity (0.7 kb/min, 2.0 kb ) remains constant and narrowly distributed through S. However, multi-scale analysis of genome-wide timing shows a broad distribution of replication gradients with regions larger than 100 kb replicating less than 2/min. He cells lack large regions of unidirectional progression. Temporal regions are replicated by sequential activation of origins at a rate increasing during S and timing gradients are set by the delay and spacing between origin firings rather than the velocity of forks. Activation of internal origins in a temporal region is demonstrated by analysis of the IGH locus in He cells. Analysis of origin maps in He cells and published timing data in other cells corroborate these findings with the exception of embryonic cells where regions of unid progression are more abundant.
The ability of the nervous system to recognize objects in spite of changes in contextual variables such as perspective or lighting is thought to be learned by exploiting the fact that object identities change more slowly than contextual variables. Here, we study how this “temporal stability” or “slown” approach can be implemented within biologically realistic spike-based rules. We show that slow analysis, an algorithm based on slown, can be implemented in continuous neurons by a modified Hebbian rule. This provides a link to trace, another implementation of slown learning. We then show that for Poisson neurons, slown can be implemented by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a specific window. We study the learning of STDP and show that for interpretations of ST, it is not the window that is relevant but the convolution of the window with postsynaptic. We derive ST windows that implement slow analysis and trace. The resulting windows are compatible with data in shape and times. We show that the window can be split into functionally different components that are sensitive to reversible and irreversible aspects of input. Our analysis indicates that irreversible are not favor stable distributions but generate weight dynamics.
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCL) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and chemotherapy resistance to therapy is a major cause of treatment failure. While genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity within tumors contribute to resistance, it is not understood how tumor subclones interact with each other to withstand therapy. Here, we report a previously unrecognized behavior in heterogeneous tumors: cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT), in which cancer cells induce resistant phenotypes in neighboring cells exposed to therapy. We engineered phenotypically diverse NSCL cells by conferring mutations in Dicer, a type III cytoplasmic endonuclease involved in noncoding RNA genesis. We monitored three-dimensional growth of fluorescently-labeled mutant and wild-type cells in co-culture using a substrate-free NanoCulture system under stimulated or drug conditions. By integrating flow cytometry, we characterized growth of mono- and co-cultures using a mathematical model of intra and interspecies competition. Leveraging cytometry data, we estimated model parameters to reveal combination of WT and mutants co-cult allowed beneficial growth in drug-sensitive cells via induction of cell transitions described by cooperative game-theoretic change in fitness. We used an ex vivo human model to predict clinical response through drug analyses and determined that cellular heterogeneity correlates to failure of clinically-approved and off-label drugs in NSCL samples.
Rickettsial diseases are endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, but the burden of disease and risk factors of transmission are sparsely described. We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study to estimate the serreval of Ig antibodies against Spotted Group ( SFG ) ricketiae and assess socioeconomic and environmental risk factors in the Mbeya region, South Tanzania. We randomly selected 1, 228 persons above 5 years from nine communities stratified by age, altitude and ownership of domestic mammals. Serology was performed at a dilution 1:64. SFG-serositivity in the cohort was 67.9% ( range 42.8–91.4% ). Multivar analysis revealed association with age ( PR 1.08; 1.–1.10 ), warmer temperatures ( 1.38; 1.11.71 ), gender (1.08;.00.16 ), and low density (.96.94.99 ). At higher elevations, cattle density was associated with higher serreval.
Monounsaturated fatty acid oleate plays a previously unknown role in the innate immune response of the nematode Caenorhabdis elegans. We identified two stearoy-co A desaturases that synthesize oleate in C. elegans and show that oleate is necessary for the pathogen-mediated induction of immune genes. C elegans deficient in ole production are hypersusceptible to infection with diverse pathogens, which can be rescued by addition of exogenous oleate. However, ole is not sufficient to drive immune activation.
Riboswitches are regulatory elements that modulate gene expression in response to specific metabolite binding. Riboswitch agonists have been reported to exhibit antimicrobial properties by binding to the ribos domain. Guanine ribwitches are involved in the regulation of transport and biosynthesis of purine metabolites, which are critical for the cellular nucleotide pool. Upon guanine binding, ribwitches stabilize a 5′-translated mRNA that causes attenuation of the downstream reading frame. We have identified a pyrimidine compound (PC1) binding guanine ribwitch that shows bactericidal activity against a subgroup of bacterial species including nosocomial pathogens. This killing is only achieved when guA, a gene for G synthase, is under ribwitch control. Several clinical strains with multiple drug resistance were inhibited, suggesting PC targets a different pathway. We used a mouse model to show direct correlation between PC administration and reduction of Staphlococcus aureus infection in mammary glands.
In this study, macaque monkeys were trained to navigate a virtual reality maze to find a reward while their behavior, visual exploration, and hippocampal activity were recorded. We found that cells in the hippocampus responded to one or more variables like direction of head, point of gaze, or context. Many cells fired at the sight of a single landmark in a viewpoint-dependent manner, encoding the animal’s situation within a set of actions leading to the goal. Overall, hippocamp activity was best fit by a fine-grained state comprising current position, view, and context.
During vertebrate development, the midbrain and hindbrain are separated by the midbrain boundary (MHB), which is characterized by a well-defined pattern of restricted gene expression. This pattern is established and maintained by a regulatory network of transcription and secreted factors, but the details of this network are not yet fully understood. Here, we show that a Boolean analysis of the characteristic gene expression at the murine MHB reveals key interactions in this network. Our analysis employs computational techniques for minimization of Boolean functions, allowing us to predict the interplay of various interactions. In particular, we predict a maintaining rather than inducing effect of Fgf on Wnt expression, an issue that remained unclear from published data. Using anterior neural plate/tube explant cultures, we provide evidence that F8 in fact maintains but does not induce ectopic Wnt in these explants. In combination with previously validated interactions, this allows the construction of a network between key transcription and secret factors at M. Analyses of Boolean differential and reaction-diff models this network confirm that it is able to explain the maintenance of M as well as timecourses of patterns under wild-type and knock conditions.
Theileria annulata is an apicomplex parasite that infects host cells and induces uncontrolled proliferation of the parasitized cell population. Shortly after sporozoite entry, the host cell membrane is dissolved and an array of host microtubules ( MTs ) surrounds the parasite, which develops into a transforming schizont. The schizont remains tethered to host MTs during mitosis and cytokinesis and engages the cell’s astral and central MTs to secure distribution between daughter cells. The molecular mechanism of schizont recruitment of host MTs is unknown. MT minus ends are anchored at the MT organizing center while plus ends explore cellular space, constantly switching between growth and shrinkage phases ( dynamic instability ). We report that schizont recruits end-binding protein 1 ( EB ), a component of MT plus end protein network and key regulator of host MT dynamics. Using in vitro experiments, we show that T. annata104, a polymorphic antigen on schizont surface, functions as EB-binding protein and recruits EB in absence of other parasite proteins. Binding depends on consensus Sx motif in highly disordered C-terminal of 104. We show parasite interaction with host EB is cell cycle regulated. This is first description of pathogen protein to interact EB via bonaide Sx motif.
Telomeres are the protective caps at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that shorten with each cell division. Telomere shortening is a hallmark of aging. Telomeres are maintained by telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that adds nucleotides to the 3’ end of telomeres. Telomeres are also maintained by homologous recombination repair ( BIR ) of broken replication forks. In budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the replicase Cdc9 is necessary for BIR. In cdc9-1 cells, a population of cells with persistent DNA damage, likely due to broken forks, constitutively activates the DNA damage checkpoint and leads to longer teleres. Telom length requires telerase, the DNA signaling cascade Mec1-Rad-Rad53, and BIR components Rad51, Rad52,32, and P1. Mec-Rad53 phosphorylates P1, which inhibits telerase at double strand breaks, is also important for P1 in BIR and telom elongation in c9-1 cells. Two other mutants, c44 and r3, similar to c9, have long teleres dependent on P1 phosphorylation. We propose that B forks passing through telomeres promotes telerase and leads to telom length.
Onchocercias, caused by the filarial nematode Onocerca volulus, is a major public health concern due to its debilitating symptoms and concerns about recrudence in areas of previous onocercias control. We investigated whether luciferase immunrecipitation systems (LIPS) may be used as a rapid, specific, and standardized assay for Onoc volulus infection. We tested four recomantly produced Onoculus antigens (OvAR-1, API-1, A-MS-1 and CPI-1 ) by IPS on a large cohort of sera comprised of uninfected controls and patients with proven parasitic infection including Onoculus (O), bancrofti (W), loa (L), stercoralis (S), and other crossreactive infections. Antibody responses to the four antigens allowed unequivocal differentiation between infected and uninfected sera with 100% sensitivity and 100 specificity. Analysis of antibody titers to each antigen in infected sera revealed they were markedly different and did not correlate with each other. Compared to infected sera, patients with W, L, S, and other had markedly lower geometric antibody titers to each antigen (P<0.000 for each ). A mixture of the four antigens in standard or 15-minute IPS showed 100% sensitivity and specificity distinguishing infected from unected sera. The 15 IPS had best performance with 76%, 84, and 93 for distinguishing from W, L, S-infected sera.
Iron deficiency anemia and soil-transmitted helth infections are major public health problems in women of reproductive age in resource-constrained settings. However, few studies have assessed the effectiveness of long-term population-based interventions. This study evaluated the impact of weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and deworming on hemoglobin, anemia, iron deficiency, and soil helth infection in a rural Vietnamese population over 54 months. A total of 389 women were enrolled prior to intervention. After 54 months, 76% were taking ironolic acid and 95 had taken dewing treatment. Mean hemoglobin rose from 122 g/L to 131 g and anemia fell from 38% to 18. However, results differed between ethnic groups. Iron deficiency fell from 23 to 8 and iron anemia from 4. Hookworm infection fell from 76 to 11 and moderate or heavy helth infestation to less than 1.
Herpesviruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are able to persist in the face of primed immunity by exploiting immune evasion strategies, including reduction of antigen expression and escape from antigen presentation pathways. We show that EBV encodes a novel immunoevas, gp150, expressed during the late phase of replication. gp150 inhibits antigen presentation by HLA I, H II, and non-class lipid-presenting CD1 molecules. The mechanism of gp150-mediated escape does not depend on degradation of antigen-presenting molecules nor does it require gp’s cytoplasmic tail. Through abundant glycosylation, gp creates a shield that impedes antigen presentation. This is an unprecedented immune evasion mechanism for herpesviruses. Importantly, cells infected with a gp-null EB displayed rescued levels of antigen presentation by H I, II, and CD, supporting an important role for B cells next to classical T in fighting EB infection.
Chlamydiaeae are obligate intracellular pathogens that cause a wide range of diseases in humans and animals. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of sexually transmitted chlamydia in humans. Chlamydiae are able to invade host cells by inducing actin dependent endocytosis. Chytoplasmic actin plays a key role in this process. Chytoplasm actin is a cytoskeletal protein that polymerizes into actin filaments. Chytopl actin filaments are important for cell motility and shape. Chytopl actin filaments are also involved in endocytosis. Chtoplasmic actin filaments can be nucleated by actin binding proteins. Chytopl actin nucleation is important for chlamial invasion. Chytopl actin nucleation is mediated by the actin recruiting protein ( Tarp). Tarp is conserved among all pathogenic chlamial species. Previous studies have shown that the actin binding and proline rich domains of T are required for T mediated actin nucleation. In this study, we generated an antiserum specific for the act binding domain of T. This antiserum inhibited actin polymerization in vitro and chlam entry in vivo, indicating an essential role for T in chlamial pathogenesis. Our findings indicate that T mediated actin binding and nucleation is conserved among chlamial species and plays a critical role in bacterial invasion of host cells.
Schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonotic disease with a number of mammalian species acting as reservoirs, including buffaloes, which contribute to 75% of human transmission in the People’s Republic of China. Determining prevalence and intensity of Schosoma japon in mammalian hosts is important for calculating transmission and environmental contamination. A new procedure, formal–ethyl acetate sedimentation–digestion ( F–SD ), for visualization of S japon eggs in bovine feces is described. This technique is effective for identifying and quantifying S japon eggs in fecal samples from naturally infected Chinese buffaloes and carab water buffalo in the Philippines. The procedure involves filtration, sedimentation, hydroxide digestion and centrifugation prior to microscopy.
Mutations in the genes encoding cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and proly 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1, encoded by LEP1) were first identified as causes of recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI. These proteins, together with cyclophilin (by PPI), form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a proline on the α1(I) chain (Pro986) and has cis-trans isomerase Pase activity for proper collagen folding. Recent data suggest proly 3ydrolation of Pro986 is not required for collagen structural stability; however, absence of this post-translational modification may disrupt protein-protein interactions for proper collagen folding and lead to collagen overmodification. PH and CRTAP stabilize each other and absence results in degradation of other. Hence, hypomorphic or loss of function of either gene causes loss of complex and associated functions. The contribution of this complex’s 3ydrolation versus Pase and collagen chaperone activities to OI phenotype is unknown. We generated knock-in mice carrying single amino acid substitution in catalytic site of PH (Lep1H662). This abolished PH activity but retained ability form complex CRT and collagen chaper function. Knock mice showed absence proly 3ydrolation Pro of α(I) and α(II) collagen but significant overmodification other residues. They were normal appearance, no growth defects normal cartilage plate histology but decreased trabecular mass.
In Drosophila simulans, a species closely related to Drosophila melanogaster, has been found to be invaded by the P-element, a selfish genetic element that causes hybrid dysgenesis, a syndrome of abnormal phenotypes including sterility. The P-element invaded D. melanogaster in a few decades ago, causing hybrid dysgenesis, but D simul remained P-element free until recently. Here, we show that around 20% of D simul strains induce dysgenesis, and that this phenotype is associated with the invasion of the P-element. We surveyed 631 D simul strains on three continents over 27 years for the presence of P and find that the invasion occurred rapidly and nearly simultaneously in regions, with P-elements being rare in 2006 and common by 201. Importantly, strains from the latter phase of invasion have adapted to suppress the effects of the-element, evidenced by resistance to dysgenesis.
Male mosquitoes of the species Aedes aegypti were marked with the fluorescent dye rhodamine B by feeding them sugar solutions containing 0. 1, 0. 2, 0.4, or 0.8% rhodamine (w/v in 50% honey during flight. All concentrations produced >95% transfer to females and successful marking after 4 days of feeding, with 0.4 and 0.8% solutions producing the longest body marking. Importantly, rhamine marking had no effect on male competitiveness. Proof-of-principle releases demonstrated transfer of marked seminal fluid to females under field conditions and recapture of marked males.
Bacterial superantigens are a family of toxins that induce an inflammatory cytokine storm that can lead to lethal shock. We show that superantigens must bind to the CD28 homodimer to elicit inflammatory cytokine gene expression and lethality. CD28 is a homodimer expressed on T cells that functions as the principal costimulatory ligand in the immune response through interaction with its B coligands. We show that preventing superigen access to CD28 suffices to block lethality. Mice were protected from superigen challenge by peptide mimetics of the CD28 interface and peptides that compete with superigen for binding to CD. Superigens use a conserved β-strandinge/α-helix domain to engage CD28. Mutation of superigen domain abolished cytokine induction and lethality. Structural analysis showed that superigen binds to T cell receptor and major histocompatibility class II on antigen-presenting cell, CD can accommodate as superigen receptor in ternary complex with CD28 oriented towards β-stringe/α-helix superigen. Our findings identify CD homimer as critical target for superigens.
Wnt/β-caten signaling controls the cell cycle of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) through the transcriptional activation of the Ink/arf locus. This is mediated by the recruitment of the Wnt-effector Tcf1 to the Inkarf promoter. Tcf1, but not Tcf3, is responsible for the Wnt-dependent anti-proliferative effect in mESCs. Tcf1 is recruited to palindromic motifs in the promoter of cell cycle repressor genes, such as p15Ink4, p16k4a and p19f, which mediate the Wnt anti-proliferative effect in mES. Consistently, ablation of βaten or T1 expression impairs W-dependent cell cycle regulation. The Wnt pathway, known to be mitogenic in somatic tissues, restores the G1 phase and reduces proliferation of mES without perturbing pluripency.
Dengue Virus Activates Membrane TRAIL Relocalization and IF-α Production by Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells In Vitro and In Vivo  
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are innate immune cells that respond to virus exposure by secreting IF-α and expressing membrane TRAIL (mTR). We aimed to characterize DC activation in deng patients and their function under DENV-2 stimulation in vitro. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that pDC of mildeng patients exhibit higher frequencies ofTR compared to severe or healthy controls. Plasma of IF-α and TR are increased in mild compared to severeeng patients, correlating with DC activation. In vitro exposure to D-2 induced TR expression on pDC, and microscopy highlighted TR was relocalized from intracellular to plasma. Chloro treatment inhibited D-2-induced TRlocalization and IFα by p. Endosomal degradation by chloro allowed viral detection inside p. Data favor endocyt pathway activation by in pDC. Coculture p/D-2-infected monocytes revealed antigen reduction by. This was also observed after exogenous IFα treatment. Thus, DC effect was mainly dependent onα production.
The immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is a complex. Experimental evidence has revealed that tumor necrosis factor (TN) plays a major role in host defense against Mtb in both active and latent phases of infection. TN-neutralizing drugs used to treat inflammatory diseases have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis (TB) in accordance with animal studies. This study takes a computational approach toward characterizing the role of TN in protection against the tuble bacillus in both active and latent infection. We extend previous mathematical models to investigate the roles of soluble (TN) and transmembrane TN (TN). We analyze the effects of anti-T therapy in clinical trials by simulating two commonly used therapies, anti-T antibody and TN receptor, predicting that explain differences in TB reactivation rates. Our findings are that bioavailability of TN following anti-T therapy is the factor for reactivation of latent and thatTN—even at low—is for control of infection. Using a model, it is possible mechanisms of action of anti-T treatments and insights into the role of TN in control and pathology.
Recent studies have shown that the presence of at least 208 retroduplication (RD) variations, a class of polymorphisms in which a retrocopy is present or absent from individual genomes. The majority of these RD resulted from recent retroduplication. This study used the results from the 100 Genomes Project to investigate variation in loss of ancestral ( i. e. shared with other primates ) retrocopies among human populations. We also examined retrocopy levels using RNA-Seq data from the Human Body project as well as data from lymphoblast cell lines provided the Geuvis Consortium. We developed a new approach to detect retro absent from the human genome. We experimentally confirmed the existence of detected retro and their presence in human of 17 different populations. We were able to detect 193 RD; the majority from retro deletion. Most had not previously been reported. We experimentally confirmed expression of 11 retro that underwent deletion in individuals. The frequency of deletion, exception one, is low. The expression and rate of remaining may suggest functionality.
Infection of the central nervous system by Taenia solium cysticerci causes neurocysticercosis (NCC), a pleomorphic disease. Inflammation around the cysterci is the major cause of disease but is variably present. The location and characteristics of the brain tissue adjacent to the cysterci may modulate the inflammatory responses. We analyzed the inflammatory responses to cysterci located in the parenchyma compared to those in the meninges or partially in contact with the parenym and meninges. Histological specimens of brain cysterci ( n = 196 ) from 11 pigs naturally infected with Taenia solium cystic were used. Four pigs were sacrificed after 2 days and 5 days of praziquel treatment; three did not receive treatment. All were intravenously injected with Evans Blue to assess blood-brain barrier disruption. The degree of inflammation was estimated by histological score (ISC) based on extent of inflammation in pericyst areas assessed in composed photomicrographs at 40 ampl. Parenymal cysterci provoked significantly higher ISC after antiparas treatment compared to meninge and cortingeal cysterci. ISC of meninge cysti was not affected by treatment. Cortinge cysti increase ISC correlated to extent of cyst adjacent to parenym. Disruption of blood-brain was associated treatment in parenym tissue. Inflammatory to cysti in meninges was decreased compared to parenyci.
Yaws is a disease caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies perten and is endemic in Ghana. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends mass azithromycin distribution as the cornerstone of the yaws eradication campaign. Previously, azithrom was distributed at a lower dose in two regions of Ghana to control trachoma. However, reporting of y raises the possibility that resistance may have emerged in T. pallum perten or alternative infections may be responsible for some cases. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in thirty communities in two districts of Ghana where mass drug administration for trach had been conducted. Children aged 5–17 with ulcerative lesions compatible with y were enrolled. Samples for treponemal serology and PCR were collected from all children.90 with 98 lesions were enrolled. Syphilis serology was negative in all of them. PCR T. pallumsp pertue was negative in children but Haemophilus duyi DNA was detected in 9. In communities previously treated trach, we found no evidence of ongoing y transmission. H.duyi was associated with proportion of lesions but majority remain unexplained.
Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in treating HIV infection, HIV persistence remains a major challenge. A key driver of persistence is cell homeostasis, which is regulated by cytokines that trigger the Jak-STAT pathway in memory T cells, the hub of the HIV reservoir. We evaluated the ability of two FDA-approved Jak inhibitors, tofacitinib and ruxitin, to block HIV seeding and maintenance of the reservoir in vitro. We provide evidence for the involvement of the Jak-STAT pathway in HIV persistence in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro; STAT5 correlates with increased levels of integrated viral DNA in vivo and in vitro. Jak inhibitors reduce the frequency of CD4 T cells harboring HIV DNA. We show that Jak block viral production from infected cells, inhibit IL-15-induced viral reactivation from latent stores thereby preventing transmission to bystander T cells. These results show dysregulation of the JakSTAT pathway is associated with persistence in vivo and that inhibitors target key events downstream IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 ligation to their receptors, impacting the HIV reservoir in all CD T subsets in vitro and vivo.
Infection of Spodoptera exigua larvae with the baculoviruses SeNPV and AcNP leads to a complex transcriptional response. In contrast to the expected transcriptional shut-down during baculovirus infection, S. exig cells show a balanced number of up- and down-regulated genes during the first 36 hours following infection. Many immune-related genes, including pattern recognition proteins, signalling and immune pathways as well as immune effectors involved in the melanization cascade are down-regulated after baculirus infection. The down-regulation of immune genes is confirmed in the larval gut. The expression of immune genes in the gut affects the status of gut microorganisms, many of which are responsible for growth and development. We hypothesize that the downregulation after baculirus infection affects the amount of gut microbiota. An increase in gut load is observed and hypothesized to be a consequence of viral infection. Subsequent experiments in the presence and absence of gutota reveal that bacteria enhance baculirus virulence and pathogenicity.
Apomixis, a form of asexual reproduction through seeds, is of great interest in agriculture due to its potential applications. One element of apomix is apomesis is the deregulation of meiosis that results in a mitotic division. We have isolated a novel gene that directly controls entry into the second meiotic division. By combining a mutation in this gene with others that affect meiotic processes, we created a genotype called Mi in which meiosis is replaced by mitosis. The plants produce diploid gametes that are genetically identical to their mother.
In the post-genomic era, prioritization of disease-causing genes is a major challenge. Current methods exploit protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for this task. These methods are based on the observation that genes causing similar diseases lie close to one another in a P network. However, these methods use a static picture of human PIs, while disease-specific tissues in P networks may be dramatically different. Here, we assess the contribution of tissue-specific information to prioritization. We integrate tissue gene expression with P information to construct tissue-specific PIs for 60 tissues and investigate their power. We find that tissue PIs considerably improve results compared to those using a generic network. Furthermore, they predict novel-disease associations, pointing to subclinical effects that may escape detection.
Vector-borne diseases such as malaria are a major public health problem in many parts of the world. Mosquitoes that transmit these diseases are becoming increasingly resistant to insecticides that are used to control them. We develop a mathematical model that describes the evolution of resistance to insecticides in mosquito populations. The model allows for differences between males and females in their exposure to insecticides and selection pressures, depending on the concentration of insecticide encountered. We use the model to compare two strategies for deploying insecticides: using them sequentially or as a mixture. Our results show that mixtures of insecticides are more likely to delay the spread of resistance than sequential use, but this depends on the effectiveness of the insecticides and the proportion of mosquitoes that encounter them. If the insecticides are not very effective against susceptible mosquitoes, sequential use may be more robust. Although mixtures slow the spread of resistance, they may not always outperform sequential use. For example, a mixture may last 5 years while individual insecticides last 3 and 4 years, giving an overall lifespan of 7 years for sequential use.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is transmitted by triatomine bugs, including Rhodnius neglectus. The saliva of these hematophagous insects contains bioactive molecules that counteract host hemostasis, inflammation, and immune responses. In this study, we used next generation sequencing and mass spectrometry to investigate the content of Rhodnius neglectus saliva. We deposited 4, 230 DNA sequences in GenBank. A set of 636 proteins of putative secretory nature was extracted from assembled reads, of which 73 were confirmed by proteomic analysis. We characterized the saliva of Rhodni neglectus and detected serine protease transcripts. The presence of ubiquitous protein families was revealed, including lipocalins, ser protease inhibitors, antigen-5 metalloproteases, disintegrins, and odorant binding proteins.
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism used to study the interaction between nematodes and bacteria in soil. In this study, we used transcriptional profiling to identify genes that are differentially expressed in response to bacteria isolated from grassland nemodes and grassland soils. We found that many of these genes are involved in metabolism and innate immunity, suggesting they could influence nemode community dynamics in natural systems. We then used mutations to inactivate 21 of these genes and showed that most contribute to lifespan and fitness in a given bacterial environment. Although these bacteria are not a natural food source for C. elegans, we show that changes in food source, as can occur in environmental disturbance, have a large effect on gene expression with consequences for fitness. We also used regression to demonstrate that for many genes the degree of differential expression between bacterial environments predicts the magnitude of effect of loss of function on life traits in those environments.
Development of the mammalian blastocyst is a complex process that involves the formation of an inner cell mass surrounded by a trophoectoderm, a shell of cells that will form extraembryonic structures. We used multi-scale modeling to investigate the principles responsible for the robust establishment of these structures. Our results make three predictions, supported by quantitative imaging. First, stochasticity in the expression of critical genes promotes plasticity and has a role in organizing the mouse blastocyst. Second, asymmetry in the levels of variation ( fluctuation ) of Cdx and Oct4 provides a means to gain the benefits of noise-mediated plasticity while amelioring the detrimental effects of stochasticity. Finally, by the timing and pace of cell specification the embryo modulates plasticity and creates a window during which can continually read its environment and adjusts its fate.
Antibodies encoded by the germline genome have the ability to bind to a wide range of antigens due to structural flexibility in the germl gene. The affinity and specificity for a particular epitope increases as the antibody acquires somatic mutations in antigen-stimulated B cells. We investigated whether germl-encoded antibodies are optimal for polyspecificity by determining the basis for recognition of diverse antigens by antibodies encoded by three VH gene segments. We computationally redesigned antibodies encoded by a common VH gene but binding to different antigens to engage multiple antigens at once. The Rosetta multi-state process predicted antibody sequences for the entire heavy chain region, including framework, CDR, and CDR. The predicted sequences matched germl gene to a remarkable degree, revealing residues that enable polysity, i. e., binding many antigens with common sequence. In contrast, designing to bind a single antigen similar to mature sequence was returned, mimicking maturation. We demonstrated that Rosetta captures aspects of antibody/igen recognition. The hyperviable CDR often mediates much of mature specificity, but VH CDR, CDR, and immunoglobulin framework are critical for polyspecific germl. We computationally designed antibodies binding multiple antigens may retain polyspecific for diverse epitope.
Locusts exhibit two interconvertible behavioral phases: solitar and gregar. While solitar individuals are repelled by other locusts, gregar insects are attracted to conspecifics and form large aggregations such as marching hopper bands. At the individual level, crowding biases locusts towards the gregar form. To understand the formation of marching locust hop bands, we study phase change at the collective level, in a quantitative framework. We construct a partial integrodifferential model incorporating interplay between phase and spatial movement at the individual level to predict hopper formation at the population. Stability of our model reveals conditions for an outbreak, characterized by large transition to gregar. The model enables quantification of temporal dynamics of each phase, proportion of population that will gregarize, and time for this to occur. Numerical simulations describe aggregation structure and traveling clumps gregar.
Viral membrane fusion is a complex process that involves a series of conformational changes of viral envelope glycoproteins, called fusion proteins. Although high-resolution structures of viral proteins in their prefusion and postfusion states are available, the intermediate structures of the fusion pathway have been difficult to define because of their transient nature. Flaviruses have a class II fusion protein (E) that mediates fusion at acidic pH, which is converted from a dimer to trimer with a hair-like structure during fusion. Here, we show that tick-borne encephalitis virus virions exposed to alkaline instead of acidic pH are trapped in an intermediate conformation where E dimers dissociate and interact with membranes via fusion peptide without proceeding to membrane merger. Further treatment to low pH leads to fusion, suggesting that monomers correspond to elusive intermediate required to convert prefusion dimer into postfusion trimer.
Biodiversity hotspots, such as the Cape of South Africa, harbor a disproportionate number of plant species. However, our knowledge of plant extinctions and vulnerabilities lags behind that of vertebrates. Here, we investigate the drivers of extinction risk in plants, focusing on the Cape. By comparing Red List data for the British and South African floras, we show that the taxonomic distribution of extinction risk differs between regions, inconsistent with a simple, trait-based model of extinction. Using a comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the Cape, we find a phylogenetic signal in the distribution of plant risks, but most threatened species cluster at the tips of the phylogeny, opposite to trends in mammals. Analyzing the distribution of threatened species across 11 exemplar clades, we suggest mode of speciation best explains the phylogenetic structure of risks in plants of the Cape. Our results demonstrate that explanations for elevated risk in plants of the Cape differ from those recognized for vertebrates. In the Cape, risk is higher for young and fast-evolving plant lineages and cannot be explained by correlations with simple traits. Critically, we find that most vulnerable species are marching towards extinction at a rapid pace independently from anthropogenic effects.
Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is phagocytosed by the innate immune system to prevent infection. Dectin-1 is the major phagoc receptor involved in anti-fungal immunity. We have identified two new proteins that interact with Dect-1 in macrophages, Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (TK) and Vav. TK and Vav are recruited to phagosomes containing C. albicans yeasts or hyphae but are absent from mature phagosomes. TK and Vav localize to the cuff surrounding hypha while Dect-1 lines the length of the phagosome. TK and V colocalize with PI (3, 4, 5)P3 and Fynin at the phagosome but not diacylglycerol (DAG) which marks mature phagosomes. Using a TK inhibitor, we show TK contributes to DAG at the phagosome and the recruitment of PKε TK or Vav-deficient peritoneal macrophages display a defect in C. alb phagytosis. Bone-derived macrophages lacking TK or Vav show reduced C. alb uptake comparable toect-1 deficient. TK or Vav-deficient mice are more susceptible to systemic. alb infection than wild mice.
Rift Valley fever (RV) is a vector-borne disease affecting ruminants and humans. Madagascar was heavily affected by RV in 2008–200, with evidence of large spread of the disease. To optimize available resources by RV surveillance in Madagascar, it is essential to identify at-risk environments. This study aimed to identify environmental factors favoring RV transmission in cattle and humans, as well as human behaviors favoring human infection in Malag contexts. We characterized Malag environments using Multiple Factor Analysis (FA) and analyzed cattle and human serological data at national level using Generalized Mixed Models, with serological status (cattle or human ) as response and FA, as well as other risk factors (density, behavior) as explanatory variables. We found that cattle and human seroprevalence were positively associated with humid environments (p<.001). Areas with high cattle density were at risk (p<.01; OR=2.6), and frequent contact with raw milk contributed to human infection (OR=1.6). Our study highlighted eastern, western, and northwestern parts as high-risk for RV transmission in cattle.
Prions are self-propagating protein conformations that can be transmitted between non-identical proteins, e. g. between homologous proteins from different species. However, transmission of the prion state is frequently inefficient and the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Here, we use a yeast Rq1PIN]-based experimental system to explore the nature of transmission barriers. We show that Rq encompasses multiple prion determinants that can independently drive amyloid formation in vitro and transmit the PIN prion state in vivo. Subsequent analysis of PIN transmission between Rq fragments with different pr determinants established that ( i ) one Q-rich region is required and usually sufficient for transmission; ( ii ) despite identical sequences of QNs, transmissions are impeded by barriers of strength.
Inference of complex population genetic models from genomic data is often infeasible due to the high dimensionality of the data. We introduce a novel likelihood-free inference framework that employs deep learning, a powerful machine learning technique, to circumvent this problem. Deep learning makes use of multilayer neural networks to learn a feature function from input ( e. g., hundreds of summary statistics ) to output ( e. g. genetic parameters of interest ). We demonstrate that deep learning can be employed for population inference and learning features from data. We focus on the problem of jointly inferring natural selection and demography in form of population size history. Our method separates demography from selection without sequential steps for these factors. Demography and selection are studied jointly motivated by Drosila, where selection confounds demographic analysis. We apply our method to 197 Drosila melanogaster genomes from Zambia to infer demography and regions of genome under selection. We find regions that have experienced sweeps and under selection ( soft or balancing ) sweeps. Sweeps and balancing occur more frequently closer to chromosome centre. Demographic inference suggests previously bottlenecks for Dila melanaster are too extreme.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes are necessary for the development of anogenital and orophngeal cancers. We show that E6/E7-expressing cells are hypersensitive to cisplatin, a DNA crosslinking agent, and have defects in repairing interstrand crosslinks (ICL). We elucidate how E7 attenuates the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway. E7 activates the pathway by increasing Fanc2 monoubiquination and foci formation, but inhibits completion of repair by multiple mechanisms.7 impairs F2 localization with double-strand breaks (DSB), hindering Rad51 recruitment to DS. Further,7 causes delayedanc2 deubiquination, important for ICL repair. Delayedanc2 deubination is associated with chromatin retention ofanc, hindering US1 deubitinating activity and persistently activated ATR/CHK-1/p565anc signaling.7 mediated p53 degradation does not hamper cell cycle processanc modifications but abrogates repair by disruptinganc deubination. Further7 reducesanc expression and foci of Pal2, a downstreamanc repair protein. These findings uncover mechanisms by which HPV oncogen contribute to genomic instability and response to cispl therapies.
Transmission of Onchocerca volulus has been interrupted in the Southern Chiapas focus of Mexico, one of the major onchocerciasis foci in Latin America. Since 1998, all 559 communities in this focus have undergone semi-annual treatment with ivermectin. In 2003, iverectin frequency was shifted to twice a year in 50 communities, and an additional 113 communities were added to quarterly treatment in 2009 to achieve rapid suppression. Epidemiologic and entomologic assessments were performed in six sentinel communities with 2 rounds ofiverect treatment per year and three extra-sent communities with 4 roundsiverect per year. In the dry season 2011, none of 67,924 Simulium ochum collected from this focus were found to contain DNA by PCR-ELISA, resulting in an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (95%-CI) of infective rate in vectors 0.06/2,000 examined. Serologic testing for Onocerca volulus exposure on 4,230 children 5 years old of a total 10,280 in this group revealed 2/4,230 were exposed (0.05%; one 95%CI=0.08% ).
Listeria monocytogen is a Gram-positive facultative intracellular pathogen that invades mammalian cells and escapes from membrane-bound vacuoles to replicate in the host cytos. PrA is a transcriptional activator required for intracellular bacterial growth and spread to adjacent cells. However, the signal that activates Pr has not been defined. We show that L monocogen secretes a small peptide pherone, pA, which enhances escape from host vacoles and may facilitate Pr activation. The pherone is generated by proteolytic processing of lipoprotein signal. The lipoprotein is dispensable for pathogenesis, but bacteria lacking pher are attenuated for virulence in mice and have reduced escape efficiency from vacoles of nonphagocytic cells. Mut activation restores virulence and eliminates need for pher signaling. The pher may signal L monocogen presence within vacole, stimulating expression of products that contribute to escape and Pr to promote growth in cyol.
Vibrio cholera, the causative agent of cholera, is a highly adaptable pathogen that is able to colonize host intestines and combat host-produced reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) during infection. To understand the molecular mechanisms by which V. cholera overcomes ROS in vivo, we performed a whole-genome transposon sequencing ( T-seq ) by comparing gene requirements for colonization in mice with and without treatment of the antioxidant N-acetyl cystine. We found that mutants of the methyl-directed repair ( M ) system, such as MutS, displayed colonization advantages in untreated, ROS-rich mice but not in N-treated mice. Further analyses suggest that accumulation of catalase-producing and rugose variants in N- mice was the cause of Mut mutant enrichment by oxidative stress during infection. We also found that rugose variants revert to smooth colonies upon aerobic in vitro. Moreover, the mutation rate of wildtype colonized in N mice was higher than in mice.
Mutations in the MLH3 gene in baker’s yeast alter meiotic recombination outcomes by increasing non-crossover events genome-wide. The MLH3 protein is an endonuclease that is hypothesized to act in meiosis to resolve Holliday junctions into crossovers and also plays a minor role in eukaryotic DNA repair ( MMR). We analyzed 60 new ML3 alleles in baker’s yeast, five of which specifically disrupted MMR and one (MLH3-32) disrupted meiotic crossing over. We purified and characterized ML3-32 (MR+, crossover-) and ML3-45 (MR-, crossover-), both of which displayed wild-type endonuc activities in vitro. ML2SH, an SH complex that acts with ML3 in MMR, stimulated the enduc activity of ML-32 but not ML-45, suggesting ML-45 is defective in SH interactions. We constructed whole-genome recombination maps for wild-type MR+, MR-, MR+, enduc defective and ML3 mutants in S288/Y789 background. Compared to wild-type, all ML3 mutants showed increases in the number of non-crossover events consistent with recombination intermediates being resolved through alternative pathways.
The evolution of drug resistance in bacterial populations is a major concern in the treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, Staphylococcus aureus and gonorrhea. The use of antibiotics has led to rapidly increasing levels of drug resistance, necessitating the switch to new drugs and discontinuation of older ones. However, resistance often persists or declines slowly after treatment is stopped. This is usually ascribed to low fitness costs of resistance in the absence of drug. We show that host population structure, in particular heterogeneity in number of contacts, also plays an important role in reversion dynamics. During treatment, host structure leads to non-random distribution of resistant strains among the population. After drug discontinuation, it affects competition, resulting in mitigation of fitness advantages. As a consequence, we observe lower rate of reversion and lower probability of reversion to sensitivity on population level after treatment is stopped. Our simulations show impact of heterogeneity in structure is maximal in biologically plausible range, when costs of resistance are small.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are highly heritable and characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors. Although a number of highly penetrant ASD variants have been identified, there is growing evidence to support a role for combinatorial effects arising from contributions of multiple loci. By examining synaptic and circadian phenotypes resulting from dosage of unique human-fly orthologs in Drosophila, we observe synergistic interactions between pairs of informatically-identified candidate genes orthologs that are jointly affected by de novo copy number (CN) variants. These CNs were found in the genomes of individuals with autism, including one carrying 22q11. 2 deletion. We demonstrate that dosage of the Drosila orthologs of candidate genes de novo CN that only display single gene neurological defects similar to previously in Drosila models of ASD variants. We considered dosage within the set of ortholog candidate genes affected by same human novo CN. For three CN with complete ortholog relationships, we observed synergistic effects following simultaneous change of gene pairs from single CN. The phenotyp variation atrosila that results from these genetic supports concordant outcome all gene following direction human copy change. We observe specificity and transitivity between interact, within and CN candidate sets supporting distinct aetiologies. We show different interactions divergent processes demonstrating moleculareti.
Cerebral malaria (ECM) caused by Plasmodium berghei AN infection of C57/6 mice is associated with the accumulation of brain-infiltrating CD8 T cells. However, the mechanisms through which they mediate pathogenic activity remain poorly understood. Utilizing intravital microscopy and flow cytometry, we show that brain-infiltrating T cells accumulate in the perascular spaces of mice infected with ECM-inducing ( P berg AN ) and non-inducing ( berg NK ) infections. However, perascular T cells displayed arrested behavior during berg AN infection, despite brain-accumulating CD+ T exhibiting activation phenotypes during both infections. We observed T forming long-term interactions with CXCR1-bearing antigen presenting cells within brains during berg AN, but abation failed to prevent ECM. Pathogenic CD+ T colocalized with apoptotic CD31-expressing endothelial cells within brain during ECM. However, apoptosis was rare and did not result in loss of vasculature or extensive disruption to its integrity during ECM.
Tungias is a parasitic disease caused by the sand flea Tungaans (also known as jigger flea) that affects communities living in precarious conditions in tropical and sub-Saharan countries. This study aimed to determine the burden of tungias in Viga County, Kenya. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in 21 villages in 3 sublocations of Viga, western Kenya. A total 437 participants aged ≥5 years were clinically examined for tungias after consenting to the study. Diagnosis was made following standard methods. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to assess socio-demographic factors, housing, presence of animals, and knowledge related tungias. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate analysis. GIS was used to map the geographic distribution of tungias in the area. The overall prevalence was 21.5% (95% CI 17.7–25.3 ). Cases were visualized in a map. Multivariate analysis suggested that tungias was associated with variables indicating low economic status: monthly income ≤ Ksh 100 (OR 27.85; 95% CI 4.13–187.59 ), floor 0.36 (0.13–1.024 ), lack of toilet (4.27 0.82–22.34 ), age ≤14 (27.414 10.–74.99 ), no footwear (1.98.987.97 ) and resting inside house (.93.96.89 ).
Auxin patterning in the root tip of Arabidopsis thaliana depends on a mutual feedback between auxin and cytokinins. This feedback is mediated by the PIN class of auxin efflux transporters and AHP, an inhibitor of cytokinin signalling. We developed a parsimonious computational model of aux transport that considers regulation of auxin transport within a spatial context, taking into account cell shape and polarity and cell walls. Our analysis shows that an informative cytokin pattern generated by diffusion is unlikely and not required for correct auxin patterning. Instead, aux-dependent modifications of cytokin response rather than variations in cytokin levels allow necessary feedbacks that can amplify and stabilise auxin. Our simulations demonstrate importance of hormonal regulation of auxin efflux for robustness. We predict and experimentally verify a role of AUX and LAX/1 aux influx transporters in vascular patterning. We show that polarisation of PIN generates an aux circuit that stabilises accumulation of aux within xylem axis and provides mechanism for aux to accumulate in xylem-pole cells, an early step in lateral root initiation.
Neuropeptide F (NPF) and nitric oxide (NO) signaling plays a regulatory role in phase-related locomotor plasticity in the migratory locust Locusta migratoria. We report that the conserved transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein B (CRE-B) is a key mediator in the signaling pathway from NPF to NO in the migratory locust, triggering locomotor activity between solitary and gregarious phases. CRE-B directly activates brain nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression by interacting with the NOS promoter. Phosphorylation at serine 110 of CRE-B changes in response to population variation and is negatively controlled by N2. CRE-B involvement in N2-regulated locomotor plasticity is validated by RNA interference (RNAi) and behavioral assay. Protein kinase mediates the effects of N on CRE-B phosphorylation and OS transcription.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the earliest stages of development are driven by maternally deposited proteins and mRNAs. The maternal-to-zyotic transition ( MZ ) occurs hours after fertilization, when the zotic genome is transcribed. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput (IP-Seq ) to map regions bound by the zinc-finger protein Zelda ( ZLD ) before, during, and after the MZ. We identified thousands of regions bound by ZLD in cycle 8 embryos, most of which remain through cycle 14. Early Z-bound regions include the promoters and enhancers of genes transcribed at this stage. We also observed Z bound cycle 8 to the promoters of genes first transcribed during the MZ and virtually all known enhancers bound cycle 14 by transcription factors that regulate gene activation during the MZ. The association between Z binding and MZ activity is so strong that Z can be used to identify promoters and regulatory sequences with specificity.
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential for virtually all biological processes. The timing of these interactions is critical for proper function. Circadian clocks, which operate on a 24-hour cycle, regulate important physiological processes. However, the dynamics of PIs on this timescale are largely unknown. We identified 109 novel PIs among circadian proteins using a yeast-two-hybrid approach. The interaction between phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL resulted in BMAL destabilization. We constructed a dynamic circadian PI network predicting PIs using circadian expression data. Systematic circadian phenotyping (RNAi and overexpression ) suggests a crucial role for components in dynamic interactions. Analysis of a dynamic network in liver revealed that interacting proteins are expressed at similar times to restrict interactions to specific phases. We predict that circadian PIs dynamically connect important processes (signal transduction, cell cycle, etc. ) contributing to temporal organization of physiology in an unprecedented manner.
Nematode protein allergens (NP) are a class of lipid-binding proteins found in nematodes. They are synthesized as large, tandemly repetitive proteins that are post-translationally cleaved into multiple copies of small lipid-binding proteins with identical fatty acid and retin (A)-binding characteristics. These proteins are central to transport and distribution of hydrophobic compounds between nematode tissues, and may play roles in nutrient scavenging, immunomodulation and IgE antibody responses in infection. In some species, repeating units are diverse in amino acid, but in ascar and filarial nemodes, many are identical or near-ident. A-1 is the most repeating unit of NP of Ascaris su, similar to Ascar lumicoid, the large roundworm of humans. Immune responses to NP have been associated with acquired resistance to infection in humans, and immune to them is under genetic control. The structure of A-1 was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The protein adopts a novel seven-helical fold comprising a central helix that participates in two four-hel bundles either side. Discrete hydrophobic ligand-binding sites are in N-terminal and C-terminal bundles, and amino sidechains affected ligand ( acid ) were identified. Recombinant A1 contains tightly-bound ligand of bacterial origin one site.
Between 1998 and 2008, there were 39,677 reported cases of ciguatera poisoning in 17 Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PITCs), with a mean annual incidence of 194 cases per 100,000 people. This represents a 60% increase in annual incidence compared to the 104 cases per 100,000 reported between 1973 and 1983. Taking into account underreporting, it is estimated that 500,000 Pacific Islanders may have suffered from cigater poisoning in the last 35 years. The incidence of cigater in the Pacific is higher than reported globally and locally. Ciguater poisoning is characterized by acute neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac symptoms, with chronic neurologic symptoms lasting weeks to months.
Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease, a chronic disease characterized by the persistence of the parasite and impairment of the cellular immune response. In this study, we investigated the impact of benznidazole treatment on the functional response of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific CD4CD8+ T cells in Chagas patients. Thirty-eight Chagas patients (20 asymptomatic and 18 symptomatic ) and twelve healthy controls were enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with soluble T cruzi antigens to analyze the production of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules by CD4CD+8 cells before and after benidazole treatment. Additionally, expression and co-expression of five inhibitory receptors in patients after treatment were studied using multiparameter flow cytometry. The frequency of CD4CD+ cells was higher in Chagas patients compared to healthy donors. Furthermore, a higher ratio of CD4CDlowCDhigh was observed in Chagas patients than healthy. CD4CD+ cells expressed and co-expressed higher levels of inhibitory receptors in proportion to the severity of pathology. Benidazole reduced the frequency of CD4CD cells and decreased the ratio CDCDlowCDhigh. Co-expression of inhibitory was reduced after treatment with enhancement of multifunctional capacity CD4CD. After, increase in frequency T cruzi-specific CD4CD expressing IL-2 and TN-α was observed. CD4CD could play important role in control cruz infection since able to produce effector molecules for parasite. Benidazole partially reversed exhaustion caused by cruz in cells with improvement of T cruz-specific CD4CD.
Arabidopsis PLC2 is a phosphoinospecific phospholipase involved in phosphoinid metabolism and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. Phosphoinides are important lipid signals in plant development and stress, but multiple isoforms of the phosphoin biosynthetic genes hamper our understanding of the enzymes in each step of the pathway and their roles in growth. We report that phosphoin-specific phospholipase 2 (PLC2) is the primary phospholip in phosphoin metabolism and is involved in seedling growth and ER responses in Arabidopsis thalian. Lipid profiling of plc mutants showed plc-1 increased levels of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidyositol 4,5-bisphosphate, suggesting the phosphoin metabolic pathway is impaired.PLC displayed distinct expression and localized at the plasma membrane in different cell types where phosphoin signaling occurs. The plc-1 mutant showed growth defect was complemented by heterologous expression ofPLC, suggesting phosphoin phospholipase activity byPLC is required for growth. Moreover, plc-1 showed hypersensitive response to ER as evidenced by phenotypes and gene profiles.
In this article, we challenge the reductionist assumption that causation in the physical world occurs only at the micro level by employing a principled, well-defined measure of intrinsic cause-effect power–integrated (Φ). We show that according to this measure, it is possible for a macro level to “beat” the micro. We evaluate simple systems for Φ across different spatial and temporal scales by considering all possible black boxes, which are macro elements consisting of one or more micro elements over one or more updates. We evaluate cause power based on inputs and outputs of the black, ignoring internal elements that support their input–output function. We show that black elements can have more inputs and outputs than corresponding micro, revealing emergence of high-order mechanisms and constraints not apparent at micro. As a consequence, a black system can have higher Φ than its constituents by having more mechanisms that are more interconnected. We also show that for a given system, one can identify maxima Φ across spatiotemporal scales. We demonstrate this framework on a biological system, the Boolean model of fission yeast cell cycle, and identify maxima during its simulated function. These maxima correspond to levels of organization where emergent cause properties come into focus, providing a natural point for scientific inquiries.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) play a dual role in modulating cellular adaptation to the environment and causing damage under conditions of hypoxia/reoxygenation relevant to various diseases and transplantation. To investigate the role of ROS in cell survival, we extended our model of complex III to account for electron transport in the RC coupled to proton translocation, transmembrane electrochemical generation, TCA reactions and substrate transport to mitochondria. We measured electron fluxes in rat mitochondria fueled by succinate or pyruvate malate and dynamics of NAD reduction by reverse transport through succinate complex I. Our analysis revealed association of ROS production with specific electron transporters and their combinations in complexes I and III. We found that bistability, a property of complex III, remains for the whole RC. Conditions for switching to a state with high free radicals in III were predicted and confirmed.
Transport of intracellular cargo is essential for eukaryotic cells and is facilitated by motor proteins that convert chemical energy into kinetic energy. Motor proteins work in teams to enable unidirectional and bidirectional transport of intracellular cargo over long distances. Disruptions of the underlying mechanisms, caused by mutations that alter motor characteristics, are known to cause neurodegenerative diseases. For example, phosphorylation of the kines motor domain at serine is implicated in Huntington’s disease. We report the effects of mutations on transport properties of cargo carried by wild-type and mutant motors. Results indicate that mutants with altered stall forces determine average velocity and run-length even when outnumbered by wild motors in the ensemble. Mutants gain a competitive advantage and increase run-length when the load is near the mutant’s stall force or a multiple of its stall. We develop a semi-analy method to analyze transport by multiple motors of types. The technique determines transition rates between various configurations of motors carrying cargo using rates between absolute configurations. This enables computation of biologically relevant quantities like velocity and run-length without Monte Carlo. Our method is implementable and provide software for use.
CAC1 is a gene that encodes a subunit of high-voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, which are central to synaptic plasticity and have been associated with learning and psychiatric disorders. We investigated the role of Cna1 in learning by selectively ablating the gene in mice and analyzing their behavior on an operant discrimination task. We used a detailed analysis of individual learning in terms of behavioral strategies combined with computational models to show that Cna knockout does not impair learning in general, but has a specific effect: most knockout mice increased reward across trials by adapting an outcome-based strategy, while most controls adopted the intended cue-association rule.
Aedes aegypt mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria are being released to suppress arbovirus around the world. Their ability to invade and persist in the field will depend on their interactions with environmental conditions, as larvae are often exposed to fluctuating and extreme temperatures. In this study, Ae.egypt larvae were infected with different types of Wolia ( wMel, wAlB and wPopCLA ) and reared under diurnal cyclical temperatures. We found that wMel and wPopCLA-infected larvae reared at 26–37°C had reduced expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility, a reproductive manipulation induced by Wolia. We also observed a reduction in Wolia density in adults. Furthermore, w and wPopCLA were not transmitted to the next generation when exposed to 26–37 across all stages. In contrast, wB was maintained at high density, exhibited cytoplasm incompat, and transmitted to offspring with high fidelity under this cycle.
Adenoviruses are important human pathogens that have been developed as vectors for gene therapies and vaccines. Previous studies indicated that infections with adenoviruses are self-limiting in immunocompetent hosts with evidence of persistence in adenoid tissue. We sought to understand the natural history of adenirus infections in non-human primates and discovered that healthy populations of great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangans ) and macques shed substantial quantities of adeniruses in stool. Shedding from asymptomatic humans was much less frequent. We purified and sequenced 30 adeniruses from apes and 3 adeniruses from macques. Analyses of ape adenirus sequences as well as chimpanzee adenirus we previously reported together with 22 adenirus available from GenBank revealed that ape adeniruses could be classified into species corresponding human adenirus B, C, E. There was evidence intraspecies recombination adenirus and high phylogenetic relatedness adenirus across primate provided evidence for species transmission occurred in history B E viruses.
Chromatin, the fundamental unit of eukaryotic genome packaging, is a protein-DNA complex called the nucleosome, where 146–147 base pairs of DNA are wrapped 1.75 times around a histone core. To function in cellular processes, nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped. Although unwrapping has been experimentally investigated, details at the atomic level are not well understood. Here, we used molecular simulation with enhanced sampling to calculate free profiles for unwrapping the outerhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA. We found a free change of about 11. 5 kcal/mol for unwr, in agreement with single molecule experiments. The simulation revealed a variety of conformation states, indicating many paths to superhelical unwr, but the dominant is likely asymmetric. At one end of DNA, first five b unwrap, then second five at same end with increase free. Unwrapping then starts at other end, ten unwrap. During further unwr 15, advances at one end, then other unwr to complete superhel turn.
Lipocalin Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is a secreted by astrocytes in the nervous system to protect neurons from oxidative stress. It is known to optimize autophagy and prevent neurodegeneration, but the mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that Apo is endocytosed and targeted to vulnerable lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner. Apo is stable in acidic environment and necessary for lysosomes to recover from oxidation-induced alkalinization in astrocytes and neurons. This is accomplished by preventing lysosomal permeabilization. Two lysosomal processes, myelin phagocytosis by astrocytes and neurodegeneration-triggered autagy in Drosophila, require Apo-related lipocalins.
The sandfly Phlebotus orientalis is the main vector of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania donovani in East Africa. Here, we report on the biology and susceptibility to L. donani of P. orient colonies from two geographically distant localities in Ethiopia: a non-endemic site in the lowlands Melka Wer (MW) and an endemic of VL in the highlands Addis Z (AZ). We found marked differences in life-cycle parameters between the two colonies, including distinct requirements for larval food and humidity during pupation. However, genetic analyses using Random Amplified Polymorphic (RAP) PCR and DNA sequencing of cytB and COI genes did not reveal any genetic differences between the two colonies. F1 hybrids developed higher fecundity than the parental colonies. We studied susceptibility of P. orient to L.ani by experimental infections. Even the lowest infective dose (2×103/ml) was sufficient for successful establishment of L.ani in about 50% of P orient females. Using higher infective doses, infection rates were around 90% for both colonies. Leish development in P orient was fast, with presence of metacylic promastigotes in thoracic midgut and colonization of stomal valve hapt by homonads recorded in P orient females by five post-blood. Both MW and AZ of P orient were highly susceptible to Ethiopian Lani strains.
Schistosomiasis japonica is a major public health priority in China due to its serious health and economic impacts. However, it has not been included in the Global Burden of Disease ( GBD ) study. Therefore, the quality of life and disability ( DW ) for advanced schosomias japonica cases need to be taken into account in the estimation of schosias burden. A patient-based quality-of-life evaluation was performed for schos japon suspected or confirmed cases in a schos japon-hyperemic county of the People's Republic of China ( P. R. China. ) using a short questionnaire and physical examination. Disability and morbidity were assessed in confirmed cases using the European quality of life questionnaire with additional dimension ( EQ-5D ), ultrasonography and laboratory. The age-specific DW for schos japon was estimated based on patients' self-rated scores on the analogue scale. The relationships between health, morbidity and DW were explored using multivariate models. Of 506 candidates, 215 were confirmed schos japon and evaluated. Most patients reported impairments in at least one dimension such as pain (90. 7% ), activities (87.9 ) and anxiety or depression (80.9 ). The DW was 0.447 and age-specific ranged from 0. among 30–44 years to 0. among ≥60. DW were associated with loss capacity, abnormal, ascites and hepatitis B, while splenectomy and albumin were protective for life.
Sleeping sickness, also known as African trypanosomias, is a highly prevalent parasitic vector-borne disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Humans acquire the disease following the bite of a tset fly infected with the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei. Over the last decade, diagnostic capacity to estimate sleeping sickness prevalence has improved in active-finding areas but passive surveillance is lacking in much of sub-Saharan Africa. This study examined the use of national census data ( 1999 ) to estimate vulnerability and disability in Kenya's tse belts. A multilevel study estimated the likelihood of disability in individuals, nested within households, within tse fly of varying levels of poverty. Residents and recent migrants of working age were studied. The study conceptualised tse's impact on disability via two pathways: directly from the bite of pathogenic tse resulting in sleeping infection or indirectly, as potential takes out of agricultural and diseased livestock leads to morbidity and mortality, contributing to nutritional and poverty. The study identified tse belts with increased prevalence and evaluated direct and indirect pathways. Incorporating reports from the census is a promising tool that may enhance sleeping programs in sub-Saharan. The burdens of sleeping and takes and opportunity of production in areas are contributors to disability tse-infested.
Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) is a potent inducer of cell differentiation and HIV production in chronically infected cells. In this study, we demonstrate that HMBA transiently activates the PI3/Akt pathway, which leads to the phosphorylation of HEXIM and subsequent release of active transcription elongation factor (PTEF) from its transcriptionally inactive complex with HEXIM and 7 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). As a result, PF is recruited to the HIV promoter to stimulate transcription and viral production. Despite continuous presence of HM, released PF rapidly reassociates with 7snRNA and HEXIM. In contrast, mutant HEXIM that cannot be phosphorylated and released PF and 7sn via PI/Akt pathway antagonizes HM-mediated induction of viral production.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), caused by New World Leishmania (Viannia) species, is associated with the risk of developing mucosal (ML) or disseminated cutaneous leishmanias (DCL). After the formation of a primary skin lesion at the site of the bite by Leish-infected sand fly, the infection can disseminate to form secondary lesions. This metastatic phenotype causes significant morbidity and is associated with a hyper-inflammatory response leading to destruction of nasophary tissues in ML and appearance of numerous ulcerated skin lesions in D. Recently, this aggressive phenotype was connected to the presence of Leish RNA (LRV) in L. guyanensis, showing LRV responsible for elevated parasitemia, hyper-inflammation and overall exacerbation of disease. Further studies of this relationship and LRV in other Leish strains would benefit from improved methods of detection and quantitation, especially not dependent on prior LRV sequence. This study reports various techniques, including anti-dRNA monoclonal antibody (J) for specific and quantitative recognition of LRV in sequence-independent fashion. Applications of J include immunofluorescence, ELISA and dot techniques complementing arsenal of other tools such as nucleic acid purification and real-time PCR. We evaluate each method and demonstrate LRV detection by J in several strains, freshly isolated patient sample and lesionops of infected mice.
Enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are closely related pathogens that attach to intestinal epithelial cells and promote cytoskeletal rearrangements into protrusions called actin pedestals. PEC employs the tyrosine phosphorylated transmembrane receptor Tir, while EHE relies on the multivalent scaffolding protein EspFU. The formation of these pedestals correlates with bacterial colonization in animal models, but the precise function of pedest in infection remains unclear. We characterized the colonization of PEC and EC during polarized epithelial cells. Both PEC and EC formed distinct bacterial communities or “colonies ” that encompassed multiple cells. Tir and EspFU as well as the Arp2/3 complex were critical for colony expansion over time. Unexpectedly, EspFU accelerated colony formation compared to PEC, as Esp-mediated actin assembly drove bacterial motility to junctions, where bacteria formed a pedestal on a neighboring cell and divided, allowing one daughter to disengage and infect second. Collectively, these data reveal Esp enhances epithelial colonization by actin-based motility and efficient cell-to-cell transmission.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of helminth pathogens, and their purification is necessary for downstream studies and applications. The most widely used method for EV purification is differential centrifugation (DC), but size exclusion chromatography (SEC) has been used for EV from other pathogens. This study compares DC and SEC for EV purification from Fasciola hepatica, a helminth pathogen. EVs were collected from culture media and purified by DC or SEC. Transmission electron and atomic force microscopy showed that SEC EVs were smaller and less diverse than DC EVs. Protein quantification and Western blotting showed that SEC had a higher EV to excretory-secretory protein (ESP) yield ratio than DC, with reduced soluble cathepsin proteases in SEC EV. Proteomic analysis showed DC contamination with ESP, with increased protein identifications and peptide hits in DC EV compared to SEC EV. SEC EV contained less tegument proteins than DC EV. These results suggest that DC and SEC do not isolate equivalent EV populations and caution should be taken in choice of purification method, with DC including free proteins and tegument artefacts. We propose that SEC should be used prior to downstream studies.
Reverse engineering of post-transcriptional regulation of gap genes in Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, we use a systems biology approach to infer regulatory mechanisms of the gap genes Krüpp, knir, and giant in Drosila melanogaster. We use detailed, quantitative datasets of mRNA and protein expression to fit a model of postcription regulation and establish its structural and practical identifiability. Our results demonstrate that postcription is not required for patterning in this system, but is necessary for proper control of protein levels.
Rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea worldwide and exhibits a pronounced tropism for the intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) of the small intestine. Both infants and neonatal mice are highly susceptible to infection, whereas adults remain asymptomatic and shed only low numbers of viral particles. Here, we investigated the age-dependent mechanisms of the intestinal epithelial innate immune response to rotavirus infection in an oral mouse model. We found that the expression of the innate receptor for viral dsRNA, Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) was low in the epithelium of suckling mice but strongly increased during the postnatal period inversely correlating with rotavirus susceptibility, viral shedding and histological damage. Adult mice deficient in TLR3 (TLR3−/−) or the adaptor molecule TRIF (TRIFL2) exerted significantly higher viral shedding and epithelial expression of proinflammatory and antiviral genes compared to wild-type animals. In contrast, neonatal mice deficient in TLR or TRIF did not display impaired stimulation or enhanced rotavirus susceptibility. Using chimeric mice, a contribution of the non-hematietic compartment in TRIF-mediated antiral response was detected in adult animals. Finally, a significant increase of TLR expression was detected in human intestinal biops. Thus, upregulation of epithelial TLR during infancy might contribute to age-dependent rotavirus susceptibility.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, communication, and repetitive behavior. The etiology of ASD is not fully understood, but genetic factors are thought to play a major role. In this study, we report results from whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 1, 039 subjects with ASD and 870 controls from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIH) repository with similar ancestry to cases. We used two sequencing methods to produce variant calls and compared the distribution of rare variants between centers. We filtered variants by fraction of missing data, read depth, and balance of alternative reads. We evaluated seven samples sequenced at both centers and found similar results. We addressed how to combine data and results from centers. Gene-based association was an obvious choice, but should we combine statistics across centers (meta-analysis) or combine data then analyze (mega)? We showed that mega-analysis has better power than meta-analysis for gene-based tests. We explored the impact of population structure on rare variant analysis and found that it can confound case-control studies by clustering variants in ancestry. However, principal component analyses were sufficient to control for ancestry and produce appropriate distributions. We used gene-based tests and mega-analysis and found no new risk genes for ASD in this sample. Our results suggest that gene tests require larger samples before being effective for discovery, even for a disorder like ASD.
Mycetoma is the most common causative agent of eumycoma in Sudan and is characterized by the formation of grains. Many people are exposed to the causative agent, but only a small number develop infection. Mycetoma contains chitin in its cell wall, which can trigger the human immune system. We investigated the association between polymorphisms in the chitin-degrading enzyme genes chotidase and AMCase and the incidence of myetoma in a Sudanese population. We studied polymorphisms in 112 eycoma patients and 103 controls, including a 24-b insertion in the chotidase gene (rs1317 ) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in AMCase (617 ). We also studied SNP (41292 ) and 10-b insertion in the 5’UT region of AMCase (143088 ). DNA was isolated from blood and genotypes were determined using PCR-RP. Histological staining proved the presence of chitin in the grain. We found that polymorphism in chidase was associated with increased odds of eoma (OR 2.9; p.004 ). No association was found for polymorphisms in AMCase (all>.05 )
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a prototype for viral latency with well-defined lytic and latent phases. However, the quiescence of latency has been questioned with evidence that ly genes can be transcribed in this state. Here we show that lytic and latent phases are less clearly defined in two ways. First, half of HSV spread to latently infected sites occurred beyond initial infection. Second, we show that ly promoters drive protein expression during latency.
Prion Strain Differences in Accumulation of PrPSc on Neurons and Glia Are Associated with Similar Profiles of Neuroinflammatory Genes: Comparison of Three Prion Strains.
Chromosome organization is essential for regulating gene expression and cell function. Chromosomes are long, densely packed, topologically constrained polymers, making it challenging to develop models that capture their multi-scale dynamics. We propose a strategy to develop coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice, accounting for entanglement and volumic density. Our scheme captures steady-state and dynamical properties and tracks dynamics at different coarse-graining, offering a power-law gain in efficiency and a systematic way to define coarse-grained models for chromosomes. We use this formalism to investigate the 3D organization of chromosome 3R 20bp in Drosophila during one cell cycle. We show that combining coarse-graining with a one-parameter copolymer model integrating epigen-driven interactions reproduces experimental data at chromosome-scale and predicts chromatin is dynamic during the cycle.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping have been used to analyze complex traits and diseases in humans. GWAS tag non-coding SNPs with small effects, and these SNPs exert phenotypic control by modifying gene expression. To interpret GW associations using eQ data, we need to understand the genetic and causal mechanisms of cell specificity of eQs. We performed eQ analysis in three parts: (1) identified eQs from eleven on seven cell types, (2) integrated eQ with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data from ENCODE, and (3) built classifiers to predict the type of e. We found that e are associated with e SNP overlap hundreds of type CRE, including enhancer, promoter, repressive chromatin, open chrom, and DNA protein classes. These associations provide insight into the mechanisms of e and mode of corresponding. Using a classifier with CRE-SNP as features, we demonstrate the feasibility of predicting e. We also show that CRE from a trait type can be used to annotate GW in absence of e for that type.
The development of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) to the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein gp120 has been an important area of research over the last decade. Many of these bNAbs recognize epitopes consisting of both amino acid and glycan residues. Moreover, the glycans required for bNAb binding are intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. This type of glycosylation alters the mass and charge of Envs compared to molecules with the same amino sequence but with mature, sialic-containing carbohydrates. Since cell lines for biopharm production that limit N-glycosylation to mannose (Man5) or intermediates are not readily available, production of vaccineogens displaying glycan-dependent epitopes has been challenging. Here, we report the development of a suspension-adapted Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) line that limits glycosylation to Man5 intermediates. This line was created using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and contains a mutation inactivating the MG1 gene. Monomeric gp120 produced in the MG1 CHO line exhibit improved binding to protic glycan-dependentNAbs to V1/V (PG9) and V3 (PGT and 10–107) while preserving structure of gly-independent (RC01). The MG CHO line limits glycos to intermediates without impairing doubling or ability to grow at high densities, suggesting it will be useful for biarm production of HIV-1 immunogens.
Lymphatic filariasis is a major cause of permanent and long-term disability in many of the world’s poorest populations in tropical and developing nations. Parasitic nematodes are responsible for this devastating disease. Proteins essential to nematodes that do not have mammalian counterparts represent targets for therapeutic discovery. Trehalose-6-phosphatase (TPP) from Brugia mal is a promising target. In the nematode Caenorhabdis elegans, TP is essential for survival due to toxic effects of trehal 6-phosphate accumulation. TP is also essential in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We determined the X-ray structure of TP from B. mal. The structure revealed a stabilizing N-terminal MIT domain and catalytic C-terminal C2-type H phosphatase fold. Structure-guided mutagenesis combined with kinetic analyses using competitive inhibitor trehal 6-sulf identified residues important for binding and catalysis. This structure-function analysis along with computational provided the basis for proposed TP-trehal 6-phosphate model. The model indicates substrate mode wherein complementarity and van der Waals interactions drive recognition. This mode is in contrast to hom sucrose-phosphatase where extensive hydrogenond interactions are made to substrate.
Cancers are characterised by spatially heterogeneous vascular architectures across samples and patients, which contribute to suboptimal treatment efficacy. We present a novel computational framework to simulate blood and interstitial fluid transport in silico for validation against in vivo imaging. Our model couples Poiseuille and Darcy descriptions of vascular and interstitial flow, and incorporates spatially heterogeneous vessel and interstitial permeabilities to predict tumour fluid dynamics. We apply our framework to orthopic murine glioma ( GL261 ) and human colorectal carcinoma ( LS174T ) and perform sensitivity analysis to understand key mechanisms determining tumour transport. We mimic vascular normalization by modifying parameters, such as vessel and interstitial permeabilities, and show that realistic vasculature is key to contrasting fluid response between tumours. We show that reducing tumour interstitial pressure is not essential to increase interstitial perfusion and therapies should develop interstitial pressure gradient. We hypothesise that stabilising vessel diameters and permeabilities are key responses following normalization and may alter interstitial conductivity. Finally, we suggest normalising interenvironment may increase perfusion within tumours.
HIV-1 is known to spread through both cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission, but the relative importance of cell-to-cell transmission in natural infection has not been resolved. Likewise, the extent to which cell-to-cell transmission is vulnerable to inhibition by neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors remains to be determined. Here we report on neutralizing antibody activity during cell-to-cell transmission using specifically experimental strategies that enable discrimination between the two routes. We demonstrate the activity of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs) and entry inhibitors during cell-to-cell transmission varies depending on their mode of action. While gp41 directed agents remain active, CD binding site (CDbs) inhibitors, including the neutralizing mAb VRC01, lose potency during cell transmission. This implies CDbs mAbs act preferentially block free transmission while allowing HIV to spread through cell contacts. This provides a plausible explanation for how HIV maintains infectivity and escapes potent broadly active CDbs antibody responses in vivo.
Visual attention is known to have a profound effects on neural responses in the visual system, producing changes in firing rates as well as in the structure and size of receptive fields in both spatial and feature space. Previous models of attention suggest that these effects arise from selective modulation of neural inputs. However, anatomical and physiological observations suggest that attention targets higher levels of the system such as V4 or MT rather than input areas such as V1. Here, we propose a mechanism that explains how top-down attentional modulation on higher areas can produce observed effects on neural responses. Our model requires the existence of feedback connections between areas and short lateral inhibition within each area. Feedback redistributes top-down to lower areas which in turn alters inputs of higher cells including those did not receive initial. This produces rate modulations and receptive shifts. Simultaneously, short lateral between neighboring produce competitive that are scaled to field in any area. Our reproduces observed effects on rates ( response gain input, gain, competition scaled field ) and structure ( shifts and resizing fields spatial feature ) without modifying. Our also makes novel that effects should shift from gain to as focus away from cell.
In Drosophila, the posterior signalling centre (PSC) is a group of cells that controls blood cell homeostasis in the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. SC acts in a non-autonomous manner to maintain janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling in hematietic progenitors (proocytes, preserving their multipotent character for differentiation into lamlocytes, a cell type required to fight specific threats such as wasp parasism. We show that the short I cytokine receptor CG142/Lat is required to switch off J/STAT signalling in proocytes, a prerequisite for lamlocyte differentiation upon waspism. In vivo and cell assays indicate that Lat forms heteromers with Dome, the Drosila I cytokine receptor related mammalian GP130, and antagonises Dome in a dose-dependent manner. Primary response to waspism is a decrease in cytok mRNA in the gland followed by increase in Lat/Dome ratio. We propose this sequence culminates in inhibition of J/STAT by Lat.
Genetic recombination is an important for the evolution of begomoviruses, a family of single-stranded DNA viruses. In begoviruses, recombination is not random and is influenced by factors such as sequence similarity between recomb genomes, nucleic acid structure and sensitivity to nuclease breakage. The viability of recombinant genomes could be influenced by protein-protein and nucleotide interactions. We investigated recombination patterns in begovir Tomato leaf curl virus and Tomato leaf Comos virus over 120 days in tomato plants. We show that recombination between these viruses is complex and influenced by sequence similarity but not structure. Selection against recombinants with disrupted intra-gen interactions such as protein and nucleic folding is strong. We find that selection preserves co-evolved protein-protein and DNA interactions so strongly that we can identify sequence tracts involved in these interactions.
Nucleosomes are the basic units of eukaryotic chromatin that have been suggested to influence the evolution of eukotic genomes by altering the propensity of DNA to mutate and acting to maintain or exclude nucleosomes in particular locations. In contrast to the idea that nucleosomes are unique to eukotes, histone proteins have been found in archaeal genomes. However, archaeal nucleosomes differ from eukotic nucleosomes in many respects, including assembly into tetramers rather than octamers from histone proteins lacking N and C-terminal tails. Here we show that despite these differences the association between nucleosome footprints and sequence is conserved between humans and the archaeon Haloferaxii. We examine whether selection or mutation can explain concord substitution patterns in the two. Unexpectedly, we find that neither mutation nor selection are sufficient to explain the association between nucleosomes and sequence. Instead, we show that nucleosome substitution patterns are consistent with a model where sequence results in reposition of nucleosomes during evolution. We demonstrate that nucleosome reposition is both necessary and sufficient to explain the association current nucleosome and substitution patterns.
Protein conformational diversity of the native state plays a central role in modulating protein function. The paradigm sustains that different ligands shift the conformation equilibrium through binding to high-affinity conformers. Intramolecular vibrational dynamics associated with conformation guarantee conformation transitions, which could be associated with evolutionary conserved traits. We present a novel procedure to identify key positions sustaining conformation associated with ligand binding. The method is applied to a refined dataset of 188 paired protein structures in bound and unbound forms. Normal modes most involved in conformation change are selected according to overlap with structural distortions introduced by ligand. The subspace defined by modes is used to analyze effect of point mutations on conformation of protein. We find negative correlation between effects of mutations on normal subspaces associated with ligand and position evolutionary conservations from multiple alignments. Positions found to alter these subspaces are defined as key, important mediating ligand conformation change. These are conserved, mostly buried aliphatic residues in structural regions like β-sheets and α-helix.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an intracellular pathogen that uses multiple metabolic pathways to establish and maintain infection. We investigated the role of fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA), an enzyme involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. We engineered an Mtb strain in which FBA levels were regulated by anhyrotetracycline and found that depletion of F resulted in clearance of M in both acute and chronic phases of infection in vivo and loss of viability in vitro when cultured on single carbon sources. Consistent with M's ability to coatabol multiple carbon sources, loss of F could be overcome when cultured on mixtures of glycol and gluogenic carbon sources. We generated an F knockout (Δfba) strain and found that lack of F could only be compensated by specific balance of glucose and butyrate in growth and metabolism of butrate was determined by M's ability to coatab glucose. These data evaluate F as a drug target in both replicating and persistent M and expand our understanding of conditions that define F in vivo.
Trypanosomatids, such as Leishmania, lack catalase and selenium-glutathione peroxidases, which are enzymes involved in peroxide removal. In this study, we investigated the role of mitochondrial 2-cys peroxin ( mTXx ) in the Leishmania life cycle. We generated mpx null mutants by gene replacement and found that they were avirulent in a murine infection model. Unexpectedly, the avirulence was not due to lack of peroxidase activity, as mpx behaved like controls when exposed to exogenous oxidants or generated by macrophage phagocytosis in vitro. mpx were also avir in hosts unable to mount an oxidative phagocyte response ( B.47ox−/− and B.AG−−/−IF− mice ). We conclude that perase activity is not required for survival in mice by showing that peraseinactive mpx rescued the nonfective phenotype ofpx. We propose a novel function for mpx as a molecular chaper, which may explain impaired infectivity ofpx. This is based on ability to suppress aggregation of citrate synth in vitro.px were more sensitive than controls to temperature shift from 25°C to 37°C, reminiscent of lacking chaper genes.
Histoplas urine (HAg) is the preferred method for diagnosing progressive disseminated histoplasis (PDH) in HIV patients. In 2007, ALPHA-Histoplas E was approved for clinical use outside the United States. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of ALPHA-HAg. We conducted a multicenter, prospective diagnostic study in secondary and tertiary-care facilities in Mexico. We included HIV patients with PD suspicion and evaluated ALPHA-HAg accuracy using Histlas capsulatum growth on blood, bone, and tissue cultures or histopathologic exam (PD–proven) as reference. We evaluated 288 patients, 29.5% (85; 95% CI 24.–.35 ) had PD. ALPHA-HAg sensitivity was 67.% (95 CI 56–.76 ) and specificity 97.5% ( CI 94–99. ). The likelihood ratio was 27. (11–74. ) In PD–pro patients, 10.5% had co-infections, mostly disseminated Mycobacterium complex. We observed high specificity but low sensitivity of ALPHA-HAg. The test may start antifungals but culture is necessary since co-infections frequent and negative result does not rule PD.
Diarrhea is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide, responsible for approximately 1. 8 million deaths annually and millions of episodes of nonfatal cases. In up to 40% of cases, the etiologic agent remains unidentified. The advent of metagenomics has enabled the systematic characterization of microbial populations, and metagenomics has the potential to define the spectrum of viruses, including novel, present in stool during episodes of diarrhea. This study employed a metagenomic approach to characterize the viral communities present in stool specimens from 12 children employing a “microassay” strategy that requires minimal sample (100 mg ), minimal purification, and sequencing ( reads per sample. This approach detected known enteric viruses as well as sequences from putatively novel viruses with limited similarity to GenBank.
Zika and deng outbreaks in the Dominican Republic were studied using national surveillance data to compare the two flaviviruses. Retrospective datasets were used to collect information on populations at risk and descriptive statistics were used to describe the outbreaks on a national scale. The data showed that 75% of deng cases were reported in those <20 years old, while Zika infections were more dispersed among the population. Dengue rates were higher among males (25.9 per 10,000 population) compared to females (21.5 per 10,000 population). Zika was highly clustered among females (73.8% (95%CI 72.6,75.%; p<0.05) ; age-adjusted rates were 7.64 per 10,000 among females and 2.72 per 10,000 among males. Stratification by sex showed higher rates among females (1.84 (1.82,1.87; p<0.05) compared to males (1.72 (1.69,1.75; p<0.05). However, GBS rates stratified by sex showed higher risk in males vs females (0.62 vs 0.57 per 10,000). Little impact of existing deng immunity on Zika attack rates was found at the population level. Confounding of R and risk by sex-specific reporting can alter reliability of metrics, which can be addressed using proxy syndromes or conditions to explore sex-skewed incidence.
Poly(ADP-ribose ) polymerases (PARs ) are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of poly (ADP-ri ) units onto target proteins. In Arabidopsis thaliana, we have found that PAR2 (Atg023 ) rather than PAR1 (Atg20 ) makes the greatest contribution to PAR activity and organismal viability in response to genotoxic stresses caused by bleomycin, mitomycin C or gamma-radi. PAR2 carries DNA binding motifs rather than the zinc finger domains common in plant and animal PAR1 proteins. PAR2 makes stronger contributions than PAR1 to plant responses including restriction of pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae growth and reduction of infection-associated DNA-strand break. For poly (AD-ri )glycohydase (PARG ) enzymes, we find Arabidopsis P1 not P2 is the major contributor to (AD-ri ) removal from acceptor proteins. The abundance of PAR2 is influenced by PAR1 and PARG. PAR2 and PAR interact with each other, with PARG and P2, suggesting direct interactions among mediators of the balance of (AD-rib.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, RPM-1 is a conserved intracellular signaling protein that regulates synapse formation and axon termination. RPM-1 acts as a ubiquitin ligase to inhibit the DLK-1 and MLK-1 MAP kinase pathways. We have identified a new MAP kinase pathway that suppresses synapse defects but not axon defects in mechanosensory neurons of rpm-1 mutants. This pathway includes M-15 ( MAPK ), NS-1 ( MAPK ), KK-1 ( MAPK ) and JNK-1 ( MAP ). These kinases are likely to form a new MAP pathway that opposes RPM-1. Transgenic overexpression of M-15/J-1 kinases impairs synapse in wild-type animals. M-15/J-1 functions autonomously in mechanensory neurons and localizes to presynaptic terminals. Loss of M-15/J-1 suppresses defects in habituation to repeated stimuli in rpm- mutants, a behavioral that likely from impaired glutamatergic synapse.
In Caenorhabditis briggs, the sex-determination protein TR-1 (TRA-1) is a bipotential transcription factor that can activate or repress the same target gene in response to changing signals from upstream genes. Here, we show that TR-1 is required for spermatogenesis and that it works as part of the Tip60 Histone Acetylase complex. TR-1 promotes the expression of C-f-3, a gene needed for spermatogenesis. TR-1 also works through TR-1 to activate C-f-3 and control the sperm/oocyte decision. Since TR-1 can repress C-3 as well, these observations demonstrate it is bipot. TR-1 regulates the development of the male tail. Since C-tra C-tr- double mutants resemble C-tra null, these two branches control TR- activity. However, differences in the relationship between these branches have arisen during evolution. brigae TR- null prevent hermaphrodite spermat, but C-f null, which disrupt the other half of the switch. On the other hand, C null prevent spermat, but C-tr null. Synthetic interactions confirm both halves exist each species.
Integrated information is a measure that quantifies the extent to which a system generates more information than the sum of its parts as it transitions between states, possibly reflecting levels of consciousness generated by neural systems. However, it is only defined for discrete Markov systems, which are unusual in biology. As a result, it can rarely be measured in practice. Here, we describe two new measures, Φ and Φ, that overcome these limitations and are easy to apply to time-series data. Φ is a measure of integrated information that can be applied to continuous systems, while Φ is a measure of integrated that can be applied to time-series data. We use simulations to demonstrate the practical applicability of our measures and explore their properties. Our results provide new opportunities for examining integration in real and model systems and carry implications for relations between integrated, consciousness, and neurocognitive processes. However, our findings pose challenges for theories that ascribe meaning to measured quantities.
In Uganda, the prevalence of Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) has increased in recent years, raising concerns that it may overlap with the Gambian form of the disease. Recent studies have focused on environmental and climatic factors that control the distribution of the disease. Here, we extend a previous study that used logistic regression to explore the relationship between Rhodesian H and social, environmental, and climatic variables in the most affected districts, suggesting the disease spread was due to movement of infected, untreated livestock. We use Bayesian geostatistical analysis to account for spatial autocorrelation, uncertainty in data and parameters, and undertake predictive mapping of high H prevalence in the future. In a generalised linear model, we account for spatial autocorrelation and uncertainty in data and parameters, resulting in more accurate parameter estimates and increased predictive accuracy. This allows assessment of the validity of the livestock hypothesis and assessment of covariate effects. Our analysis supports that Rhodesian H was imported via movement of untreated, infected livestock from endemic areas. The effect of health care on the distribution of Rhodesian H and the link between disease and minimum temperature have been confirmed. Predictive mapping indicates increased risk of high prevalence in areas surrounding livestock markets, demonstrating the importance of trading for disease spread. Adherence to policy to treat livestock at sale is essential to prevent spread of sleeping sickness in Uganda.
The concept of equilibria in large ecosystems is a neglected in the complexity-stability debate. In the 1970s, the consensus that complexity leads to stability in ecosystems was challenged. Recently, this was extended to ecologically inspired networks. These approaches assume the existence of a feasible equilibrium, i. e. positive abundances. However, this assumption has not been tested. We provide analytical results complemented by simulations which show that equilibrium vanishes in species rich systems. This leaves us in an uncomfortable situation in which the existence of a equilibrium assumed in stability is far from granted. We extend our analyses by changing interaction structure and intensity, and find that feasibility and stability is irrespective of species with weak interactions. Interestingly, we find that the dynamical behaviour of ecologically inspired architectures is very different and richer than of unstructured. Our results suggest that a understanding of ecosystem requires the interplay between strength and architecture.
Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever, is a zoonotic pathogen with a near global distribution. This study aimed to assess the epidemiology of C burnii in humans and cattle in Western Kenya. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 204 humans and 955 cattle in 416 homesteads in Western and Nyan Provinces, Kenya. Serum samples were tested for C burnii antibodies and questionnaires collected demographic, socio-economic and husbandry information. Data were linked to environmental datasets based on geographical locations. Correlation and spatial analyses were applied to assess the link between cattle and human seropreval. Multile regression was used to assess relationships between socio-economic, demographic and environmental factors and ser-positivity in humans and animals. The overall ser-prevalence of C burnii was 2. 5% in humans and 10.5 in cattle. We found no evidence of correlation between cattle and human serpreval within households or spatial proximity to other households. Multile modelling indicated that cattle obtained from market had higher serpreval than those bred in homestead and residing in areas with lower precipitation. For humans, the youngest group had highest odds of seros, variations observed between ethnic groups and frequent livestock contact ( grazing and dealing material ) was a risk factor.
Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic flatworm that causes schistosomiasis, a major neglected tropical disease. Schistosoma japonicum and S. haematobum are close relatives of S. mansoni, and their genomes have been sequenced. To understand the role of S. mansoni genes, functional approaches are being developed. Transgenesis in S. mansoni can be achieved using RNA interference and insertional mutagenesis. However, culturing germ cells in S. mans is difficult. Vasa is a DEAD-box helicase that marks primordial germ cells in animals. In S. mans, 33 DEAD-box helicases were identified, three of which are vasa-like: Smv1, Sm2, and Sm3. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed Smv1, Sm2, and Sm3 belong to the vasa/10 subfamily. Smv1, Sm2, and Sm3 are transcribed in adult S. mans with high expression in sporocysts, females, eggs, miracidia, and undeveloped eggs. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed Sm1, Sm, and Sm3 transcribed in the ovary where oocytes.
Cardiac valve disease is a major clinical problem worldwide. Cardiac valve development and homeostasis need to be precisely controlled. Hipp signaling is essential for organ and tissue homeostasis, while its role in valve formation and morphology remains unknown. We found that VGL4, a transcriptional cofactor in vertebrates, is mainly expressed in valve interstitial cells at the post-embryonic (EM) stage and maintained till adult stage. Tissue specific knockout of V4 in cell lineages revealed that only loss of V4 in endothelial lineage led to valve malformation with expression of YAP targets. We semi-knock Y in V4 ablated hearts and found hyperproliferation of valve interstitial cells significantly constrained.
Many studies have sought to identify patterns of positive selection on standing genetic variation in natural populations. Recent large-scale analyses have argued that soft sweeps are common in humans, Drosophila, and HIV. However, others have questioned the relevance of these models to natural populations and the identifiability of sweeps relative to other processes, arguing that sweeps are likely rare. Here, we evaluate three recent studies and their methodologies using population theory and simulation. We find that all are prone to high false-positive rates, identifying sweeps under both hard and neutral models. Furthermore, we show that demographic histories combined with hard sweeps serve as more parsimonious explanation.
Female mosquitoes of the species Aedes aegypt are the principal vectors of dengue fever, causing 50–100 million infections per year. They inhibit host-seeking behavior for three days following a blood meal due to a hemolymph-borneal humoral factor. Headptide is a candidate mediating this suppression, but the mechanism is unknown. We identified eight Neurope Y ( NPY )-Like Receptors ( NLRs ) in the Ae. aegypt genome and screened them in a cell-based imaging assay against a panel of peptides. Four Ae.egi NLRs responded to one or more peptide ligands, but NLR1 responded to Headptide as well as Neurope-Fs. Two NLR homologues in the Lyme disease vector Ix scularis were also sensitive to Headptide. Injection of synthetic Headptide and Neurope-F3 inhibited host-seeking in non-fed females, whereas control buffer or inactive Headptide had no effect. We used zinc-fingerases to generate five independent NLR null strains and tested for behavioral abnormalities. NLR mutants displayed normal locomotion, egg, sugar feeding, blood feeding, host, and host inhibition after meal. We identified four Aeeg NLR and NLR1 as candidate Neurope receptor sensitive to Headptide. NLR alone is not required for host inhibition and we conclude other receptors, peptides, or both regulate this behavior.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease whose distribution in space and time can be influenced by environmental factors such as rivers, elevation, slope, surface temperature, land use/cover, and rainfall. This study aims to identify areas with conditions suitable for schosomiasis transmission based on physical environmental factors derived from satellite imagery and spatial analysis in Akure Local Government Area ( LGA ) of Ondo State, Nigeria. This was done through multicriteria evaluation (CE) using Sa’s Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). AHP is a multicriteria method that uses hierarchical structures to represent a problem and make decisions based on priority. In this study AHP was used to obtain the weight importance of each schosiasis factor. The study focused on temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, and land use/cover as factors controlling schias incidence in the area. These factors were reclassified and overlaid to identify areas vulnerable to schias. Weighted analysis was done after each factor was given appropriate weight through hierarchical process. The prevalence of schias in the area was determined by parasitological analysis of urine samples collected through random sampling. Results showed varying schias risk with larger portion of area (82%) falling under high and very risk category. Study showed one community (O I) had lowest schias while risk increased in four communities (I, Igoba, It, Ogb and Oese). Predictions by model correlated with observations from study.
Pneumococcal meningitis is a bacterial infection of the brain caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The cholesterol-dependent cytolin pneumolys is a virulence factor that determines the neuropathogenic potential of pneumoc. Here, we show that pneumoc meningitis leads to selective loss of synapses in the superficial layers of the neocortex of post-mortem brain samples from individuals with pneumoc meningitis. A similar effect is observed in mice with pneumoc meningitis when the bacteria express the pore-form cholesterol-dependent cytol pneumolys. We also show that exposure of mouse brain slices to pore-compet pneumys at disease-relevant, nonlytic concentrations causes dendritic swelling, dendritic spine elimination and synaptic loss. This pathology is reduced by NMD glutamate antagonists MK801 and DAP5. Pneumolys increases glutamate levels in brain slices. In astrocytes, pneumol initiates glutamate release in a calcium-dependent manner. We propose that pneumol plays a synap and dendotoxic role in pneumoc meningitis by initiating glutamate release from astrocytes, leading to glutamate-dependent synaptic damage.
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are DNA viruses that are associated with major human cancers. To develop new means of prevention, such as vaccines and microbicides, it is necessary to understand the life cycle of HPVs. The life cycle of HPVs is closely linked to the state of the stratified epithelium it infects, with progeny virus only made in the terminally differentiating supasal compartment. It has been recognized that HPVs first establish infection in the basal layer of stratified epithelium, but this has not been understood. We used chemical approaches to reveal that cell progression through mitosis is critical for HP infection. We used HPV16 containing the viral genome, synchronized human keratinocytes as hosts, and viral expression as read for infection. We learned that the cell must enter phase for infection to take place. phase inhibitors had no effect, whereas,,,, and phase inhibitors prevented. We conclude that cells need to pass for successful of the encapsated genes. These provide reason why HPVs establish in the compartment of stratified epithelia. Only this of the epithelium cells through the cycle, and it is in these that HPVs can establish.
Penicillium marffei is an important dimorphic fungus that causes systemic mycoses in China and Southeast Asia. While miRNAs are known to regulate gene expression in animals and plants, miRN in fungi are less studied and their roles in dimorphism are largely unknown. We hypothesized that mi-like RNAs (milRN) are expressed in P. marffei and attempted to identify them in mycel and yeast phases using high-throughput sequencing. Small RN were more abundant in mycel than yeast. We identified 24 mil candidates, 17 in mycel and 7 yeast. Two genes, d-1 and d-2, encoding Dicer-like proteins and q- encoding Argonaute, were identified in P. marff. Phylogen analysis showed d-2 was more related to homologues in other dimorphic fungi than Penillium chrysenum Aspergillus. d demonstrated higher expression in mycel than yeast. Northern analysis confirmed two milRN, PMil-M and PMil, only in mycel. Using dKO dKO dKO qKO we showed biogenesis dependent on d but not d or q. mRNA levels of predicted targets PMil were upregulated in PMilKD, supporting function.
Zika virus (ZIK) emerged in French Polynes in 2013 and spread through the Pacific between 2013 and 2017. Several Aedes mosquitoes may have contributed to ZIK transmission, including Aedes aegypt, the main vector in the region, and Aedesynensis, vector of lymphatic filariasis and secondary vector dengue. This study aimed to analyze the ability of these vectors to transmit ZIK at a regional scale. We compared the competence of wild Ae.egypt and.ynensis populations from Pacific for ZV which circulated in 2013–2017. We collected Ae.egpt ( three populations ) and.yn ( two ) from the region. Female mosquitoes were exposed to ZV ( TC/mL ) isolated in 2014. At 6, 9, and 21 post-infection, bodies ( thorax and abdomen ), and heads were analyzed to measure infection, dissemination, and transmission rates, respectively. Our results showed ZV rates were heterogeneous between Aeeg populations, but dissemination rates were moderate and homogenous between these. For.yn, rates were less heterogeneous between the two tested populations. Transmission efficiency revealed low competence for ZV of Ae populations under study. Our results indicated low Z transmission by Aeeg andyn from the region.
Xist is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that regulates X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells. The function of Xist and other lncRNAs depends on their thermodynamically stable secondary and higher-order structures that can form in the context of a cell. To study the structure of Xist in cells, we developed Targeted StructureSeq, which combines chemical probing of RNA in cells with target-specific massively parallel sequencing. Targeted StructureSeq enriches for signals from the RNA of interest, achieving high coverage of the RNA with relatively few reads, providing a targeted and scalable approach to analyze conformation in cells. We applied Targeted StructureSeq to the full-length Xist ncRNA and developed new models for functional elements within Xist, including the A element in the 5’end of X. This analysis also identified structural elements X that are evolutionarily conserved, including a proximal to the repeats that is important for X function.
Genome-wide association studies have identified a large number of genetic variants associated with complex diseases. However, the clinical utility of risk prediction based on genomic profiles is controversial. To evaluate the performance of genetic risk models, appropriate statistical measures are required. Previous studies have mainly used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), AUC, to judge the predictive value of genetic tests. However, AUC has limitations and should be complemented by other measures. We develop a novel statistical framework that connects a variety of predictive indices. Given the overall disease probability and the level of variance in total liability (heritability) explained by genetic variants, we can estimate analytically a variety of prediction metrics, for example AUC, mean difference between cases and non-cases, net reclassification improvement to reclassify into high and low categories, proportion explained by specific percentile of population at highest risk, variance of predicted, and risk at percentile. We demonstrate how to construct graphs to visualize performance of models, ROC, density of risks, and predictiveness (disease plotted against risk ). Results match well with theoretical. We apply to nine complex diseases evaluating predictive of genetic tests on known variants for each trait.
Trypanosoma brucei gambiense is the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Diagnosis and treatment are key elements of control strategies. Serological screening is the first step in diagnostic algorithms. The Card agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT) has been the most used screening test for decades. However, it has practical limitations. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) were introduced, but are manufactured using native antigens, which are challenging to produce. This study evaluated a new DT using recombinant antig (SDOLINEAT 2. 0) in comparison with DT using native antigens (OLINEAT) and ATT. A total 57,632 individuals were screened in the Democratic Republic of Congo, either passively at health centres or actively by mobile teams, and 260 H cases were confirmed by parasitology. The highest sensitivity was achieved by OLAT 2. 0 (71. 2%), followed by ATT (62.5%) and OLAT (59.%). The most specific was ATT (99. 2%), while specificity of OLAT and OLAT 2.0 were 98.9 and 98.1, respectively. All tests were more sensitive in passive than active screening. Combining tests resulted in increased sensitivity: when OLAT was combined with OLAT 2. 0, sensitivity reached 98.4 in passive and 83. in active. The recomant-based DT was more sensitive and specific than OLAT. It was as sensitive but less specific than ATT.
Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease that affects millions of Latin Americans and has been effectively controlled in Guatemala after multiple rounds of indoor insecticide spraying. However, a few foci with persistent Triatoma infestation remain. In the municipality of Comapa, Department of Juti, southeastern Guatemala, control interventions appear less effective. We carried out three cross-sectional entomological and serological surveys in Comapa to evaluate a decade of vector activities. Baseline serological (1999 ) and entological (2002 ) surveys were followed by three rounds of insecticide applications (2005 ) and intermittent spraying of infested houses until 201. Household inspections to determine entom indices and materials were conducted 1, 7 and 11. Serological surveys were conducted in school children 199, 7 and 201, and women of child-bearing age 15–44 in 201. After multiple rounds of indoor sprayings, the infestation index decreased from 39% to 27. Household materials alone predicted <10% infested houses. Chagas seropreval in Comapa declined in school children by 10, from 10% to 1. However, serreval in women of child age remains >10. After a decade of control in Comapa, there is evidence of reduced transmission. However, continued vector-borne and congenital transmission pose a threat to Chagas elimination goal.
Citrobacterium is a natural mouse pathogen that causes attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions and shares virulence strategies with clinically significant human pathogens such as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). We previously reported the complete genome sequence of C. rodium ICC168, which displayed characteristics of a newly evolved pathogen. In this study, we found that the genome of C. rodium is unstable as a result of repeat-mediated large-scale recombination and active transposition of mobile elements such as prophages. We sequenced an additional C. rodium strain EX-33 to reveal that the reference ICC168 is representative of the species and most inactivating mutations were common to both isolates and likely occurred early in the evolution of this pathogen.
Stochastic fluctuations in gene expression give rise to distributions of protein levels across cell populations. We propose a method for inferring sets of biochemical constants that govern chromatin modification, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation from stochasticity in expression. We derived analytical solutions for the first four moments of the protein distribution and found that these moments capture the shape of protein distributions. We developed an efficient algorithm for inferring expression constants from the moments of distributions. Using this algorithm we find that protein distributions are consistent with a number of different biochemical constant sets. Despite degeneracy, the solution of constants always informs underlying mechanism. We distinguish between regimes of transcriptional bursting and constitutive production. Our method agrees with current approach in restrictive regime and identifies constants not obtainable without assumptions. We estimate biochemical constants or ratios in 91% of cases and identify all underlying constants in some cases.
Monkeypox virus (MPV) is the causative agent of monkeypox (MPX), an emerging orthopoxvirus zoonosis endemic in tropical rain forests of Africa and sporadic in West Africa. It is a neglected disease in rural areas where human population interacts with wildlife, and human-to-human transmission is possible. Smallpox vaccination provides cross-protection against MPX; however, vaccination ended in Africa in 1980, leaving a large population unprotected against MPV. Disease control relies on deterring zoon exposure and interrupting person-to-person spread. There are no FDA-approved therapies against MP and current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns. New studies on pathogenesis, prophylaxis and therapeutics are of interest for scientific and governments concerned MPV could be bioterror. In this study, a new vaccination strategy based on recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (HV-4) vectors expressing MPV glycoproteins A29, M1 and B6 was investigated for protection from lethal MPV challenge in STAT knockout mice. Three recombinant HV-4 vectors were constructed and demonstrated to express their transgene. A small study showed all recom HV-4 safe following intraper administration. Further, HV-E1-MR alone or in combination with HV-C-A29 and HV-E6 was able to protect 100% and 80% against mortality and morbidity in STAT mice. This demonstrated efficacy of HV-4 vectors and use as vaccine platform.
Trypanosomes lack homologues to the subunits of the decapping complex, while deadenylation and 5’-3 degradation are conserved. Here, I show that trypanosomes use an ApH-like phosphatase TbPH1 as their major mRNA decapping enzyme. TbPH1 was recently identified as a trypanosome stress granule protein and involved in mRNA binding. A fraction of Tb1 co-localises with the tryosome 5’-3 exibonuc X to a granule at the posterior of the cell, indicating a connection between the enzymes. RNA depletion of Tb1 is lethal and causes a massive increase in mRNAs that are deadenylated but not yet 5-3 degraded. These data suggest Tb1 acts downstream deadeny and upstream of mRNA, consistent with a function in decapping. In vitro experiments show recombin, N-terminally truncated Tb1 protein but catalytically inactive sensitises the tryosome spliced RNA to yeast X1, only if an 5 polyosphatase is included. This indicates the decapping of Tb differs the decapping of D2 by more than one group at mRNA’s. This is the first function of eukotic ApH phosphatase, a bacterial-derived class present all phylogen super of eukotic.
Inhibition of the Arx gene in pancreatic α-cells is sufficient to promote the conversion of α-cells into β-like cells at any age. This is achieved through the continuous mobilization of ductal precursor cells to an endocrine fate, glucagon cells, which are subsequently converted into β-like cells upon Arx inhibition. The generation of Arx and Pax4 double mutants indicates that Pax4 is dispensable for these processes, suggesting that Ar is the main trigger for α-mediated β cell neogenesis. Importantly, loss of Ar in α-cells is sufficient to regenerate β-cell mass and reverse diabetes-induced β depletion.
Eukaryotic cells use a battery of mechanisms to reduce the probability of re-initiation from the thousands of origins in their genome because re-init can generate genomic alterations with high frequency. It has been presumed that all origins are inhibited identically. However, origins initiate with diverse efficiencies when these mechanisms are disabled, and this cannot be explained by differences in the efficiency or timing of initiation during S phase. We have identified genetic elements that are necessary for preferential initiation of two origins and sufficient to confer preferential initiation on heterologous origins when control is partially deregulated. These elements do not enhance S timing or efficiency of adjacent origins and are acting as initiation promoters (RIPs). We mapped RIP to ∼60 bp AT rich sequences that act in distance and sequence-dependent manner. During induction, Mc2 reassociates with origins that preferentially initiate and that do not, suggesting RIP can overcome block imposed by. Our findings identify a level of control to initiation. This creates a complex landscape of potential that revealed when mechanisms are compromised.
Invasive amebias caused by Entamoeba histolytic are increasing among men who have sex with men and co-infection ameba and HIV-1 is emerging in East Asian countries. In this study, the clinical and epidemiological features of invasive amebias in HIV-1 patients were characterized. The medical records of 170 coinfected cases were analyzed and E. histoly genotype was assayed in 14 cases. The clinical presentation of invasive amebias in HIV-1 patients was similar to that in normal hosts, with fever, leukocytosis and high CRP associated with extralinal amic diseases. Two died from amic colitis ( intestinal perforation and gastrointestinal bleeding ) and three from causes unrelated amias. Treatment with metronidazole or tinazole was successful in 165 cases. Luminal treatment was provided to 83 following metronazole or tinazole treatment, but amias recurred in 6, similar to those who did not receive luminal. Recurrence was more frequent in HCV-antibody positive and those acquired syphil during follow-up. Various genotypes E. hist were identified but no correlation between genotype and clinical features. The outcome of metronazole and tinazole treatment uncomplicated amias was excellent in HIV-1 individuals. Luminal following metronazole tinid treatment does not reduce recurrence amias in high risk probably due amic re-infection.
Sleeping sickness or African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a neglected tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambi and transmitted by riverine tset species. The World Health Organization aims to eliminate the disease as a public health problem by 2020 and stop transmission by 203. In South Chad, the Mand area is a persistent focus of sleeping sickness where around 100 cases were diagnosed and treated annually until 2013. We assessed whether adding vector control to detection and treatment could further reduce transmission and consequently reduce incidence of sleeping in Mand. We investigated the impact of deploying tiny targets which attract and kill tset. Before control, a census of the population was conducted and their settlements mapped. A pre-intervention of tset distribution was implemented in November 2013 and 260 targets were deployed in riverine habitats in 2014,201 and 2016. Impact onset and sleeping was assessed through nine surveys and medical of the population in 201 and 201. Modelling was used to assess the impact ofset on incidence compared to active and passive screening. The population of 74 inhabitants lived in the vicinity of Mand. In November 201, the vector Glossina fipes fipes and mean of tse from traps was 0.7/trap (0–26 ). The of tse from sentinel traps declined after deployment with only being caught in surveys giving a mean of 0.005/trap. Modelling indicates 70.4% (51–95 ) of the reduction between 201 and 201 can be attributed to vector with the rest to medical. Tiny are estimated to have reduced dramatically with 62.8% (59–66 ) due toset and 8.5 (8–9 ) to passive.
Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the nematode Strongyloides stercoralis that is increasingly being diagnosed in non-endemic areas. This study describes the epidemiological, clinical and microbiological characteristics of patients with strongyloidias in Spain. The study included 124 cases of strongyloidis registered in the +IV Collaborative Network from 2009 to 2017. Most patients were immigrants (66.9% ) and South America was the most frequent area of origin. Detection of larvae in stool samples was observed in 21.9% of patients and serological tests made the diagnosis in the rest of cases. Eosinophilia was present in 82.2% of cases. Treatment withivermectin compared to albendazole was the most strongly associated factor to achieve cure (OR 2.34 ).
Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases. An important consideration in vaccine formulation is the inoculum, i. e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher inoculum levels generally lead to better immune stimulation but might cause more side effects and allow less coverage in presence of vaccine shortages. Determining optimal inoculum is important component of rational vaccine design. We illustrate concept using mathematical models and data to inoculum determination, by fitting model to influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mice and human parainfluenza (HPV) in rats at different inoculum. We use model to map inoculum to protection and morbidity and explore how framework might be used to determine optimal inoculum. Our framework combines models with data to study inoculum impact on important outcomes such as protection and morbidity. We show that inoculum impact protection and morbidity depend on pathogen and protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase with inoculum. Once protection and morbidity goals are specified, our framework can be used to design vaccines and determine optimal inoculum.
In multicellular filaments of the cyanobacterium Anabaena undergo a process of differentiation in response to nitrogen deprivation, resulting in a one-dimensional pattern of nitrogen-fixing heterocysts separated by photosynthetic vegetative cells. We studied the expression of hetR, a transcription factor essential for heteroc differentiation, using a chromosomally translational hetR-gfp fusion. Statistical analysis of fluorescence at the individual cell level in wild-type and mutant filaments demonstrates that fluctuations of het in nearby cells are coupled, with a spatial range of circa two to three cells, setting the scale for cellular interactions along filament. Correlations between cells arise from intercellular molecular transfer and less from division. Fluctuations after nitrogen deprivation can build on those under nitrogenplete conditions. We found that under nitrogen-rich conditions, basal expression of Het is influenced by the septal protein Sep and positive Het auto-regulation, while under nitrogen-poor conditions, Het is influenced by HetN and Sep/Fra. A comparison between het-gfp under nitrogen and nitrogen highlights differences between HetN and Het, as well as between Sep and Fra/Fra.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype has shifted from genotype III (GIII) to I (GI) in China, as demonstrated by molecular epidemiological surveillance. To confirm this shift at the seroepidemiological level, we performed a serological survey in JEV-nonvaccinated pigs and found an average GI/GIII infection ratio of 1.87, suggesting co-circulation of GI and GIII infections with GI being more prevalent in pigs. To understand the reasons for this shift, we compared the replication of seven recently-isolated JEV isolates, including three GI and four GIII strains, in C/36 cells, chicken fibroblast (DF-1) and porine iliac endothelial (PIE) cells. GI strains replicated more efficiently than GIII in DF-1 and PIE cells, particularly in DF-1 with titers 22.9–225.3 higher than GIII. This shows enhanced efficiency of GI in avian cells. To examine this efficiency in vivo, young ducklings were inoculated with GI and GIII at day post-hatching. GI-inoculated ducklings developed higher viremia and displayed longer vmic duration than GIII-inoculated ducklings. These results support the hypothesis of enhanced efficiency for GI in birds. There are 36 amino differences between GI and GIII, some of which may be responsible for the efficiency of GI in birds.
Candida albicans biofilm formation is a key aspect of its pathobiology and is regulated by an integrated network of transcription factors (CRZap1, Brg1,EFG1,N80,ROB1, and TEC1. We used a systematic genetic approach to generate all possible double heterozygous mutants of the network and quantitatively analyze the genetic interactions between them. The network is highly susceptible to perturbation with six heterozygous mutants showing alterations in biofilm formation (haploinsufficiency). In addition, many heterozygous mutants are as severely affected as homozygous deletions. The network shows properties of a highly interdependent ‘small’world’ that is efficient but not robust. Genetic data indicate that TEC is a component whose expression is sensitive to perturbations of other TFs. We also found that RO is dependent on auto-regulation and cooperative with other TFs. Finally, heterozygous N80 mutant is hyperfilous under bio and hypha-inducing in TEC-dependent.
Leishmania infantum Asparagine Synthase Is Dispensable for Parasite Survival and Infectivity. Asparagine synthase (AS) is an enzyme responsible for converting aspartate into aspar in an ATP-dependent manner using ammonia or glutamine as a nitrogen source. There are two structurally distinct forms: strictly ammonia-dependent AS-A and glutamine-dependent AS. In humans and trypanosomes, AS-A is absent, but present in trypanosomes and Leishmania donani, making it a potential drug target. Here, we demonstrate that Leishmania infantum AS uses both ammonia and glutamine as nitrogen sources. We generated AS null mutants by gene replacement in Leishmanium and observed no significant growth or infectivity defects. However, severe growth impairment was observed in aspar limiting conditions. Our results show that despite being important under aspar limitation, AS is not essential for parasite survival or infectivity in normal in vitro and in vivo conditions. Therefore, we exclude AS as a drug target against Leishium parasites.
Toxocara seropositivity is associated with an increased risk of epilepsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic review was conducted to investigate the association between Toocara serositivity and epilepsy. The review included 11 case-control studies from 13 countries, involving 1,474 subjects (215 with epilepsy and 1,259 without epilepsy ). The pooled odds ratio ( OR ) was 1.69 ( 95% CI 1.42–2.01 ), indicating a positive association between Tooc seropositivity and epilepsy. Meta-regression showed no significant association between covariates and outcome. The association was consistently reported in restricted analyses ( confirmatory, diagnostic, younger, and population-based studies ). The meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidence of a positive association between Tooc seros and epilepsy.
ATM-dependent miR-335 targets CtIP and modulates the DNA response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). ATM is a protein that plays a critical role in the cellular response to DSBs. We describe a new ATM-mediated DSB-induced DNA damage response pathway involving microRNA (miR) : ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DSBs activate ATM, which leads to the downregulation of miR-335, a miRNA that targets CtIP, a protein important for DNA end resection in homologous recombination (HR) repair. We show that CREB is responsible for a large portion of mi-335 expression by binding to the promoter of mi-335. CRE binding is greatly reduced after IR, corroborating previous studies that IR-activated ATM phosphorylates CRE to reduce its activity. Overexpression of mi-335 in HeLa cells results in reduced CtIP and post-IR survival and BRCA foci formation. Further, in patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines with post-IR survival “radiosensitive” phenotype we demonstrate elevated mi-335, reduced CtIP, and BRCA foci formation. Colony, BRCA foci, and CtIP are partially rescued by miRNA antisense AMi-335 treatment.
Mentalizing is the process of attributing mental states such as beliefs and emotions to others is a fundamental aspect of human social cognition. In this study, we tested whether sophisticated mentalizing, captured by the depth of recursive beliefs such as “I think you think I think”, influences learning in a social context. Participants played repeated games against artificial mentalizing agents with different levels of sophistication and were led to believe they were either playing against other humans or gambling in a casino. We found that participants won against the sophisticated mentalizing agents in the social framing and lost in the non-social framing. Importantly, participants’ choices were best explained by sophisticated mentalizing models only in the social framing. This is the first demonstration of the added value of mentalizing on learning in social interactions.
Biological networks are increasingly used to analyze diseases beyond traditional single variable analysis. The Gaussian Graphical Model (GM) is a probability model that characterizes the conditional dependence of a set of random variables by a graph and has applications in biological network analysis, such as inferring or comparing networks. However, existing approaches are either not statistically rigorous or inefficient for high-dimensional data with tens of thousands of variables. We propose FastGM, an efficient algorithm to estimate GM and obtain p-value and confidence for each edge in the graph. FastGM is based on a recent proposal by Ren et al. (2015). We demonstrate that FastGM is faster by several orders of magnitude than the current algorithm by Ren et. without losing accuracy. We apply FastGM to two data: transcriptomic from a childhood asthma study and proteomic from Alzheimer’s disease. We estimate gene or protein networks for disease and healthy samples. The networks reveal interactions and differential between cases and controls show relevance to diseases. FastGM is a computationally fast and statistically sound procedure for GM and high-dimensional data. It has been implemented in R package “FastGM”.
Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the basal ganglia are important for learning and executing movement sequences. Their population activity varies on slow timescales relevant to behaviour. In a model of a MS network, activity emerges only at realistic connectivities and IP sizes. We investigate how MS population activity interacts with temporally varying cortical activity, as in a task. We find that unrealistically high connectivity leads to a winners-take regime, where activity separates into stimulus dependent firing and quiescent components. In this regime, only a few components interact with cortical variations. Around a transition to a more active regime occurs, where cells switch between activity and qucence. In this regime, components wander and are independent of cortical variations. Only in this regime do changes interact with many components, so sequential assemblies are reproducibly activated for hundreds of milliseconds after onset and peri-stim time display strong and specificity. We show that this is maximized at realistic connectivities and IP sizes. Thus, the MS network has optimal characteristics. It is neither too stable to respond dynamically to variations nor too unstable to respond consistently. Rather, it is optimized to generate activity for periods after cortical excitation.
Polarized exocytosis and endocyt are two transport pathways that maintain cell polarity by transporting membrane components to specific locations on the cortex and retrieving them before they can diffuse away. We show that the Rab GTPase Sec4 couples polar exocyt with cortical actin polymerization, which induces endyt. After polar exocyt to the plasma membrane, Sec4 binds Las/Bee1 ( WASp) in complex with Sla and Sla during actin assembly. Mutations in Sec4 or its GEF Sec2 inhibit actin formation, whereas activating Sec4L accelerates assembly. In vitro assays of Arp3-dependent actin polymer established GTP-Sec4 overrides Sla inhibition of Lasp actin nucleation. These results support a model in which Sec relocates from polar exytic sites to endytic sites. Activated Sec then promotes actin polymer and triggers endyt.
Acetamin-induced liver injury in mice is a model for drug-induced liver injury in humans. Acetamin hepatotoxicity is characterized by necrosis that begins adjacent to the central vein (CV) of the hepatic lobule and progresses outward. The mechanism of this phenomenon is not well understood, but evidence suggests that differences in NAPQI (reactive metabolite ) formation within hepatic lobules are necessary and sufficient to account for it. We call this mechanism the NZech hypothesis. To challenge this hypothesis, we employed virtual hepatocytes configured to exhibit peri-portal-to-CV gradients and achieved quantitative targets for acetamin clearance and metabolism but failed to achieve the phenomenon. We posited that at least one additional feature must exhibit zonation in the CV direction. We explored two alternatives: 1 ) glutathione depletion diminishes in CV and 2 ) ability to repair diminish in CV. Inclusion of one failed to achieve the phenomenon, but inclusion of both enabled it. This merged mechanism provides a multile, multiscale explanation of key features of acetamin hepatotoxicity in mice. We discovered that variants of this mechanism provide plausible explanations for considerable variation in necrosis among 37 diverse mouse strains following a single acetamin dose.
Trypanosoma cruzi congenital infection diagnosis in infants relies on detection of parasites by microscopy and/or persistence of specific antibodies at 10–12 months of age. Parasite levels were quantified by PCR in T cruzi-infected children grouped according to one-year follow-up diagnosis: (1) Neonates diagnosed first month after delivery by microscopy (n=19) had median parasitemia 1,700/mL; (2) infants required second parasitological diagnosis at six months (n=10) showed parasitemia around 20/mL and 500/mL at 1 and 6 months; (3) babies undetectable parasitem by blood but diagnosed by specific T cruz serology at 1 year (n=22) exhibited parasitem around 5/mL 800/mL and 20/mL 6 and 12 months. Parasites were isolated by hemoculture from congenitally infected children 19 of which were genified DT Tc (former TId) and only T. This is the first to quantify parasitemia in more than 50 congenitally infected. Our results show parasite in 22 out of 51 below detection microscopy limit.
The work presents a coarse-grained biophysical model of Escherichia coli that predicts growth rate and cellular composition from an effective representation of its genome. The model assumes E coli is in a state of balanced exponential growth in a temporally and spatially constant environment with rich resources. We apply this model to measurements of growth and r-to-protein ratio for seven coli strains with rRNA copy number ranging from one to seven. These measurements show growth decreases for strains with fewer copies. The model reproduces these measurements and suggests that the fraction of macromolecules inside coli is not fixed when rRNA copy is varied. Moreover, it predicts that increasing beyond seven results in cytoplasm densely packed with ribosomes and proteins. Assuming overcrowding weakens binding affinities, it predicts growth will not increase beyond wild-type rate, consistent with experiments. Our model suggests that changing rRNA copy of coli in constant environment does not increase growth. Other observations with altered copy, such as compaction and feedback, are qualitatively consistent.
The Arabidopsis thaliana MYB transcription factor R1 (R1SM1) is a member of the MYB-related subfamily and has been implicated in plant development and stress responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the molecular mechanisms of R1 action in response to abiotic stresses remain obscure. We show that downregulation or upregulation of R1 expression alters sensitivity of seed germination and cotyled greening to abscic acid ( ABA), NaCl and mannitol in Arabidopsis. The expression of R1 is dynamically regulated by ABA and NaCl. Transcription factors ELONG HYCOTYL 5 (HY) and HYHOMOLOG (HY) regulate R1 via binding to R1 promoter. Genetic analyses reveal R1 mediates multiple functions of HY in responses seed germination postgermination to ABA and abiotic, and seedling to salinity tolerance. Pull-down and Bi assays show R1 interacts with HYHY in vitro and in vivo. R1 and HYHY may function as a module in responses A and abiotic stresses. R1 binds ABI5 promoter thereby regulating its expression, while R1 interaction stimulates HY binding to ABI.
Mitochondrial complex I is the largest and most complicated proton pump of the respiratory chain. It transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone and pumps four protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. In humans, defects in complex I are involved in a wide range of degenerative disorders. Recent structural analysis of proary and eukotic I confirmed that redox reactions are confined to the hydrophil peripheral arm and take place at a distance from the domain. This implies that the pumping within the membrane arm is driven via long conformation coupling. However, the mechanism, number, and localization of pumpites remain unclear. We report that deletion of the gene for a small subunit of the complex, a stable sub ( nbm ) is formed that lacks the distal part of the domain. Single analysis revealed that nb lacks the distal part of the domain. Our results provide evidence that the arm harbours two functionally distinct modules connected by a helical element recently identified.
In this study, we investigated the effect of fever on the binding affinity of antibodies to malaria antigens in vitro. We used isothermal titration calorimetry and ELISA to measure the binding of monoclonal antibodies to malaria antigens at 37°C, 40°C, and 42°C. We observed a marked increase in the affinity of the antibody-antigen complexes at 40°C compared to 37°C and 42°C. We also found that thermal equilibration of the protein partners at these temperatures in vitro prior to measurements increased their binding.
Actomy-based cortical flow is a fundamental for cellular morphogenesis. Cortical flows are generated by cross-linked networks of actin filaments and myosin, which produce stress by motor activity is opposed by resistance to network deformation. Continuous flow requires local remodeling through cross unbinding and/or filament disassembly. Here, we study a model for cross-linked network with motors based on minimal requirements for production and dissipation of contractile stress: Asymmetric compliance, spatial heterogeneity of motor, reversible-links and filament turnover. We characterize production and dissipation of network depend individually on cross dynamics and filament, and how these combine to determine cortical flow. Our model predicts that turnover is required to maintain stress against resistance and steady flow in response to external stress. Steady stress increases with lifetime up to τ, then decreases above τ. Effective increases with lifetime up τ, then becomes independent of lifetime and dependent on cross dynamics. These dependencies of stress and viscosity define multiple regimes of flow. Our model predicts that when lifetimes are shorter both τ and τ, dependencies of viscosity and stress on turnover cancel, such that flow is insensitive to turnover and shows simple on activity and dynamics.
Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings are sensitive to high levels of glucose and fructose in the growth medium. We identified a quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) GS11 that confers resistance to high sugar using natural variation analysis and selection. GS11 was mapped through genotyping and confirmed in near-isogenic lines in Col and C24 backgrounds. Allelism and transgenic tests showed that GS11 lies within the AN060 gene. The AN060 allele confers sugar insensitivity and is dominant over the sugar-sensitive C24 allele. Genomic and mRNA analyses showed a single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) in AN060 affects splicing such that 20 additional nucleotides are present in mRNA. This creates a stop codon resulting in a truncated AN060 lacking the transmembrane domain ( TMD ) present in C060. The absence of T results in nuclear localization of AN060. The short version of AN060 is found in ∼% of natural Arabidopsis accessions. Glucose induces GS11AN060 in a process requiring abisic acid (ABA ) signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and transient analysis showed ABI directly binds GS11AN060 to activate transcription. Interestingly, AN060 reduced ABA sensitivity and Gl-induced ABA, and ABI was also reduced in AN060 lines. Thus, sugar-ABA induces AN060, but truncated AN attenuates ABA and signaling.
Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a bacterial second messenger that regulates a wide range of behaviors, including the transition of planktonic cells to biofilm communities. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we show that c-di-G signaling gains specificity by rewiring into the Hpt regulatory cascade, which controls biofilm formation and motility. This rewiring relies on the interaction between the c-di-G synthase Hsb and the anti-sigma factor Hsb, and the dynamic localization of Hsb at the cell poles.
Visuomotor learning is the ability to learn and store multiple mappings between visual stimuli and motor responses. However, little is known about how this learning generalises to novel conditions. In this study, participants performed a rapid pointing task while visual feedback was presented with different offsets depending on the target shape. They needed to use different visomotor mappings depending on the shape to hit the target. Shapes were morphed between spiky and circular. After training, we tested performance without feedback on novel shapes. We compared two hypotheses. First, we hypothesised that participants could extract the relationship between shape and visomotor and generalise. Second, we developed a Bayesian model that predicts generalisation is consistent with categorisation. The results show that learning requires awareness of cues, but participants apply the mapping to the shape most similar to the current. The Bayesian model predicts learning slows with increased training pairs, which was confirmed. We found correspondence between the model and results, indicating it poses a mechanism for multiple visomotor learning.
Climbing fibers are one of the two main inputs to the cerebellum and are generally believed to be involved in the timing of motor commands and motor learning. Climbing fiber activation leads to all-or-none action potentials in cerebellar Purkin cells, silencing them for a brief period afterwards. Climbing fibers can transmit a burst of spikes as a result of an olivary cell spike, potentially increasing the information transferred to the cerebellum. The size of the climbing fiber burst is related to the phase of the ongoing subthreshold membrane oscillation of the oliv cell, i. e. the phase of the oscillation is reflected in the size of the fiber. We used a three-compartment model of an oliv cell to investigate the factors determining the size of the fiber. Our findings suggest that the phase dependency of the size is present but that flow between soma and dendrite is a major determinant of the fiber.
Iron is essential for all living organisms due to its redox properties. However, these properties can also lead to toxicity through the production of reactive species. The liver is the main site of iron regulation. Iron misregulation is implicated in many diseases and our understanding of metabolism improves the list of iron-related disorders. Recent developments have led to knowledge of the fate of iron in the body and a detailed map of its metabolism. However, a quantitative understanding of how components interact to produce regulation remains elusive. Here, we present a mechanistic computational model of human iron metabolism that includes core components. It was constructed on mechanisms and kinetic obtained from several publications. The model was quantitatively validated by comparing results with previously published data and was able to reproduce multiple findings. A simulation following an oral dose was compared to a clinical study and was found to recreate the dynamics and scale of the response to challenge. A disease simulation of haemochromosis was created by altering a parameter that mimics a haemromosis gene mutation. The provides a quantitative of the that arises in this disease. This model supports the role of the liver as an sensor and a framework for further modelling to identify targets and design experiments to improve this system.
Transport of molecules across the nuclear envelope (NE) is regulated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Selective transport occurs on a timescale of milliseconds and length of tens of nanometers; however, the mechanism remains elusive. Central to the process are hydrophobic interactions between karyopherins (kaps) and P-G (FG) domains. We have established a coarse-grained model of the NPC that mimics nucletoplasmic transport, taking into account the polymeric nature of FG-repeats on the NPC structure and kap-F hydrophobic affinity. The model predicts the first-passage time of a 15 nm cargo is about 2.6±.13 ms with an inverse distribution for statistically independent Brown dynamics. The cargo is primarily attached to the wall where it interacts with FG as it passes the channel. The kap-F hydroobic is highly dynamic and fast, ensuring efficient through the NPC. Almost all hydrophobic spots on are occupied during transport. In contrast, filaments-deficient NPCs show high permeability to, implying filaments in the barrier.
Determining the optimal infectious dose of a pathogen for nonhuman primate (NHP) models is a critical for testing interventions against human pathogens such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The NHP model is the best experimental model for testing designed to block infection by these pathogens. However, the model requires the use of a limiting dose of the infectious agent, where only a fraction of animals become infected upon given challenge. Determining the challenge dose of pathogen in experiments is critical to the success of the experiment: using too-high or too-low a dose may lead to false results and excessive use of animals. Here, I define a protocol for determining the dose of pathogen that infects 50% of the time (ID50%); other doses, e. g. ID80, can be easily calculated from same data. This protocol minimizes number of animals as well as resources, while providing estimate of ID50 within 1.5 of true.

Prions are infectious proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Previous studies have shown that the mammalian prion protein (PrP) polybasic domains bind the disease-associated prion PrSc, suggesting that these domains of cellular prion protein (PC) serve as docking sites for PrSc during prion propagation. To examine the role of polybasic domains in the context of full-length PC, we used prion proteins lacking one or both polybasic domains expressed from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as substrates in serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) reactions. After ∼5 rounds of PM, PrSc lacking the central poly domain (Δ) were formed. Surprisingly, in contrast to wild-type prions, Δ-PrSc prions could bind and induce conversion of the poly domain mutant substrates into PrSc molecules. Remarkably, Δ-PrSc and poly domain PrSc displayed diminished or absent biological infectivity relative to wild Pr, despite ability to seed PM reactions of mouse brain homogen. These results suggest that Δ-Pr prions interact with PC through a novel mechanism, yielding expanded substrate and efficient Pr propagation. Furthermore, poly domain deficient Pr provide the first example of dissociation between brain homogen PM seeding from biological infectivity.
Animals are able to reach a desired state in an environment by controlling various behavioral patterns. To understand how animals make decisions and how the nervous system processes information, it is important to identify the behavioral strategies used for control. However, methods to quantify such strategies have not been fully established. In this study, we developed an inverse-learning ( IRL ) framework to identify an’s strategy from behavioral data. We applied this framework to C. elegans thermactic behavior after cultivation at constant temperature or without food, fed worms preferred, while starved worms avoided temperature on a thermal gradient. Our IRL revealed that fed worms used both temperature and its derivative and their involved two strategies: directed ( DM ) and isothermal ( IM ). DM efficiently reached specific temperatures explaining thermactic behavior when fed. IM moved along constant reflecting isothermal well-observed in previous. In contrast, starved worms escaped temperature using only, not the derivative of. We investigated the underlying strategies by applying to thermens neuron-deficient worms. Our I-based is useful in identifying from behavioral data and could be to a range of, including in other.
Chrychromina tobin is a species of alga that belongs to the order Prymiales (Haptophyceae ). It is an important player in aquatic ecosystems due to its role in carbon sequestration, formation of harmful blooms, and as a food source of fatty acids for a wide range of species. Chrychromina to is a mixotrophic alga, meaning it can obtain nutrients from both photosynthesis and heterotrophy. Despite its importance, the nuclear genome of only one alga, Emilian hleyi (Isochryales ) has been sequenced. Here, we report the draft genome of Chrychromina and transcript data collected over 24 hours. The genome is 59 Mb in size, 40% of which is protein coding and encodes 16, 777 genes. Genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, modification and catabolism show distinct expression patterns over the circadian photoperiod. The genome encodes a hybrid polyketide synth/nonribosomal synthase complex, anti-microbial peptides, and proteins involved in multidrug and toxic compound extrusion. A new alga xorhodopsin was identified together with two RuBisCOases shared across algal lineages.
Breast cancers that lack estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are classified as triple-negative and belong to the Basal molecular subtype. Basal-like breast cancers are associated with mutations in the BRCA1 and TP53 genes. Our studies in mice show that inactivation of BRCA1 and TP53 is sufficient to suppress normal cell death in the mammary epithelium. Furthermore, concomitant inactivation of all three pathways in the mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant metastatic adenocarcinomas. These tumors are poorly differentiated and have histologic features common to human BRCA-mutated tumors, including heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia and necrosis. Gene expression analyses show that these tumors share attributes of both Bas-like and Claudin-low signatures, two subtypes encompassed by the broader triple-negative class defined by clinical markers.
Aedes aegypt (L.) is the primary vector of dengue virus, the most important arboiral disease globally. Until an effective vaccine is licensed and rigorously administered, Ae.egypt control remains the principal tool in preventing and curtailing deng transmission. Accurate predictions of vector populations are required to assess methods and develop effective reduction strategies. Aeegy develops primarily in artificial water containers. Release studies indicate that adult Aeegy do not disperse over long distances. Therefore, containers in an area of high development density are likely to be ovip sites and frequently used ovip than that are relatively isolated from other sites. After accounting for container characteristics, frequently used ovip are likely to produce mosquitoes at a higher rate. Most studies Aeeg populations ignore the density of larval sites. Pupal surveys were carried out from 2004 to 2007 in rural Kameng Phet, Thailand. In total, 84, samples of water containers were used to estimate parameters. Regression was used to assess the effect of lar development density, access to water, and seasonal variation on productivity. A varying model was employed to account for differences between container types. A two modeling, called hurdle, accounts for zeroes and overdispersion in counts. The number of sites and their density were primary determinants of Aeeg distribution and abundance. Productivity increased as density. An ecological accounting for density is appropriate for Aeeg levels and programs.
In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the conserved Target of Rapamycin complex 2 ( TOR2 ) mediates gut-to-brain signaling in the regulation of phenotypic plasticity. TOR2 acts in the intestine to regulate the expression of daf-7 and daf-28 peptides, which reflect bacterial-dependent feeding status. These peptides promote a binary decision between growth and entry into the dauer larval stage in response to pherom, food, and temperature. In the adult, TOR2 acts in the intestine to modulate food-regulated foraging via the PDF-2/PDF-1 neuropeptide pathway. We find that genetic variation affects food-dependent larval and adult phenotypes, and identify quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) associated with these traits. These results suggest that TOR2 acts as a hub for communication of feeding information from the gut to the brain, thereby modulating neuronal function by state.
Understanding the transcriptional regulation of embryonic stem (ES) cells is fundamental for efforts to direct their differentiation and reprogramming. We analyzed the transcriptional profiles of mouse ES cells and primordial germ cells, identifying genes upregulated in pluripotent cells in vitro and in vivo. These genes are involved in transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair. We developed Compoby, a novel algorithm combining aligned and non-aligned sequences with a probabilistic segmentation model to predict short DNA motifs regulating expression. Compoby was used to identify conserved motifs in pluripotent genes. We show these motifs are active in undifferentiated ES and embryonic germ cells in a sequence-specific manner, acting as enhancers with an endogenous promoters. Importantly, their activity is conserved in human ES. We show transcription factor NF-Y binds one motif, differentially expressed during ES differentiation, required for ES proliferation.
Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a non-segmented negative-strand RNA virus that replicates through the continuous supply of nucleoprotein (N) in the form of a complex with phosphoprotein (P). Here, we present the structural characterization of a soluble heterodimer complex between a variant of SV lacking its N-terminal residues (ΔN21) and a peptide of 60 amino acids (P60) encompassing the molecular recognition element (RE) of P that binds RNA-free N. The complex crystallized in decameric form was solved at 3.0 Å resolution, revealing how RE folds upon binding to N and competes with RNA binding and polymerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering and NMR spectroscopy on the complex confirm binding of RE and indicate its flanking regions remain flexible. The structure of this complex suggests a mechanism for initiation of viral RNA synthesis.
In the fly visual system, the vertical system (VS) is a network of cells that plays a key role in processing visual information. These cells primarily connect to each other via axonal gap junctions, a type of electrical synapse. This provides a unique opportunity to explore the role of gap junctions in sensory processing. Our analysis of a realistic VS model shows that within 10 ms of visual input onset, gap junctions enable the system to efficiently encode the axis of rotation, θ, of the fly’s motion. This efficiency is near-optimal with respect to physical limits determined by the input’s statistical structure. The network is connected to downstream pathways via a subset of VS cells; we found that gap junctions make this subpopulation’s encoding of θ superior to the whole network and robust to a range of signal to noise ratios. This subpopulation’s efficient encoding is necessary for the fly’s visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers. Because gap junctions are among VS axons, they only impact the system’s readout while maintaining dendritic input. Our study shows how specific connectivity leads to efficient encoding of stimuli.
Enterovirus 71 (EV) is a major causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease, a common febrile disease in children. EV has also been associated with severe neurological diseases including fatal cases in large EV outbreaks in Asia. Recently, PSGL-1 was identified as a cellular receptor for entry and replication of EV in leukocytes. PS-1 is a sialucylated on the surface of leukocytes and serves as a high affinity counterceptor for selectins, mediating leukocyte rolling on endothelium. The PS-1–select interaction requires sulfation of at least one of three tyrosines and adjacent O-gcan sial Lewis in N-terminal of PS-1. To elucidate the molecular basis of PS-–71 interaction, we generated PS- mutants and identified postlational modifications critical for PS binding to EV. We expressed PS- in 293 cells and transfected cells were assayed for their abilities to bind EV by flow cytometry. We found O-glycosylation T, critical for PS–select interaction, is not necessary for PS binding to EV. On the other hand, site-directed mutagenesis one or more tyrosine sulfation in N-terminal PS significantly impaired PS binding to EV. Furthermore, inhibitor of sulf, sodium, blocked PS–EV interaction and PS-mediated replication EV in Jurkat cells in dose-dependent manner.
Leishmanias is a global health problem that affects millions of people worldwide. Current treatments for leishiasis are limited by toxicity and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have been shown to exert anti-parasitic effects. This study tested the therapeutic efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in controlling Leishmania major infection. Rapamycin, G-2128 and K-379 were administered to BAL/c mice that received an intrafoot injection of the parasite. Foot swelling and parasite burden were assessed, and cytokine production by splenocytes and phenotypic changes in draining lymph nodes were evaluated. Treatment with clinically relevant doses of rapycin or G-212, but not K-379 dramatically lowered foot swelling and parasite burden in draining nodes. Importantly, rapycin did not kill promastigotes in vitro. Moreover, IL-4 production of splenocytes from mice treated with rapycin was reduced. Consequently, IFNγ:IL-4 ratio was elevated, suggesting a Th1-skewed cytokine profile. Finally, expression of CD, an activation marker on splenic and node CD+ CD+ T cells was enhanced in rapycin-treated mice. Our findings suggest mTOR inhibitors may be used in leishias management. We propose beneficial effects stem from immunomodulatory properties.
Natural transformation is the process by which competent bacteria take up free DNA and incorporate it into their genomes, becoming genetically transformed. To prevent deleterious transformation by foreign DNA, several species preferentially take up their own DNA containing specific DUS (DNA uptake sequence) marks. We show that ComP is the long sought D receptor in Neisseria species, enabling functional analysis of the D-Com interdependence. In Neisseria meningidis, abolishing ComP enhances transformation in the presence of DUS and controls transformation in absence of D. Peripheral DUS bases are less important, while inner bases are essential since single mutations dramatically impair interaction with Com and transformation. Strikingly, naturally occurring D variants in Neisser commals differing from D by one or two bases are similarly impaired for transformation. We show Com from N sub commal binds cognate D variant and mediates D-enhanced transformation in com mutant N meningidis, confirming similar mechanism used by Neisser to promote own or closely related DNA.
In fission yeast, cell division requires the coordinated closure of the contractile actomyos ring (CAR) and formation of the septum, a specialized cell wall structure. While many CAR proteins have been identified, how they interact with septum enzymes to form the septum remains unclear. Our study shows that cooperation between the paxillin homolog Pxl, required for CAR integrity, and Bgs, the enzyme responsible for linear (1, 3) glucan synthesis and septum formation, is required for stable anchorage of CAR to the plasma membrane before septation and cleavage. We show that lack of Pxl in combination with Bgs depletion causes failure of ring contraction and cell overgrowth towards the lumen without sept formation. We also show that Pxl concentration at CAR increases during cytokinesis and this depends on the SH domain of the protein Cdc15. Bgs depletion in cells carrying cdcΔ3 allele causes ring disassembly and sept block, as in cells lacking Pxl. On the other hand, Pxl absence is lethal when C15 function is affected, generating large CAR with septum deposition along the cortex. Our findings indicate that CAR anchorage to plasma through C15 and Pxl, conitant Bgs activity are necessary for CAR and sept formation in yeast.
Glanders is a highly infectious zoonotic disease caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia malle that can cause severe disease in animals and humans. Although eradicated in many countries, it has recently emerged in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and South America. We investigated a recent outbreak of glanders in Bahrain by applying high resolution genotyping ( multiple locus variable number of tandem repeats, MLVA ) and whole genome sequencing to B. malle isolated from infected horses and camels. The results were compared to samples from an outbreak in the United Arab Emirates in 2004 and placed into a broader phylogeographic context based on previously published B. malle data. The samples from the outbreak in Bahrain separated into two distinct clusters, suggesting a complex epidemiological background and involvement of multiple B. malle strains. The samples from Bahrain were more closely related to B. malle isolated in the UAE in 2004 than other. malle, suggesting repeated importation to the region from similar sources.
American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) is a disease that causes approximately 67,000 new cases per year. The severity of the disease depends on the parasite; however, in the majority of cases confirmation is not feasible. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that ACL is produced by Leishmania braziliensis, and the first line treatment are pentavalent ant derivatives (Glucime or Stibogluconate ) under systemic administration. According to authors, pentavalent ant derivatives treatment for ACL show a healing rate of 75% and reasons for treatment failure are not known. In order to characterise the clinical and parasitological features of patients with ACL that did not respond to Glucime, a cross-sectional study was carried out in a cohort of 43 patients recruited in three Colombian National reference centers for ACL. Clinical and paraclinical, epidemiological and geographic information were recorded for each. Parasitological, histological and PCR confirmation were performed. Glucime IC50 and in vitro infectivity for isolated were estimated. Predominant infecting Leish species was L brazili (95% ) and 35% of parasites showed significant decrease in vitro Gluc susceptibility associated with administration medic. Lesion and infect of parasite are negatively correlated with Gluc susceptibility (Spearman: -0,548 and -0,726; ) A negative correlation between lesion and parasite is documented. brazili was main species associated with patients that underwent treatment failure or relapse.
In this study, we investigated the interplay between the biosynthetic pathways of siderophores and colactin in Escheria coli. Siderophores are iron-scavenging molecules and colactin is a genotoxin. Both pathways require 4′-osphopantin transferase (PTase). Only two PTases have been identified: Ent and Clb. Ent is part of the core genome, whereas Clb is encoded on a pathogenic island. The island is associated with the pathogenic island (PI) in highly virulent strains. PI carries genes for yiniactin synthesis except the cognate PT. We demonstrated that Clb can contribute to siderores synthesis. Inactivation of both Ent and Clb abolished virulence of extra-intestinal pathogenic E coli (Ex) in mouse sepsis model. Either Ent or Clb is required for Ex survival in vivo. This is the first report of multiple PT pathways leading to distinct metabolites in a microorganism. We hypothesize that association of island with PI has been selected in highly virulent coli because Clb is promisc PT that contributes to genotoxin and siderores. The data highlight complex interaction of virulence with functions.
Probabilistic Phylogen Inference with Insertions and Deletions is a probabilistic model for phylogenetic inference that accounts for insertions and deletions in addition to substitutions. The model is based on a continuous-time Markov process and a non-reversible birth–death evolutionary model for insertions and deletions. The model assumes that insertions and deletions occur one residue at a time. The model is applied to phylogen inference by extending the program dnaml in phyl.
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infects the skin by initially infecting the mucosal epidermis prior to entering nerve endings. In the skin, epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) are the first dendritic cells (DCs) to encounter HSV, but it is CD103+ dermal DCs that carry viral antigen to lymph nodes for presentation, suggesting DC cross-talk in the skin. In this study, we compared topically HSV-1 infected human skin explants with biopsies of human genital herpes lesions to show that LCs are initially infected and emigrate into the dermis. Here, LC bearing markers of maturation and apoptosis formed large clusters with BD3+ dermal DC (thought to be equivalent to murine CD+ dermal DC ) and DC-S+ DC/macages. HSV-expressing LC were observed inside dermal DC/macages and BD3 dermal DC had upregulated damaged uptake receptor CLEC9. No other epidermal cells interacted with dermal DC. Correspondingly, LC isolated from skin and infected with HSV-1 in vitro underwent apoptosis and were taken by BD3 dermal DC and DC+ cells. Thus, we conclude a viral relay takes place where infected LCs undergo apoptosis and are taken by dermal DC for antigen presentation. This provides rationale for targeting these cells with mucosal or intradermal immunization.
Leishmania parasites are obligate intracellular protozoan pathogens that cause leishmaniasis in humans and animals. In this study, we investigated the biogenesis of parasitophorous vacuoles ( PVs ) in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with Leishmania major or L amazonensis amastigotes. We found that PVs housing one or two L. major amastotes are small and tight-fitting, while PVs housing many L amazon amastotes are large and giant. We used multidimensional imaging of live cells to compare PV biogenesis in macrophages infected with L. major or L amazon amastotes and loaded with Lotracker, a lysosotropic fluorescent probe. Three features of L major PVs were documented: i ) entry of Lotr into tight-fitting L major PVs; ii ) decrease in number of macrophage vesicles during major PV fission; iii ) PV remodeling after homotypic fusion. In contrast, amazon PVs were characterized by ii ) decrease in number of macroage vesicles during PV enlargement; iii ) PV remodeling after homotyp fusion. Multidimensional imaging allowed us to update our understanding of Leish species-specific differences in PV biogenesis and could be useful for study of other intracellular microorganisms.
Chromatin Structure Regulates Homologous Recombination and Gene Conversion. Homologous recombination is a powerful mechanism for maintaining and altering genomic structure. We investigated how chromatin contributes to the use of homologous sequences as donors for repair in the chicken DT40 cell line. Immunoglobulin genes undergo sequence diversification by gene conversion templated by pseudogene donors. We found that immunoglobulin V pseudogene is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin. We demonstrated the importance of chromatin for conversion using a regulatable system in which heterochromatin protein HP1 (Drosophila melanogaster Su), expressed as fusion Escheria coli repressor, is tethered to polymerase integrated within pseudoλ array. Tether HP diminished histone acetylation within pseudoλ, and altered outcome V diversification so templated mutations rather than templated predominated.
The cerebellum plays a crucial role in adjusting motor behavior in response to changing situations. It has been assumed that cerebellar motor learning is guided by the difference between desired and actual behavior, i. e., by error. Not only immediate but also future behavior benefits from error because it induces lasting changes in parallel synapses on Purkin cells ( PCs ), whose output mediates behavioral adjustments. Olivary climbing fibers, connecting PCs, are thought to transport information on errors for synaptic modification but do not contribute to memory. In this study, we tested monkeys in a saccadic learning paradigm that challenges this concept. We demonstrate a clear spike signature of error at time of occurrence and a reverberation of this signature later before new behavior manifestation to improve.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective loss of motor neurons and inclusions containing the RNA binding protein TDP-43. In this study, we used a yeast model of ALS exhibiting T-43 dependent toxicity to show that overexpression of T-43 dramatically alters cell shape and reduces ubiquitin dependent proteolysis of a reporter. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of the chaperone S1 reduces T-43’s effect on toxicity and proteolysis. The strength of these effects was influenced by the presence of the endogenous prion [+]. Overexpression of S1 altered T-43 pattern, but we did not detect association of S1 with T-43, suggesting indirect effects on T- aggregation. Overexpression of the mammalian S1 homologue DNA1 relieved T- mediated toxicity in rodent cortical neurons, suggesting S1 and homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS.
Chagas disease is a major public health issue in many Latin American countries. Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi ( T. cruzi ) transmitted by triatomine bugs. In this study, we investigated the parasite load and molecular diversity of T. cruzi in patients with chronic Chagas disease from different regions of Brazil. We used multilocus PCR and quantitative real time PCR ( qPCR ) to perform molecular typing and parasite quantification from blood specimens of 65 patients. All patients were recruited at the same health center, but from different geographic regions of Brazil. Of 35 ( 53. 8% ) patients presented positive amplification by qPCR, 20 ( 30. 7% ) had indeterminate form and 15 ( 23. 1% ) cardiac form. The median parasite load for all positive patients was 2.54 [ 1.43–11.14 parasite/mL, ranging from 0.12 to 153.66. Notably, parasite load was higher in patients over 70 years (20.05 [18–86.29 parasite/mL ). We genotyped T cruzi in spiked blood samples with reference strains from six DTUs to 0.5 parasite/mL with high specificity. Of positive qPCR patients, we identified T cruz DT in 28 (80% ). Remaining 20% had partial result. Specimens showed Tc, TII and mixed Tc prevalence equal 40%,17.1% and 14.3% respectively. Two patients were infected Tc and one coinfected TIIIc+VI. These patients were in chronic chag cardiomyopathy (CCC ) and from Bahia northeast Brazil. T cruz genotypes were compared with load, elevated loads in TII (7.56 parasite/mL ) compared to TVI (2.35/mL ). However, CCC was 50% in TII and only 16.7% TII evolved CCC.
Between 2009 and 2011, enhanced rabies surveillance was conducted in Guatemala as part of a larger pathogen detection program. A total of 672 bats from 31 species were sampled and tested for rabies. The prevalence of rabies virus (RV) among collected bats was 0. 3%. Viral antigens were detected and virus isolated from the brains of two common vampire bats (Desmodus rotus). RV was also isolated from oral swabs, lungs, and kidneys of both bats, whereas viral RNA was detected in all tissues by hemi-nested RT-PCR except the liver of one. Sequencing of the nucleoprotein showed both viruses were 100% identical, whereas sequencing the glycoprotein revealed one nonsynonymous (302S). The vampire RV isolates in this study were phylogenetically related to viruses associated with vampire bats in eastern Mexico and El Salvador. Additionally, 7% of sera from 398 bats demonstrated RV neutralizing antibody. The proportion of seropositive bats varied across troph guilds, suggestive of intraspecific compartmentalization of RV perpetuation.
Lamin A is known to play a role in the regulation of chromatin structure and transcriptional activity. In this report, we show that lamin also plays a role in the downregulation of heterochatin and gene activation. Herpes virus initiates replication near the edge of the nucleus and histones are excluded from these structures. We examined HSV infection in wild-type and lamin-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In lamin-deficient cells, viral compartments are reduced in size and fail to target the periphery as in wild-type cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies show that HSV is associated with heterochatin in lamin-deficient MEFs. These results argue for a role of lamin in viral expression, replication, and growth. Lamin is required for targeting viral genome and reduction of heterochatin on viral promoters during lytic infection. The lamin can serve as scaffold for DNA and protein that regulate both euchatin and heterochatin modifications.
Mitochondria originated from proteobacterial endosymbionts and their transition to organelles was tightly linked to the establishment of protein import pathways. The initial import of proteins is mediated by the transloc of the outer (TOM). Although TOM is common to all forms of mitochondria, unexpected diversity of subunits between eukotic lineages has been predicted. Here we analysed the TOM in hydrogenosomes, a metabolically anaerobic form of mitochond found in the excav Trichomonas vaginal. We demonstrate that highly divergent β-bar T vaginal TOM (Tv)40 forms translocation channel to hydrogenosomal import. Tv40 is present in high weight complexes and analysis revealed presence of tailored (TA) proteins. Two of them Tom36 and Tom46 with heat protein (H) and tetratopeptide (PR) domains bind hydrogenosomal proteins and likely function as receptors. A third unit Tom22 protein has short domain and conserved transmembrane but lacks domain The fourth protein hydrogenosomal outer protein19 (Hom) has no homology. Our data indicate TvOM associated sorting assembly (SAM) that in β-bar assembly. Visualisation TvOM by microscopy that forms three and has shape.
Autoimmune diseases are often result from inappropriate or inadequate activation of CD4 and CD8 T cells. Genetic studies of disease-associated polymorphisms have highlighted the importance of biological context for regulatory variants in understanding the immune system and its cellular phenotypes. Here, we show cell-specific regulation of transcript levels of genes associated with autoimmune diseases in CD4 and CD8 T cells, including a trans-acting locus at chr12q13. 2 containing the rs1017 SNP in R26 gene. We also identify a missense variant in IL27 associated with type 1 diabetes that results in decreased protein activity and expression of downstream IR1 and STAT in CD T cells. Our results indicate eQ mapping in purified cells provides novel insights into polymorphisms and pathways with autoimmune.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), sleeping sickness (African trypanosomiasis, HAT) is a major public health problem. In the provinces of Bandu and Kasa Oriental, which are lagging behind in HAT elimination efforts, we conducted a qualitative study to understand the socio-economic and cultural barriers to H screening and treatment. We interviewed current and former H patients, as well as healthcare providers and program managers of the national H control program. Our results show that community members and health workers quote a number of taboos that must be respected for six months after H treatment: no work, no sex, no food, and no sun. Violating these taboos is believed to cause serious and sometimes deadly complications. These taboos are well-known by the community and lead people to avoid H screening for fear of observing them in case of diagnosis. The tabos were originally aimed to mitigate the adverse effects of the melarsop regimen, but are not evidence-based and obsolete with new drugs.
Since December 2009, Médecins Sans Frontières has diagnosed and treated patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Tabarak Hospital, eastern Gedare State, one of the main foci of VL in Sudan. We conducted an exhaustive door-to-door survey in 45 villages of Alure locality to estimate VL incidence. The survey was conducted between 5th May and 17th June 2011. All deaths were investigated by verbal autopsies. Individuals with (i) fever at least two weeks, (ii) VL diagnosed and treated in previous year, (iii) clinical suspicion post-kala-azar der leishiasis (PKDL) were referred to medical teams for ascertainment. A new VL case was clinical with positive rk39 rapid test or direct agglutination test (DAT). In 45 villages screened, 17,702 households were interviewed for population 94,369. The crude mortality over mean period 409 days was 0.13/10 people per day. VL was possible probable cause for 19% deaths. VL mortality was estimated 0.9/100 per year. The teams examined 551 individuals for fever at least weeks. Of these,16 were diagnosed primary VL. The incidence over year was 7.0/100 persons or 7.9 when deaths possibly due were included. Overall 12.5% (11,943,609) reported past VL episode.
Bacterial chromosomes are compacted into a supercoiled structure by the enzyme gyrase in an ATP-dependent reaction. The supercoiling density ( σ ) of prokaryotic DNA occurs in two forms: diffusible (D ) and constrained (C ). Diffible supercoils move freely around the chromosome in 10 kb domains, while constrained supercoils result from abundant proteins that bend, loop, or unwind DNA at many sites. Diffible and constrained supercoils contribute equally to total in vivo supercoiling in wild-type cells, so σ=σ+σ. Unexpectedly, Escherichia coli has a 15% higher σ than Salmonella enterica. We analyzed Salmonella strains using a 9 kb supercoil sensor inserted at ten positions around the genome. The sensor contains a Lac operon flanked by resolvase binding sites and monitors supercoiling and elongation in WT and mutant strains. Transcription causes supercoiling to increase upstream and decrease downstream of highly expressed genes. Excess supercoiling is relaxed by Top I and gyrase replenishes superco to maintain equilibrium. Strains with gyrase mutations at permissive exhibit superco varying from 30% WT to total σ at most locations. Supercoils are influenced by transcription because rifampic causes superco to rebound throughout chromosome. Gyrase mutants cause superco also reduce elongation throughout genome.
Leishmania amazonensis is an intracellular protozoan parasite that replicates in parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs), which share features with late endosomes/lysosomes. During infection, PVs expand but the impact of PV size on parasite intracellular survival is unknown. We show that host cells infected with L. amazon upregulate LYSTBe, which regulates lysosome size. Mutations in LYSTBe caused PV expansion and enhanced L amazonensis replication. In contrast, LYSTBe overexpression led to small PVs that did not sustain parasite growth. Treatment of LYSTBe overexpressing cells with vacolin reversed this phenotype, expanding PV and promoting growth. The opposite was seen with E-64, which reduced PV in LYSTBe mutant and inhibited amazonensis. Enlarged PV protect parasites from oxidative damage since inhibition of nitric synth had no effect on amazon within PV, but enhanced within LYSTBe-induced smalls.
Mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT) gene are associated with Allan-Herndonudley syndrome (AHDS), an X-linked disorder characterized by delayed development, severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, spastic paraplegia, and disturbed thyroid hormone (TH) parameters. In order to determine the pathophysiological mechanisms of AH, we generated M8 mutant zebraf using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)-mediated gene editing. Elimination of M8 decreased TH expression; however, it did not affect expression of other TH-related genes. Similar to patients, M8− larvae exhibited neurological and behavioral deficiencies. High-throughput behavioral assays demonstrated M− larvae exhibited reduced locomotor activity, altered response to light and dark transitions and increased sleep. These behavioral deficiencies were associated with expression myelin genes and neuron deficiencies in circuit formation. Time-lapse imaging of single-axon arbors and synapses in M− larvae revealed reduction in filopodia and axon branching in sensory neurons and synaptic density in motor neurons. These phenotypes enable assessment of therapeutic potential TH analogs that enter cells in absence M8. TH analogs restored myelin and axon outgrowth in− larvae. These findings suggest mechanism by which M regulates neural assembly mediating sensory and motor behavioral performance.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous virus that causes disease in newborns and immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients. The virus infects a variety of cell types using different entry pathways that involve forms of the g/g glycoprotein: g/gL/g and g/gUL-131 as well as the fusion glycoprotein g. However, the minimal core machinery for cell fusion is g/g and g. Here, we demonstrate that CMV g and g/g form a stable complex after synthesis in the absence of other proteins. g/g can interact with mutants unable to mediate cell fusion. The g/g complexes as much as 16–50% of total g in CM virus particles. In contrast, small amounts of g/g and gUL-131 complexes found with. All herpesviruses express g and g/g molecules. Most herpesviruses suggest g/g interacts to mediate fusion, although there is no evidence. For herpes simplex (HSV-1) has suggested that after binding g/g binds to either before or coincident with fusion. Our results have implications for these models demonstrating that CM g and g form g complexes are incorporated virions without receptor or fusion.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is known to segregate in a tissue-specific manner, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The segregation of pathogenic mtDNA is a major determinant of the onset and severity of disease. Here, we demonstrate that Gimap, an outer membrane GTPase, is a critical regulator of this process in leukocytes. G3 is important for cell development and survival, suggesting that leukocyte survival may be a factor in the regulation of mtDNA variants and modulation of mitochondrial diseases.
Buruli ulcer (BU) is a geographically restricted infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The incubation period of BU is difficult to estimate globally as most patients reside in endemic regions. However, in Victoria, Australia, a significant proportion of people acquire BU are visitors to endemic regions. We estimated the incubation period of BU on the Bellarine peninsula to be 4. 5 months. Since then, cases on the Bellarine have declined but a new endemic has developed on the Morning peninsula. We retrospectively reviewed 443 cases of BU in Victoria between 2013 and 2016. Telephone interviews were performed to identify cases with a visit to endemic or multiple visits within one month. The incubation was defined as time between exposure and symptom. Data were combined with cases from 2002 to 201. Among 20 cases in short visitors, the incubation was 143 days (4.8 ), similar to 135 (4.5 ). This was despite predominant location shifting from Bell to Morning. We found no association between incubation and age, sex, exposure, duration or location lesion. Our study confirms incubation of BU in Victoria to be 4–5 months.
Toxoplas is an intracellular parasite that possesses a protein containing the phylogenetically conserved sterol-sensing domain (SSD). We investigated the role of this protein in lipid regulation in the parasite. The protein is a Niemann-Pick type 1-related protein (NPC1) with significant identity to human NPC1 and contains residues implicated in human disease. We named this protein TgCR. TCR localizes to flattened vesicles beneath the plasma membrane of Tooplas and lacks endosomal targeting signals. When expressed in mammalian NPC mutant cells and addressed to endo-lysosomes, TCR restores cholesterol and GM1 clearance from these organel. We genetically disrupted TCR in Tooplas. Quantitative lipid analyses reveal normal cholesterol but overaccumulation of cholesteryl esters, sphingomyins and ceramides. ΔCR parasites are characterized by abundant lipid storage bodies and membranous tubules from parasitoph vacoles. They generate multiple daughters per mother at high frequencies and are more virulent in mice than parental.
Ophthalmic syndrome, also known as Waardenburg anophthalmia, is a rare congenital disorder characterized by bilateral anophthalmia and postaxial oligodactyly. We report the identification of homozygous mutations in SMOC ( SPARC-related calcium binding 1 ) in eight unrelated families. The mutations include four nonsense, two frameshift, and two missense. The missense mutations are located in the Thyrogulin-1 ( T1 ) domain of the protein. The mouse ortholog, Smoc, shows stage-specific expression during eye, limb, craniofacial, and somite development. We also report a targeted gene-trap of Smoc ( Sm1tm1 ) that reduces mRNA to ∼10% of wild-type levels. This results in highly penetrant hindlim postaxial oligodactly in homozyg mutant ( Sm1tm1/t1 ) animals. Eyeformations, most coloma and cleft palate occur in a proportion of Sm1tm1/t1 embryos and pups. Loss of SM-1 results in a convincing phenocopy of the disease. SM-1 is a mammalian paralog of Drosophila Pentone, an inhibitor of decapentapleg. The ortholog in Xenopus, Sm- also functions as BMP antagonist in early embryogenesis. Loss of BMP antagon during mammalian development provides a plausible explanation for both limb and eye phenotypes in humans and mice.
Type 1 interferons inhibit HIV replication by inducing the tripartite motif protein TR22 (TR22). TR22 is one of the most strongly upregulated genes in cells treated with interferon. TR22 inhibits HIV replication as shown in previous studies. To assess the role of TR22 under natural conditions, we compared the effects of interferon in cells depleted for TR22 using RNAi and found that HIV release was significantly increased in knockdown, indicating TR22 acts as a natural antiviral effector. TR22 inhibited budding of virus particles containing Gag only, indicating G was the target of TR22. TR did not block release of MLV or EIA G particles. Inhibition was associated with diffuse cytoplasmic staining of G rather than accumulation at the plasma, suggesting TR disrupts proper trafficking. Mutational analyses of TR22 showed that catalytic amino acids Cys and Cys of the R domain are required for TR22 antiral activity.
Mutualisms are interspecific interactions in which both players benefit, but explaining their maintenance is problematic because cheaters should outcompete cooperative conspecifics, leading to mutualism instability. In figs ( Ficus ) are pollinated by host wasps (Agonidae), whose larvae gall in their fruits (syconia). Female pollinating wasps ovip directly into Ficus ovules from inside receptive sycon. Across Ficus species, there is a documented segregation of pollinators in inner ovules and seeds in outerules. This suggests wasps, or are prevented from ovipiting, and this results in mutualism. However, mechanisms preventing was from exploiting outerules remain unknown. We report that Ficus rubosa offspring in outerules are vulnerable to parasitic wasps ovip from outside sycon. Parasism decreases towards centre of sycon, innerules provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring. We suggest that resulting in viability likely contributes to selection pollin to avoid outer, and was to focus on subset, reduces galling.
Plant growth is a complex trait that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors and has a significant impact on plant architecture and biomass. We performed six controlled experiments on an interspecific Setaria italica x Setaria viridis recombinant inbred population to assess how plant architecture is influenced by developmental time, water availability, and density. Plant height was measured non-destructively throughout the life cycle in both field and controlled environments. We found that height is reduced under water limitation and high density and affected by environment ( field vs. chamber ). The results support a model where height is a heritable, polygenic trait and major loci that influence height independent of environment. The contribution of loci that influence height changes throughout development and reduction in water environments is a consequence of delayed progression of the program that establishes height in Setaria. In this population, alleles from the weedy S. viridis parent increase height early, whereas a number of small alleles from domesticated S. itica increase height later in development.
Ilus Isolation of Ilus Virus in the Pantanal, West-Central Brazil. The Pantanal wetlands in western Brazil are home to a large number of species of wildlife and hematophagous arthropods, which favor the circulation of zoonotic arboviruses. A previous study in the Nhecolând sub-region of Pant reported serological evidence of flaviviruses, including West Nile virus and Ilus virus ( ILHV ). According to seropositive horses, at least three flaviruses, including ILHV, circulated in the Pant between 2005 and 2009. To extend this study, we collected 3, 234 adult mosquitoes of 16 species in 2009 and 201 in the same region. Mosquito homogenates were assayed for virus on C/36 and Vero cellolayers and tested for flaviral RNA by group-specific real-time RT-PCR. One pool of 50 non-enged female Aedes aegypti tested positive for ILHV by culture and for IL RNA by real RTPCR, indicating a minimum infection rate of 2.5 per 100. Full genomic sequence exhibited 95% identity to only genome available ILHV.
Scabies is one of the most commonest dermatological conditions worldwide and a major public health burden. Current treatments with topical agents and oral ivermectin (IVM) are insufficient and drug resistance is emerging. Moxidin (MO), with advantageous pharmacological profiles, may be a promising alternative. In this study, 12 pigs were randomly assigned to receive oral MO (0. 3mg/kg once ), IV (0.2mg twice ) or no treatment. We evaluated efficacy by mite count, clinical lesions, pruritus and ELISA-determined anti-S. scieiG antibodies. Plasma and pharmacokinetic profiles were determined. At 14 post-treatment, all MO-treated but only IV-treated were mite. MO efficacy was 100% and unchanged until study-end (47 ) compared 62% (26–100 ) for IV, with IV-treated remaining until47. Clinical scabies, pritus and anti. scieiG had disappeared all MO-treated only 75% IV-treated. MO persisted ~9 longer IV in plasma and skin, thereby mite entire cycle and long-lasting.
Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen that is renowned for its resistance to many antibiotics and prevalence in hospitals. Its genome encodes a low number of proteins with peptoglycan ( PG ) synthesis activity compared to other model organisms. We deleted seven of the nine genes encoding PG enzymes from the S. aureus genome without affecting normal growth or cell morphology, generating a strain capable of PG synthesis catalyzed by only by penicillin-binding proteins PBP1 and bi-functional PBP2. However, PBPs are important in clinically relevant environments as bacteria with minimal synthesis machinery became highly susceptible to cell-target antibiotics and lytic enzymes and displayed impaired virulence in Drosophila infection dependent on peptogcan receptor, PGRP-SA.
Burkholderia pseudomallei is a saprophytic bacterium that can infect humans and cause meloidosis, a difficult-to-manage disease. Even with proper diagnosis and treatment, mortality rates range from 20% in Northern Australia to 40% in Thailand. Little is known about how B. pseudalle infects, invades and survives within hosts, and nothing about the contribution of nutrients such as iron to the bacterium pathogenesis. It was assumed B pseudalle used iron-acquisition systems found in other bacteria, such as siderophores. However, a clinical isolate carrying a chromosomal deletion of the malleactin cluster encoding major-affinity siderore was still virulent in murine meloid model. Here, we deleted major siderore malleactin ( m ) and pyelin ( ) clusters in 171b and revealed residual siderore activity unrelated to known Burkia siderores such as cepactin and cepachel, not increased secretion of chelators such citrate. Deletion of hem uptake loci h and showed h required utilization of hem and hemoglobin and could not complement h deficiency. Prolong incubation h mutant in hemoglobin medium yielded able to utilize hemoglobin and hemin suggesting alternate pathways for these sources. Utilization was dependent on mactin, not pyelin synthesis/uptake. A pchmu h mutant could use ferritin as source and intranasal infection lethal in murine meloid model. These data suggest Balle may employ ferritin-iron pathway to sustain in vivo.
Genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models (GSMs) provide comprehensive representations of cellular function. However, their usability is often hampered by inconsistencies between models, particularly for concurrent models. To address this issue, we developed COMM, a tool for Consensus Metabolic Model GENeration. COMM automatically identifies inconsistencies between models and semi-automatically resolves them, thereby contributing to knowledge consolidation of metabolic function. We tested COMM for four organisms and showed that automatically generated models were predictive and substantially increased coherence of representation. COMM is particularly useful for scenarios in which manual curation does not scale, such as eukaryotic organisms, microbial communities and host-pathogen interactions.
Chondrocytes interact with their extracellular environment by embedding in a proteoglycan (PG)-rich matrix, then undergo a developmental transition termed “maturation” when they express genes to induce bone in the overlying tissue, perichond. Here, we ask whether PGs regulate chrocy and perond interactions. Using zebraf mutants, we reveal that cartilage PGs inhibit chro maturation, dictating the timing of perichral bone development. In a mutagenesis screen, we isolated a class of mutants with decreased cartilage and increased perichral bone. Position cloning identified two genes, famb and xylosyltransferase1 (xt1), which encode PG synthesis enzymes. Mutants failed to produce wild-type levels of chroit sulfate PGs, normally abundant in cartilage, and perichral bone formed earlier than wild-type siblings. Primary chro defects induce the phenotype secondarily because chrotes initiated mat prematurely, showing increased expression of run2, collagen 1a, andh coorths, andha suppressed perichral bone in mutants. Ultrastructural analyses demonstrated aberrant matrix and early chro hypertrophy in mutants.
Topoisomerase II Is Required for Proper Separation of Heterochromatic Regions during Drosophila melanogaster Meiosis.
Visceral leishmanias (VL) is a zoonotic disease of great importance. Limitations in current control measures indicate the need for new strategies. This study evaluates the effectiveness of deltamethrin-impregnated collars as a public health measure to prevent canine leishmaniasis (CVL). An interventional study was implemented in two areas of Monteordo, Bahia, Brazil: an intervention area with collared dogs and a control area with conventional CV measures. At baseline, seropositive dogs were removed and seronegative included. Dogs were reevaluated every 7–8 months for two years. In the intervention area, serone dogs received new collars and serone were included. Local authorities were notified of seropitive dogs in both areas, marked for euthanasia by the Ministry of Health. In the first serological survey, serreval was similar. The second evaluation showed significant reductions in serre in both areas, with 6. 0% in the intervention and 11. 0% in control. The relative risk (RR) indicated protection against CV in the intervention. CV incidence did not differ between areas, but increased in control, possibly due to low serconversion or loss.
The X chromosome is unusual because of its non-random gene content, which is commonly discussed in the context of sexual antagonism and avoidance in the germline. We examine the notion that, at least in some taxa, functionally biased gene content may be shaped by limits on expression due to haploid expression of the X. We test this hypothesis using ENCODE and FANT5 data. As predicted, human X-linked genes have lower maximal expression than autosomal genes: on average, maximal expression is three times lower on X than autos. Autosome-to-X retrogenes have lower maximal expression on X than X-to-autosome retrogenes on autos. X genes have lesser increase in expression than autosomal compared to human-Chimpanzee ancestor if highly expressed, but not lowly expressed. The traffic model explains lower breadth of genes on X and Z as broad genes are, on average, highly expressed. Highly expressed genes are rare on X and broadly expressed on X tend to be low. Highly tissue-specific genes are rare on X and broadly expressed on X tend to be low, indicating trend shaped by maximal level not breadth. Importantly, maximal level explains biased tissue profiles of X-linked genes. Tissues highly expressed ( e. g. secretory, structural ) are in which expression is rare on X. These cannot be accounted for in biased models.
Helicobacter pylori is a gastric pathogen that originated in Africa and has been associated with humans for at least 100,000 years. Seven geographically distinct H pylori populations exist, three of which are indigenous to Africa: hp1, hpAfrica, and hpAfrica. The oldest and most divergent population, hpAfrica, evolved within hunter-gatherers who represent one of the deepest branches of the human tree. We investigated the prevalence and population structure of H pyl within Baka Pyies in Cameroon. Gastric biopsies were obtained from 77 Baka from two geographically separated populations and 101 non-B from neighboring agricultural populations and cultured for pyl. Unexpectedly, Baka showed a lower pyl infection rate (20. 8%) than non-B (80.2%). We generated multilocus haplotypes for pyl by DNA sequencing, but were unable to identify B-specific lineages and most were assigned to hpAfrica or hp1. hpAfrica was divided into East and West African subpopulations, and hp1 mainly among Cameroonians supports eastern and western Bantu expansions. An age-structured model shows pyl prevalence among Baka is achievable within a few hundred years. Demographic factors such as small size and low life expectancy can lead pyl eradication from human populations. Baka were either pyl-free or lost lineages during past fluctuations. Using simulations and phylogenetic inference, we show B almost certainly acquired pyl through contact with agricultural neighbors.
Dengue virus (DENV) NS5 is the most conserved amongst the viral non-structural proteins and is responsible for capping methylation and replication of the flavivirus genome. Although replication occurs in the cytoplasm, a characteristic of DENV NS is that localizes to the nucleus during infection with no clear role in replication or pathogenesis. We examined NS of DENV1 and 2, which exhibit the most difference in nuclear localization, employing a combination of functional and structural analyses. Extensive swapping between DENV and 2 NS identified the C-terminal 18 (C18 ) was sufficient to direct the protein to cytoplasm or nucleus, respectively. The lowmic affinity between NS C18 and the nuclear receptor importin (Imp ) allowed their complex to be purified and visualized at 2. Å using x-ray crystallography. Structure-guided mutational analysis of this in GFP-NS clones D1 or 2 and a D2 infectious clone reveal important for NS subcell localization. Notably the transformation by Pro884 allows presentation for Imp and mutating this to, present in D1 results in mislocalization of to cytoplasm without compromising virus. In contrast, mutation at position 888, conserved in all flavivir, resulted in completely virus and the mutation led severely attenuated phenotype, though was in nucleus.
Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) control and elimination programs can be successful in reducing prevalence and intensity of infection, but many endemic countries lack the necessary data for planning and advocacy. Each NTD has its own guidelines for data collection. We developed and tested an integrated NTD mapping protocol, the Integrated Mapping (ITM) Methodology, for lymphatic filariasis (LF), trachoma, schistosiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths (STH). The protocol is resource-efficient and aims to determine if a threshold for public health intervention has been attained. It relies on World Health Organization (WHO) indicators in disease-specific age groups. We tested the protocol by comparing it to WHO methodologies for each disease in one district each in Mali and Senegal. Results were compared in public health, feasibility, and cost. The IT methodology reached same conclusions as WHO regarding initiation of public interventions for trach, LF, and STH, but more targeted recommendations for schosias. It was practical and cost-effective compared to standard, non-integrated WHO methodologies.
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the conserved phosphatase Cdc is required for exit from mitosis. Cdc is anchored to nucleolar chromatin by C1/Net until anaphase, at which time it is released into nucleoplasm. We report here a novel requirement for ubiquitination of histone H2 by Bre1 ubiquitin ligase in cell–dependent release ofdc from nucleolar chrom when MEN is inactivated. This function is mediated by activation of histone H methylation on lysines 4 and 79 (H3K4 and H3K79 ), but not by histone deetylase (HD)2, which associates withdc on nucleolar chrom as part of RENT. We also observed defect indc release in cells lacking H3 lysine methylation (H36 ) and cells lacking HD recruited by this modification.
The development of computational methods to identify programs of co-expressed genes that orchestrate normal or pathological processes is an important problem in biology. GeneProgram is a new unsupervised framework that addresses challenges in expression compend data, including cellular heterogeneity, genetic variation, and temporal behavior. Gene uses Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes to simultaneously organize tissues and genes into overlapping programs with consistent behavior, producing maps that are sorted by generality scores. We showed Gene outperformed several methods on synthetic and real data. Gene was applied to a compend of 62 time-series expression datasets of human responses to infectious agents and immune-modulating molecules. Gene produced a map of 104 programs, a number of which were enriched for genes in key pathways or bound by NF-κ transcription factors. Gene also discovered programs implicating surprising pathways in response to infection, including Wnt and neurotransmitter receptors.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) drives epigenetic imprinting of the IFNG locus in NKGChi natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells play a crucial role in the defense against CMV and represent the main source of interferon (IF)-γ. Recently, it was shown that memory-like features can be observed in NK subsets after CM infection. However, the mechanisms underlying NK adaptive properties have not been completely defined. In this study, we show that NKGChi NK cells in CM seropositive individuals underwent epigen remodeling of the IF conserved non-coding sequence (CNS)1, similar to CD8+ T or TH1 cells. The accessibility of NS1 was required for IF- transcription in response to NKG2 and 4, leading to IF production in NK cells. Our data identify epigen imprint of IF locus as hallmark and mechanism driving stable IF in CM NK expansions, providing basis for regulation in cells.
Legionella pneumophila exploits the host proteasome to temporally regulate the function of a cognate effector protein. The pathogen secretes numerous effector proteins into eukaryotic cells to coordinate cellular processes important for infection. Temporal regulation is important for modulating distinct activities of effectors at different stages of infection. Here we provide the first evidence of a metaeffector, an effector that regulates the function of another effector within the host. The Legionella effector Lub functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that hijacks the host proteasome to target the bacterial effector Sid for degradation. Delayed delivery of Lub to the host cytoplasm leads to shutdown of Sid within the host at later stages of infection.
Viral diversification in newly infected individuals provides information about the host and immune responses experienced by the transmitted virus. We investigated the diversification of HIV-1 env sequences in 81 early infections that resulted from transmission of a single virus (n=78) or two related viruses (n=3). The infecting virus can be estimated, enabling inference of substitutions as well as distinction between insertion and deletion events. We find evidence of adaptive evolution of HIV-1 env and a subset of codons that diversified more than can be explained by neutral evolution. Of 24 rapidly diversifying codons, 14 were either in CTL epitopes or in nucleotide indicative of APOEC-mediated G-to-A substitutions, despite excluded hypermutated sequences. In several, a site was embedded in APOEC and CTL, suggesting APO may facilitate early escape. Ten diversifying codons could not be explained by CTL or APO, including most mutated in gp41. We examined the distribution, extent and sequence of insertions deletions and provide that variation in hyperviable regions is a consequence of selection not mutational hotspots.
The role of multiple epigenetic marks in silencing and the emergence of a bivalent chromatin state. We introduce a minimal model of epigenetic silencing in budding yeast that incorporates known biomolecular interactions in the system. The model identifies epigen marks essential for bistability of epigen states and explores the presence of multiple marks leading to qualitatively different behavior. We find that both H4 acetylation and H3 methylation are important for robust ep silencing. Besides silenced and transcriptionally active chromatin, our model leads to a novel bivalent state with both marks under certain perturbations. The bivalent state appears under perturb and results in patch silencing. We show that titration of silencing proteins can result in counterintuitive responses.
Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is a major health problem in many developing countries and manifests in two forms: oedematous and non-oemat. The pathogenesis of both forms is largely unknown, but gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis has been linked to oemat malnutrition. This study aimed to assess whether GM composition differed between Ugandan children with oedemat or non-oemat malnutrition. Children aged 6–24 months with SAM were included in an observational study. Fecal samples were collected at admission. Total DNA was extracted from fecal samples, followed by PCR and Denaturing Gradient Electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA-targeted high-throughput sequencing. Alpha and beta diversity were determined with ANOVA mean abundance and test. Of 87 children, 62% had oemat mal, 66% were boys and mean age 16.1 months. GM differed between groups by DG (p=0.031) and high-throughput sequencing. Non-oemat children had lower GM diversity (p=0.036). However, beta diversity did not differ between oemat and nonemat SAM (ANOS weighted UniR=-0.008 p=0.584; unweighted UniR=0.9 p0.011).
Telomere length varies among wild-type Saccharomyces sensu stricto isolates and is controlled by multiple loci. We screened 112 wild-type isolates and found extensive variation in telom length. Telom length correlated with geographic origin: European isolates had short telomeres (<150 bp ) and American isolates had telomeres approximately three times longer (>400 bp ). Insertion of the URA gene near telom allowed analysis of individual telom lengths and telom position (TPE). Crossing American and European isolates resulted in F1 progeny with a continuum of telom lengths consistent with many quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in length. Variation in TPE was weakly correlated with telom length. Genotyping F1 progeny indicated several QTL associated with telom length and silencing variation. These QTL include candidate genes and map to regions with no known telom properties. We detected transgressive segregation for both phenotypes. We validated by reciprocal hemizygosity that YU80 and TLC1 are telom-length QTL in two S paradox subpopulations. Furthermore, we propose that divergence within Ku80 generates negative epistasis in one allelic combinations (American-YU and EuropeanU ) resulting in short telom.
Decision making is a complex process that involves not only how people choose, but also when they choose. Traditional models of decision making, such as sequential sampling models ( SSMs ), assume that decisions emerge from a bounded accumulation of evidence and that response times ( RTs ) become predictable. However, we show that SSMs fail when people are not forced to respond immediately but are allowed to sample sequentially: the decision maker might decide to delay choice and terminate the process, a scenario not accounted for by standard SSM. We developed SSMs predicting RTs from electroencephalography ( EEG ) and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) data. In these studies, participants bought or rejected fictitious stocks based on sequentially presented cues and were free to respond at any time. Standard SSMs did not describe RTs adequately, but adding a mechanism for postponing decisions to the model obtained an accurate fit to data. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data revealed alternating states of de- and increasing oscillatory power in beta-band (14–30 ) Hz, indicating responses were repeatedly prepared and inhibited. This supports the existence of a decision to not decide. The extended model accounted for results of an adapted paradigm in which participants had to press button for more information.
Hereditary nasal parakeratosis (HN) is a monogenic autosomal recessive skin disorder in Labrador Retrievers characterized by crusts and fissures on the nasal planum. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 13 HN cases and 23 controls and obtained a strong association signal on chromosome 2 (p=4.4×10−14). Haplotype analysis defined a critical interval of 1.6 Mb with 25 genes. We resequenced the genome of one case at 38 coverage and detected 3 nonsynonymous variants in the interval with respect to the reference assembly. We genotyped these variants in larger cohorts and only one was associated with HN in more than 500 dogs. This candidate variant is a missense in SUVH2 encoding histone lysine 9 (HK) methyltransferase, which mediates chromatin silencing. The c.972G>T is predicted to change conserved asparagine to lysine in catalytically active domain (p.NK). We studied histopathological alterations in epidermis in vivo. Our data suggest HN is not caused by hyperproliferation but delayed differentiation of kerocytes.
Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are a major public health concern due to their ability to cause seasonal epidemics and pandemics. Swine are considered a “mixing vessel” for generating reassortants of avian and mammalian IAVs that could be transmissible to mammals, including humans. However, the emergence of transmissible reassortants in swine is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the emergence of reassortants during co-infection of swine with avian and sw IAVs. A total of 571 isolates were recovered from nasal samples and respiratory tissues of a group of co-housed pigs (influenza-negative, avian H1N1 IAV-infected and sw H3N2 IAV-infected pigs) and 30 distinct genotypes of reassortant viruses were identified. Reassortants from lower respiratory tissues had the largest genomic diversity, while those from turbinate and nasal fluids had the least. Reassants from lower tracts had the largest variations in growth in respiratory epithelial cells and temperature in sw nasal cells seemed to select the type of reassant shed by pigs. One reassant was consistently identified in upper, middle and lower respiratory tissues and was efficiently transmitted between pigs. Our findings suggest that during co-infection of av and sw IAVs, reassort are likely to occur in the lower respiratory tract and tissue tropism is an important for selecting transmissible reassant.
Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic worm that causes schistosomiasis, a major public health problem in endemic areas. Children born to mothers with schosomiasis may be sensitized in utero, which may influence their immune response to schosomiasis and morbidity. We examined the effect of prazantel treatment of S mansoni during pregnancy on the risk of S mans infection and immune response among offspring at age five. In a trial in Uganda, offspring of mothers treated with prazantel or placebo were examined for S mans infection and cytokine and antibody responses to SW and SEA, as well as T cell expression of FoxP at age five. Of 134 children examined, 32 ( 2. 4% ) had S mans infection at age five based on single sample. Infection did not differ between children of treated or untreated mothers. Cytokine ( IFγ, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 ) and antibody (G, Ig and IgE ) responses to SW and SEA, and FoxP expression were higher among infected than uninfected. Prazant treatment S during pregnancy had no effect on responses, except IL-10 to SW which was higher in offspring of mothers that received prant than did not.
Following an infectious challenge, macrophages are activated to allow for the efficient clearance of infectious pathogens. However, how macrophage activation is coupled to clearance remains largely unknown. Here we describe that inflammatory stimuli induce the reprogramming of the macrophage endocytic machinery from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macinocytosis, allowing the transfer of internalized cargo to lysosomes in a receptor-independent manner. This reprogramming occurs through protein C-mediated phosphorylation of the macrophage protein coronin 1, thereby activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K) activity for macinocytic uptake. Expression of a phosphomim form of coronin 1 is sufficient to induce PIK activation and macinocytosis even in the absence of inflammatory stimuli.
In the West Nile region of Uganda, there is a renewed effort to eliminate sleeping sickness (African trypanosomiasis or HAT ) by deploying insecticide-treated targets over an area of ∼500 km2. The effectiveness of the targets depends on their acceptance by the local community. We assessed knowledge and perceptions of tset baits ( traps ) in villages where they had not been previously used. We conducted sixteen focus group discussions with male and female participants in eight villages across Arua District. Despite being less than 10 km apart, community members perceived baits differently. Villagers who had never seen traps before expressed fear and anxiety, related to associations with witchcraft and “ghosts from the river”. By contrast, villagers in areas where traps had been used had positive attitudes and were aware of their purpose and benefits. The latter reported similar negative perceptions when tse control started a decade ago. Our results suggest that despite proximity, acceptance varies between villages and is related to duration with tse programs.
Recombination is a fundamental biological process with profound evolutionary implications. Recombination increases the effectiveness of selection in natural populations. However, direct tests of this prediction have been restricted due to the lack of characterization of recombination variation across genomes and species. Here we report the first high-resolution description of genomic recombination variation in Drosophila melanaster. We characterized 5, 860 female meios by genotyping 139 million SNPs and mapped 106,964 recombination events at 2 kilobases. This allowed us to generate whole-genome CO and GC maps as well as description of variation in recombination among individuals. We describe levels of variation in recombination. At large scale, CO exhibit highly punctuated variation along chromosomes with hotspots and coldspots. We show intra-specific variation in CO that is associated with hotspots low frequency. GC are uniformly distributed than CO and detect in regions absent. At scale re are associated with numerous motifs and occur within transcript, suggesting chromatin favors double-strand breaks.
ID2 is a component of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) machinery in Arabidopsis thaliana, but its function in RDM remains unknown. By purifying ID2, we co-purified two ID paralogs, ID1 and ID2 ( ID2AL 1 and 2 ). The coiled domain between the XS and X domains of ID2 is required for ID homodimerization, whereas the ID2-terminal X domain but not coiled domain is required for ID interaction with ID1 and ID2. By introducing wild-type ID2 and its derivatives into the id2 mutant for complementation, we demonstrated that the previously uncharacterized ID X domain is required for ID-ID1/ID2 formation as well as ID function. ID is required for de novo methylation, siRNA accumulation and transcriptional silencing, whereas ID has overlapping roles with ID. Unlike ID, ID and ID are incapable of binding-stranded RNA, suggesting the roles ID and ID are different from ID in ID-ID and that ID and ID are essential for functioning RDM.
Neutrophils are the first line of defense against invading pathogens and are rapidly recruited to the sites of Leishmania inoculation. During Leishmania braziliensis infection, depletion of neutrophils significantly increases the parasite load. However, co-culture of neutils and L braziliensis has an opposite effect. Here we investigated the interaction between neutils and Lili, exploring activation and apoptotic fate. Inoculation of serum-opsonized Lili promastigotes mice neutil accumulation in vivo, peaking at 24 h. In vitro exposure of thylycoll-elic inflammatory bone neutils to Lili modulated expression of surface molecules such as CD18 and CDL and induced oxidative burst. Using mCh-expressing Lili, effects were mainly observed in infected and not bystander neutils. Neutil activation following Lili was confirmed by release of TN-α and neutilase. Neutils infected Lili but not L major displayed markers of apoptosis. We show Lili induces neutil recruitment in vivo and neutils exposed the parasite in vitro through activation and release of inflammatory mediators.
Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a major disease of cattle that causes significant economic losses to the livestock industry. In the EU, vaccination is not currently used to control bTB, but new diagnostic tests that differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIV) offer the potential to introduce vaccination within eradication programs. We used historical data from Great Britain (GB) to explore the feasibility of using vaccination as a supplementary control tool. The economic impact of bTB on farmers is dominated by testing costs and restrictions on animal movements. Farmers will adopt vaccination if it not only reduces the burden of infection, but also the risk of restrictions. We find that in GB, the specificity of the DIV test, rather than sensitivity, is the greatest barrier to a herd benefit of vaccination. The negative effects of vaccination could be mitigated by relaxing testing, but this could increase the burden of infection in officially TB-free herds. We explore the range of DIV characteristics necessary to see a protective benefit of vaccination. We estimate that a DIV specificity of at least 99. 85% and sensitivity >40% is required to see a benefit with no increase in risk of infection. Data from infected animals suggest that this specificity could be achieved using a cocktail of DIV antigens while maintaining sensitivity of 73. 3% (61.9, 82.9 ) relative to post-mortem detection.
Trichuris trichi is a parasitic worm that infects around 500 million people worldwide, causing physical and educational damage to those infected. Current treatments are limited and lack efficacy against the parasite, preventing eradication. To develop new treatments, we screened a library of 480 drug-like compounds for activity against Truris in vitro. We identified a class of dihydroben[e][1, 4]azin-2 ( 3 )one compounds with activity against Tis. Further screening of structurally related compounds and synthesis of the most potent led to the identification of 20 dihydrozazepones, a class not previously implicated in nematode control. The most active against Tis with EC values around 25–50μM, comparable to existing levamis. The best from this class show low cytotoxicity against murine epithelial cells, demonstrating selectivity for the parasite. Developing a novel treatment for a neglected disease and deploying via mass administration is challenging. Interestingly, dihydrozepone O029 reduces ability of embryated Tis to establish in mouse in vivo. Complementing development as an, this supports an alternative to develop that acts in, via to interrupt lifecycle.
Protein-protein interaction networks have been studied using the concepts of “date” and “party” hubs. Date hubs are characterized by low co-expression with their partners, whereas party hubs have high co-expression. It was proposed that party hubs are local coordinators and date are global connectors. However, we show that the importance of date hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a small subset of them. These extremely central hubs do not display low correlation with their partners, undermining the link between quantity and function. The date/party distinction was motivated by a bimodal distribution of hub-expression, but we show this is not robust to methodological changes. Additionally, topological properties do not correlate with co-expression. However, we find correlations between centrality and similarity of interacting proteins.
Pathogen genome sequences can be informative of transmission events in infectious disease outbreaks, but only if there is sufficient genetic diversity among the sampled genomes. This is because the position of individuals in a transmission tree can only be resolved by genetic data if mutations have accumulated between pathogen genomes. We introduce the concept of ‘transmission’, defined as the number of mutations separating genome sequences from transmission pairs. Using literature values, we simulate outbreak scenarios alongside sequence evolution models to describe transmission of major outbreak-causing pathogens. We find that mean transmission varies between pathogens, but is generally low, with many outbreaks characterised by genetically identical pairs. We describe the impact of transmission on reconstruction using outbreak tools R and, and demonstrate that genetic data of rapidly evolving pathogens can provide information on individual events. Conversely, data of pathogens with lower transmission, including Streptoccus, Shigella and Clostrid, provide little to no information on individual events.
X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a process that silences most genes on one of the two X chromosomes in female mammals. However, some genes escape this silencing. To identify genes that escape CI in vivo, we analyzed allele-specific expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes in mouse tissues and cells with skewed CI based on single nucleotide polymorphisms. We used a binomial model to assess allelic expression and demonstrated a continuum between complete silencing and expression from the inactive X (Xi) chromosome. The validity of RNA-seq was verified using RT-PCR with species-specific primers and Sanger sequencing. We identified both common genes that escape CI and genes with significant differences in CI between tissues. Such genes may be candidates for tissue-specific sex differences. Overall, few genes (3–7%) escape CI in any of the mouse tissues examined, suggesting stringent silencing and escape controls. In contrast, an in vitro system represented by embryonic kidney-derived Pki cell showed higher density of escape genes (21%), representing kidney-specific genes and cell-line escape. Alle-specific RNA polymerase II occupancy and DNase hypersensitivity at the promoter of genes on Xi correlated with levels of escape, consistent with open chromatin structure at escape genes. Alle-specific CTCF binding on Xi at escape genes was denser in brain compared to Pki cell, possibly contributing to more compartmental structure of Xi and fewer genes in brain compared to cell where larger domains were observed.
Plasmodium vivax is a protozoan parasite that infects erythrocytes and causes vivax malaria. The parasite requires cystine proteases for maintenance of metabolic homeostasis and egress from the erythrocyte. In this study, we characterized a novel cystine protease of P. viv, VX-4, which appears to have evolved differently in Plasmodia with strong affinity toward rodent Plmod. VX-4 has dual substrate specificity depending on the microenvironmental pH. Its hydrolytic activity against benzyloxycarbonyl-Le-Arg-4-methyloumaryl-7-amide (Zu-ArgCA) and Z-P-Arg-MCA was highest at acidic pH 5.5, whereas against Z-Arg-MCA was maximal at pH 6.5–7.5. VX-4 preferred positively charged amino acids Gln at P1, with less specificity at P3 and P4. P2 depended on pH (Le at 5.5 and Arg at 7.5 ). Three amino that deline the S pocket were substituted in VX4 compared VX2 and VX3 (Ala, Gly and Glu180 ). Replacement Gl180 abolished activity Z-Arg-M at pH, indicating importance this acid in pH-dependent preference. VX4 was localized in foodoles and cytoplasm of erythro stage P. VX4 showed activity at pH and against P viv plasm 4 and hemoglobin at neutral/acidic and acidic, respectively.
Acetogens are microorganisms capable of fermenting a wide range of substrates, making them ideal candidates for biotechnological production of commodity chemicals. Their ability to grow on H2/CO or H2/CO makes them ideal for sustainable biop. However, design of acetogens is hampered by incomplete knowledge of their physiology and inability to accurately predict phenotypes. Here we describe a genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis (ME) of Clostridium ljungahli, the first ME of a Gram-positive bacterium. The model captures major metabolic, amino, nucleotide, lipid, cofactor, and vitamin pathways as well as RNA and protein synthesis necessary to catalyze reactions. This broadens the scope of predictability. The model reveals how protein and media influence metabolic pathways and energy in acetogens and predicts secretion of multiple products. Predicting overflow is of interest since it enables new strategies, e. g. formation of glycerol, a product for C. ljungli, broadening its metabolic capability. Furthermore, prediction and validation of secretion based on metal availability opens window into fermentation and provides knowledge of proteome and carbon utilization in acetogens.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are moving towards the use of large cohorts of primary cell lines to study diseases of interest and assign biological relevance to genetic signals. We used a panel of human osteoblasts (HOBs) to carry out a transcriptomic survey similar to recent studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines (Ls). OBs and Ls are distinct by preferential grouping of cell–specific genes within biologically and functionally relevant pathways to each type. We performed cis-association with SNP genotypes to identify genetic variations of transcriptforms and our analysis indicates differential expression of transcriptforms in OBs is partly controlled by cis-regulatory genetic variants. Theseforms are regulated by variants in tissue-specific and tissue-independent fashion and have been confirmed by RT–PCR. Our study suggests multiple transcriptforms are present in tissues and genetic may affect the expression of oneform to another rather than all-or effect. Examination of SNPs from GW of bone density show overlap probeset associations in this study. Top corresponding to FAM gene was tested in additional studies revealing novel transcriptform.
Saccharomyces eayan is the non-S. cerevisiae parent of the lager-brew hybrid S. pastus. In contrast to most S. cerevis and Froberg S pastus strains, S eayan cannot utilize α-tri-glucide maltose, a major carbohydrate in brew’s wort. In Sacomy yeasts, utilization of maltose is encoded by the subtelomeric MAL gene family and requires transporters for maltose uptake. While eayan CBS 57 harbors SeALT genes enabling α-di-glucide maltose uptake, it lacks maltose genes. In contrast, S cere sequence indicates maltose and maltose transporters likely evolved from a shared gene. To study maltose utilization in eayan CBS57, maltose-assim mutants obtained after UV mutagenesis were subjected to evolution in carbon-limited chemostat cultures on maltose-enriched wort. An evolved strain showed maltose and maltose fermentation in 7 ferment experiments on industrial wort. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel SeALT gene resulting from repeated introgress by non-recipro translocation of at least SeALT. The predicted structure SeT was comparable to original transporters but overexpression sufficed to enable maltose, indicating neofunction had occurred.
Influenza virus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Timely and accurate assessment of its impact on human health is essential for planning but presents a challenge. Current approaches rely mostly on intensive surveillance. This study proposes a novel host-virus interaction model and establishes a positive correlation between excess mortalities caused by viral strains and their antigenic distances to previous strains for each type of seasonal influenza virus. Based on this relationship, a method is developed to rapidly estimate mortality of influenza A H1N virus by predicting antigen distance between H1 strains. This should help formulate cost-effective response for control and prevention.
The Asian soybean fungus Phakora pachyri is an obligate biotrophic pathogen that causes severe soybean epidemics. The molecular mechanisms by which P. pachyri and other fungi interact with their host plants are poorly understood. Here, we present the characterization of Pachy effector 23 (PEC), a small secreted cysteine-rich protein that suppresses plant immunity. We show that PEC interacts with the soybean transcription factor GS12 and that soybean in which GS12 is silenced have constitutively active immunity, thereby identifying GS12 as a negative regulator of soybean defenses.
Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that invades host cells to replicate inside a membrane-bound vacuole called an inclusion. Multiple host proteins are recruited to the inclusion and functionally modulated to support chlamial development. We identified the cell surface tyrosine kinase EphA receptor (Eph2 ) as a chlamial adherence and invasion receptor that induces PI3 kinase (PIK ) activation, promoting chlamial replication. Interfering with C. trachatis serar2 (C ) binding to Eph2, downregulation of Eph2 or inhibition of Eph significantly reduced C infection. C interacts with and activates Eph on the surface resulting in receptor internalization. During chlamial replication, Eph remains active around the inclusion and interacts with the p85 subunit of PIK to activate the PIK/Akt pathway required for chlamial development. Overexpression of full Eph, but not mutant lacking the intracellular domain, enhanced PI activation and C infection. Despite depletion of Eph from the surface, C induces upregulation of Eph through the ER pathway keeping infected cells in an apoptosis-resistant state.
Active Dendrites Enhance Neuronal Dynamic  
Neurons have long been known to exhibit dendritic excitability through the expression of voltage-gated ion channels. However, the role of this excitability in dendritic computation has remained elusive. We show that the average output of an active dendritic tree is a highly non-linear function of afferent rate, attaining large dynamic ranges above 50 dB. The model yields double-sigmoid functions experimentally observed in retinal ganglion cells. We claim that enhancement of dynamic is the primary role of dendritic conductances. We predict that neurons with larger dendritic trees have larger dynamic and blocking of conductances lead to decrease dynamic.
Inference of Quantitative Models of Bacterial Promoters from Time-Series Reporter Data is a study that aims to improve the inference of regulatory and quantitative models of gene expression from time-series transcriptomics data. Current methods are based on assumptions that mRNA abundance is representative of protein concentrations and changes in expression are solely due to transcription factors and regulators. However, these assumptions are often not valid and bias the reverse engineering process. Here, we investigate the importance of this bias and possible corrections using a combination of models and experiments. We measure the activity of genes involved in the Fli-FlM module of the E. coli motility network and estimate protein concentrations and physiological effects by kinetic models of expression. Our results show that correcting the bias improves the quality of models from data. Moreover, we demonstrate that these improvements are expected to be stronger for systems with longer protein half-lives and varying expression machinery activity than the Fli-FlM module.
Oligoryzomys fulcens is an important mammalian reservoir of zoonotic pathogens in Central America. This study characterizes the spatio-temporal distribution of O. fulcens in the Agua region, Panama, using a longitudinal dataset of rodent populations collected between April 2006 and December 2009. The study area was divided into a 0.09 km2 grid, with a total area of 6.43 km2 ( 2.39 x 2.69 ). The temporal dataset was divided into four periods: the dry season, rainy season, and two transitional months between seasons ( April and December ). The study found heterogeneous patterns in population densities and dispersion of O. fulens across seasons and years. The species was typically absent during late transitional months and re-established in subsequent years. Populations reoccurred in the same area during first three years but re-established further south in final year. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated populations encompassed approximately 300–600 m. Suitable and unsuitable habitats were sharply demarcated over short distances. O fulens showed a well-defined spatial pattern evolving over time, leading to a pattern of changing aggregation. Hot spots of abundance showed a shifting pattern explaining intermittent transmission by this species. This was associated with seasonality and anthropogenic pressures from agricultural activities.
Influenza A (H3N) viruses are a major cause of seasonal epidemics and pandemics in humans. Understanding the antigenic evolution of these viruses is important for the development of efficient vaccines. Antigenic evolution is driven by amino acid changes in the hemagglutinin protein, the major surface antigen of the virus. However, distinguishing between mutations that determine the phenotype and those that do not is a challenge. We have developed a method to infer antigenic trees for the hemagglutinin protein. Antigen weights are assigned to all branches in the tree, allowing us to determine the antigen impact of amino acid changes. Our method is comparable to antigen cartography and identifies both known and novel amino acid changes with antigen impact in evolution of A (3) viruses from 1968 to 2003.
Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV) infection is a major risk factor for cervical cancer and other anogenital cancers. To identify host factors required for HPV infection, we performed a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in human cells. We found that a cluster of mitotic genes were required for HPV infection, and identified a novel mechanism for viral DNA import into the nucleus. In interphase cells, viruses were endocytosed and routed to the perinuclear area, but failed to enter the nucleus. Upon nuclear envelope breakdown in interphase, HPV infection occurred. During mitosis, viral DNA was associated with host chromatin on the metaphase plate. We propose that HPV requires nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis for DNA access to the nucleoplasm. Our results highlight the value of RNA screens for viral infections and provide a resource for future virus-host interaction studies.
Black Sigat or black streak disease, caused by the Dothideomyc fungus Pseudocospora fiji (synonym: Mycoserella fiji ), is the most significant foliar disease of banana worldwide. Due to the lack of effective resistance, disease management requires frequent fungicide applications, which greatly increase the economic and environmental costs of banana production. Weekly fungicide applications in banana plantations lead to rapid evolution of fungicide-resistant strains, causing disease failures throughout the world. To combat this threat, two strains of P. fiji were sequenced and assembled with the aid of a genetic map. The 74b genome of P. fiji is expanded by L retrotransposons, making it the largest within Dothideyc. Mel-curve assays suggest the genomes of closely related Sigat disease members, P eusae and mus, are also expanded. Electrophoretic kary and molecular analyses of markers in P fiji populations showed chromosome polymorphisms and genetic diversity. Genetic differentiation was detected using neutral markers, suggesting strong selection with limited flow at the geographic scale. Frequencies of fungicide in fung-treated plantations were higher than in untreated Piji populations. A homologue of Cladospor fulum Avr effector Pf4 was identified in Piji genome. Infiltration of purified PfAV4 into leaves of resistant variety Calcut resulted in hypersensitive response. This suggests Calcut could carry unknown gene recognizing Pf4.
The evolution of lineage-specific transcription factor binding sites is thought to be a major contributor to the evolution of species-specific traits. However, most computational approaches to study regulatory elements focus on conserved sites and rely heavily on sequence alignments. In this paper, we describe a novel framework that uses a birth-death model to trace the evolution of lineage-specific sites without detailed cross-species alignments. Our model was applied to ChIP-seq data for six transcription factors ( GATA, SOX, CTC, MY, MAX, ETS ) along the human-mouse lineage. We estimate that 58–79% of binding sites for each factor have origins since human-mouse divergence. Over 15% of all sites are unique to homin. Such elements are enriched near genes associated with specific pathways and harbor more SNPs than older sites in human.
In zebraf, light is the principal environmental signal for entraining the endogenous circadian clock. Unlike mammals, most of its tissues are exposed to light, leading to local entrainment of the clock. Importantly, light induces expression of a set of genes including clock genes in zraf cell types in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the mechanism linking light to gene expression, we focus on light regulation of zraf period2 (per2). Using transgenic fish and stably transfected cell–based assays, we define a Light Module (LRM) within per2 promoter. The LRM lies proximal to start site is necessary and sufficient for light-driven expression and light circadian regulation. Curiously, LRM is conserved in vertebrate per2, even species lacking light-sensitive peripheral clocks. We reveal that human LRM substitutes zraf L to confer light-regulated inraf cells. LRM contains E and D elements critical for function. E directs circadian regulation by mediating BMAL/CLOCK, D confers light-driven. zraf hom thyrophonic factor binds LRM D and transactivates expression. We demonstrate t mRNA are lightible and knockdown attenuates light from per in vivo.
The actin filament-binding protein coronin regulates motility in Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, the highly motile forms of the rodent malaria parasite transmitted by mosquitoes. Parasites lacking coronin show motility defects that impair colonization of the salivary glands but not migration in the skin, yet result in decreased transmission efficiency. Non-motile sporozoites have low concentrations of actin and mediate coronin localization to the periphery. Engagement of extracellular ligands triggers intracellular release of calcium followed by act-dependent localization of coron to the rear and initiation of motility. Mutational analysis and imaging suggest coron organizes actin filaments for motility.
Leishmania parasites are the causative agents of leishmaniasis, a major public health problem in many tropical and subtropical regions. Amphotin B is an important drug for the treatment of leishiasis, but the potential for resistance to this drug is considerable. Here, we characterised four amphotin-resistant Leishmania mexicana lines, which exhibited altered sterol biosynthesis and hypersensitivity to pentamidine. Whole genome sequencing revealed a mutation in the sterol biosynthesis gene sterol5-desaturase in one line, while RNA-seq demonstrated loss of expression of sterol24-ethyltransferase ( SMT ) in three out of four lines. SMT is responsible for drug resistance and altered sterol biosynthesis. Loss of milteine transporter was also associated with one line. SMT is encoded by two gene copies with different expression levels. In all cases, reduced expression was associated with loss of 3’ untranslated region of dominant copy, resulting from structural variations at locus. Local sequence homology between copies and presence of SIDER retrotransposons promote these variations. In one case, loss SMT was not associated with loss virulence in macrophages in vivo.
Predictive coding theory suggests that the brain optimizes the encoding of sensory information by using two processes: prediction and attention. Prediction is thought to guide the interpretation of forthcoming events, while attention prioritizes events according to their relevance. Despite their contributions to perception and cognition, it is unknown how they interact to modulate information in the brain. A recent extension of predictive theory suggests that attention optimizes the precision of predictions by modulating the gain of prediction units. Because prediction errors code the difference between predictions and sensory, this would suggest that attention increases selectivity for information in the response to surprising stimuli. Alternatively, predictive models suggest that attention increases the activity of prediction neurons and therefore that attention and prediction synergistically modulate selectivity for information in the brain. Here, we applied predictive models to neural activity recorded via EEG as observers performed a visual task to test the effect of attention on both mismatch and information in response to surprising stimuli. Participants attended or ignored a stream of gratings, orientations which could be predictable, surprising, or unpredictable. We found that surprising evoked responses were encoded according to the difference between predicted and observed features and attention facilitated encoding of this information in the brain.
Trypanosoma brucei gambense is a pathogen of sub-Saharan Africa that causes sleeping sickness in humans and animals. There are three sub-species of T. brucei: T. brucei, T. rhodesense, and T. gambense. T. bruce is unable to infect humans due to sensitivity to trypanolytic factors ( TLF ) 1 and 2 found in human serum. T. rhodesense and. gambense are able to resist lysis by TLF. There are two sub-groups of T. gambense that differ genetically and human resistance phenotypes. Group 1 T gambense have an invariant phenotype whereas group 2 show variable. Previous data indicated group 1 gambense are resistant to TLF-1 due to reduced uptake of T-1 mediated by reduced expression of T- receptor the haptoglobinemoglobin (Hb ) gene. Here we investigate if also in group 2 parasites. Isogenic resistant and sensitive group gambense were derived and compared to bruce parasites. Both express Hb gene similar and internalized fluorescent labeled T- similar to bruce. Both resistant and sensitive group 2, as well as group gambense, internal recombinant AP1 but sensitive group are lysed. Our data indicate group gambense avoiding T-1 is to main lytic AP1. Similarly group gambense innately to AP1 which be same mechanism. However group gambense variably phenotype and expression does not appear correlate change expression or Hb. Thus differences in human resistance between gambense 1 and 2.
DNA methylation of the HIV-1 5′ long terminal repeat (LTR) is considered to be a mechanism of transcriptional suppression that allows retroviruses to evade host immune responses and antiretroviral drugs. However, the role of DNA methylation in the control of HIV-1 latency has never been unambously demonstrated. Here, we show that CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5′LTR is an epigenetic mechanism that controls resistance of HIV-1 to reactivation and determines the stability of HIV-1 latency. In an in vitro model of reable latency, Cp methylation acts as a late event during establishment of HIV-1 latency and is not required for initial provirus silencing. The latent reservoir of avire patients contained high proportions of nonethylated 5LTR. The latency controlled by transcriptional interference and chromatin mechanisms in absence of significant DNA methylation tends to be leaky and reactivable. In latent HIV-infected individuals without detectable viremia, we found HIV promoters and enhancers to be hypermethyl and resistant to reactivation, opposed to hypomethyl 5LTR in vire patients. However, methylation of HIV-1 5LTR did not confer complete resistance to reactivation of latent HIV with histone deacetylase inhibitors, protein C agonists TN-α, and combinations 5-aza-2oxycytidine.
Genomic variation in Drosophila melanogaster is a key to understanding the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation. We present a nucleotide catalog of single-nucle, multiucle, and structural variants in 39 Dophila melanogaster Reference inbred lines. We identify more than 3. 6 million variants, including more than 800, 000 insertions, deletions ( indels ) and complex variants (1 to 6, 000 bp ). We find that variants are not mutagenic nor are regions with high variant density mutation-prone. Rather, elevated SNP density around variants is due to population-level processes. We provide insights into the architecture of gene expression variation in adult flies by mapping cis-expression trait loci (cisQTL ) for more 2, 000 genes. Indels comprise 10% of all cisQTL and show larger effects than cisQTL. We find more associations in males than females and most cisQ are sex-specific, revealing decoupling of genomic architecture between sexes and importance of factors mediating sex-based expression. Finally, we perform RNA-seq-based allelic imbalance in offspring between sequenced lines and find that most cisQ can be validated in heterozygous.
The amplitude of the rectified electromyogram (EMG) signal is commonly used as an estimator of the neural drive to muscle and synaptic input to motor neurons. However, the loss of EM amplitude due to overlap of motor unit potentials (cancellation ) may distort the spectrum of the rectified EM and its correlation with the drive. This study investigated the impact of cancellation on correlation using analytical and computational models of motor activity, force, and EM signal. We analytically demonstrated that rectified EM without cancellation (EMnc ) is superior to rectified EM as estimator of neural drive. This was confirmed by simulations, as the coefficient of determination ( ) between neural in 1–30 Hz and EMnc (0.59±.08 ) matched the correlation between rectified EM and drive when cancellation was low (<40% ) at contraction (<5% maximum voluntary force; MVC ). However, correlation decreased with cancellation (–.83 ) to values <0.2 at cancellation (>60% ) contraction (>15 MVC ). Simulations showed that stronger neural implied stronger correlation between rectified EM and drive and cancellation distorted mainly low-frequency (<5 Hz ) of drive.
In Arabidopsis thaliana responds to aluminium (Al) stress by inhibiting root growth, and auxin is necessary for this response. However, the molecular mechanism is largely unknown. We show that YUC, which encodes flavin monooxygenase-like proteins, regulates auxin biosynthesis in the root transition zone (TZ) in response to Al stress. Al upregulates YUC3/5/7/9 in the root TZ, resulting in aux accumulation in the TZ and root inhibition during stress. These changes are dependent on ethylene signalling. Disruption of eth signalling causes enhanced or reduced upregulation of Ys in TZ in response to Al. Moreover, eth enhanced root inhibition under Al was alleviated in y mutants or by co-treatment withucas, an inhibitor of Y activity, suggesting a role in this process.
Natural killer (NK) cell responses in primates are regulated by interactions between killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) on NK cells and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on target cells. We show that certain simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) peptides stabilize the interaction between the MHC class I molecule Mamu-A*002 and the inhibitory receptor Mamu-K3DL05, but not others. We investigated the functional implications of these interactions by testing SIV peptides bound to Mam-A*002 for their ability to modulate Mam-K3+ NK cell responses. Twenty-eight of seventy-five SIV peptides bound to Mam-A002 suppressed the cytolytic activity of Mam-K3 NK cells, including immunodominant CD8 T cell epitopes previously shown to stabilize Mam-A002 tetramer to Mam3. Substitutions at C-terminal positions changed inhibitory peptides into disinhibitory, and vice versa, without altering binding to Mam002. The effects of these variants on NK responses corresponded to their effects on Mam002 tetramer to Mam. In assays with mixtures of inhibitory disinhib peptides, low concentrations of inhib peptides suppressed NK responses. Consistent with inhibition of Mam-K cells by epitopes presented Mam002, SIV replication was higher in Mam002 CD+ lymphocytes co-cultured Mam-K cells than Mam-K cells.
Bacterial pathogens must be able to sense and adapt to a variety of environmental stresses in order to survive. We hypothesize that strains adapted to survive nutrient deprivation are more adept at colonizing and persisting in the host. In this study, we detected microevolution in response to nutrient limitation in Haemophilus influenza ( NTH ). We observed a mutation in 3',5-cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase activity in the ic strain. In a preclinical model of NTH-induced otitis (OM), we observed a decrease in recovery of effusion from ears infected with the ic strain. Clinically, resolution of OM coincided with clearance of middle ear fluid. In contrast, the ic strain formed significantly more intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) than the parental strain during OM. The number of IBCs formed by the parental strain was low at early stages of OM, but increased at later stages coinciding with absence of recoverable effusion, suggesting a mucosal reservoir following resolution of disease.
Bacterium Burkholderia pseudomalle, the causative agent of meloidosis, modulates host iron homeostasis to facilitate intracellular survival. Infection of primary macrophages with B. pseudalle results in downregulation of the iron exporter ferroin, leading to increased iron availability within macrophages. Exogenous modification of ferroport function by hepcin or supplementation with ferric ammonium citrate increases intracellular iron and stimulates B pseudalle growth, whereas iron chelation by deferoxamine reduces bacterial survival. Iron-loaded macrophages exhibit lower expression of NADPH oxidase, iNOS, lipocalin 2, cytokines and activation of caspase-1. Infection of mice with the pathogen causes diminished ferport expression, higher iron retention in the liver and lower levels in serum (hypofermia ). In vivo administration of ferric ammonium cit tends to promote bacterial growth and inflammation, whereas limitation of availability significantly ameliorates bacterial clearance, attenuates cytokine levels and improves survival of infected mice.
Proteins accomplish their biological functions through collective atomic motions. However, the identification of collective motions related to a specific protein function from a molecular trajectory is non-trivial. We propose a novel technique termed “functional analysis” that detects collective motion directly related to a protein function. This technique is based on an ensemble of structures and a “functional” quantity that quantifies the protein’s functional state. It detects the collective motion maximally correlated to the quantity. The functional quantity can correspond to geometric, electrostatic, chemical, or any variable relevant to the protein. In addition, the motion most likely to induce a change in the quantity is estimated from the ensemble. Two correlation measures are applied: the Pearson coefficient that measures linear correlation and mutual that assesses any interdependence. Detecting maximally correlated motion derives a model for the state in terms of a single coordinate. This approach is illustrated with proteins including polyalanine-helixase, T lysozyme, Trpase and leucine-binding.
Eukaryotic genes of Euglena gracilis and other marine diatoms harbor nonconventional introns that are not found in other eukaryotes. These nonconventional introns do not have the conserved borders of spliceosomal introns or complementary U1 snRNA at the 5’ end. They form a stable secondary structure between exon/intron junctions, but do not resemble self-splicing introns. Nonconventional introns are frequently inserted at new positions, whereas conventional introns are conserved or lost. We examined the order of intron removal from Euglena gracilis transcripts of the tubA and gap genes, which contain both nonconventional and spliceosomal introns. We compared the order of intron excision for pairs of intr belonging to different types and analyzed intermediate splicing products using PacBio Next Generation Sequencing. We found that nonconventional introns are removed later than spliceosomal introns. We also observed accumulation of transcripts with conventional introns removed and noncon present, suggesting a gap between the two splicing types.
Coxsackievirus B (CV) is an enterovirus that commonly causes self-limited febrile illness in infants. However, cases of severe infection can manifest in acute myocarditis. The consequences of mild CV infection are unknown, though there is an epidemiologic association between subclinical infections and late heart failure, raising the possibility of subtle damage leading to late-onset dysfunction or chronic injury due to inflammatory reactions during latent infection. Here, we describe a mouse model of juvenile infection with subclinical dose coxsievirus B3 ( CV3 ) which showed no symptoms either immediately following infection or in adult. However, following physiological or pharmacological cardiac stress, juvenile-infected mice underwent cardiac hypertrophy and indicative of progression to heart failure. Evaluation of vasculature in hearts of mice subjected to cardiac stress showed compensatory increase in CD31+ vessel formation, though this was suppressed in juvenile-infected mice. Moreover, CV3 efficiently infected c-kit+ cells, cardiac progenitor numbers were reduced in hearts of juvenile-infected mice.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, regulates IL-1 and IL-18 production via NOD-like receptor NLRP and pyroptosis NLRC. However, the role of B. pseudalle in inflamome activation and other cell death mechanisms during infection are not well defined. We show that caspase-1 and pyptosis are exclusively dependent on NLRC, not NLRP in early macrophage infection, whereas later casase-1 activation is NLRC-independent. In the early phase, we identified a pathway involving casases-9, -7 and PAR downstream NLRC and casase-1. In casase-1-deficient macrophages, apoptosis is strongly induced, dependent on apoptotic initiator and effector casases. Early casase-1 activation in macrophages is reduced or abolished after B. pseudalle flagellin F or TSS3SA mutant infection. TSS effector protein BE activates casase-1. TSS inner protein BK mutant fails to activate casase, reveals higher intracellular counts, reduced death and IL-β during early but not late macroage infection. Intranasal infection of BAL/c mice with BK mutant displays decreased mortality, lower bacterial loads, IL-β, myeloperoxidase and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage. Our results indicate a major role for TSS in NLRC casase-1 activation pyptosis and contribution of casase-dependent death in B pseudalle pathogenesis.
The Arabidopsis thaliana KINγ is a subunit of the SNF1-related kinase complex plays a role in plant development. We show that KINγ is a cytoplasm and nucleus-localized protein in vegetative cells of Arabidopsis pollen. Kγ mutant pollen does not germinate on stigma, but germinates normally in vitro. Further analysis shows that hydration of Kγ mutant pollen on stigma is compromised. However, adding water to stigma promotes germination of mutant in vivo, suggesting that hydration of mutant leads to defective germination. Kγ mutant pollen mitochondria and peroxomes are destroyed and numbers are significantly reduced compared to wild type. We find that Kγ mutant has reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in pollen. Addition of H2O2 in vitro partially compensates for reduced hydration of mutant, and ROS in Arabidopsis CATAL 3 overexpression compromises hydration on stigma. These results indicate Arabid Kγ is critical for ROS regulation by mediating biogenesis of mitochond and perox in pollen required for pollen–stigma interactions.
RNase III is a class of enzymes that cleaves double-stranded RNA in many biological systems. In bacteria, RNase III is involved in ribosomal RNA maturation and mRNA turnover. In eukaryotes, Drosha and Dicer are RNase homologs that play critical roles in miRNA and siRNA production. However, RN III is not essential in most bacteria, except in Bacillus subtilis. We show that RN III is essential in B. subtilis to silence toxin genes borne by two prophages, Skin and SP, through antisense RNAs. Unlike many organisms that use RN III or homologs as part of viral defense, B. subtil requires RN for survival. We identify txA and yT as toxin-encoding mRNAs of Skin and SP sensitive to RN III. We explore mechanism of III-mediated txA mRNA decay when paired to antisense Rat, both in vivo and in vitro.
The filarial nematode Brugia mal is the causative agent of Lymphatic Filariasis, a parasitic nematode that modulates host biology by releasing extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) containing bioactive proteins and RNA. EVs are secreted by all life stages of B. mal (microfilar, L3, L4, adult male and female ) and are internalized by murine macrophages by phagocytosis, suggesting a conserved mechanism for effector trafficking. Proteomic profiling of adult male and female EVs revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in the EV proteome, defining Brug EV biogenesis and sexual dimorphism in immunomodulatory cargo. Iverectin was found to rapidly inhibit EV release by all B. mal life stages. This effect was also observed in the filarial nemode Dirofilar imitis, but not in iverect-unresponsive isolate, suggesting a mechanism of action for this drug and new platforms for anti-filar drug development.
In the Western Province of the Solomon Islands, the prevalence of scabies and impigo was investigated in a population-based survey. Ten rural villages were included in the study and 190 residents were enrolled. The total prevalence of scabies was 19. 2% (95% CI 17.–21. ) and age and gender prevalence 19.2% (95CI 16.–21. ). The prevalence of scabies in adults was 10.4% (95CI 8–13. ) and highest in infants <1 year (34.%, OR 3.2–.6 ) and children 1–4 years (25., OR 2.–3. ) Scabies affected two or more body regions in 80% of participants and 4% classified as severe. The total prevalence of impigo was 32.7 (95CI 30–.8 ) and age and gender 26.7 (CI 24–.5 ) The highest in children 1–4 (42., OR 2–5.8 ). Sc infestation was associated with impigo (OR 2., 1–.6 ) and 41% of impigo also had scabies.
Neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus continues to occur in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in mice. However, the function of this process remains unclear. In this study, cellular proliferation in the hippocampus was measured in 719 outbred stock mice and revealed a significant correlation between the proportions of CD8+ and CD4 T lymphocyte subsets. This correlation reflected shared genetic loci, with the exception of the H-2a locus that had a dominant influence on T cell subsets but no impact on neurogenesis. Analysis of knockouts and repopulation of Tα-deficient mice subsets of T cells confirmed the influence of T on neurogenesis, indicating that CD+ T cells mediate the effect.
Chagas disease is a major public health problem in Latin America and an emerging disease in the US. We previously screened the Trypanosoma cruzi database by computational/bioinformatics and identified antigens that exhibited characteristics of vaccine candidates. We investigated the protective efficacy of a multi-component DNA-prime/protein-boost vaccine (TVac2) constituted of selected antigens and cytokines (IL-12 and GM-CSF) expression plasmids in a murine C57/6 mice model. Mice were immunized with antigen-encoding plasmids plus cytokines, followed by recombinant proteins and weeks later, challenged with T cruzi trypastigotes. ELISA and flow cytometry were employed to measure humoral (antibodyotypes ) and cellular (ymphocyte, CD+ and CD+ T phenotype and cytokine ) responses. Myocard pathology was evaluated by H&E and Masson trich staining. TVac induced a strong antigen-specific response (Ig2>Ig1 ) and moderate lymphocyte proliferation in mice. Upon challenge, TVac-vaccinated mice expanded Ig2/Ig1 and elicited a CD+ T response with type cytok (IF- and TN- ) that resulted in control of parasite burden. During phase, response persisted, splenic activation CD+ cells and IF-/-TN cytokines subsided and IL/- cytok became dominant in vaccinated. The parasitism, inflammation, androsis in heart and muscle TVac-vacc chronic were undetectable by techniques. In, mice injected vector or cytok only responded T cruz by elicitation of mixed (1/type ), cell and cytok response and persistent burden in myocardium.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying genetic loci associated with complex diseases. However, a remaining question is whether disease risk can be quantified based on genotype to facilitate prevention and treatment. Previous studies have failed to achieve satisfactory performance due to use of limited susceptibility loci. Here, we propose that machine learning approaches with a large number of markers may improve disease assessment. We applied a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm on a GWAS dataset generated on Affymetrix genotyping for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and optimized a risk model with hundreds of markers. We tested this model on an independent Illumina-genotyped dataset (1,008 cases, 1,000 controls ) and a separate Affetrix-genotyped dataset (1,529,1,458 ), resulting in area under curve (AUC) ∼0.84 in both datasets. In contrast, poor performance was achieved when limited to dozens of known loci in the model or logistic regression. Our study suggests that disease assessment can be improved by algorithms taking into account interactions between a large of markers. We are that genotype-based risk may be feasible for diseases where proportion of risk has been captured by arrays.
Memory CD8 T cells are a type of immune cell that rapidly infiltrate non-lymphoid tissues, such as the skin, to provide protective immunity against viral infections in an antigen-specific manner. However, the fate of memory CD8 T cells after entering non-lymphoid tissues, such as the skin, during a secondary infection is largely unknown. CD62 is often used to identify the central memory ( TCM ) CD8 T subset, but the requirement for CD62-mediated lymph node homing versus other attributes of TCM CD8 T remains unresolved. We show that memory CD8 T cells traffic into the skin independent of CD62-mediated lymph node reactivation and provide robust immunity against Vaccinia (V) infection. TCM, but not effector (TEM ) CD8 T differentiated into functional CD69+/103 tissue residents following viral clearance, which was dependent on local antigen recognition in the skin microenvironment. We found that memory8 cells expressed granzyme after trafficking the skin and utilized cytoly to provide immunity againstV infection. Collectively, findings demonstrate that TCM8 cells become cytoly following infiltration the skin to protect against infection and differentiate into CD69 tissue residents.
Myosin VI is a minus-directed motor protein that has been shown to play a role in the enrichment of proteins on the surface of axons in neurons. In contrast to Myosin Va, a plus-directed motor that has been shown to target proteins to dendrites, Myos VI is involved in targeting proteins to the axonal surface. Myos VI mediates the enrichment of proteins on the axonal surface at least in part by stimulating dendrite endocytosis, a mechanism that has been shown to underlie the localization of many axonal proteins. In addition, a version of Channelrhodopsin 2 that was engineered to bind to Myos VI is concentrated at the surface of the axon of cortical neurons in vivo, suggesting it could be useful for probing circuit and function.
Sex determination in the branchiopod crustacean Daphnia magna: Conservation of a doublesex gene in the sex-determining pathway. Daphnia magna is a freshwater crustacean that parthenogenetically produces males in response to environmental cues. We report the identification of two doublesex (Dsx) genes, DmaD1 and Dma2, which play important roles in controlling sexual dimorphism. DmaD1 is responsible for male development when expressed during environmental sex determination. The DmaD1 domain is similar to Dsx from insects, which are thought to be sister group of branchiop crustans. However, the molecular basis for sexually dimorphic expression of DmaD1 is different from insects.maDma1 exhibits sexually dimorphic differences in transcript abundance rather than sex-specific pre-mRNA splicing in the coding region. During embryogenesis, Dma1 is increased only in males and transcripts are primarily detected in male structures. Knockdown ofma1 in males results in female traits including ovary maturation, whereas ectopic expression ofma in females results in male-like phenotypes.ma2 expression patterns are similar toma1 but silencing and overexpression do not induce clear phenotypic changes. These results establishma1 as key regulator of male phenotype. Our findings reveal how environmental sex is implemented by selective expression of fundamental component conserved in genetic sex. We infer previously unidentified link between genetic and sex.
Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2) is a sexually transmitted virus that causes genital herpes, neonatal herpes, and increases the risk of HIV transmission. A vaccine is urgently needed to prevent pain and suffering. We evaluated a trivalent HSV-2 subunit vaccine in rhesus macques and guinea pigs. The vaccine contains glycoproteins C, D, and E ( g2,D, g2,E ) to block virus entry and immune evasion. In rhes macques, the trivalent vaccine induced plasma and mucosa neutralizing antibodies that block immune evasion and stimulated CD T cell responses. After intravaginal challenge, a brief infection was detected in naïve but not immunized macques. We evaluated vaccine efficacy in guinea pigs. Animals were mock, immunized with g2, trivalent or trivalent followed by booster g2 trivalent. The trivalent and trivalent g2 groups were 97% and 99% efficacious in preventing lesions and outperformed g2. As marker of transmission, vaginalabs were evaluated for HSV-2 DNA and replication between five and seven weeks after challenge. HSV-2 DNA was reduced in all compared with mock. Shedding of replication virus occurred fewer days in trivalent than g2 immunized while trivalent g2 had no shedding replication virus. Overall, trivalent had lesions <1% and shedding replication virus 0.2%.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a powerful tool for genome-wide profiling of protein-DNA interactions. However, mapping protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplications and highly repetitive regions of genomes is challenging because short reads (50–100 base pairs) map to multiple locations in the reference genome. Standard methods discard multi-mapping reads and those that can accommodate are prone to false positive and negative rates. We developed Perm-se, a prior-enhanced read allocation method for ChIP-se that can map multiapping reads in repetitive regions with high accuracy. We comprehensively evaluated Perm-se and found that our approach significantly improves multi-read allocation over methods that do not utilize additional data. Our statistical framework facilitates multi-read allocation with a variety of data including histone Ch-seq. We applied Perm-se to 64 ENCODE ChIP-se datasets from GM78 and K562 cells and identified novel protein-D interactions in segmental regions.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that affects approximately 218 million people worldwide, mostly in Africa. Previous studies suggest that people with chronic schosomiasis may have a higher risk of HIV-1 acquisition and impaired ability to control HIV-1 replication once infected. We conducted a nested case-control study within a population-based survey of HIV-1 transmission in Tanzania to investigate the effects of schosiasis on HIV-1 susceptibility and HIV-1 viral load at HIV-1 serconversion. Approximately 40% of the population was infected with Schosoma mansoni and 2% with S. haobium. We tested schosoma antigens in pre- and post-HIV-serconversion blood of HIV-1 serconverters and matched controls who did not acquire HIV-1. Analysis was stratified by gender. We compared 73 HIV-1 serconverters with 265 controls. Women with schosias had higher odds of HIV-1 acquisition than without (OR 2.8 [ 1.–.6, p 0.019 ). Schos-infected men did not have increased odds HIV-1 acquisition (OR 0. [.3–.8, p.42 ). We compared HIV-1 RNA in post-serconversion blood HIV-1 serconverters with schosias versus without. The median HIV-1 RNA in 15 HIV-converters with schos was higher than 22 without schos: 4. [.–. log copies/mL versus 3.–., p.017. We confirm that pre-existing schos infection increases HIV-1 odds in women and HIV-1 viral load at HIV- serconversion. This is the first study to demonstrate schos effect on HIV-1 susceptibility and control and to differentiate by gender.
Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is one of the most variable regions in the human genome with respect to copy number variation. Despite its importance for cellular function, virtually nothing is known about what governs rDNA copy number and sequence stability in the mammalian genome. We applied computational and droplet PCR to measure rDNA copy in normal and cancer states in human and mouse genomes. We find that rDNA copy and sequence can change in cancer genomes. Counterintuitively, human cancer genomes show loss of rDNA copies accompanied by global copy number variation. The sequence can also be more variable in cancer genomes. Cancer with lower rDNA have mutational evidence of mTOR activity. The PTEN phosphatase is a tumor suppressor that is critical for genome stability and negative regulator of mTOR pathway. Surprisingly, consistent with human cancer, hematopoietic stem cells from PTEN-/- mouse leukemia have lower rDNA than normal, despite increased rRNA and protein synthesis. Loss occurs early and is with hypersensitivity to DNA. Therefore, loss is recurrent in cancers with mTOR.
Infection with Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium ) is a major cause of disease in humans and animals worldwide. The dynamics of bacterial growth, death, and spread within mammalian hosts are not fully understood. Here, we used a novel approach to study the spatiemporal dynamics of S. Tyimium during infection in mice. We infected mice with wild-type and isogenic strains of S. Tyium, which are phenotypically identical but can be distinguished by quantitative PCR. This allowed us to estimate the death rate of bacteria based on the disappearance of strains over time. We found that shortly after infection, concom death and rapid bacterial replication lead to the establishment of independent bacterial populations in different organs, controlled by host antimicrobial mechanisms. Later, decreased mortality leads to an increase in the number of bacteria that spread locally, with mixing of bacteria between organs via bactemia and further selection. Our approach provides an unprecedented view of the pathogenesis of S. Tyim, illustrating the complex and stochastic effects that drive infectious disease.
Binocular 3D motion perception is the process by which the brain interprets the motion of objects in 3D space based on information from the two eyes. The inverse problem of binocular 3D motion is the process by which the brain recovers the 3D motion of an object from 2D retinal images. Current theories of binocular 3D motion are based on interocular velocity difference, changing disparity over time, and joint encoding of motion and disparity. However, these theories do not provide a general solution to the inverse problem of binocular 3 motion. Instead, we propose that local velocity in combination with binocular disparity and other cues provide a more flexible framework for the solution of the inverse problem. In the context of the aperture problem, we derive two plausible strategies: (1) the normal prefers slow motion in 3D and (2) the cyclopean based on slow in 2. Predicting motion for ambiguous motion provides an opportunity to distinguish between these strategies of 3D processing. Our results suggest that velocity and disparity from tracking are needed to solve the inverse of 3 motion. It is plausible that motion and disparity are processed in parallel and integrated in the hierarchy.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes anionic O-acetylated exopolysaccharide alginate during chronic infection in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. Four proteins have been implicated in alginate O-acetylation: AlgJ and AlgX. We determined the structure of Alg to 1. 83 Å resolution. Alg is a SGN hydrolase-like protein with a conserved catalytic triad composed of D190, H192 and S288 and exhibits acetylester activity in vitro. Alg exhibits a distinctly different electrostatic surface compared to the N-terminal of AlgX. We identified residues in Alg that form an extensive network of interactions critical for alginate O-acetylation in vivo. We compared the abilities of Alg and Alg to bind and acety alginate using electrospray ion mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Alg exhibits weak or no binding to polymuronic acid while Alg binds polymuronic in a length-dependent manner. Additionally, Alg utilizes acetyl-donor 4-nrophenyl acetate to catalyze alginate Oetylation. Our results suggest Alg and Alg have separate roles in alginate Oety. Our model places Alg as terminaltransfer and provides rationale for variability in proteins required for polyschar Oety.
Candida albicans is one of the most common causes of human fungal infections and a major source of mortality. It is able to evade detection by the innate immune system by masking its cell wall with a heavily glycosylated outer layer of mannan. However, mutations or drugs that disrupt the cell wall can lead to exposure of β 1, 3 -glan ( unmasking ) and detection by innate cells through receptors like Dectin, C-type lectin. We previously showed that the pathway synthesizing phospholipid phosphatylser ( PS ) plays a role in β 1 3 -glan masking. The homozygous PS synthase mutant, choΔ, exhibits increased exposure β 1 3 -glan. The MAPK pathways and upstreamho small Gases are important for cell biogenesis and remodeling. In choΔ, both C1 and M1 are constitutively activated and act downstream of smallases C42 andho, respectively. In addition, C42 is upregulated inΔ. It was hypothesized that activation of C42ho orho and their kinases cause unmask. Disruption of M1 does not decrease unmask inΔ and hyperactivation ofho in wild increases unmask and activation of C1 and M. Moreover, hyperactivation of kinase in wild cells leads to C1 activation and β 3 -an exposure. Upregulation of C1 pathway causes unmask and may be responsible for unmask inΔ.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias are major public health challenges that require additional insight into their molecular pathogenesis. We performed a genome-wide association study of known genetic loci for AD using neuropathologic data from 4, 914 brain autopsies. Neuropath data were used to define clinico-path AD or controls, assess neuropath features of AD ( neuritic plaques, NPs; neurofibr tangles, NFT ) and evaluate coorbid neuropath changes: cerebral amyloid angiopathy ( C ), Lewy disease ( L ) hippocal sclerosis of the ( HS ) and brain injury ( V ). We observed genome-wide significance for clin-path AD, NPs, NFT, C and L with variants in apolipoprotein E ( APO ) Galc transfer 7 ( GAL7 ) ATPinding Subfamily G Member 1 (WHITE ) and intergenic on chromosome 9 for NP; Potassium Conductance Subfamily M Beta 2 (KCMB ) for HS. Twelve non-APO genetic loci for clinically AD were confirmed in our sample: CR, BIN, CL, MS, PICAL, ABC, CD, PTK, SOR, MEF, ZW, and C with 9 of these showing larger odds ratio in our sample. Correlation effect sizes for AD with NFT or NPs showed positive, while for V showed negative. Other coor neuropath features only showed nominal association with known loc. Our results discovered new associations with neuropath and aligned genetic for AD with neuropath in the largest AD and dement study.
The role of urea in the unfolding of proteins at the proteome scale is still not fully understood. We have analyzed 30 representative proteins of all native folds using molecular dynamics simulations with a range of force fields. We derived rules for urea unfolding that are valid at the proteome level. Irrespective of fold, presence or absence of disulfide bridges, and secondary structure, urea concentrates in the first solvation shell of native proteins with lower density than the unfolded. Urea does not alter spontaneous protein vibrations, but reduces their magnitude, slowing atomic motions that oppose unfolding. Urea stick and diffusion is crucial for unfolding. Long urea around hydrophobic core stabilizes partially open structures generated by thermal fluctuations. Our simulations indicate ure does not favor open microstates, but is not a spectator of unfolding that displaces the folded→unfolded equilibrium. On the contrary, ure actively unfolds: selects and stabilizes partially microstates, driving conformation far from native and sampled during unfolding.
Dengue fever is a major public health problem in Colombia. Between 2000 and 2011, deng fever was characterized by a stable annual number of cases with major outbreaks in 2001–2003 and 2010. The majority of deng cases were among those <15 years of age. Most of the country was affected by the 201 outbreak.
Leishmaniasis (TL) is a disease of the skin and mucosal tissues caused by Leishmania parasites. In addition to Leishiasis, patients may concurrently carry other pathogens that can influence the clinical outcome of the disease. This review focuses on the frequency of coinfections in human populations, interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens in animal and human subjects, and implications for clinical practice. TL is defined as all forms of cutaneous ( localised, disseminated or ) and mucocutaneous leishias. We searched MEDLINE and other databases and included 73 records: 21 studies in animals and 52 in human subjects ( mainly cross-sectional and case studies ). Several reports describe the frequency of Trypanosoma cruzi coinfection in TL patients in Argentina ( about 41% ) and frequency of helminthias in TL in Brazil (15% to 88% ).
Genetic variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) affects CD4:CD8 lineage commitment and MHC expression. However, the contribution of specific genes in this gene region has not been resolved. Here we assessed the impact of genetic variation on MHC expression and CD4:8 commitment using two rat models. We mapped Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) associated with variation MHC I and CD4:8 cell ratio in outbred heterogeneous rats. We identified 10 QTL across the genome and found QTL for individual colocalized within a region spanning MHC. We generated a panel of M-recombinant congenic strains and refined QTL to two intervals ∼0. 25 Mb in M-I and II regions. An interaction between intervals affected M class expression as well as selection commitment of CD8-positive (SP) thymocytes. We mapped effect to transporter associated antigen 2 (Tap) in M-II and classical M class (RT-A) in-I. This was revealed by recombination between RT-A and Tap, which occurred 0.2% of rats. Variants Tap have been shown to influence antigenicity M class by altering ligand. Our results show a restricted repertoire M class leads to negative CD8 cells.
Chagas disease is a major public health problem in Spain due to the large number of migrants from Latin America. We analyzed the Spanish National Hospital Discharge Database ( CMB ) to describe the disease’s evolution from 1997 to 2011. We performed a retrospective study using CMB information on hospitalizations for Chagas. Data was divided into two periods: 199-2004 and 2005-201. We calculated hospital rates and described clinical characteristics. We used multivariable logistic regression to calculate odds-ratio (OR ) for association between conditions and hospitalization with organation. A total 172 hospitalizations were identified. Hospital rates were 18 and 242.8/000 population. The median age was 35 (0-87 ), 74% were female and the 16-45 age group was mostly (69.8 ). Overall 23.4 hospitalizations included Chagas with complications. Being male [OR 1.3 (1.00.77 ), aged 45-64 [OR 2. (1.42.71 ] and hospital cost above 3,065 [OR 2. (.73.86 ] were associated with organation. Since 2005, infections increased in Spain. Patients were mostly asymptomatic women of fertile age and conditions with organation underline the need for early detection of cruz.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic markers associated with complex diseases. However, the “missing heritability” remains elusive. Combinatorial interactions may account for a substantial portion of this missing heritability, but have been impeded by computational complexity and genetic heterogeneity. We present Blocuster, a systems-level approach that constructs genome-wide, allele-specific networks that segregates homogenous combinations of genetic factors and tests associations with the phenotype. Blocuster employs a correlation measure customized for single nucleotide polymorphisms and captures genetic heterogeneity. We applied Blocuster to psoriasis, discovering a combinator pattern with odds ratio 3.64 and Bonferr-corrected p-value 5.01×10−16. This was replicated in independent data, reflecting robustness of method. Blocuster improves prediction of disease and broadens understanding of psoriasis pathogenesis.
Rare and de novo copy number variants (CNVs) are more prevalent in agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) than in cerebellar hypoplasia (CH) or polymicrogyria (PM). We conducted a large-scale CNV discovery effort in 255 ACC, 220 CH, and 147 PM patients, and 2,349 controls. Compared to controls, significantly more ACC but not CH or PM patients had rare CNVs over one megabase (p=1.48×10−3; odds ratio [OR]=3.19; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.89–5.39 ). Rare CNVs impacted at least one gene less 1% of combined patients and controls. More ACC but not CH or PM patients had CNVs over genes (p=.01;OR=2.95%CI=1.69–5.18 ). Independent PCR confirmed 9.4% ACC had de novo CNVs, in comparison to inherited CN. These preferentially overlapped de novo CN previously in patients with autism spectrum disorders (p=3.06×10−;OR=7.95%CI=2.–23.72 ). We also confirmed and refined known CN, including 8p.1–p.1 present 2% current ACC. We found novel CN, each single patient likely deleterious deletions 1.–.31.,1,1.–.31.3,5.–., and duplications 2–.– and 14.–. One patient microcephaly had paternally deletion 16. that included N1. Exome sequencing revealed recessive matally inherited nonsense in non-deleted N1 allele. This is first systematic CN in congenital brainform, shows higher large CN in ACC than CH and PM.
Regeneration in planarians is a complex process that requires the integration of proliferation, differentiation, and patterning of tissues to the proper size and scale. However, the integration of these processes with wound responses remains relatively unknown. Here, we investigated the role of the effector of the Hippo signalling cascade, Yorkie, during planarian regeneration and its role in restricting injury responses. We used RNA interference ( RNAi ) to deplete Yorkie in planarians and found that wound responses were hyperactivated, with both stem cell proliferation and transcriptional wound programs heightened and prolonged. We also uncovered novel wound-induced genes by RNAseq that were repressed in Yorkie RNAi animals compared to controls. Additionally, we found that Yorkie RNAi animals had expanded epidermal and muscle populations, which we hypothesize are sources of wound-induced genes. Finally, we found that Yorkie RNAi animals could not sense the size of an injury by the eyes, pharynx, brain, and midline, and could not remodel or scale to the size of the regenerating fragment. Our results suggest that Yorkie functions as a key molecule that integrates multiple aspects of injury including proliferation, apoptosis, injury transcription, and patterning.
Exosomes secreted by enterovirus 71 (EV71)-infected cells contain viral RNA and miR-146 that facilitate viral replication in recipient cells by suppressing type I interferon response. EV71 infection results in increased exosome secretion and differential packaging of viral RNA and mi-146 into exosomes. We show that mi-146 is preferentially packaged in exosomes while viral RNA is not. Exosomes contain replication-competent EV71 RNA complex with mi-146, Ago2, and GW182 and mediate EV71 transmission independent of virus-specific receptor. Exosomal RNA is transferred to and replicates in new cell while exosomal mi-146 suppresses type I interferon response in cell, facilitating viral replication. Exosomal mi-146 suppresses IFN-stimulated gene (ISGs) BST2/tether, involved in EV71-induced exosome secretion. In vivo study, exosomal RNA accumulates in tissue compared to free virus.
Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( PINK ) is a protein required for mitochondrial homeostasis and is mutated in early-onset Parkinson’s disease. Parkin is another protein mutated in early-onset Parkinson’s disease and has been suggested to function downstream of PINK based on genetic studies in Drosila. PINK is a serine/threon kinase with a predicted mitochondrial sequence and probable transmembrane domain at the N-terminus, while Park is a RING finger protein with ubiquitin ligase activity. However, how PINK and Park regulate mitochondrial activity is largely unknown. Here we report that PINK binds to a mitochondrial protein, PG5, which modulates the PINK pathway. Loss of PG5 in Drosila suppresses muscle degeneration, motor defects, and shorter lifespan resulting from PINK inactivation and can be attributed to mitochondrial degeneration. However, PG5 inactivation fails to modulate phenotypes of Park mutant flies. Conversely, ectopic expression of PG5 exacerbates PINK and Park phenotypes. These results suggest PG5 negatively regulates PINK related to maintenance of mitochondria, and further that PG5 acts between PINK and Park, or independently of Park downstream PINK.
Mycobacterium ulcer is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer (BU), a chronic necrotizing skin disease associated with the production of the cytotoxic macide exotoxin mycolone. Despite extensive research, the type of immune responses elicited against this pathogen and effector functions conferring protection against BU are not fully understood. Histopathological analyses of BU lesions have demonstrated mainly extracellular localization of toxin producing acid fast bacilli, but there is evidence for an early intracellular growth phase of M ulcerans. We investigated whether interferonγ might play a role in containing M ulcer infections. In a Buruli mouse model we found that interferγ is a critical regulator of host defense against ulcer infections. Interferγ knockout mice displayed faster progression of infection compared to wild-type mice. This was reflected in faster and more extensive tissue necrosis and oedema, as well as higher bacterial burden after five weeks infection, indicating mice lacking interferγ reduced capacity to kill intracellular bacilli during early intracellular growth of ulcer.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the mitochondria is a major factor in many diseases. However, the mechanism of hypoxia-induced ROS production is not fully understood. We developed a new methodology to mathematically analyze this mechanism, taking into account all possible redox states in the electron transport chain. This allowed us to identify two steady modes of operation (bistability) of respiratory complex III at the same conditions. Various perturbations could induce transition from one mode to another. Normally, complex III is in low ROS mode, but anoxia can switch it to high ROS mode, which persists after oxygen return. We qualitatively validated this prediction experimentally, explaining anox-induced cell damage.
Drosophila melanogaster embryos are used as a model to study the role of genes in pattern formation. The gap gene network is the first regulatory tier in the hierarchy of genes involved in specifying body segment position. Here, we investigate the effect of the terminal gene huckin ( hkb ) on gap expression using an integrative, systems approach. We present Hkb protein expression data to include it in gap gene models. Gap models are used to extract regulatory information from spatial data by fitting to expression patterns and obtain estimates for parameters. Our models are in agreement with earlier results and extend them in two respects: Hkb is required for the anterior shift of the posterior hunch ( hb ) border, which is reproduced in our models. Our models are able to reproduce mutants of terminal genes while published models were unable to reproduce any correctly. Our models capture the expression of all posterior genes and variational properties of the system.
Brucellos is an important zoonotic disease that causes significant economic losses worldwide. Currently, there is no effective immunotherapy for Bruclos or biomarker to monitor the efficacy of therapy. Treatment is ineffective and animals remain lifelong carriers. We report the successful immunotherapy of bovine Bruclos by phage lysates of RB51 ( RL ) and S19 ( SL ). RL induced strong antibody response and stimulated cell mediated immunity ( CMI ). In vitro restimulation of leukocytes from immunized cattle induced interferon production. A single subcutaneous dose of 2 ml cocktail of lysate ( RL and SL ) eliminated virulent Brucella from Bruclos affected cattle with undetectable level of Bruc specific amplicon by RT-PCR and negative for Bruc by culture 3 post-immunization. This is the first report on minimally invasive monitoring of antibacterial therapy employing RNA specific for bacteria as biomarker and use of RB51 phage lysate for immunotherapy Bruclos in cattle.
Cell cycle progression is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are also involved in the response to DNA damage. However, it is difficult to assign precise functions to specific CDKs in maintaining genomic integrity. In mammals, CDK2 is active during S and G2 phases, but CD2 is dispensable for survival due to compensation by other CDKs. To uncover a requirement for CD2 activity in human cells, we replaced wild-type CD2 with a mutant sensitive to inhibition by adenosine analogs. We show that transient inhibition of analog-sensitive CD2 after ionizing radiation enhances cell killing. CD2 phosphorylates the Nijegen Syndrome gene product N1—a component of the conserved MRN complex required for DNA repair and checkpoint—on a CD recognition site at Ser432. In vivo, inhibition of CD2 delayed N1-Ser phosphorylation during S and mutation of Ser to Ala or Asp increased IR sensitivity.
Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified many genetic variants associated with hematological traits, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction. However, it is challenging to turn these findings into biological mechanisms. We applied the formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) method in megakaryocytes and erythroblasts to map active regulatory elements at loci associated with these traits. We found that the two cell types exhibit distinct patterns of open chromatin and that open chromatin guides the finding of functional variants. We identified an open chrom region at 7q22. 3 in megaryocytes but not erythroblasts that harbors the non-coding variant rs342 known to be associated with platelet volume. Resequencing this region in 643 individuals provided strong evidence that rs342 is the causative variant. We showed that C and G differentially bind transcription factor EV1 affecting PIKCG expression in platelets and macrophages. A protein interaction network in Pikcg knockout mice indicated PI3 is associated with pathways in platelet biogenesis and thrombus formation. Thus, rs342 is the functional variant at this locus.
Respiratory rhythm generation in the pre-Bötzinger complex (preötC ) is thought to be generated by a persistent sodium current (INa ). However, the effects of pharmacological blockade of INa are often assumed to be equivalent, regardless of the mechanism of the blocker. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate that this assumption may not always be correct. We simulated the blockade of INa via two pharmacological mechanisms: (1 ) pore obstruction by tetrodotoxin and (2 ) altered inactivation by ruzole. The effects of tetroxin and ruz in respiratory circuits are diverse and have led to debate about the role of INa in respiratory. Our results match experimental data from preöt neurons to the respiratory network and generate experimentally testable predictions. We provide a mechanistic explanation for seemingly contradictory results in vitro INa block, show that INa block in vitro is not equivalent to intact preparations, explain why ruz fails to block INa in the network, and predict that low tetroxin will stop respiratory rhythm in the network.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to play important roles in tumor metastasis. Here, we describe the regulation and function of mi-218 in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. We found that mi-218 expression is decreased along with the expression of its host gene Slit in metastatic GC. However, Rob1, one of several Slit receptors, is negatively regulated by mi-218, thus establishing a negative feedback loop. Decreased mi-218 levels eliminate Rob1 repression, which activates the Sl-Robo pathway through interaction between Rob1 and Slit2, thus triggering metastasis. The restoration of mi-218 suppresses Rob1 expression and inhibits tumor invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo.
Transcriptional Profiling Uncovers a Network of Cholesterol-Responsive Atherosclerosis Genes: Atherosclerosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in coronary artery disease and stroke. Despite the well-documented effects of lipid lowering therapies on atherosclerosis, the transcriptional response in atherosclerotic lesions has not been carefully investigated. We performed transcription profiling in atherosclerosis-prone mice with hypercholesterolemia and genetic lowering of plasma lipoproteins. Atheroscler lesions progressed slowly, then rapidly, and plateaued after advanced lesions formed. Analysis of expression indicated accumulation of lipid-poor macrophages led to rapid expansion with foam-cell formation and inflammation, supported by histology. Lowering plasma cholesterol prevented formation of advanced plaques and profiling identified 37 cholesterol-responsive genes mediating this effect. Validation by siRNA inhibition in macrophages incubated with ac-LDL revealed a network of eight cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes regulating cholesterol accumulation. We have identified a network of atheros genes in response to cholesterol preventing formation of advanced plaques. This should be of interest for development of atherosclerosis therapies.
The envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is a formidable barrier that is difficult for antimicrobial drugs to penetrate. Thus, the list of effective treatments against these organisms is small and the rise of new resistance is rapidly shrinking. We developed a simple, quantitative, high-throughput assay for mutants with envelopeogenesis defects and used to screen an ordered-gene library of Escherich coli. The screen was robust and correctly identified mutants known to be involved in assembly. Importantly, the screen implicated 102 genes of unknown as factors that likely impact biogenesis. As proof of principle, one of these, Ely, was characterized and shown to play a role in metabolism of the lipid used for biogenesis of wall and other bacterial polysacides.
Multivariate dynamical processes in biological systems are increasingly studied using a variety of techniques, each revealing unique features of the system. One of the challenges is developing systematic approaches to fuse heterogeneous datasets into an integrated view of multivariate dynamics. We demonstrate that heterogeneous data can be successfully fused within a semi-supervised learning framework that exploits the geometry of high-dimensional data. We illustrate our approach using a dataset from studies of pattern formation in Drosophila. The result is a continuous trajectory that reveals joint dynamics of gene expression, subcellular localization, protein phosphorylation and morphogenesis.
Snake venom hemorrhagic metalloproteinases (SVMPs) of the PI, PII and PIII classes were compared in terms of tissue localization and their ability to hydrolyze basement components in vivo, as well as by proteomics analysis of exudates collected in injected tissue with these. Immunohistochemical analyses co-localization of these SVs with type IV collagen revealed that PII and III SVs co-localized with IV collagen in capillaries, arterioles and postillary vles to higher than PI SV, which showed more distribution in tissue. The patterns hydrolysis by these SVs of lamin, type collagen and nidogen in vivo differ, whereas three showed similar pattern of IV, supporting concept hydroly of this is critical destabilization microessel leading hemorrhage.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the homeotic genes are located on the chromosome in the order of the body segments they affect. The more posterior genes repress the anterior genes. However, this rule is qualified in the case of abdominal-A ( ab-A ) by abdominal-B ( Abd ). Abd mutants show ectopic expression of ab-A in the epidermis of the eighth segment, but not the central nervous system. Repression in these cells is accomplished by a 92 kb noncoding RNA, “iab-8”. This RNA produces a micro to repress ab-A and has a second redundant mechanism that only acts “in. Transcription interference with ab-A promoter is most likely.
Focal seizures are episodes of pathological brain activity that arise from a localised areas of the brain and have been distinguished into two types: low-amplitude fast oscillations (LAF) and high-amplitude spikes (HAS). Here, we explore whether these patterns arise from fundamentally different mechanisms. We use a previously established model of neocortical tissue and validate it using clinical recordings of focal seizures. We reproduce the two patterns in their defining properties and investigate the mechanisms underlying different seizure patterns in the model. We find that LAF is initiated by independent patches of local activity which invade surrounding tissue and coalesce over time. In contrast, HAS is a global transition to a seizure state triggered by a local event. This transition is enabled by an increase in excitability of surrounding tissue which itself does not generate seizures but can support activity when initiated. In simulations, the difference in excitability offers a simple explanation of clinically reported outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate how changes in excitability could be elucidated using stimulation. Our results suggest that excitability of surrounding the seizure core plays a role in onset as well as outcome.
Defensin-like ZES4 Mediates Pollen Tube Burst via Opening of the Potassium Channel KZ1 in Maize. In flowering plants, pollen is transported to the female gametophyte via the pollen tube. Upon arrival at the female gamophyte, two sperm cells are discharged into the synergid to execute fertilization. The players involved in gametophyte signaling to pollen tube arrest have been identified. However, the mechanisms leading to pollen burst and sperm discharge remained unknown. Here, we describe the role of defensin-like cyste-rich protein ZES4 ( Zea mays embryo ) in pollen growth arrest, burst, and sperm release. ZES4 is exclusively expressed in female gamophyte cells. Z4-GFP proteins accumulate in secretory vesicles of syner cells and are released during fertilization. Using RNAi knockdown and Z4 proteins, we found Z4 induces pollen burst in species-preferential. Pollen plasma depolarization occurs after Z4 application, as well as channel experiments point a role of K+-flux in tube rupture. Finally, we discovered the rectifying K channel K1 as direct Z4 target. Following Z4, K1 opens at physiological potentials and closes after wash. We suggest that Z4-containing vesicles are released from syner upon male-female signaling. Subsequent interaction Z4 and K1 results channel opening and K influx. We suggest K influx leads to water uptake and culminates osmotic tube.
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been engineered to selectively infect and kill cancer cells expressing the HER2 protein, which is overexpressed in ovarian and breast carcinomas. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of systemically delivered HSV against disseminated ovarian and breast carcinomas in mouse models that recapitulate the spread to the peritoneum in women. Human ovarian SKOV-3 cells implanted intraperitoneally in immunodeficient mice gave rise to progressive peritoneal carcinomatosis mimicking the fatal condition in patients. Intraperitoneal administration of HSV strongly inhibited carcinomatosis, with 60% of mice free from peritone diffusion and 95% reduction in total neoplastic nodules. Intraperitone metastases are common in breast cancer: intraperitoneal administration of HSV inhibited growth of ovarian metastases in HER2+ MDA-MB-453 cells. Brain metastases were also reduced. Cumulatively, intraper administration of HER-redirected oncolytic HSV reduced growth of ovarian and breast disseminated to peritone cavity.
Centrosome duplication is essential for bipolar spindle formation and genome maintenance and is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Our study identifies Sfi, a conserved centrosomal protein, as the first Cd substrate required to restrict centome duplication to once per cycle. We found that reducing Cdk phosphorylation of Sfi by changing phosphorylation sites to nonphosphorylatable residues leads to defects in separation of duplicated spindle bodies (SPBs, centomes) and inappropriate SP reduplication during mitosis. These cells display defects in bipolar assembly, segregation, and growth.
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a major cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The role of Vpr, an HIV-1-encoded protein, in HIV-1 infection and AIDS remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that V causes G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HIV-1-infected cells in vitro. V is conserved in transmitted/founder HIV-1s and primate lentiviruses, which are evolutionarily related to HIV-1. Here, we show that V causes G2 cycle arrest and apoptosis in proliferating CCR+ CD+ T cells, mainly consisting of regulatory T cells (Tregs), resulting in T depletion and enhanced virus production during acute infection. V-dependent replication and T depletion are observed in C5-tropic but not CX4ropic HIV-1-infected mice, suggesting these are dependent on coreceptor by HIV-1. Immune is observed in C5ropic wild-type but V-deficient HIV-1-infected humanized mice. When mice were treated with denileuk difoxin (DD) to deplete Tregs, DD-treated mice showed activation/proliferation of memory cells compared to untreated. This activation/proifer enhanced C5 in memory CD+ cells and rendered them more susceptible to5ropic wild-type HIV-1 than V-deficient virus. These results suggest V takes advantage of proliferating C5 CD+ cells enhancing viremia5ropic HIV-1. Tregs exist in higher state than other subsets T, appear more vulnerable to V during HIV-1 infection.
Malaria was eliminated in South Korea in the late 1970s, but re-emerged in 1993. To control malaria and evaluate the effectiveness of controls, it is important to understand the genetic structure of the parasite. We analyzed microsatellite markers of the P. viv genome from 163 isolates collected 199 to 2008. We used 14 microsatellite loci to analyze linkage disequilibrium ( LD ), genetic differentiation, and population structure to estimate temporal change in the parasite. The analysis showed a decrease in LD and genetic differentiation between successive years. The population structure based on Bayesian suggested a drastic change in Korea during 200 and 200. Although relapse and asymptomatic carriage might influence the structure, our results suggested continual introduction of P. viv into Korea through other sources. One source, particularly 200 and 200, is Korea.
Transcription by a splicing-competent introns is an evolutionarily conserved feature among eukaryotes. We show that the intron is an important regulator of promoter direction. In the presence of an intr, transcription of mRNA is favored over upstream antisense transcripts (uaRNA) initiating from the promoter. Mutation of the 5′ or 3′ splice site results in reversal of promoter direction, suggesting it is not the 5′ splice site but the entire splicing-competent intr that regulates direction. ChIP analysis reveals recruitment of termination factors near the promoter in presence of intr. Removal of intr or mutation of splice sites affects localization of termination factors. The intr-mediated enhancement of transcription is dependent on gene looping. We show that looping is crucial for recruitment of termination factors in promoter-prox region of intr-containing gene. In looping-defective, despite splicing, promoter factors for poly (A)-dependent termination are compromised. This is accompanied by loss of direction.
Domestic pigs carrying a single nucleotide mutation in the intron 3 of the IGF2 gene exhibit a 3-fold upregulation of IGF expression in skeletal muscle. This results in major effects on muscle size, heart, and fat deposition. We have identified the repressor of IGF expression and named ZBED, a novel transcription factor previously unknown in placental mammals. ZBED is derived from an exapted DNA transposon. Silencing Zbed in mouse C2C myoblasts affects Igf expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) using C2C cells identified 2,500 ZBED binding sites in the genome. The deduced consensus motif matches the established site in IGF. Genes associated with ZBED sites show significant enrichment for Gene Ontology classifications including development and transcription.
The RNA editome of the rhesus macaque, a close relative of human, has been comprehensively characterized by combining genome and transcriptome sequencing of multiple tissues from the same animal. We identified 31, 250 editing sites, of which 99. 8% are A-to-G transitions. We verified 96. 6% of sites in coding regions and 97. 5% in non-coding regions by multiple means, demonstrating the feasibility of our paradigm. We found that adenosine deamination is associated with the mac editome, with A-to-G sites flanked by ADAR substrates, and the context and expression of ADs are relevant in determining the variance of editing across sites and tissue types. We detected decreased divergence around editing sites, suggesting evolutionary constraint in maintaining these substrates with double-stranded structure.
Perceptual bias reveals suboptimal population decoding of sensory responses in two-altern visual discrimination tasks. In these tasks, observers integrate noisy neural responses into a more reliable representation of the likelihood that the stimuli under consideration evoked the observed responses. Importantly, an ideal observer should be able to evaluate likelihood with high precision and only the likelihood of the relevant stimuli involved in the discrimination. We report a perceptual bias suggesting that observers read the likelihood with remarkably low precision when discriminating spatial frequencies. Using spectrally filtered noise, we induced asymmetry in the likelihood of spatial frequency. This mainly affects the likelihood of spatial that are irrelevant to the task. Nevertheless, we find a significant in grating frequency, that observers evaluate likelihood of a range of irrelevant and discard knowledge of stimulus when performing two-altern discrimination.
Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play a conserved role in defending the genome against foreign genetic elements. In C. elegans, piRNAs are derived from a long polycistronic RNA. Here, we show that C. elegans piRNA is a tiny, autonomous transcriptional unit. The minimal C. eleg piRNA cassette requires a 21 nucleotide (nt) piRNA and ∼50nt upstream motif with limited genomic context for expression. We demonstrate that this motif is necessary for expression of gerine-enriched, Pi-dependent piRNA. We show that a single nucleotide within this motif directs gerine enrichment. Over 70% of C eleg piRNAs are selectively expressed in male or female gerine and comparison of their targets suggests they have evolved independently. Our results indicate that C eleg piRNA motifs act as promoters to specify which sequences are piRNAs, how abundantly they are expressed, and in gerine.
Brucella species replicate within host cells in the form of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vacuoles. During Bruc infection, the IRE pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in a time-dependent manner, while the PER and ATF pathways are not activated. This is accompanied by the upregulation of COPI vesicle components Sar, Sec23, and Sec24. We identified a novel host factor, YipA, responsible for activation of the IRE pathway in response to tunicamycin treatment and Bruc infection. YA is responsible for phosphorylation of IRE through high-order assembly of Ire molecules at ER exit sites (RES) under UPR conditions. InipA-knockdown cells Bruc fail to generate ER-derived vacoles and remain in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. These results indicate that activation of theRE pathway and formation of ER-derived vacoles are critical foruc to establish a safe niche, and is indispensable for these processes.
Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and carnation Italian ringspot virus (CV) are positive-strand RNA viruses that depend on host factors and cellular pathways to support replication. We show that both viruses recruit the cellular V34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) into the viral replication compartment. The function of V34 is critical for TV replication, suggesting that PI3 phosphoinoside is utilized by TV to build the replication compartment. We observed increased expression of V34 and higher abundance of PI3 in the presence of tombusiral proteins, leading to efficient TV replication. Overexpression of PI phosphatase in yeast or plants inhibited TV replication on peroxomal membranes and CV on mitochondrial membranes. Moreover, purified phosphatase reduced TV assembly in a cell-free system. Detection of PI with antibody or probe revealed enrichment of PI in replication compartment. V34 is recruited into replication through interaction with p33 protein. Gene analysis in yeast unraveled that TV requires vesicle function of34. In absence of34, TV cannot efficiently recruit Rab-positive endosomes which provide PE-rich membranes for TV compartment biogenesis. We found V34 and PI needed for stability of33 protein which is degraded by 26 proteasome when PI abundance was decreased by inhibitor34.
Dengue virus (DENV) transmission from humans to mosquitoes represents a critical component of deng epidemiology. However, examinations of this process have been hampered by a lack of methods that adequately represent natural acquisition of DENV by mosquitoes. In this study, we assessed artificial and natural feeding based rates of DENV infection and dissemination within mosquitoes for use in field-based epidemiological study in Iqu, Peru. Participants 5 years and older with 5 days of fever were enrolled from clinic and neighborhood studies deng in Iqu. Wild, laboratory Aedes aegypt mosquitoes were fed on febrile individuals or blood collected that was untreated or treated with EDTA. Mosquitoes were tested after days of extrinsic incubation for D infection and dissemination. A total 58 participants with virem ranging 1.3 ×102 to 2.9 ×106 per mL participated one or more methods. DENV and dissemination rates were not different following direct and indirect-ED feeding; however, they were lower for that fed on blood no additive. Relative direct infection rates showed greater indirect-ED than indirect-no feeding. Dissemination rates were across all methods. No differences in D or dissemination in fed participants with different deng illness. Our study demonstrates direct and indirect methods for field studies vector. Direct is preferable in terms of ease, security, and reliability.
Topoisomerase II poisons are a class of chemotherapeutic drugs that target the enzyme topoisomerase II, which is involved in DNA replication and transcription. However, patients vary in their response to these drugs, and the causes of this variability are not well understood. Here, we show that the nematode Caenorhabitis elegans varies in its sensitivity to topois II poisons, and use an unbiased approach to demonstrate that this variation is due to a single amino acid substitution in topomerase II (TOP-2). We show that the presence of a non-polar methion at this residue increases hydrophobic interactions between TOP-2 and etoposide, compared to a polar glutamine. This results in increased genomic instability in strains that contain methion. The affected residue is conserved from yeast to humans and is one of the few differences between human topomerase isoforms (methion in hTOIα and glut in hIβ). We show that this difference influences cytotoxicity of topois poisons in human cell lines.
Long-lived rodents, such as naked mole-rats, have life expectancies that are multiple times higher than those of their phylogenetically closely related short-lived rodents. To gain insights into the genetic mechanisms determining mammalian lifespan, we obtained genomic and transcriptomic data from 17 rodent species and scanned for evolutionary branches associated with the evolution of longevity. We identified 250 positively selected genes (PSGs ) in the liver of long-lived naked-rats and short-lived rats that fit the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging. PSGs were enriched for genes related to cellular respiration, ion homeostasis, as well as processes regulated by the mTOR pathway: translation, autophagy and inflammation. PSGs included RHE, a regulator of mTOR, IGF, central components of aging-relevant pathways, as well as genes unknown to be aging but convincing candidates, e. g. RBL,HR,SM1PG andGER. Exempl protein modeling suggests functional consequences for amino changes under selection.
Aedes albopictus is a major vector of several important arboviruses, including chikungunya, dengue and Zika. The endosymbion Wolbach is a bacterium that can be used to induce sterility in Ae. albictus and reduce its vector competence. In this study, a new Ae. albict line ( ARP-M ) was generated by introducing wMel Wolbach in the ARP line, which had previously been established by replacing wAlA and wB Wolbach with wip. The infection and fitness of ARP, ARP and wild-type Ae. albict were compared. AR-M showed 100% maternal inheritance of w and wip Wolbach. Survival, fecundity and fertility did not differ between Ae. albict lines. Crosses between AR-M males and wild Ae alb females were unfertile regardless of male age, while egg hatch increased from 0 to 17% with wild males from 3 to 17 days. When competing with wild males for females, AR-M induced sterility higher than expected ( Fried index 1.71 instead of 1. Wolbach density in AR females was about 15 fold higher than AR, mostly due w infection. This corresponded to reduced competence for chikunya andeng viruses (5 and 0% transmission at 14 and 21 post ) with AR females.
Many biological responses to intra- and extracellular stimuli are regulated by complex networks of transient protein-protein interactions, where a globular domains of one protein recognize linear peptides from another at a relatively small interface. These peptide stretches are often found in unstructured regions of proteins and contain a consensus motif complementary to the surface of their binding partners. Current methods for de novo discovery of motifs exploit their tendency to occur in disordered regions, but our work focuses on another observation: upon binding to their partner, motifs adopt a well-defined structure. We analyzed peptide-mediated interactions of known high-resolution 3D structures and found that the structure of the peptide may be characteristic of the consensus, helping to identify peptides that do not match established patterns. Motifs tend to have a stretched and elongated structure unlike other peptides of same length. We implemented a strategy based on Support Vector Machine that uses these features along with structure-encoded information about interfaces to search known 3D protein interactions and identify peptide-mediated among them. We also derived consensus for interactions whenever information available and compared with linear patterns and domains. Finally, we cross-validated our strategy by scanning interactomes of four organisms with derived to see if any occurred more expected. We found significant overrepresentations for 64-motif interactions, 46 not described, involving 6,000 interactions.
Environmental enteropathy (EE) is a condition associated with malabsorption of micronutrients and impaired responses to oral vaccines. We studied 49 adults with EE in Zambia using confocal endomicroscopy (CLE), histology, immunohistochemistry, and mRNA sequencing of intestinal biopsies. We correlated these with plasma lipopolyscharide (LPS) and zinc uptake. CLE images showed small intestinal epithelial defects at the tips of villi. Histology and claudin immunostaining corresponded with CLE images. Circulating LPS was correlated with shedding (β=0.83; P=0.035) and serum glucagon-like peptide-2 (β=-0.13;P=0.007). Zinc uptake was attenuated in 30/47 (64%) and reduced by HIV but correlated with GLP-2 (β=2.72;P=0.03). There was a U-shaped relationship between L and villus area. Transcript analysis identified 23 differentially expressed genes in EE, including peptides and proteins.
Viral superinfection is the process by which a virus infects a host cell that is already infected by the same or a similar virus. This is a common phenomenon that is not well understood. Here, we show that superinfection of turnip crinkle virus (TCV) is blocked by p28, one of the two proteins encoded by this virus. p28 is expressed from the TCV genome and blocks superinfection by a different TCV replicon. When p28 is expressed transiently delivered with or ahead of TCV replicon, it recapitulates this blocking activity. p28-mediated superin is enhanced by C-terminal epitope tags but weakened by N-terminal modifications and inversely correlates with p28 ability to complement p-defective TCV replic. Strikingly, p28-positive cells form large punctate inclusions that transaggregate non-superfective yet replication-compet p mutant. These results support a model that TCV superinfection is caused by p28 multimer formation capable of intercepting fresh p monomers from superector genomes, abolishing superector. This model could be applicable to other RNA viruses and offer novel antiviral targets.
Immunization of mice with the Trypanosoma cruzi transsialase (TS) gene using a plasmid DNA adenoviral vector and CpG-adjuanted protein has proven to be highly immunogenic and protective against acute lethal challenge. However, long-term protection by TS vaccines has not been reported. Here, we tested whether co-administration of plasm encoding IL-15 (pIL-15) could improve the duration of protection achieved by genetic vaccination with plasm encoding TS (pTS) alone. We immunized BALB mice with TS in the presence or absence of IL-15 and studied immune responses with TS-specific IF-γ ELISA, serum IgG ELISA, intracellular cytokine staining IF-γ, TN-α and IL-2, tetramer staining and CF dilution assays and protection against lethal challenge at 1 to 6 months post-vaccination. Mice receiving TS alone developed TS-specific IFγ responses and survived lethal challenge within first 3 months following immunization. Addition of IL to TS vaccination did not significantly alter T responses or protection during early postacc period. However, mice with TS and IL challenged 6 postacc were more protected against lethal T cruzi than TS alone (P0. 05). Improved protection correlated with higher TS-specific IFγ producing and CD+ T cells detected postimmunization Also, TS-specific T were better expand in vitro-stimulation. Addition IL during vaccination greatly improved long T survival cell, T expansion and long-term against important parasite T cruzi.
Trypanosoma brucei is a parasitic protozoan that causes sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in animals. It has a complex life cycle with two stages in the mammalian host and insect vector. The flagellum and basal body are essential for its motility and infectivity. Here, we show that the Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase composed of Cull4, the DNA-binding protein 1 homolog TbDB1 and the WD-repeat protein WDR controls the abundance of the Polo-like kinase TbK in the flagum and basal. WDR binds to TbK through its C-terminal PEST motif and to TbDB1 through its N-terminal WD motif. Depletion of WDR inhibits flagum duplication and basal segregation, disrupts the new flagum attachment filament and detaches the new flagum. Consistent with its role in TbK degradation, WDR depletion causes accumulation of TbK in the flag and basal, leading to phosphorylation of Cent2 in the flag at late cycle stages.
The DEAD-box helicase DDX3 plays a crucial role in the innate immune system as a mediator of antimicrobial immunity. We show that the sex-specific isoforms of DDX3 are important in the immune system. Mice lacking DDX3 have an altered leukocyte composition in bone marrow and spleen and are unable to combat Listeria monocytogenes infection. This results from decreased effector cell availability and impaired cytokine synthesis. Our data provide further evidence for a non-RIG-like helicase contribution to innate immunity and suggest it may contribute to sex differences in resistance to microbes and inflammatory disease.
A computational model of the insect pherone transduction cascade in the male moth olfactory neuron is presented. The model takes into account all pre-effector processes, including pherone translocation from air to sensillum, deactivation and interaction with receptors, and G-protein effector activation, and focuses on post-effector processes. These involve production and degradation of second messengers ( IP3 and DAG ), opening and closing of ionic channels ( IP-gated Ca2+, DAGated cation, Ca+-gated Cl−, and Ca+-voltage K+ ), and Ca+ extrusion. The network is regulated by modulators ( kinase and Ca+-modulin ) that exert inhibition on effector channels. The evolution of chemical species and currents and membrane response to pulse stimulation of various intensities were simulated. Parameters were fitted by comparison to amplitude and characteristics ( rising and falling ) of experimentally measured receptor at pherone. The model captures features of dose–response: wide range with amplitudes as experimental, short rising, and long. It also reproduces second kinetics.
Doxorubicin (DX)-treated human lymphoblast cells were used to elucidate how p53 sequences and chromatin interact to affect p53 binding and transactivation. We mapped p53 and H3K4me3 genome-wide binding in untreated and DX-treated cells and examined the relationships among p53 occupancy, gene expression, H3K4, chromatin accessibility (DNase hypersensitivity DHS ), EN chrom states, pRE, and evolutionary conservation. Inducible p53-regulated genes were associated with steady chromatin status. Highly inducible p-regulated genes were suppressed at baseline and marked by repressive histone modifications or CTC binding. pREs residing in different chrom contexts were compared: weaker pREs were in promoters, stronger pRE in enhancers and repressed chrom. p occupancy was correlated with similarity to pRE consensus but inversely correlated with DHS and conservation at pRE. Occupancy of pRE that overlapped transposable element (TE) repeats was higher and correlated with stronger pRE relative to non-associated pRE. Occupied pRE in L-like TEs were unique displaying negative Phylo scores and associated with altered H3me and DHS.
Synthetic biology aims to design and reengineer biological systems, with most efforts focused on transcriptional circuits. However, reengineering signaling circuits is hampered by limited understanding of their dynamics and experimental challenges. Bacterial two-component systems offer a rich diversity of sensory systems that are built around a phosphotransfer reaction between histidine kinases and response regulators, and are a good target for reengineering. Here, we explore the signal-response arising from a motif in two-component signaling. In this motif, a histidine ( HK ) phosphotfers reversibly to separate response ( RR ) proteins. We show that this motif allows rapid signal termination, whereby one RR acts as a sink towards the other ( i. e. the output ) and implements a sigmoidal signal relationship. We identify conditions on parameters that are necessary for sigmoid relationships and define parameters that control levels and sensitivity of the curve. We confirm findings by reconstitution of the HK RR motif in Sinorhizium meli chemaxis and measuring the resulting curve. We find that level of sigmoid in this can be controlled by the presence of RR and an auxiliary that binds HK ( Hill coefficients above ).
Single-cell RNA sequencing is used to quantify transcript heterogeneity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells treated with and without salt to explore population variation and identify cellular covariates that influence the stress transcriptome. We found significant variation in individual cells, both before and after stress. A subset of cells decouples expression of ribosomal genes from the stress response in a manner correlated with cell cycle but unrelated to yeast metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing fluorescent regulators, including transcription factor Msn2 with Dot, Sfp, or kinase Hog, revealed coordinated and decoupled nucleoplasmic shuttling.
Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite responsible for African trypanosomiasis, accumulates in large numbers in various organs and tissues, including the male reproductive organs of mice. We show that parasites can be detected in the male reproductive system by fine needle aspiration cytology. Histological analysis reveals that T. brucei accumulates in the stroma of the epididymis, epididymal adipose tissue and fibrous tunics of the testis, but not in the lumen of epididymal ducts or semiferous tubules of the test. This indicates that the majority of parasites are not located in immune-privileged sites. Instead, parasites are associated with inflammatory cell infiltration, degeneration and tissue rupture of epididymal ducts, which may be related to reduced fertility. Overall, T. bruce is exposed to a strong immune response in the male organs, similar to the bloodstream and other tissues.
In Drosophila melanogaster, chemosensation is critical for survival and is mediated by large families of chemoreceptor proteins whose expression must be appropriately tuned to changes in the chemical environment. We investigated whether expression of chemoreceptor genes that are clustered in the genome would be regulated independently, whether expression of chemceptor genes would be especially sensitive to environmental changes, whether groups of chemceptor genes undergo coordinated expression and how plasticity of chemore genes would be with regard to sex, development, reproductive state and social. We used Drosila melanogaster because chemosens systems are well characterized and the genotype environment can be controlled.
Meiotic Recombination in Human Oocytes  
Meiotic recombination in human oocytes is associated with nondisjunction at maternal meiosis I or II. Studies of trisomies indicate that failure to recombine or recombination events near or far from centromeres are linked to origin of trisomies. Immunofluorescence can identify abnormal crossover configurations. We studied crossover proteins ( e. g. ML1 ) in human oocytes to analyze nondjunctionone chromosomes and characterize genome-wide recombination. Our analyses indicate ML1 foci are lower than predicted, but pattern conforms to crossover protein. In individual chromosomes, we provide evidence for “vulnerable” crossover in oocyte, consistent with nondjunction in adult.
Many vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, leishmaniasis, and arboviral fever, are transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods like mosquitoes, sand flies, and ticks. These arthropods inject saliva containing immunogenic compounds that facilitate feeding. The immune response elicited by pre-exposure to arthrop saliva can alter disease progression if the host later becomes infected. Such preensitisation of the host has been reported to both exacerbate and limit symptoms depending on the system in question, with implications for recovery. We develop a general model of vectororne disease to explore how preensit alters the effects of control. We show that the abundance of preensised hosts increases when control moderately increases vector mortality. If preensit leads to rapid clearance of infection, increasing mortality may achieve greater than expected control. However, preit prolongs the duration of infection, e. g., through symptomatic cases unlikely to be treated, control can increase the number of infected. Infections may go unnoticed unless active surveillance is used to detect subclinical individuals who provide long reservoirs for transmission and suffer long-term consequences of subclinical infections.
Leishmanias is an important disease that affects 12 million people in 88 countries, with 2 million new cases every year. Leishmania amazonensis is an important in Brazil, leading to clinical forms varying from localized ( L ) to diffuse cutaneous leishiasis ( D ). In this study, we investigated the effect of host immune response on Leish phenotype and virulence. We compared proteomes of amastigotes from BAL/c and BAL nude mice. athymic nude mice resemble patients with diffuse cutaneous leishias, considered T-cell hyposensitive to Leish antigens. We identified 44 differentially expressed proteins, including those related to oxidative/nitrosive stress and proteases, and known virulence factors such as oligopeptase and tryparedin peroxidase. Specific isoforms of these proteins were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting T cells restrain postl modifications in BAL mice. On the other hand, an iso of H70 was increased amast from BAL mice. Our study may allow identification of virulence factors and ways regulating expression.
AID (Activation-Induced Deaminase) is an enzyme that initiates immunoglobulin gene diversification by deaminating cytosines in DNA and reprogramming CpG methylation in early development. However, AID is highly mutagenic and causes genomic instability and translocations in B cell malignancies. Here, we show that AID is cell cycle regulated. Using high content microscopy, we demonstrate that AID is degraded more slowly in G1 phase than in S or G2/M phase, and that mutations affecting phosphorylation or catalytic activity alter A stability and abundance. We directly test the role of cell regulation by fusing A to tags that destabilize protein outside G1 or S2 phases. We show that nuclear localization of A in G1 accelerates somatic hypermutation and class recombination and is tolerated, while A in S2 phase compromises viability. We identify A derivatives that accelerate hypermutation with minimal impact on viability, useful for engineering iterative mutagenesis and selection.
Microbial degradation of plant polysaccharides is an important for carbon cycling, nutrition, and industrial processes based on cellulosic bioconversion. Here, we describe a broadly applicable method to analyze how microbes degrade plant polysacides that integrates carbohydrate-active (CAzyme) assays, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and anaerobic screening. We apply this method to study the bacterium Clostridium phyfermentans, which ferments biomass components including glucans, mannans, xylans, galact, pect, and arabin. These polysacides are fermented with variable efficiencies and diaux prioritize metabolism of preferred substrates. Strand RNA-seq reveals how this bacter responds to polysides by upregulating groups of CAymes, transporters and enzymes to metabolize constituent sugars. Fifty CAymes were purified and their activities show polysides are degraded by multiple enzymes, often from same family but divergent specificities and localizations. CAymes were tested in combination to identify synergies between enzymes on same substrate different catalytic mechanisms.
In Sierra Leone, onchocerciasis was endemic in 12 of 14 health districts (HDs) and lymphatic filariasis (LF) was endemic in all 14 districts between 2005–2008. Three annual mass drug administrations (MDAs) were conducted in the 12 endemic districts between 2008–2010 with good geographic and drug coverage. A mid-term assessment was conducted in 201 to determine the impact of MDAs on LF in these districts. The prevalence of microfilariae (mf) in the 12 districts was determined using the thick film method and compared with baseline data from 200–2008. Overall mf prevalence fell from 2.6% (95% CI 2.3–3.0 ) to 0.3 (95% CI 0.19–.47 ), a decrease of 88.5% (p=0.000 ); prevalence was 0.0 (100.0% ) in four districts: Bo, Moyamba, Kenema and Kono (p=.001.025.085.000 ) and seven districts had reductions in mf prevalence between 70.0 and 95.0 (p=.000.060.001.014.000..002 Bombali Bonthe Kail Kambia Kadugu Portokolili respectively. Pehun had baseline prevalence 0.0 which was maintained. Bomb still had mf ≥1.0 (.58.80–.09 ) and was the district with highest baseline 6.9 (95 CI5.–8.8 ). Overall mean mf after MD was 17 mf/ml (95 CI 15–19/ml ) among mf individuals 65.4 from baseline 50/ml (95 CI40–61/ml; p=.001 ) and 0/ml (95 CI0–08 ) for entire population 96.2 from 1/ml (95 CI1–1; p=.000 ).
Many high-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA profiling, have the potential to elucidate the inner workings of microbial communities. A key step in exploring such data is the identification of dependencies between community members, which is commonly achieved by correlation analysis. However, compositional data generated by such techniques can produce unreliable results since they take the form of relative fractions rather than absolute abundances. We show that compositional effects can be widespread and severe: many correlations can be artifactual and true correlations may appear opposite. Community diversity modulates the acuteness of such effects. We develop a new approach, Spar, capable of estimating correlation from compositional data. Using Spar, we infer a rich network connecting hundreds of species across the human body. The standard approach yields 3 spurious species interactions and misses 60% of true interactions in the human microbiome. Most erroneous links are found in samples with lowest diversity.
Streptococcus pneumoniae colonizes the upper respiratory tract by evading the antimicrobial effects of lysozym, a mucosal enzyme that hydrolyzes peptoglycans. Lyso has both muridase and antimicrobial activities. We show that the antimicrobial effect of lyzym is due to its muridase activity and that peptogly modifications are required for pneumoc resistance to lyzym in vitro. To examine the contribution of lyzym and peog modifications during colonization, we competed wild-type and pgAadr mutant pneumocci in lysoe-sufficient (LM+) and -deficient (LM−) mice. The wild-type outcompeted the mutant in LM+, but not LM− mice, indicating the importance of resistance to lyzym murid activity during mucosal colonization. In contrast, strains containing single mutations in pgA or Adr prevailed over the wild-type in LM+ and LM− mice. Our findings demonstrate that peog modifications diminish fitness during colonization. The competitive advantage of wild pneumocci in LM+ but not LM− mice suggests that the combination of peog modifications reduces fitness, but is outweighed by the benefits of resistance to peog degrading lyzym activity.
Dengue is the most important arthropod borne viral disease in the world in terms of morbidity and mortality. It is caused by any of the four serotypes of deng virus (DENV-1 to 4). Brazil is responsible for approximately 80% of deng cases in the Americas. Since the introduction of deng in 1986, a total 5, 944, 270 cases have been reported, including 21,596 deng hemorrhagic and 874 fatal. The goal of this study was to investigate the usefulness of NS1 capture as an alternative to detect DENV in tissue from previously deng fatal cases (n=23) that occurred in 200 in Brazil. A total 74 tissue specimens were available: liver (n=23), lung (n=14), kidney (n=4), brain (n=10), heart (n=2, skin (n=1, spleen (n=15, thym (n=3 and lymph (n=2. We evaluated three tests for NS1 capture: Deng Early ELISA (Pan Diagnostics), Platelia NS (Bio Laboratories) and the test NS1 Strip (Bio Laboratories). Overall deng fatal diagnosis based on tissues by Deng ELISA, Platelia and NS Strip was 34.7% (8/23), 60.8% (14) and 91.% (21, respectively. Deng ELISA detected NS1 in 22.9% (17) of specimens and Platelia in 45.% (34. The highest sensitivity 78.% was achieved by Strip and differences in sensitivities were statistically (p0.05. Strip was most in liver 91. (21, lung 71. (10, kidney 100 (4, brain 80 (8, spleen 66 (10 and thym 100. This study shows DENV1 capture as rapid approach to postmortemeng confirmation.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy with significantly higher incidence and mortality rates among African Americans (AA) compared to Caucasians (CA). This study aimed to elucidate differences in molecular alterations in MM as a function of self-reported race and genetic ancestry. We utilized somatic whole-exome RNA-sequencing and clinical data from 718 MM patients in the Multiple Myeloma Research CoPass Interim Analysis 9. Somatic mutational analyses based on self-reported race corrected for ancestry revealed significant differences in mutation frequencies between groups of interest. BCL2A, BR3 and AUT2 demonstrated higher mutation frequencies among AA cases. These genes are involved in translocations in B-cell malignancies. Moreover, we detected a difference in mutation frequency of TP53 and IR4 with higher among CA cases.
Most mutations in the exome of cancer cells are passengers, which do not affect the reproductive rate of the cell. Passengers provide important information about the history of an individual cancer and serve as molecular clock. Passengers also become targets for immunotherapy or confer resistance to treatment. We study the expansion of a population of cancer cells describing the growth of primary or metastatic lesions. We analyze the process looking forward in time and calculate the probabilities and frequencies of successive mutations ordered by time of appearance. We compute the likelihood of evolutionary trees informing phylogenetic reconstruction of cancer in individual. Next, we derive looking backward for a subclonal we estimate the number of cells present when mutation arose. We derive formulas for subcl of any frequency. Fitting to data leads to estimate of birth and death during early stages.
Polyglutamine (Q) expansion in exon 1 (X1) of the huntingtin protein is linked to Huntington’s disease. When the number of glutamines exceeds a threshold of approximately 36–40, X1 can form amyloid aggregates similar to those associated with the disease. The misfolding of monomeric X1 plays an important role in length-dependent aggregation. To elucidate the misolding of X1 can determine the molecular mechanism of X aggregation and help develop strategies to inhibit X aggregation. The flanking sequences surrounding the Q region play a role in determining structural rearrangement and aggregation of X. We perform molecular simulations on monomeric X with full flanking regions, variant missing polyline regions hypothesized to prevent aggregation and isolated Q. For each we study glutamine lengths 23, 36, 40 and 47. We find Q peptides have positive correlation between probability to form β-rich state and expansion. The flanking of X affect probability to form β state compared isolated Q. Particularly, polyline regions form helices decrease probability Q to β state. By length Q, first-terminal residues more likely adopt conformation rather conformation.
The CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats) loci, together with CRIS-associated genes, form the CRIS/Cas adaptive immune system, a defense strategy used by bacteria and archaea to protect against foreign nucleic acids, including phages and conjugative plasmids. CRIS loci consist of short spacer sequences separated by repeats derived from foreign DNA that direct interference future infections. The availability of hundreds of shotgun metagenomic datasets from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) enables us to explore the distribution and diversity of CRPRs in human-associated microbial communities and discover new CRs. We propose a targeted strategy to reconstruct CRPR arrays that whole-genome assemblies fail to identify. For each CR type identified from reference genomes, we use its repeat sequence to recruit reads from HMP and assemble into CR loci; unique spacers can be extracted for analysis. We identified novel CRs in whole-genome assemblies and targeted to comprehensively identify CRs across samples. CRs are largely body-site specific. We provide analysis of CR loci, including novel CRs. For example, streptoc CRs were identified in oral microbiota, ∼8,000 spacers; samples from same site shared most spacers; different sites from same shared fewer, while individuals almost no sp, indicating niche differences on CR defenses. We demonstrate CR to trace species and virus exposure. This work indicates importance of CR to study microbiome ecology.
Most organisms have an endogenous circadian clock that is synchronized to environmental signals such as light and temperature. Although circadian rhythms have been described in the nematode Caenorhabdis elegans at the behavioral level, these appear to be relatively non-robust. Moreover, in contrast to other models, circadian transcriptional rhythms have not been identified. Thus, whether this organism contains a bona fide circadian remains an open. Here we use genome-wide profiling to identify light and temperature-entrained transcripts in C. elegans. These exhibit rhythmic expression with temperature-compens 24 periods. In addition, expression is sustained under constant, suggesting they are circadian regulated.
The Saccharomyces cerevisae RAD3 gene is a homolog of the human XPD gene, which encodes a DNA helicase of the TFIIH complex involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription. Mutations in the RAD3 gene, such as rad-101 and rad-102, result in defects in DNA repair and a hyper-recombination (hyper-Rec) phenotype. Previous studies showed that the hyper-Rec phenotype of rad-101 and rad-102 can be explained by persistent single-stranded DNA gaps converted to recombinogenic double-strand breaks (DSBs) by replication. We further characterized the hyperRec phenotype of rad strains using a system that recovers reciprocal products of mitotic recombination. Both rad-101 and rad-102 elevate the frequency of reciprocal crossovers about 100-fold. We mapped these events and found that three-quarters of crosso reflect DS formed at same positions in sister chromatids (double-chromat breaks, DSBs). The remainder reflect DS formed in chromatids (singleid breaks SCBs). The ratio DSBs to SC is similar to observed for spontaneous events in wild-type cells.
Helicobacter pylori is a gastric pathogen that requires optimal expression of virulence factors to adapt to the changing host environment during persistent infection. The bacterium has a large number of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) that generate heterogeneous populations through slipped mispairing, facilitating adaptation. We present a model explaining how an intergenic SSR, via slipped mispair, operates as a rheostat to fine-tune expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin (SabA) promoter. Using Ttract variants in an isogenic strain, we show that SSR length generates multiphas output from sab promoter. This alters H. pylori binding to sial-Lewis receptors on gastric mucosa. Analysis of post-infection clones shows SSR length is highly variable in H. pylori. This mirrors host-pathogen interplay where bacterium generates clones with best-fit phenotypes selected in host. In silico and in vitro analyses show SSR length affects DNA structure and RNA polymerase binding through axial alignment between promoter and UP elements. We identified additional H. pyl genes with SSR similar to sab, and variations likewise modulate cognate output. We propose this mechanism mediated by promoter-prox SSR provides alternative transcriptional regulation in bacteria with limited transacting factors.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) must evade the innate immune response to establish persistent infections and amplify its genome upon epithelial differentiation. The JAK/STAT pathway is important for the innate response and HPV downregulates STAT1 to maintain viral episomes. STAT5 is another member that modulates the inflammatory response and controls cell cycle in response to cytokines and growth factors. Our studies show that HPV7 activates STAT5 phosphorylation without altering total levels. Inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation by pimide abolishes genome amplification and late expression in differentiating keratinocytes. In contrast, undifferentiated that maintain episomes has no effect on replication. Knockdown show STAT5 isoform is mainly responsible and this is mediated through ATM damage. A downstream STAT5, peroxisomeactivated receptor (PARγ) contributes ATM pathway members.
Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi is a bacterium that can colonize and persist in the biliary tract of infected individuals, resulting in a state of asymptomatic chronic carriage. Chronic carriers may act as persistent reservoirs of infection within a community and may introduce infection to susceptible individuals and communities. Little is known about the interaction between the host and pathogen in the biliary of chronic carriers and there is currently no reliable assay to identify asymptomatic S. Typhi carriage. To study host-pathogen in the biliary during S. Ty carriage, we applied immunoscreen technique called in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVAT), to identify biomarkers unique to carriers.IV identifies humorally immunogenic antigens expressed uniquely in vivo, we hypothesized S Ty surviving the biliary of humans may a distinct antigen profile. Thirteen S Ty antigens were immunactive in carriers but not in healthy from tyoid endemic were identified. The antigens included number of putative proteins, liproteins and hemys-related.nc (ST147), uncharacter protein an ATP-binding gave responses in our screen The response in patients biliary contained Ty was compared responses patients biliary did not Ty, patients tyoid fever and healthy tyoid endemic. Seven (70%) carriers, (0%), (0%), (0%) and (12.5%) had detectable-YE Ig blood. Ig were also present Further evaluation and other antigens identified IV could lead improved assays identify asymptomatic Typhi.
Transcriptional Reactivation of Silenced Genes: A New Epigenetic Phenomenon Revealed by Homologous RNA.
Boophil is a multifunctional serine protease inhibitor expressed in the midgut of the tick Rhipphalus microplus, a vector of Babesiosis. It targets thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein, enzymes involved in the coagulation and complement cascades. Boophil was expressed in HEK cells and purified to homogeneity. Using amidolytic assays and surface plasmon resonance experiments, we demonstrated that Boophil behaves as a classical noncompetitive inhibitor of thrombin with respect to chromogenic substrates by a mechanism dependent on both exosite and catalytic sites. Inhibition is accompanied by blockade of platelet aggregation, fibrin formation, and clot formation in vitro. Boophil is also a noncompetitive inhibitor of FXa, preventing FIX activation. In addition, Boophil inhibits kikrein activity and reciprocal activation, indicating it targets the contact pathway. Furthermore, Boophil abates cathepsin G and plmin-induced platelet aggregation and affects elastase cleavage of Tissue Pathway Inhibitor ( TFPI ). Finally, Boophil inhibits carotid occlusion in vivo by FeCl and promotes bleeding in mice.
Inflammation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of many gastrointestinal diseases and is the most important factor governing the maintenance of mucosal architecture. The mucosa of the intestinal tract is a finely tuned system where structure influences and is influenced by function as an absorptive surface and defensive barrier. Mucosal architecture plays a key role in diagnosis and characterization of pathophysiology of a host of gastrointestinal diseases. We propose that characterization of the role of inflammation as controller of enteric mucosal pattering requires understanding of cellular and molecular dynamics that determine epithelial cryptillus architecture across a range of conditions from health to disease. We have developed the Spatial General-purpose Model of Enteric Tissue (SEMT ) to represent the behavior of enter epithelial tissue influenced by inflammation with ability to generate a variety of pathophysiological processes within a platform and common base. SEMT reproduces healthy mucosal dynamics as well as a series of morph knock-inhibition experiments. SEMT provides insight into clinically relevant cellular-molecular mechanisms such as the role of PTEN/PIK as point of crosstalk between inflammation and morphogenesis, the role of enterocyte slough in enter ischemia-reper and low inflammation as driver of colonic metaplas. SEMT can serve as platform for study of inflammation in gastrointestinal disease.
Aedes aegypti populations are difficult to control using traditional methods such as source reduction and insecticide spraying. Wolbachia, an endosymbion of Ae.egypti, has been proposed as a tool to mitigate arbovirus transmission and has been deployed worldwide. Models predict a rapid increase in frequency of Wolia-positive Ae.egypt in local settings, supported by cytoplasmic incompatibility ( CI ) and high maternal transmission associated with wBr strain. Wolia wBr was released for 20 weeks in Tubanga, Rio de Janeiro, reaching 87% of households. wBr frequency peaked at 65% but dropped as releases stopped. A 97. 56% maternal transmission was observed. Doubling releases and deploying mosquitoes with large length and low mortality produced no effects on trend. By investigating lab procedures, pyreth resistant genotypes wBr decreased from 68 to 3.5% after 17. Initially released mosquitoes were highly resistant to pyre which jeopardized Wolia invasion. A new strain wRio was produced aftercrossing wBr females with field males to introduce pyre resistance. w increased survival but produced negative effects on Aeegypt traits, reducing egg size and hatch. Despite fitness wRio established whereBr failed, revealing matching local genetics, especially insecticide background is critical to invasion.
Poxviruses are complex pathogens that have evolved to modulate cellular defense mechanisms while ensuring proper expression of viral factors. For example, the vaccinia virus B protein plays a role in in inactivating the antiviral factor B and likely orchestrates other pathways. In this study, we generated a B1 deletion virus to search for suppressor mutations and novel pathways involving B. After several passages of the Δ1 virus, we observed a robust increase in titer of the adapted virus. Characterization of the adapted viruses reveals that mutations correlating with loss of function of the vaccinia B pseudokinase provide a fitness enhancement to the virus. We present multiple lines of evidence that expression of full B leads to a reduction in viruses with a defect in B, but no impact on wild-type or other poxviruses. These data suggest that B possesses a potent inhibitory activity masked by the presence of B kinase. Further investigation of B attributes that it localizes to the nucleus, a rare among poxiral proteins. Surprisingly, B phosphorylation is reduced when B is present in cells without B, indicating B may function by enhancing antiral activity of B.
In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the conformation behavior of two synthetic amphipathic peptides, LKKKLLKKLLKL ( L ) and EAAEALAEALAE ( E ), with built-in secondary structure forming an alpha-helix. We find that these peptides are neither random coils in bulk nor fully formed helices, but adopt multiple conformations and secondary elements with short lifetimes. These provide a basis for conformation and population-shift upon environmental changes. Differences in peptides’ response to macroscopic and molecular interfaces presented by aggregation can be linked to their alphaelical tendencies in bulk. We find that peptides’ aggregation is strongly affected by presence or absence of interface and subtly depends on surface and hydrophobicity.
Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a ubiquitous betaherpesvirus that infects humans within the first years of life and establishes latency in various cell types. Both HH-6A and HH-6B can integrate their genomes into the telomeres of host chromosomes in latently infected cells. The molecular mechanism of viral integration remains elusive. Interestingly, HH-6 and HH-6 harbor arrays of telomeric repeats (TMR) identical to human telomeres at the ends of their genomes. The HH-6 and HH-6 genomes harbor two TMR, the perfectMR (pMR) and imperfectMR (impMR). To determine if TMR are involved in integration, we deleted pMR and impMR in HH-6 genome. Upon reconstitution, TMR mutant replicated comparable to wild type (wt) virus, indicating T are not essential for HH-6 replication. To assess integration properties of recombinant viruses we established in vitro system that allows assessment of integration and genome in latently infected. Integration HH-6 was impaired in absence of T and virus was rapidly lost, suggesting integration crucial for maintenance of genome. Individual of pMR and impMR revealed pMR play major role in HH6, impMR only minor, allowing to establish model HH6 integration. Taken, data that HH-6 are dispensable for replication but crucial for integration of genome in latently cells.
Poxviruses are a family of enveloped viruses that do not acquire their internal lipid membrane by budding from cellular compartments. Instead, they are generated from crescent-shaped precursors whose architecture and composition are not well understood. Here we report the 2. 6 Å crystal structure of vaccinia virus D13, a key component of the outer scaffold of viral crescents. D13 folds into a jellyroll decorated by a head domain of novel fold and assembles into trimers homologous to double-barrel capsid proteins of adenoviruses and lipid-containing icosahedral viruses. We show that when tethered onto artificial membranes, D forms a honeycomb lattice structurally similar to viral crescent and immature particles. The architecture of the D honeycomb and lipid-remodeling abilities of D support a model that exhibits similarities with mimivirus. Overall, these findings establish that the first step of poxirus morphogenesis utilizes a lipid-remodeling strategy common to icosahedral viruses infecting all kingdoms of life. Furthermore, D is the target of rifampicin and its structure will aid the development of poxirus inhibitors.
In Arabidopsis thalian, auxin biosynthesis via indole-3-pyruvic acid ( IPA ) is essential for root development and requires TRYOPHANIN AMOTANSFER OF ARIDOPSIS ( T1 ) and T1-RELATED ( TAR ) genes. In contrast, the monocot Brachodium distyon ( Brachodium ) has a different auxin biosynthesis pathway. A promoter-DNA insertion in the Brachodium TAR-LIKE ( BdARL ) gene severely downregulates expression, suggesting reduced tryophaninotransfer activity in the mutant, which represents a hypomorphic BdARLhypo allele. However, BdLypo mutants display dramatically elongated seminal roots due to enhanced cell elongation. This phenotype is also observed in a stronger BdL allele and can be mimicked by treating wild type with L-kyunine, a T1/TAR inhibitor. Surprisingly, Lkyine-treated as well as BdL display elevated rather than reduced auxin levels. This does not result from compensation by alternative auxin biosynthesis pathways. Rather, expression of YCCA genes, which are rate-limiting for IPA to auxin conversion, is increased in BdL mutants. Consistent suppression of Bdypo phenotypes upon application of ethylene precursor 1-aminoclopropane-1-carboxylic ( ACC ), YCCA are downregulated upon ACC. Moreover, they are upregulated in downstream ethylene-signaling component homolog, ethylene 2-like 1 which also displays BdL root.
The organization of the promoter region of a gene, known as the nucleosome, has been shown to influence the rate of evolution of gene expression in species of the budding yeast. Genes lacking a nucleosome-free region, denoted as Occupied Proximal Nucleosomes ( OPN), vary widely in expression between species, while those containing nucleosomes, denoted as Depleted Proimalucleosomes (DPN), have largely conserved expression. To examine the role of early evolution in this difference, we artificially selected for high expression of GFP-tagged proteins. Surprisingly, selection was successful for both OP and DP genes, with ∼80% of each group increasing expression by a similar amount. Notably, the two groups adapted by distinct mechanisms: DP-selected strains duplicated genomic regions, while OP-selected favored mutations not involving duplications. When selection was removed, DP but not OP genes rapidly reverted to wild-type expression, consistent with lower diversity between species. Our results suggest that nucleosome organization constrains early evolution and biases the path of long-term evolution.
Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). The HT-1 transactivator/oncoprotein, Tax, is thought to promote cell proliferation and transformation by activating Iκ kinases (IKs) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κ). Paradoxically, expression of Tax in most cells leads to upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21IP/W1 and p27IP, causing p53/pR-independent cellular senescence. Here, we show that p21IP/W1/p27-mediated senescence constitutes a checkpoint against IK/NF-κ hyperactivation. Senescence induced by Tax in HeLa cells is attenuated by mutations that reduce IK/NF activation and prevented by blocking NFκ using a degradation-resistant mutant Iα. Small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown indicates that Rel induces senescence by acting upstream of anaphase complex and to stabilize p27IP and p21 mRNA. Finally, we show that downregulation of NFκ by HT-1 anti-s protein HB delays onset of Tax-induced senescence. We propose that balance between Tax and HB expression determines HT-1 outcome. Robust HT-1 replication and Tax drive IK/NF hyperactivation and senescence. HB, however, modulates Tax-mediated replication and NF activation, allowing HT-1-infected cells to proliferate persist and evolve. Finally, inactivation senescence can facilitate persistent NF activation and leukemogenesis.
The human brain’s frontal lobe plays a crucial role in decision-making and executive functions, including the selection and coordination of goal-directed behaviors. However, current models of executive function do not explain decision-making in everyday situations that are uncertain, changing, and open-ended. We propose a computational model of executive function that clarifies this issue. Using behavioral experiments, we show that our model predicts human decisions and variations across individuals in natural situations. The model reveals that the frontal lobe monitors up to four concurrent behavioral strategies and infers their ability to predict outcomes: whenever one appears more reliable, this strategy is chosen to guide selection and learning of actions that maximize rewards. Otherwise, a new strategy is tentatively formed from long-term memory, probed and confirmed to drive action. The frontal has a capacity to monitor four strategies. This is compensated by the structure of control in ambiguous situations that promotes exploration and creation of new strategies. Our results support a model of frontal function that integrates reasoning, learning, and abilities in decision and adaptive behavior.
Pharmacological treatment of diseases is a challenging due to the lack of understanding of long-term effects and potential side effects. We present a new modeling approach called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations Parameter Trajectories (ADAPT) to study the long-term effects of pharmacological treatment. A time-dependent evolution of model parameters is introduced to study the dynamics of molecular adaptations. The progression of these adaptations is predicted by identifying dynamic changes in parameters to describe the transition between experimental data during different stages of treatment. This approach provides insight into the underlying biological systems and identifies molecular events to be studied in detail to unravel the mechanistic basis of treatment outcome.
Spinal cord and cerebellar neurons are capable of processing both sensory and motor signals. These signals are combined in the neurons of the spinocerebell pathways and granule cells receive this input with respect to their output. In this paper, we synthesize findings into a hypothesis for spinocerebell and cerebellar interaction to support coordination of multi-segmented limbs and bodies. We propose that recombination of signals to spinerebell neurons can approximate spatial and temporal dependencies between segments, necessary for coordination. However, recombination of sensory and motor signals is not a good strategy since granule cells limit the number of recombinations. Instead, we propose that spinal circuit provides useful recombinations, described as linear projections of multi-dimensional sensorimotor input. Granule cells, with aid of Golgi cells, enhance utility of these projections allowing Purje to establish piecewise-linear approximations of non-linear functions. Our hypothesis provides novel view of spinal and cerebell gran layer, illustrating cerebell functions supported by spinere recombinations.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a viral pathogen transmitted by the mosquito vector Aedes albopictus. In this study, we investigated the role of host microRNAs (miRNAs) in CHV infection in Ae. albictus. We identified 88 known and 79 miRNAs in uninfected and CHV infected Ae. albict cell lines, respectively, and nine novel miRNAs in Ae. We compared the two libraries and found differential expression of 77 miRNAs between them. CHV infection altered the miRNA profile of eight miRN. We identified putative targets of these miRN and classified them into pathways. Our study identified and described miRNA profiles upon CHV in Ae. This provides insight into cellular modification by miRN during CHV and leads to potential candidates for vector based antiviral strategies.
Cysticercosis (CE) is a parasitic disease affecting both humans and animals. It is a significant public health and economic problem in many developing countries, including Iran. However, the economic impact of the disease in endemic countries is not fully understood. This study aimed to determine the economic burden of CE in Iran. Epidemiological data, including prevalence and incidence of CE in humans and animals, were obtained from hospitals, literature, and official reports. Economic data relating to human and animal disease, including treatment costs, productivity, and production losses were obtained from national and international datasets. Monte Carlo methods were used to represent uncertainty in parameters. The number of surgical CE cases per year 2000–2009 was estimated at 1, 295. The number of asymptomatic individuals in the country was estimated at 635,232 (95% CI 149,466–1,120,998 ). The overall cost of CE in Iran was estimated at US$232.3 million (95 CI US$103.–397.8 million ), including direct and indirect costs. The cost with human CE was estimated US$93. million (95 CI$6.–222.7 ) and the cost with CE in livestock estimated US132 million (95 CI$61.–246.5 ) The cost per human was US1,539. CE has considerable impact on Iran, with cost approximated at 0.03% country's gross product.
Polyomavirus (MPV) is a highly oncogenic virus that infects rodents and transforms cells in culture. In this study, we used deep sequencing to follow MPV infection of mouse NIH3T cells at various times after infection and analyzed both viral and cellular transcriptomes. We found that MPV transcribes both early-strand and late-strand RNAs at all times after infection. These studies revealed novel insights into MPV gene expression, including widespread RNA editing of viral transcripts late in infection. By late in infection, 359 genes were upregulated and 857 downregulated. Gene ontology analysis showed that transcripts involved in translation, metabolism, RNA processing, DNA methylation, and protein turnover were upregulated, while those involved in extracellular adhesion, cytoskeleton, zinc binding, SH domain and GTP activation were downregulated. We also found that levels of many noncoding RNAs were altered. The noncoding RNA MALAT, involved in splicing and used as marker in late cancers, was downregulated, while other noncoding RNAs were upregulated.
Hundreds of thousands of runners attempt to complete a marathon each year, but more than two-fifths experience severe performance-limiting depletion of physiologic carbohydrate reserves, known as ‘hitting the wall, and drop out before reaching the finish. Analyses of endurance physiology have suggested that glycogen reserves are insufficient to fuel a marathon or that maximal glycogen loading is required to complete without ‘hitting the wall. However, the present study demonstrates that energetic constraints on runners are subtle and depend on physi variables including muscle mass, liver glycogen density, and running intensity as a fraction of aerobic capacity. The study estimates the distance at which runners will exhaust glycogen as a function of intensity and provides a basis for optimizing performance by setting appropriate paces and prescribing midrace fuel to avoid ‘the wall.
Toxoplas gondii is a protozoan parasite that causes toxoplasis in humans and rodents. The parasite is divided into three clonal lineages (I, II, and III) in Europe and North America, but in South America a variety of other strains are found. These strains differ in virulence, persistence, oral infectivity, migratory capacity, cytokine expression, and host gene expression. We hypothesize that besides host and environmental factors, parasite genotype plays a major role in toxoplasis outcome. Macrophages are essential in early immune response against T. gondii and are preferentially infected in vivo. We infected murine macrophages with 29 Toxoplas strains representing global diversity and used RNA-sequencing to determine host and parasite transcriptomes. We found large differences between strains in expression of known effectors and chromosomal variation in some. We identified novel strain-specific regulated pathways, including regulation of type I interferon response by atypical strains. IFβ production by infected cells was associated with parasite killing independent of interferon activation and dependent on endosomal Toll-like receptors in macroph and cytoplasmic receptor retic-inducible gene 1 ( RIG ) in fibroblasts.
Recombination in enteroviruses is an evolutionary mechanism for acquiring extensive regions of novel sequence that has been suggested to have a role in genotype diversity and is known to have been key to the emergence of novel neuropathogenic poliovirus variants. We investigated heterologous recombination using a novel genetic approach that resulted in the isolation of chimeric interic poliruses bearing genomes with duplicated sequences at the recombination junction. Serial passage of viruses with imprecise junctions yielded progeny with increased fitness that lost the duplicated sequences.
White adipose tissue (WAT) is a promising target for metabolic disease treatment through norepinephrine (NE)-mediated signaling. Previous studies report NE clearance via SLC6A in sympathetic neurons or proinflammatory macrophages in adipose tissues (AT), but SLC2’s low catechamine capacity limits efficiency. Here, we report that organic cation transporter 3 (Oct;Slc22a3) is highly expressed in W and displays the greatest NE uptake as a non-neural route in white adipocytes, differing from known routes such as neurons or macrophages. We show adipocytes express high NE degradation enzymes Mao, Maob, and Com, providing molecular basis for NE clearance by adipocytes with reuptake Oct3. NE administration ablation of Oct induces higher thermogenesis and lipolysis compared to littermates. After cold challenge, inginal WAT in Oct-deficient mice shows stronger browning and elevated thermogenic genes than littermates, involving β-adrenerg receptor (βAR)/protein kinase (PK)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive binding (Cre) pathway. Glycolytic genes are reprogrammed to compensate for loss in Oct-deficient mice, indicating glucose role during beig. Inhibition β largely abolishes lipoly and therm activities in Oct-def W, indicating NE in Oct KO adipocytes. Reduced alleles in OCT are associated with increased basal metabolic rate (BMR). Collectively, Oct governs βAR as NE transporter in adipocytes, offering applications for metabolic disorders.
HP proteins are a family of heterochromatin-enriched proteins that play a critical role in the regulation of transcription. They contain two related domains: the chromo and chromadow. The chrom-domain binds to histone H3 tails that are methylated on lysine 9. However, in vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that HP proteins have poor affinity for methylated chromatin and that opening of chrom during DNA replication facilitates their binding to nucleosomes. We show that the chromadow-domain interacts with histone H in a region located inside the nucleosomal at the entry/exit of the nucleosome. This region is also contacted by the catalytic subunits of the SWI/SNF complex. In vitro, SW/SNF requires this contact and is inhibited by HP proteins. The antagonism between SW/SNF and HP is also observed on a series of interferon-regulated genes. Finally, we show that SWNF favors loading of HP to chrom both in vivo and vitro.
Self-containment is a property of modular RNA structures that distinguishes microRNAs from other types of RNAs. It is the tendency of an RNA sequence to robustly adopt the same secondary structure regardless of whether it exists in isolation or as a substring of longer sequence. We measured self-containment using self-containment index and found that miRNAs exhibit high self-containment, consistent with requirement for structural invariance imposed by miRNA biogenesis pathway. Most other structured RNAs do not exhibit self-containment. Further analysis revealed trend toward higher self-containment among conserved miRNAs suggesting that self-containment may be characteristic of miRN acquiring new genomic contexts. We found miRN display enhanced self-containment compared to other functional RNAs and trend toward selection for self-cont in most functional classes. Self-cont may arise from selection for robustness against perturbations, invariance during biogenesis and modular composition of function.
In this study, we have identified four transcription factors (TFs) in Arabidopsis that limit the spread of necrotrophic fungal pathogens. We found that Arabid mutants defective in any of these TFs are more susceptible to Botrytis cinerea and Plectphaella cucumeria. These mutants also show a general activation of non-immune host processes that contribute to disease. We found that the mutants share a common transcriptional signature of 77 up-regulated genes. We characterized several of the up-regulated genes that encode secreted peptides, which we named PROIR ( provirulence factors ). We found that many of the PROIRs are important for susceptibility of the host to necrophic fungal pathogens.
Successful implantation of an embryo in the uterus requires a receptive endometrium. Poor uterine receptivity is a major cause of implantation failure in women who experience recurrent pregnancy loss or multiple rounds of unsuccessful in vitro fertilization cycles. Here, we show that the transcription factor Forkhead O1 ( FOX1 ) is a critical regulator of endometrial receptivity in vivo. We demonstrate that uterine ablation of Fox1 using the progesterone receptor ( Pgr ) Cre mouse model results in infertility due to altered epithelial cell polarity and apoptosis, preventing the embryo from penetrating the luminal epithelium. The utine transcriptome analysis after Fox1 ablation reveals alterations in gene expression of transcripts involved in cell invasion, transport, apoptosis, β-caten ( CTN1 ) signaling, and increased P signaling. The increase in P signaling is due to P expression retained in the utine epithelium during the window of recept. Constitutive expression of epithelial P during this period inhibits expression of FOX1 in the nucleus of utine epithelium. The reciprocal expression of P and FOX1 is conserved in human endrial samples during proliferative and secretory phase.
Dengue fever is a major public health problem in Bangladesh, but many cases are not reported. We developed a statistical model to study the spread of deng in the country. The model accounted for the fact that many cases are not reported. We used data from 2000 to 2009 on deng cases at the district level (64 districts ). We found that temperature and its interaction with temperature range were associated with deng incidence. We also found that rainfall was associated with deng incidence. We found that densely populated districts and those bordering India or Myanmar had more deng than others. We estimated that 92% of deng cases occurred between August and September. We found deng cases across the country, with 94% in the capital Dhaka. We found that less than half of d cases were reported from surveillance data. The proportion of reported cases varied by month, with more in high-incidence districts but less towards the end of transmission season.
Mice are attracted to places with high path tortuosity when introduced into a novel environment. These places are characterized by the highest number of visits and cumulative time spent. Examination of exploratory behavior in these places reveals important features of their organization. We term these places “knots” and the behavior performed in them “knotcrib”. Knots have distinct boundaries and are maintained within and across sessions. They are mostly situated in the place of introduction into the arena, away from walls. Knots are characterized by high speed during inbound and low speed during outbound paths. The establishment of knots is enhanced by injecting mice with saline and placing in an exposed portion of arena, suggesting that stress and arousal consolidate a long-term contingency between locale and knotcrib. In an environment devoid of proximal cues, mice mark locale associated with arousal by twisting and turning. This creates a self-generated, centrally located landmark. The tortuosity of path during knotcrib implies multiple views of the environment. Knotcrib could function to obtain an overview of environment and re-calibrate locale and compass.
Invasive fungal infections are responsible for more than 1. 9 million deaths worldwide each year. We report the discovery of NG04, an antifungal compound with selectivity for fungal cells over mammalian cells. Using high-resolution chemogenomics, we identified Secp, a lipid transfer protein, as the target of NG04. NG04-resistant mutations in Secp define compound interactions in the binding pocket of the protein. Secp is essential for lipid transfer in a variety of pathogenic fungi and for secretion of virulence determinants in pathogenic fungi such as Cryptococcus neoformans, making Secp an attractive antifungal target. We demonstrate that NG04 inhibits growth of two clinical isolates of C. neoans and NG04-related compounds have even higher potency against C. neo. Furthermore, NG04 analogues show fungicidal activity against fluconazole-resistant C. neo. We present genetic evidence that NG04 inhibits Secp and data supporting NG04 as a novel antungal starting point.
Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that exacerbates poverty and is often treated with a single drug called praziquant. However, the large-scale use of prazant might select for drug-resistant parasites, hence there is a need to develop new antischosomal compounds. Here, we report that the antimal drug mefloquine possesses promising antischosomal properties in mice. Mice infected with adult Schistoma mansoni or S japonicum were treated with a single dose of mefloquine (200 or 400 mg ) orally, resulting in 72.3–100% total worm burden reductions. Importantly, worm reductions were also observed for young developing stages of S mansoni and japon in mice. Both mequine enantiomers resulted in comparable worm reductions when given to mice with subpatent or patent S mans infection. Our findings hold promise for a novel antosomal drug based on aminoal functionality.
Podoconiasis is a non-filarial elephantias characterized by massive swelling of the lower limbs. It was identified as a neglected disease by WHO in 201. This study maps the distribution of podoiosis in Cameroon using parasitological, serological, and clinical evidence to exclude other causes of lymphedema. We used a multi-stage sampling design with stratification of the country by environmental risk of podoiosis. We sampled 76 villages from 40 districts in 10 regions of Cameroon. All individuals 15 years or older were surveyed and screened for lymphema. A clinical algorithm was used to diagnose podoiosis excluding filarial lymphema. Individuals with lymphema were tested for Wuchereria bancrofti antigen and IgG using Alere Filasis Strips ( F ) and Standard Diagnostics ( ) BIOLymphatic filariasis Ig4 ( W123 ), in addition to thick films. Presence of W bancft DNA was checked on blood using qPCR. Overall, 10,178 individuals from 4,603 households participated. Of 83 with lymphema were identified, two were F positive and negative W123. No bancft were found in blood of any with lymphema. None were positive bancft usingPCR. Two F positive were positive Mansonella perst and Loa loa. Overall 52 podoiosis were identified applying algorithm. Prevalence was 0.5% (CI 0.–.7 ). At least one case found every region except Adamawa. Of 40 districts, 17 had no cases; 15 between 0.2 and 1.%; eight between 1.2 and 2.7.
Notch Signaling Mediates the Age-Associated Decrease in Adhesion of Germline Stem Cells to the Niche. Stem cells have an innate ability to occupy their cell niche, which is optimized to house stem cells. Aging is associated with reduced stem cell occupancy in the niche, but mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report that Notch signaling is increased in Drosophila female germline stem (GSCs), and results in their removal from niche. Clonal analysis revealed Gs with low Not signaling exhibit increased adhesion to niche, thereby outcompeting neighbors with high Not; adhesion is through E-cadherin expression. Experimental Notch in Gs hastens age loss from niche, and is least mediated lethal. However, Notch in Gs does not delay loss during aging, nor does it BMP, which promotes Gs. Finally, we show in contrast Gs, Notch in niche maintains niche, and mediates G retention is reduced with age, indicating Notch regulates niche both intrinsically and extrins.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes a protein kinase called UL97 that phosphorylates the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor and lamin A proteins, which are also substrates of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). A functional complementation assay has shown that UL97 has Cdk-like activity. The seven human herpesviruses encode a kinase with sequence homology to UL97, termed conserved herpesvirus kinases (CHPs). To determine if Cdk activities of UL were shared by all CHPs, we expressed epitope-tagged alleles of each protein in human cells to test R phosphorylation, U2 cells to monitor lamin disruption and phosphorylation, and S cerevisiae to assay Cdk. We found that all CHPs from beta and gamma-herpesvirus families phosphorylated R and lamin and disrupted nuclear lamina, while alpha-herpesirus homologs did not. Similarly, all beta and gamma CHPs displayed Cdk activity in S cerevis, while alpha did not. We identified virally Cdk kinases, abbreviated as vdk. We found that non-C related activities of UL ( dispersion of promyocytic leukemia protein bodies and cytoplasmic nuclear aggres ) showed weak conservation among CHPs, not segregating to viral families. Our data indicate these kinases likely serve overlapping and non-overlapping functions during infections.
Burkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative bacillus that causes melioidosis and is present in the environment in many tropical countries. The global distribution of B. pseudalleli underpins efforts to prevent infection and is dependent upon robust sampling methodology. Our objective was to review the literature on detection of environmental B. pseudalle, update the map for meloidosis, and propose international guidelines for sampling. We formed the Detection Environmental Burkholder pseudalle Working Party (DEBP) during the VIth Meloidosis Congress 2010. We searched PubMed (1912–2011) using MeSH terms: pseudalle or meloidosis and hand-searched bibliographies for references. The geographical distribution of B pseudalle in the environment was mapped as definite, probable, or possible. The methodology for detecting B pseudalle was extracted and collated. We found global coverage was patchy with lack of studies in areas where meloid is suspected. Sampling and bacterial methods were highly variable and not robust. We developed guidelines to reduce probability of false results and provide low-tech applicable in both countries. The guidelines provide basis for global map B pseudalle.
Peptide Inhibitors of Dengue Virus Entry Target a Late-Stage Intermediate of the Fusion Mechanism of Class II Viral Membrane Fusion Proteins. The mechanism of membrane fusion by class II viral proteins follows a pathway that involves large domain rearrangements of the envelope glycoprotein E and a transition from dimers to trimers. The rearrangement is believed to proceed by outward rotation of the ectodomain after loss of dimer interface followed by reassociation into trim. The ∼55-residue membrane proximal stem can then zip along domain II bringing the transmembrane segments of Cterminus and loops of domain II. We find that peptides derived from the stem of deng-virus E bind stem dimer, a conformation intermediate. In vitro assays demonstrate these peptides block viral fusion. The peptides inhibit infectivity is proportional to affinity for conformation intermediate even free is removed from preincubated inoculum before infecting cells. We conclude peptides bind virions before are carried into endosomes compartment which initiates fusion. Binding depends on dynamics there is no inhibition if preincation and separation at 4°C rather 37. We propose two-step mechanism for fusion inhibition.
Cholera is a major public health concern worldwide, with an estimated 4 million cases and 95, 000 deaths annually. Recent outbreaks in Haiti and Yemen are a reminder that cholera is still a global threat. Cholera can rapidly overwhelm health facilities, especially in remote or areas of unrest. Recent studies have shown that stool specimens on paper can be used for molecular analysis of Vibrio cholera in limited settings. Specimens can be preserved in a low-cost, safe and sustainable manner, providing new data on circulating cholera strains. This may inform policy on cholera control and elimination. Whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) recovered a complete sequence of the V. cholera O genome from stool enriched in alkaline peptone water ( AP ) and V. cholera culture, both spotted on paper. The minimum V cholera DNA to produce genomic information was 0.02 ng/μL. The data confirmed presence or absence of genes of interest, including chol toxin and pilus loci. WGS identified a variety of diarral pathogens from AP-enrich specimen filter, highlighting the potential to explore the gut microbiome and co-infections. These may impact disease severity. WGS fit the current cholera phylogenetic tree, identifying as the 7th pandemic El. W allowed mapping of reads from AP-enrich specimen and isolate filter papers. This provided molecular information on V cholera strains from remote settings. These identified co-infecting pathogens while providing insight into specific cholera strains in choleraemic areas.
Dyne Regulates Epithelial Polarity and the Apical Localization of Stard A mRNA  
    Dyne, a cytoplasmic motor protein, has been identified as an essential regulator of epithelial polarity in Drosophila follicle cells. Through a genetic screen for epithelial defects, we found that Dyne is required for ap–basal polarity. Our data suggest that Dy acts through the cytoplasmic scaffolding protein Stardust ( Sdt ) to localize the transmembrane protein Crumbs at the apical surface. This is achieved through the ap targeting of specific Sdt mRNA isoforms. We have mapped the Sdt mRNA localization signal to an alternatively spliced exon. The presence or absence of this exon corresponds to a developmental switch in S mRNA localization, where ap transcripts are found only during early stages of epithelial development and unlocalized transcripts predominate in mature epithelia. This is the first demonstration that Dy is required for epithelial polarity and suggests that mRNA localization may have a role in regulating ap–bas organization.
Leishmania infantum, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, has been thought to reproduce clonally. However, recent studies have proposed the existence of a sexual cycle in the extracellular stage of the parasite within the sand fly vector. Here, we provide evidence for intraclonal genetic exchange in L. infantum. We developed transgenic L. infant lines expressing drug resistance markers linked to green and red fluorescent reporters. We hypothesized that cells with identical genotype could recognize each other and mate. We fed sand flies with a mixture of parental clones and found that both markers were exchanged within the midgut of the vector Phlebotus periciosus. Using the yellow and drug markers, we provide evidence for genetic exchange in L.um. Hybrid progeny were triploid based on DNA analysis. The hybrid was stable throughout the parasite cycle. Infections by the hybrid in BAL/c mice caused a reduction in loads in spleen and liver, and weight similar to uninfected mice. Sple arginase was also reduced to parental strains.
Leishmanias (VL), caused by Leishmania donovani, is a major health problem in Ethiopia. Parasites in different regions are transmitted by different vectors and cluster in distinctive genotypes. Recently, strains from VL and HIV-VL co-infected patients in north and south Ethiopia were characterized as part of a longitudinal study on VL. Sixty L donani strains were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting three regions: internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS), cystine protease (cp) and HASPB (26). ITS and cp PCR identified strains as L donani. Interestingly, 26 PCR amplicon size varied depending on patient's origin. Most from north Ethiopia (36/40) produced 290 bp product with minority (4/40) giving 410 amplicon. All latter were isolated from patients with HIVL co-infections, while former contained VL and HIVL co-infected. Almost all (23) from Ethiopia produced 450 amplic with smaller (290 or 360) observed for three. Sudanese strains amplicons identical (290) to north Ethiopia; Kenyan gave larger products (500 650). High-resolution (HR) analysis distinguished products. Sequence showed 26 region in donani comprised polymorphic 13 and 14 amino motifs. 13 amino prevalent in donani rare inum The and order varies between regions donani.
HIV-1 recombination is a major source of diversity in the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Recombinant HIV-1 genomes may have novel properties that contribute to their prevalence, particularly in the case of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). We hypothesize that regions of the HIV-1 genome where recombination confers a selective advantage will deviate from the null distribution of breakpoints. To test this, we generate a probabilistic model of HIV-1 recombination and compare it to the distribution of breakpoints from the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We find that much of the HIV-1 genome is accurately predicted by our model. This indicates that a probabilistic model dependent on local identity is sufficient to explain breakpoints. In regions with significant over- or underrepresentation of breakpoints, we infer natural selection influences recombination. The paucity of breakpoints in the envelope gene indicates recombinants are less likely to be successful. Breakpoints at higher than predicted are at either side of the envelope, indicating selection for these recombinants as a consequence of this region. Our findings provide the first indication of a portion of the genome deviating from a probabilistic model. This suggests only a minority of recombination events are significant to HIV-1 evolution.
Computational modeling plays an important role in modern neuroscience research. Much of the previous research has relied on separate statistical methods to address two interdependent problems. First, given a particular model, Bayesian techniques have been used to estimate individual variation in parameters over a population of subjects, leveraging population distributions. Second, candidate models are compared, and variation in the model expressed according to the fits to each subject. We propose a Bayesian inference framework for concurrent model comparison and estimation at the population level, combining previous approaches. This framework has advantages for both estimation and model comparison theoretically and experimentally. The estimated parameters show smaller errors compared to other methods. Model comparison is robust against outliers and not biased towards simplistic. Furthermore, the approach enables inference on group parameters by t-test.
The development of the auditory circuitry in the brainstem is a complex process that involves the coordination of rhombomeres and their associated Hox genes. Here we show that rhomere 4 (r4) contributes to the development of functionally linked sensory and motor components of the auditory circuit, including the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, ventral cochlear nuclei ( VCN ) and olivocochlear neurons. The assembly of r-derived auditory components is involved in sound perception and depends on interactions between Hox1 and H2. In the absence of Hox1 and H2, transmission of low-level auditory stimuli is lost and hearing is impaired. On the other hand, H2 regulates the Rig1 axon receptor and controls contralateral projections from the VCN to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid, a circuit involved in sound localization.
The genome of the marine bacterium Saccharagus degradans strain 2-40 (S2-40) has been completely sequenced. This bacterium is a member of a recently discovered group of marine and estuarine bacteria that degrade complex polysaccharides. The genome encodes an unusually large number of enzymes that degrade >10 polysacchar. These enzymes exhibit a range of catalytic and substrate architectures, including novel combinations of catalytic and substrate modules. We hypothesize that these features facilitate depolymerization of polyschar in the marine environment. This is the first sequenced genome of a marine bacterium that degrades plant cell walls, an important component of the carbon cycle not well-characterized in the marine.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a zoonotic flavivirus that is the most common cause of viral encephalitis in children in Asia. In the last 20 years, JEV genotype has shifted from genotype III (GIII) to genotype I (GI), but the mechanism of this shift is still unknown. Culex pipiens mosquitoes are the most common mosquito species in China and play a key role in JE transmission. We used Cx pipiens mosquitoes from China as an in vivo model to explore if they played a role in J genotype shift. We exposed female Cx pip mosquitoes to GI or GIII JEV and collected midgut, organs and saliv glands at 7 and 14 days post infection. We measured infection rate, replication, dissemination, and transmission of JEV in C pip mosquitoes by 50 tissue infective dose assay. Cx pip was competent for both GI and GIII infection with similar rates and kinetics. After infection, C pip disseminated both genotypes to organs at similar rates. GI-infected saliv glands were positive at 16.2%, whereas GIII was undetectable at 7 dpi, but 29.4% and 36.3% were positive at 14 dpi. No difference in transmission rate between GI and G-infected was detected. Our data show GI and GIII have similar infectivity in C pip, suggesting C pip may not play a role in J shift.
Dengue is the fastest spreading mosquito-borne viral disease affecting people in tropical and subtropical countries. In Malaysia experienced large deng outbreaks in recent years. We conducted a retrospective review of deng deaths that occurred between 2013 and 2014 to study demographics and clinical characteristics associated with deng deaths. We extracted data from mortality reports and investigational forms and categorized cases into children (15 years ), adults (15–59 ) and elderly ( ≥60 ) to compare clinical characteristics. A total 322 deng deaths were reviewed. The mean age was 40.7±19. years, half were females and 72.5 were adults. The durations of first medical contact and hospitalization were 1 and 3 days, respectively. Diabetes and hypertension were common co-morbidities among adults and elderly. The most common signs reported were lethargy and vomiting, with letharg being more common in children (p = 0. 038 ) and abdominal pain in adults (p = 0.040 ). 22.4 did not have any signs. Only 34 were suspected deng at initial presentation. More adults developed plasma leakage (p = 0.018 ). More than half suffered multi-organ involvement and 20 were free any organ. Deaths occurred at 3 days post-admission. Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) contributed >70% deaths, followed by organ (69 ) and bleeding (29.7 ). In Malaysia, deaths primarily occurred in adults. SS was cause of death regardless groups.
Female fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) choose their mates to maximize reproductive success. One component of this choice is assessing mate quality, but little is known about traits used for this assessment or how they reflect quality. We show that insulin signaling, a nutrient-sensing pathway affecting survival versus reproduction, affects female attractiveness. This effect is due to insulin signaling in fat and ovarian follicle cells, whose signals are integrated by pherone-producing oocytes. Ovaries are required for insulin effects on attractiveness and manipulations of insulin in follicle cells recapulate global manipulations. Modulation of insulin in fat produces opposite effects on attractiveness, suggesting a competitive relationship with ovary. Tissue-specific insulin manipulations change attractiveness and fecundity in the same direction, pointing to insulin activity as a link between fecity and attractiveness. Cues, cuticular hydrocarbons respond to fat and follicle manipulations, indicating readouts of pathway from these tissues. We describe a system in which attractiveness results from connection between attractiveness and fecity, both created by insulin in fat and follicle.
During the 2013–2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, the disease spread of EVD was heterogeneous across the three countries. To understand the dynamics of EVD transmission at the district level, we estimated the basic reproduction number ( R0 ) for each district and country using weekly incident numbers of cases. We calculated growth rates during the early phase of the outbreak using exponential regression of case counts on the first eight weeks since onset. To account for heterogeneity between countries, we fitted a mixed model and calculated R0 based on predicted growth rates and serial interval distribution. At the district level, R ranged from 0. 36 ( Dubka ) to 1.72 ( Bey ) in Guinea, from 0.53 ( Maryland ) 3.37 ( Margibi ) in Liberia and 1.14 ( Koinugu ) 2.73 ( Rural ) in Sierra Leone. At the national level, we estimated R of 0.97 ( 95% 0.77–1.18 ) for Guinea,1.26 (95%.98–1.55 ) for Liberia and 1.66 (95%1.–2.00 ) Sierra. Socio-demographic factors such as high population density and wealth were positively associated with R.
Proteins are the building blocks of all living organisms, and their evolution is a fundamental to life. However, the factors that determine the rate of protein evolution are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the intrinsic properties of a protein, such as its structure, or historical factors, such as its age, determine its rate of evolution. Here, we study the interplay between structure and age as determinants of protein evolution. We use a large set of one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse proteins, with PDB structures. We find that previously observed relationships between structure and rate also hold within each group, including between solvent accessibility, designability, and rate. However, age also plays a role: it modulates the relationship between solvent and rate. Younger proteins, despite being less designable, tend to evolve faster than older ones. We show that previously relationships between age and rate cannot be explained by structural biases among groups. Finally, we introduce a knowledge-based function to study stability of proteins through large computation. We find that older proteins are more stable in their native structure and robust to mutations than younger ones.
Polycomb-like 3 (PCL) is a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that promotes embryonic stem cell (ES) self-renewal. We identified CL as a Suz12 binding partner by mass spectrometry and confirmed CL interactions with PR2 core components by co-immunoprecipitation. Knockdown of CL in ES cells increases spontaneous differentiation, yet does not affect early differentiation as assessed in teratom and embryoid bodies, indicating CL has a role in regulating ES selfnew. Consistent with CL promoting PR2 function, decreasing CL reduces H3K27me levels while overexpressing CL increases H3me levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (IP) reveal CL co-localizes with PR core component Suz, and depletion of CL decreases Suz binding at 60% of PR2 targets. Mutation of conserved residues within CL Tudor domain, implicated in recognizing methylated histones, compromises H3me formation, suggesting CL Tud domain is essential for function. CL and its paralog CL2 exist in different PR complexes but bind many of same PR targets, particularly CpG regulated by CL. CL is critical for ES selfnew, histone methylation, and PR recruitment to subset genomic sites.
Chemoreceptor gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans is regulated by both cell-autonomous and non-cellautonomous mechanisms. We show that the MEF-2 transcription factor acts together with basic helix-loop-helix (HL) transcription factors to regulate the expression of the feeding-dependent chemoreceptor gene sr-234 in the AD sensory neuron of C. elegans. We identify a cis-regulatory MEF binding site that is necessary for starvation-induced downregulation of sr-234, while an E-box known to bind HL factors is required to drive sr-234 expression in AD. We show that HL-2, HL-3, and HL-4 act in AD neurons to regulate sr-234. We further demonstrate that expression of sr- in AD neurons is regulated by MX-3 and HL-30 acting in the intestine, which is dependent on insulin signaling in AD neurons. We show that this intestine-to-neuron regulation of sr- involves a subset of insulin peptides.
Buruli ulcer (BU) is a destructive skin condition caused by infection with the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans. The mode of transmission of M. ulcerans is not completely understood, but several studies have explored the role of biting insects. This study tested the association between detection of M ulcer in mosquitoes and the risk of disease in humans in an endemic area of southeastern Australia. Mosquitoes were trapped in seven towns on the Bellarine Peninsula, Victoria, Australia, from December 2004 to December 2009 and screened for M ulcer by real-time PCR. The number of laboratory-confirmed BU cases in residents of these towns during the same period was tallied to determine the cumulative incidence in each location. Pearson correlation was calculated for proportion M ulcer-positive mosquitoes per town with incidence per town. We found a strong relationship between detection of M ulcer in mosquitoes and risk of disease ( r 0.99; 95% CI 0.92–.99; p0.001. Results strengthen the hypothesis that mosquitoes are involved in transmission of M ulcer in southeastern Australia. This has implications for development of strategies to control and prevent BU.
Mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial Mg2+ channel MRS2 result in demyelination in rats. The dmy mutation is a unique model to study the maintenance of myelin because it causes severe myelin breakdown in the central nervous system (CNS) after normal completion of myelination. We report the molecular characterization of this mutation and discuss the pathomechanisms underlying demyination. By positional cloning, we found a G-to-A transition 177 bp downstream of exon 3 of the MRS2 gene generated a novel splice site resulting in functional inactivation of the mutant allele. Transgenic rescue with wild-type M2DNA validated our findings. M2 encodes a component of the Mg2 influx system in mitochondria of yeast as well as human cells. We show that dmy rats have mitochondrial deficits with elevated lactic acid in cerebrospinal fluid, 60% reduction in ATP, and increased mitochondria in swollen oligodendrocy cytoplasm. M2-GFP recombin B transgenic rats show M2 dominantly expressed in neurons rather than oligodrocytes and ultrastructurally observed in inner mitochondria.
Microarray-based gene expression signatures have the potential to improve diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. However, current documentation of signatures does not allow for unambiguous application to external studies. This hinders independent evaluation, delaying use in clinical practice. We analyzed eight publicly available clinical microarray studies and evaluated consistency of study-internal with studyexternal diagnoses. Studyexternal classifications were based only on documented information. Documenting a signature is conceptually different from reporting a list of genes. We show that exact specification of classification alone does not define signature unambiguously. Discrepancy between studyinternal and studyexternal can be as frequent as 30% ( worst ) 18% ( median. By proposed documentation strategy, which documents quantitative information, was reduced to 1%.
Bacteria of the genus Enterobacteriaceae secrete curli amyloid fibrils that mediate cell adhesion and contribute to biofilm formation, thereby promoting resistance to environmental stress. We present the crystal structures of amyloidogenic segments from the major curli subunit Csg, revealing a steric zipper of tightly mated β-sheets. These structures demonstrate a link between curli and human amyloids. We show that anti-amyloid peptides, originally developed to interfere with Alzheimer’s amyloid-β, inhibit Csg fibrillation and biofilm formation in Salmonella typhimium. Moreover, we show that Csg fibr cross-seed amyloidβ, supporting the proposed resemblance and potential for cross-species amyloid interactions. These findings provide structural insights into amyloid regions important for curli formation and suggest a novel strategy for disrupting amyloid biofilms.
Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an important cause of encephalitis in Asia with high fatality rates and significant neurologic sequelae among survivors. The epidemiology of JE in the Philippines is not well defined. We conducted a systematic review of JE surveillance data from 2011 to 2014 to support consideration of JE vaccine introduction into the national schedule in the Philippines. We searched JE and the Philippines in four databases and one library. Data from acute encephal syndrome (AES) and JE surveillance from the national laboratory from 2011 to 2014 were tabulated and mapped. We identified 29 reports on JE in the Philippines, including 5 serologic, 18 clinical, and 8 studies including both clinical and animal. The 18 studies reported 257 laboratory-confirmed JE from 1972 to 2013. JE was the causative in 7% to 18% of cases meningitis and encephitis combined and 16 to 40% enitis. Predominantly affected under 15 years and 6 to 7% resulted in death. Surveillance from 201 to 201 identified 73 laboratory JE out of 497 tested. This review demonstrates endemic and extensive JE in the Philippines and supports use of JE in the country. Continued surveillance with confirmation is needed to quantify JE burden, provide information for prioritization of high areas in the country and determination of age and schedule of introduction, and measure of preventive measures against this important health.
Since the evolutionary origins of genetic robustness are still under debate, it is unclear whether it arises as a consequence of environmental requirements or intrinsic factors such as metabolic requirements, or as an adaptive selection of genes that allow species to endure perturbations. Here, we conduct the first large-scale study of the level of robustness of metabolic networks of hundreds of bacterial species across simulated environments. We find that variations in their level of robustness reflect ecological adaptations. We decouple robustness into two components: environmental, responsible for 20% of non-essential reactions and associated with species’ lifestyle (generalist/specialist ), and environmental, associated with intrinsic capacities of species—robustness observed in fast growers or with extensive production of secondary metabolites. Finally, we identify reactions uniquely susceptible to perturbations in pathogens, serving novel drug targets.
Schistosoma mansoni infection is associated with immune modulation that can influence responses to non-schosome antigens. We investigated the effects of S. mansoni infection on responses to childhood measles catch-up immunisation and prazantel treatment on this outcome in a randomised trial. The Immune Modulation and Childhood Immunisation (IMChI) study was conducted in Enteb, Uganda. Children aged 3–5 years (193 S mansoni-infected and 61 uninfected ) were enrolled. Infected children were randomised in 1:1 ratio to receive prazant 2 weeks before, at time, or 1 after measles immunisation. Plasma-meas Ig was measured at enrolment,1 and 24 weeks after immunisation. Anti-meas Ig levels increased following immunisation, but 1 post-immun S mansoni-inf compared to uninf had lower levels (adjusted mean 0.4 [0–.7] ) and percentage with protective levels also lower (adjusted 0–0.9 ). Among mansoni-inf, antias Ig post-immun was higher treated prant than not treated before immun (adjusted 2.1–4.8); at immunadjusted 1–3.5. 24 postimmun Ig did not differ between groups, but tended lower among previously-inf who still mans-positive than who became-negative. Our findings suggest S mansoni infection among pre-school is associated with reduced response to measles immunisation and prant improves response. S mans may contribute to impaired responses in endemic; schos control may be beneficial for vaccine efficacy.
Bacterial population evolution has become better understood in recent years due to large-scale sequencing of samples. It has become clear that DNA from a multitude of genes, as well as broad coverage of target population, is needed to obtain unbiased view of genetic structure and patterns of ancestry of strains. However, traditional methods for evolutionary inference, such as phylogenetic analysis, are associated with difficulties under extensive sampling, in particular when considerable recombination is anticipated. To meet needs of large analyses of population for bacteria, we introduce several tools for detection and representation of recombination between populations. Also, we introduce model description of shape of population in space, in terms of molecular and affinity towards populations. Extensive data from Neisseria are utilized to demonstrate potential of approach where population tools are combined with phylogen analysis.
Top-Down Beta Rhythms Support Selective Attention via Interaminar Interaction: A Model  
    Cortical rhythms have been thought to play important roles in cognitive functions. Recent studies have shown that rhythmic activity in the beta frequency band, around 20 Hz, is associated with neural correlates of attention, indicating that top-down beta rhythms generated in higher areas and delivered to sensory areas can support attentional modulation. To elucidate functional roles of beta and underlying mechanisms, we built a computational model of cortical areas. Our results show that top beta can activate ascending projections from L5 to L4 and L2/3, responsible for competition in layers. In the simulation, inhibitory interneurons are shown to resonate 20 Hz and modulate activity in layers in attention-related manner. These roles provide a mechanism by which cholinergic can support selective attention.
Stochastic compartmental epidemic models are useful for studying the emergence of novel pathogens, especially when the number of infectious individuals is small. However, methods for parameter estimation and prediction of these models remain limited. We describe a calibration and prediction framework for stochastic compartmental models. The proposed method, Multiple Shooting for Stochastic Systems ( MSS ) applies a linear approximation to describe fluctuations and uses each observation to update the epidemic state. We evaluate MSS for real-time estimation and prediction using simulated outbreaks of a novel pathogen. We assume weekly counts of new cases serve as a proxy for incidence. MSS produces accurate estimates of key parameters ( duration of infectiousness, R0, and Reff ) and the number of infectious during an epidemic. MSS also predicts future hospitalizations and attack rate. We compare MSS to three benchmark methods: 1 ) Poisson approximation; 2 ) particle filtering; 3 ) Kalman filter. MSS outperforms each in most scenarios. MSS is a promising for calibration and prediction of stochastic models.
Visual perception is shaped by two opposing forces: sensory adaptation and decisional history. In a series of experiments, we used multilevel modeling and cross-validation to investigate the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on behavioral reports during adjustment and forced-choice tasks. Our results show that perceptual reports are biased by a hierarchy of serial processes: low-level adaptation repels perception away from previous stimuli, whereas decisional attract perceptual reports toward recent. This hierarchy of serial dependence arises from decisional inertia, not low sensory processes. This is consistent with a Two-process model of dependence where decision persistence compensates for adaptation, leading to attractive biases in perception. We propose a unified account of serial dependence where functionally distinct mechanisms promote differentiation and integration of information over time.
In Drosophila, the Clock (CLK)–CY heterodimer is a key component of the circadian transcriptional complex. CY has a DNA-binding domain but lacks an activation domain. Most of the transcriptional activity of CLK–CY is derived from the glutamine-rich region of its partner CLK. To investigate the role of CY in circadian timekeeping, we analyzed the effects of a CY–viral 16 (VP) protein in Dophila. The addition of the potent transcriptional activator VP to CY enhances CLK–CY activity. This is manifested in flies expressing CY–16 as well as in S2 cells. These flies have increased levels of CLK–CY target mRNAs as well as period, implicating CY in circadian period determination. A detailed examination of reporter expression in CY–expressing flies suggests the period is at least in part due to rapid transcription. Importantly, behavioral effects require period (per) promoter and are unlikely to be a consequence of generally higher levels. This indicates CLK–VP effects are a consequence of transcription.
Horizontal gene transfer is a process by which genes are acquired by an organism from a different species. These genes can function as autonomous units, conferring new traits. However, we show that pre-existing proteins in an organism can constrain the functionality of a horizontally acquired gene if it operates on an ancestral pathway. Here, we determine how the horizontally acquired pmr gene activates the ancestral Pmr/PB two-component system in Salmonella enterica but not in closely related Escherichia coli. Salmonella pmr protein binds to phosphorylated Pmr protein (mr-P), protecting it from dephosphorylation by mr. This results in transcription of mr-dependent genes, including polymyxin resistance. We show that E coli pmr can activate mr/Pmr in Salmonella even though it cannot in coli, suggesting species differ in additional controlling mr levels. We establish E coli mr displays higher phosphatase activity mr-P than Salmonella mr, and identified mr subdomain responsible for this. Replacement coli mr with Salmonella was sufficient to render coli resistant polymin under mr-inducing conditions.
Embryonic stem cell differentiation is a complex process initiated by the gradual loss of pluripotency-associated transcripts and the induction of differentiation genes. Identifying differentially expressed genes at the early stages of differentiation is crucial for understanding the causal genes that promote or inhibit differentiation. Previous methods of identifying differentially expressed genes by comparing cell types include a large portion of genes that respond rather than regulate the process. Here, we demonstrate the use of biological replicates and a novel statistical approach that gene expression data without separation of cell types is informative for detecting differentially expressed at early differentiation. Applying this method to murine embryonic stem cells, we identified Smad1 as a novel regulator of pluripotency and self-renewal.
Functional clustering of gene variants is a common in next-generation sequencing studies. However, the function of many genes is unknown and their classification to pathways is scant. Associations between genes are often inferred from large-scale omics data, such as protein–protein interactions and gene-expression networks. Statistical significance is assessed by comparing the interconnectedness of mutated genes with random gene sets. However, interconnectedness can be affected by confounding, resulting in false positives. We show that genes implicated by de novo variants are biased in coding length and tend to cluster, leading to inflated p-values in functional studies. We present a method that addresses this bias. We inferred associations between genes from diverse data and assessed with a phenotype-based method. Examining de novo variants, we control confounding in coding length. We test different networks and find disease genes cluster more significantly in phenotypic-link than other networks. We present a tool to identify functional mutated genes in disease after sequencing bias and demonstrate suitability to cluster genes polygenic disorders.
In January 2014, the Mexican government implemented an 8% tax on nonessential foods with energy density ≥275 kcal/100 g and a peso-per tax on sugar-sweetened beverages ( SSBs ). This study examines changes in volume of taxed and untaxed packaged food purchases in response to these taxes in the sample stratified by socioeconomic status ( SES ). We analyzed data from 6, 248 households that participated in Nielsen’s Consumer Panel ( CPS ) from 2012–2014. We used a longitudinal, fixed-effects model to test whether the post-tax trend was different from the pre-tax trend. We controlled for household and contextual factors like salary and unemployment. The volume of taxed foods in 2014 changed -25 (95% CI = -46–11 ) per capita per month, a 5. 1% change from expected based on pre (2012–201 ) trends, with no change in untaxed foods. Low SES purchased 10.2% less taxed foods (–44–16 g capita per month ), medium SES 5.8 less taxed (28–11 g capita month ), whereas high SES did not change.
Neurons are the building blocks of the nervous system. They are responsible for transmitting and processing information in the brain. In the visual system, there is a type of neuron called the Lobula Giant Detector Neuron ( LGD ), which is sensitive to motion. In the past, its properties were explained by a model that used a power law for inhibitory input. However, this model did not account for the fact that neurons integrate information across a large part of the visual field. Here, we present a biophysically plausible model of LGD-like neurons. We assume that each channel is noisy and has a threshold. We then obtain an approxim power law as a result of pooling these channels. We show that this mechanism can predict many characteristics of LGD. Moreover, results depend on noise in inhibitory pathway but are robust against noise in excitatory.
Buruli Ulcer in Cameroon: The Development and Impact of the National Programme  
Buruli ulcer (BU) is endemic in Cameroon and institutional control began in 2002. The National Buruli Control Programme (NBPUC) was established to describe the evolution, achievements and challenges of the programme and make suggestions for scaling up. We collated data from 2001 to 2014 and reviewed BPUC reports in Cameroon. Case-detection and key control indicators were plotted on a scale to determine trends in performance. A linear analysis of detection from 200–2014 was done. The coefficient was tested for significance. In 14 years of control, 370 cases were notified. The rate dropped from 3.89 to 1.45 per 100,000. The number of endemic districts rose from two to 64. Five centres are functional and two are planned for 2015. The system has been strengthened and education has gained interest in Cameroon.
Metacognitive confidence is the ability to correctly estimate the probability of one’s choices being correct. It is fundamental for re-evaluating previous choices and arbitrating between decision strategies. However, it is susceptible to numerous biases. We investigated the effect of outcome valence ( gains or losses ) on confidence while learning stimulus-outcome associations by trial-and-error. In two experiments, participants were more confident in choices when learning to seek compared to avoiding, despite equal difficulty and performance between contexts. Computational modelling revealed that this bias is driven by context-value, a dynamically updated estimate of average-value of options necessary to explain performance in both gain and loss domains.
Alphaviruses are a family of positive-strand RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Among the four non-structural proteins of alphaviruses, the function of ns3 is the least understood. The ns3 protein is a component of the viral replication complex and is composed of a conserved amino-terminal macrodomain implicated in viral RNA synthesis and a poorly conserved carbox-terminal domain. Despite the lack of overall homology, we noted a carbox-terminal proline-rich motif shared by many alphavir ns3 proteins and found to serve as a preferred site for Src-homology 3 (SH) domain binding by amphiphin-1 and amphin-2. The SH domains of amphin-1 and amph-2 bind to the carbox-terminal motif of ns3 of Semli Forest (SF), Sindbis (SINV), and Chikunya viruses with high affinity. Upon alphavirus infection, the intracellular distribution of amphin was dramatically altered and colocalized with ns3. Mutations in ns3 disrupting amphin SH binding as well as RNA-mediated silencing of amphin-2 expression resulted in impaired RNA replication in HeLa cells infected with SINV or SF. Infection of Bal/c mice with SF carrying SH binding-defective ns3 was associated with decreased mortality.
Chromoblastycosis is a human disease caused by members of the fungal order Chaetothyales. We studied 123 clinical strains of the disease in Brazil by sequencing the rDNA internal transcribed spacer and partial β-tubulin genes. The strains were divided into three clusters within the family Herpotiaceae, which comprises agents of the disease. The Fonca cluster contained the most agents, with Fonsepi being the most prevalent at 80% of strains, followed by Fmonora 13%, Fnica 3% and Fpnac 1. In addition, two novel species were found among Rhinadiella and Cyphora with frequencies 3% and 1, respectively.
Listeria monocytogenes dampens the DNA damage response. The DNA damage response (DDR) is a signaling pathway that detects DNA lesions caused by endogenous or exogenous assaults and maintains genome integrity. Infection by an invading pathogen is such as Listeria monocogen is one such an assault, but how bacteria impact the DDR is poorly documented. Here, we report that infection with Listeria monocogen induces host DNA breaks. Strikingly, the response to these breaks is only moderately activated. We uncover the role of the listerial toxin listeriolysin (LLO) in blocking the response to DNA breaks through degradation of the sensor Mre11. Knocking out or inactivating proteins involved in DDR promotes bacterial replication showing the importance of this mechanism for control of infection. Together, our data highlight that bacterial dampening of DDR is critical for listerial infection.
Human herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are common pathogens that cause a range of diseases in humans. Although both viral and host factors are involved in HSV infection, the mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we show that bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) plays a critical role in HSV infection by screening a chemical library of epigenetic compounds. We found that treatment with a pan-BD inhibitor enhanced HSV infection. Using JQ as a probe, we found that JQ, a BRD1 inhibitor, acts through BR4 since BR4 knockdown ablated JQ effect on HSV. BR4 regulates HSV replication through a complex involving CDK and RNAP II; JQ promotes HSV-1 infection by allocating the complex to viral promoters. BR4 suppression or CD9 inhibition impeded HSV. Our data support a model that JQ enhances infection by switching BR4 to regulation of viral expression from chromatin since transient BR4 or BR1/2 expression had similar effect to JQ treatment. In addition, BR4 is a modulator for J action on HSV and has an essential role in infection.
Noma is a devastating disease that causes severe facial disfigurement in over 140,000 malnourished children every year. The cause of noma is still unknown, but a mix of microbial infection, oral hygiene and weakened immune system likely contribute to the development of oral lesions. These lesions are plausible entry points for unidentified microorganisms that trigger gangrenous facial infections. To catalog bacteria in noma and identify noma-triggering organisms, we performed a cross-sectional study of 16S rRNA amplicons from samples of gingival fluid from twelve healthy children, twelve suffering noma ( and healthy sites ), and twelve suffering Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis ( AN ) ( and healthy sites ). Relative to healthy, samples from diseased were enriched with Spiroetes and depleted for Proteobacteria. Samples from healthy of diseased had proportions of Spiroetes and Proteob similar to healthy individuals. Samples fromoma did not have higher of Fusobacter, casting its role as causative ofoma. Microbial sampled fromoma and AN were dominated by Prevotella OT, much less in healthy sampled from same. Multivariate analysis confirmed communities healthy and sites were different. Several OTUs in Erysotrichales, Cloidales, Bacterales, Spiroeta identified as indicatorsoma, suggesting one or microbes these associated developmentoma.
In Bacillus thuringiensis is an insect pathogenic bacterium that uses quorum sensing to coordinate sporulation and survival in the insect cadaver. Quorum sensing is mediated by regulators belonging to the RNPP family and regulated by internalized signaling peptides. One such regulator, Npr, acts as a transcription factor in the presence of its cognate peptide Npr, regulating genes involved in survival in the insect cadaver. We show that Npr inhibits sporulation in the absence of Npr, independently of its transcriptional activator function, by preventing SpoA-regulated gene expression via Kin-dependent phosphorylation of phosphotransferase SpoF, thus delaying sporulation initiation. Npr displays similarities with Rap proteins, also belonging to RNPP, devoid of DNA-binding and controlling expression via protein-protein interactions. Conservation of residues interacting with SpoF suggests common inhibition of sporulation. The structure of N confirms N displays a Rap-like structure. We propose a regulatory mechanism in which residues of N are alternatively involved in its functions. N binding switches N from dimer inhibitor of sporulation to tetramer transcriptional activator in necrotrophic lifestyle. N thus coordinates sporulation and necrophism, ensuring survival and dissemination during infection.
HIV infection cannot be cured, but can be controlled by treatment with multiple antiretroviral drugs. However, different viral genotypes exist for each patient, raising the question of which drug to use for effective treatment. With genotypic and phenotyp data, computational models can be created to predict optimal treatment for patient. Current models are based on genotypic data only; chemical drug similarity is not considered. We applied proteochem models, combining chemical and protein properties in a single bioactivity model. Our dataset was a large clinical database of genotyp and phenotyp information ( ca. 300,000 drug-mut bioactivity points, 4 NNIs, 8 NIs or 9 PIs, 10,700 NNIs 10,500 NIs or 27,000 PIs ). Our models achieved a prediction error below 0.5 Log Change. Compared to published sequence models, PCM performed better in resistance prediction and classification (0.76 versus 0.91 ). We identified known and unpublished resistance-conferring mutations of Reverse Transcriptase ( e. g.102,216 ) and Protease (. e.18,88 ) from our dataset. We applied models to public HIV database obtaining a correct prediction rate 84% compared 80%.
Chemotaxis, the process by which cells move towards or away from chemical stimuli, remains poorly understood despite extensive study. Chemotaxis is thought to occur when chemoattractants cause actin polymerization, leading to pseudop formation and cell movement. However, we have proposed an alternative mechanism supported by several lines of evidence that pseudop are made by a self-generated cycle. Chemoatants modulate the cycle rather than directly causing actin polymerization. Here, we test the explanatory and predictive powers of pseudop-based models of chemotaxis. We developed a computational model of cell movement and chemaxis based on pseudop autocatalysis. The model reproduces a wide range of existing data on cell movement and chemaxis. It simulates cell polarization and persistence without chemotaxis stimuli and accurate pseudod selection when chemoatants are present. It predicts pseudod position in chemoant gradients and pseudod initiation in gradients. To test the model, we looked for untested predictions. One prediction is that the angle between successive pseudods at the front of the cell will increase with the difference between the cell direction and the chemoant gradient. We measured pseud angles in Dictyostel cells under different conditions and results agreed with the model. Our model and data suggest that pseud cycle lies at the heart of cell motility in rapidly moving cells like Dictyostel and neutrophils. This implies that chemaxis relies on modification of pseudod behaviour more than generation of pseud or actin polymer by chemoants.
Yersinia pestis is transmitted by fleas through two mechanisms: early-phase transmission (EPT) and biofilm-dependent transmission (BDT). However, the efficiency of transmission varies among flea species and results from different studies have not always been consistent. One complicating variable is the species of rodent used for the infectious blood meal. To gain insight into the mechanism of E and the effect of host blood on, fleas were fed bacteremic mouse, rat, guinea pig, or gerbil blood and the location and characteristics of infection in the digestive tract and transmissibility of Y. pest were assessed 1–3 days after. Surprisingly,–28% of rodent fleas fed bacteremic rat or guinea blood regurgated a portion of the infected meal into the esophagus within 24 h. We term this phenomenon post-infection esophageal (PIER). In contrast, P was rarely observed in rodent fleas fed bacteremic or gerbil blood. P correlated the accumulation of dense aggregate Y. pest, red cellroma, and oxyoglobin that filled proventulus. At next feeding fle with P were 3–25 more likely to appear blocked with blood within esagus than fle without P. days after feeding bacter rat blood groups Oropsa montana transmitted significantly CF than groups using mouse blood and this enhanced was biofilm. Our support a model in which E results from regurg of pest from obstructed foreut and E and B can temporally overlap.
Positive correlations in the activity of neurons are widely observed in the brain. Previous studies have shown that these correlations to be detrimental to the fidelity of population codes or marginally favorable compared to independent codes. However, we show that positive correlations can enhance coding performance by astronomical factors. Specifically, the probability of discrimination can be suppressed by many orders of magnitude. Likewise, the number of stimuli—the capacity—can be enhanced more than tenfold. These effects do not necessitate unrealistic correlation values and can occur in populations with few neurons. We show that both effects benefit from heterogeneity seen in activity. Error and capacity rest upon a pattern of correlation. Tuning of one or several parameters can yield a limit of coding: the pattern of positive correlation to a ‘lock’ response that eliminates variability in subspace for discrimination.
Cholera is a severe diarrheal disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholera. Protection against cholera is serogroup specific and defined by the O-specific polyscharide ( OSP ) component of lipysaccharide ( LPS. Here, we describe a cholera conjugate vaccine prepared via chemical conjugation of the OSP of Vibrio cholera O1 Inaba strain O1 with a recombinant fragment of tetanus toxin heavy chain (OSP:rTH ). We assessed a range of vaccine doses based on OSP content (10–50 μg ), varying molar ratio of OSP:rTH (3:1, 5:1,10 ), adjuvant, and route of immunization. Immunized mice developed antiOSP and antiT serum IgG, as well as vibriidal and memory cell responses following intramuscular or intrader vaccination. Intestinal IgA responses targeting OSP occurred following intrader vaccination. We found comparable immune responses in mice immunized with variations, although memory and vibidal responses were blunted in mice receiving highest dose (50 μ ). We found no appreciable change in responses when conjug vaccine was administered with or without adjuvant. Administration ofOSP:rTH resulted in 55% protective efficacy in mouse cholera model. We report an OSP:rTH conjugate vaccine that induces responses and protection against cholera in mice.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease caused by Wuchereria bancrofti and Loa loa and Mansonella perst. In Cameroon, the distribution of LF has been mapped using immunochromatographic cards (ICT) to detect circulating filarial antigen (CFA). This study investigated the cross-reactivity of ICT in areas with contrasting levels of Loa and Mansonella endemicity in Cameroon. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 42 villages across three regions (East, North-west and South ) of the rainforest domain. Blood was collected from 219 participants to detect CFA by ICT and microfilaria (M) by thick smear. Clinical manifestations of LF were also assessed. Overall, 24 individuals were positive by ICT with prevalence ranging from 0% in South-west to 2.1 in North. Lymphedema was diagnosed in 20 with majority in North (11 ) and none were positive ICT. No microf W bancft were found in positive ICT or lymphedema. Positive ICT was strongly associated with Loa M intensity (odds ratio 15.4; 95CI 6.–39.0; p.001 ) and Lo prevalence (Spearman rho.900 p.037). In contrast, no association was found between ICT and perans prevalence (Spearman rho.200 p747) and Mf (odds 1.8;95CI.–.2 p192). This study confirmed association between ICT and Lo intensity (M/ml) at individual level. Furthermore, ICT was strongly associated with Lo prevalence. These results suggest main confounding factor for ICT results are Lo levels. Findings indicate bancft is less prevalent in Central region than assumed and accurate re-mapping would be useful for shrinking LF map.
SARS-CoV replication is supported by a reticular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum. Positive-strand RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV, replicate in the cytoplasm of host cells. Their replication complexes are commonly associated with modified cell membranes. We have applied electron tomography of cryixed cells for three-dimensional imaging of coronavirus-induced membrane alterations at high resolution. Our analysis defines a reticular network of modified endoplasm reticulum that integrates convol membranes, numerous double-membr vesicles ( DM ) and “ves packets” arising from DM merger. Convoluted membranes were abundantly immunolabeled for viralase subunits. Double-stranded RNA, presumably the site of viral synthesis, localized to DM interior.
Root suberin is a key component of the plant cell wall that has been proposed to act as a chemical barrier to water and solute transport in roots. However, the role of suberin in water and solute transport has not been supported by direct genetic evidence. Here, we show that suberin plays a critical role in controlling water and solute transport in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. The suberin1 ( es1 ) mutant, characterized by increased suberin in the root, had reduced transpiration rates and increased water-use efficiency during vegetative growth. These changes in suberin and water transport were associated with decreased accumulation of Ca, Mn, and Zn and increased accumulation of Na, S, K, Se, and Mo in the shoot.
The kinetics of rhodopsin deactivation plays a crucial role in regulating the reproducibility of the single photon response (SPR) in vertebrate phototransduction. The dynamics of rhops during its lifetime, including the number of phosphorylations, catalytic activity, and sojourn time at each phosphorylation level, contribute to the variability of electrical responses. However, the SPR is highly reproducible. To understand the mechanisms that confer such low variability, the kinetics of rhops deactivation was investigated using a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model based on the biochemistry ofops activation and deactivation, interfaced with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction. The model parameters were extracted from photoresponse data of wild type and mutant mice with variable numbers of phosphorylation sites. The model reproduced both wild type and mutant responses. The sources of variability were dissected into components to determine whether random number of turn steps, random soj time between, or both give rise to variability. The model shows that only randomness of soj times in phosphorylated states contributes to Coefficient Variation (CV) of response, whereas number of turn steps has negligible effect.
In this work, we develop a mathematical framework to uncouple the dynamics of a stochastic reaction network from its fluctuating environment. This is achieved by incorporating the environment's effect onto the network into a new decoupled model. We show how fluctuating extrinsic components ( e. g., chemical species ) can be marginalized to obtain this decoupled model. We derive the corresponding process and master equations for the decoupled model and show how stochastic simulations can be performed. We demonstrate the significance of the approach using several case studies.
Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) have been developed using decoders such as Kalman filters and closed-loop decoder adaptation (CLDA). However, current decoders do not model spikes directly and may limit processing-scale BMI and adaptation. We develop a novel closed-loop BMI architecture that allows processing, control, and adaptation using spike events. The architecture incorporates an infinite-hor feedback (OFC) model of the brain’s behavior in closed BMI, and a point model of spikes. The OF model infers user’s intention during CL—a termed estimation. OF is also used to design autonomous and assisted training. The process allows neural, control and adaptation with every event at a faster-scale than current decoders; also enables spike-based adaptation unlike methods that use slower adaptation. We conducted experiments in a non-human primate over days to dissociate the effects of these components. OF estimation improved performance compared with techniques. OF assisted the subject to achieve proficient. Spike-based resulted in faster and consistent compared methods and was robust initialization. The architecture extended to tasks beyond training.
Retinal ganglion cells respond to a wide range of stimuli, from natural movies to white noise. We investigated the effect of stimulus structure on correlations between ganglion cell responses and found that they were modestly correlated for spatio-temporally structured stimuli, such as movies, but less than predicted by a non-adting model. For stimuli with purely spatial correlations, ganglion responses were consistent with a static non-adting receptive field and nonlinearity. We found that ganglion cells responding to spatio-temporally correlated stimuli had faster temporal kernels and stronger surrounds than those responding to uncorrelated stimuli. These properties, along with changes in effective contrast at ganglion input, explained pairwise correlations across receptive field measurements.
Genetic interactions occur when a combination of mutations results in a surprising phenotype. These interactions capture functional redundancy and are important for predicting, dissecting complexes into functional pathways and exploring the mechanistic underpinnings of common diseases. Synthetic and sickness are the most studied types of interactions in yeast. However, only a small proportion of gene pairs have been tested for interactions due to the number of possible gene pairs. To expand the set of synthetic lethal ( SL ) interactions, we have devised an integrative multi-network for predicting interactions that improves upon existing approaches. We defined a number of features characterizing relationships between genes from data. These features are independent of known interactions, in contrast to previous approaches. Using these features, developed a non-parametric multi-classifier for interactions that enabled simultaneous use of multiple procedures. Several experiments demonstrated SL features in conjunction with classification led to improved performance compared to current method. Using this, derived the first transcription factor genetic network, supported by literature. Also used this to interactions between non-essential yeast ( http://sage. fh.downloads/predict_yeast_interactions. ).
The BRCA Challenge is a long-term data-sharing project initiated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GAH) to aggregate BRCA1 and BRCA2 data to support collaborative research. The project aims to generate an informed understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk across the iconic predisposition genes BRCA1 and BR2. Initially, BRCA and BR2 variants from public databases were integrated into a single site, www. brcaexchange. org. The BR Exchange provides the community with a reliable and easily accessible record of interpreted variants for high-penetr phenotype. More than 20, 000 variants have been aggregated, three times the number in the largest public database at project outset, approximately 7, 250 have classifications. The data is based on information from clinical databases—Breast Cancer Core (ICBIC), ClinVar and Leiden Variation (LOD) as well as population databases linked to single access.
Malaria, caused by the apicomplex parasite Plasmodium, is a major threat to human health and leads to about one million deaths annually. Plmod is a rapidly multiplying unicellular organism with a complex life cycle in man and mosquito that requires adaptation to various environments. In order to deal with reactive oxygen species and maintain redox processes and pathogenicity, Plmod depends on adequate redox balance. By studying subcellular localization of antioxidant and redox proteins, we obtained the complete map of red compartment in Plmodium falcum. We demonstrate targeting of Plmod peroxiredoxins and putative glyal system to apoplast, a nonphotosynthetic plastid. We obtained complete picture of compartment of thiorexin and glutaredin-like proteins. Notably, major redoxenzymes glutathione reduct and thioreduct Plmod use alternative-initiation ( ATI ) to achieve differential localization.
The intrinsically disordered protein (ID) PUM binds to its partner Mcl-1 through its BH3 motif, which folds into an α-helix upon binding. We used a structure-based coarse-grained model with an explicit Debye-Hück charge to investigate the role of electrostatic interactions in the coupled folding and binding process. The model was calibrated with experimental data on helical content and binding affinity and shown to be consistent with previously published data on binding changes with respect to ionic strength. We found that intramolecular electrostatic interactions influence unbound PUM only marginally. However, intermolecular electrostatic interactions, particularly non-native electrostatic interactions, are involved in the formation of the initial complex. Our results reveal the binding mechanism in more detail than possible with experimental data alone and uncover the role of non-native electrostatic interactions.
Polycomb group (Pc) proteins are conserved chromatin factors that maintain the silencing of key developmental genes outside their expression domains. Recent genome-wide analyses have shown that Polycomb proteins bind to discrete Polycomb response elements (PREs). Within the nucleus, Poly proteins localize in structures called Polycomb bodies that contain Poly-silenced genes, and it has been shown that PREs form long-range networks. Here, we studied the nuclear distribution of two Poly proteins, Polyhomeotic (PH) and Polyhomeotic (PC). Using a combination of immunostaining, immuno-FISH and live imaging of GFP proteins, we analyzed the formation and motion of Poly bodies during fly embryogenesis as well as their behavior compared to the condensed fraction of euchromatin. ImmunoISH experiments show that Poly bodies correspond to 3D counterparts of linear domains identified in genome-wide studies. During embryogenesis, Poly and PH progressively accumulate in Poly bodies, which form structures localized on euchatin domains containing histone H3-methylated on K27. Time-lapse analysis indicates two types of influence the displacement of Poly bodies and chromatin containing H2-G. First, chromatin and Poly bodies undergo long-range motions that correspond to the movement of chromosome territories. Second, each Poly body and chromatin has its fast highly constrained motion. In this regime, Poly move within volumes larger than chromatin domains. Moreover, both types move volumes much smaller chromosome, restricting their interaction with other structures.
Somatic mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been implicated in the aging process, but there is no universally accepted method for their quantification. We have used ultra-deep sequencing to study the genome-wide mtDNA load in the liver of normally-aging and prematurely-aging mice that are homozygous for an allele expressing proofreading–deficient mtDNA polymerase (mtDNA mut mice ). We found that mt mut mice have 10–times higher mutation loads than their wildtype siblings. In addition, mt mice have increased levels of truncated mtDNA, resulting in decreased coverage in deleted regions. In contrast, mt molecules with deletions occur at extremely low frequencies in mt mice and therefore do not drive premature aging. Sequence analysis shows that the proportion of mutations in heterozygous mt mice and wildtype siblings is inherited from heterozygous mothers consistent with germl transmission. We found no increase in mutations or deletions in wild C57/6 mice with increasing, thus questioning causative role these in aging. In addition, there was no frequency transversions with time in any genotypes, arguing against damage as major mt mutations.
The Na+-driven ATP synthase of the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum uses glutamate decarboxylation to generate a transmembrane Na+ gradient. We demonstrate that this ionotive force is directly coupled to ATP synthesis via F1FoATP synthase with a novel Na+ recognition motif shared by human pathogens. Molecular modeling and free-energy simulations of the c-ring indicate Na+ specificity in physiological settings. Consistently, activity measurements show Na+ stimulation of either membrane-embedded or isolated enzyme and ATP synthesis is sensitive to Na ionophore monens. Furthermore, Na has a protective effect against inhibitors targeting ion-binding sites in both ATPase and c-ring. Definitive evidence of Na coupling is provided by two crystal structures of c-ring solved at 2. 2 and 2. 6 Å resolution at 5. 3 and 8.7, respectively. Na+ occupy all sites, coordinated by amino acids and water. Intriguingly carboxylates mediate ion binding. Simulations and experiments demonstrate this implies a proton is bound all sites although Na drives mechanism. The structure reveals new ion coupling in ATPases and provides basis for drug efforts against opportunistic pathogen.
T cell activation is a key event in the initiation of adaptive immunity. T cells recognize foreign peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells. In vitro, high-affinity and long-lived interactions between T cell receptors (TCR) and MHC correlate with high potency T activation. However, little is known about the influence of TCRM interaction on cell responses in vivo. We studied the influence of TCRM characteristics on cell immunity by tracking CD4+ cell activation, effector, and memory responses to immunization with peptides exhibiting a range of TCRM half-lives and in vitro activation potencies. We found that optimal in vivo cell responses occur to ligands with intermediate TCRM halfives. This is contrary to predictions from in vitro studies. In vivo responses to ligands with longest TCRM halfives were associated with attenuation of intracellular signaling, expansion, and function over a range of time.
Ascomycous fungus Nria haematocca, a member of the Fusarium solani complex, is a highly diverse species that can cause disease in >100 plant genera and opportunistic infections in humans. The most studied member of this complex, N. haematocca mating population VI ( MP ) has 17 chromosomes ranging from 530 kb to 6. 52 Mb and a genome size of 54. 43 Mb and 15, 707 predicted genes, the largest in ascomycetes. Two classes of genes contribute to expansion: those not found in other fungi, including its relative Fusarium gramineum, and those commonly single in other fungi but multiple in N. haematca MP. Some may have resulted from duplication, others from horizontal transfer. Supernumerary chromosomes 14, 15, and 17 were confirmed absent in pulsed gel electrophoresis experiments lacking chromosome-specific sequences on ends. These have more repeat sequences, unique genes, and lower G+C content than others.
Herpesviruses are enveloped viruses that egress from infected cells through a dynamic process involving the host secretory pathway and viral components. To elucidate the location, dynamics, and molecular mechanisms of herpesvirus egress, we developed a live fluorescence microscopy method to visualize the transport and exocytosis of pseudorabies virus ( PR ) particles in non-polar epithelial cells. This method is based on total reflection ( TIR ) microscopy to image virus near the plasma, and takes advantage of a virus-encoded probe to visualize the precise location of exytosis. We performed single-particle tracking and squared analysis to characterize particle, and imaged a panel of proteins to identify spatially and dynamically associated with exyt. Based on our data, individual particles travel to the plasma inside acidified secretory vesicles. GTPases Rab6, Rab8, and Rab11, regulators of the membrane secretory pathway, are present on the vesicles. These vesicles undergo fast directional transport to the site of exyt, which is frequently near LLβ, part of a complex that anchors microtubules to the plasma. Vesicles are docked at the site exyt for seconds and fusion occurs, displacing the virion across the plasma. After exyt, particles remain confined on the outer surface.
Infection with Enterobius vermicularis and treatment with mebendazole has a significant impact on the intestinal microbiota and immune response in children. In this study, we recruited 109 first grade school children in Taich, Taiwan, 30 pin-negative and 79 pin-infected, to examine the effect of meendazole on gut microbiota and immune responses. We collected fecal samples from pin-infected individuals at 2 weeks after meendazole treatment. We found that Enterob infection increased gut diversity and peaked after meend treatment. At the phylum level, pin and meend were associated with decreased abundance of Fusobacteria and increased Actinobacteria. At genus level, relative abundance of probiotic Bifobacterium increased after Enterob and meend treatment. Intestinal SIg level was lower in pin-inf group and elevated in meend-treated. Higher pre-treatment Salmonella was associated with increased SI after meend dewing.
Genome-wide association analysis of root length in Arabidopsis thalian reveals epist cancellation of additive genetic variance. We examined the genetics of root length in Arabidopsis thalian and found that the narrow-sense heritability for this trait in the examined population was statistically zero. The amount of additive variance that could be captured by genome-wide genotypes likely explains why no associations to length could be found using standard additive-based genome-wide association (GWA) approaches. However, the broad-sense herit for length was larger and primarily due to epist. We performed epist GWA to map loci contributing to epist genetic variance. Four pairs of loci were revealed, involving seven chromosomal loci that passed a standard-testing threshold. The genotype-phenotype for these pairs revealed epist that cancelled out genetic, explaining why loci were not detected in WA. We estimated the risk of false positives using a new approach and suggested that half the pairs were true associations. Our evaluation of candidate within the loci suggests this estimate is conservative; we identified genes that affected root in four loci were part of three pairs. The epist analyses were indispensable for confirming and identifying genes for length in this population of wild-collected A. thaliana accessions.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are a common cause of human disease and have been found to occur multiple times in the world population. The clinical presentation of disease-causing mtDNA mutations is strongly associated with mtDNA haplogroup, but it is not clear whether this is limited to a few examples or a general phenomenon. We determined the characteristics of 30,506 mtDNA sequences globally. After quality control, we established a pathogenic score for each allele. The pathogenic score for disease-causing mutations was significantly different between mtDNA haplogroups. Several mutations were observed in all haplogroups, whereas others only in specific clades. In some, this was a founder effect, but others recurred in same phylogenetic cluster. Sequence diversity showed disease-causing were more frequent in young sequences and genomes with two or more disease-causing were more than expected by chance.
Cells are able to coordinate their motion to achieve collective motility in processes such as cancer metastasis, embryonic development, and wound healing. To study cell-cell interactions, including contact inhibition of locomotion ( CIL), micropatterned substrates are used to restrict cell migration to linear, quasi-one-dimensional paths. In these assays, polarized cells frequently collide with only a few possible outcomes: reversing direction, sticking to one another, or walking past one. Using a phase field model of collective motility that includes cell mechanics and a minimal CIL model, we reproduce all outcomes in two-cell collisions. A balance between cell polarization, C and cell adhesion governs the outcome. We identify parameters that control transitions between outcomes: cell adhesion strength, propulsion, and C rates. These suggest why different cell types have different collision behavior and effect interventions that modulate outcomes. To reproduce heterogeneity in outcomes observed in neural crest cells, we must either tune parameters or assume significant variation in key parameters like adhesion.
Thioredoxin (Tr) mixed disulfide dissociation has been a topic of debate for more than twenty years. The role of the nucleophilic cysteine in the dissociation of the complex has been controversial. We used the complex between Tr and its endogenous substrate arsenate reductase (ArsC) as a model. In this complex, a CysTr-CysArs disulfide is formed by nucleophil attack of CysTr on exposed CysArs-CysArs in oxidizedArs. We studied Tr disulfide dissociation by theoretical analysis, molecular simulations and biochemical experiments with cysteine mutants. We observed conformation changes around the disulfide bring Cys in contact with Cys. Cys is activated for nucleophil attack by hydrogen, andys is more reactive thanysArs. Additionally,ys directs nucleophil attack on moreys thanysArs. This multidisciplinary approach provides insights into universal thiol/disulf exchange mechanism in reduced and oxidTr.
People’s preferences are not fixed and can be influenced by the preferences of others. We hypothesise that people are uncertain about their tastes and can learn about them by considering the preferences of others and updating their beliefs. If a person’s choice reflects uncertainty, then the degree of taste change should correlate with their choice variability. Temporal discounting is an example of taste-for-patience. We examined discount preferences in a large study of 14–24 year olds. We assessed discount behaviour, including variability before and after observing another’s choices. We found evidence for taste uncertainty and Bayesian updating. First, decision variability was better accounted for by random-taste than response-noise model. Second, taste shifts were described by Bayesian taking into account uncertainty and social information.
In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, filamentous growth is a complex process that is regulated by multiple signaling pathways. We used a novel approach called secretion profiling to measure the release of the extracellular domain of Msb2, a mucin that functions at the head of the filamentous growth ( FG ) MAPK pathway. Secretion profiling of a genomic collections showed that many pathways that regulate filamentous growth ( AS, RIM, O1, and RT ) were also required for FG pathway activation. This sensitized the pathway to multiple stimuli and synchronized it to the global network. Several regulators were required for MS2 expression, which identifies MS2 as a target where multiple signals converge. Accessibility to MS2 was regulated by histone deacetylase Rpd3L, which positively regulated pathway and filament growth.
Fruiting body development in filamentous fungi is a complex process that has been shaped by changes in gene expression during evolution. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that changes in gene expression are important for the evolution of divergent morphologies. We examined five species of Sordarcomycetes in a common environment and measured gene expression at five developmental stages. We reconstructed ancestral expression phenotypes and identified genes with the largest increases in expression during development. We then conducted knockouts and phenotypic analysis in two divergent species and found altered fruiting development in the species with increased expression. Our approach was more efficient than other studies that targeted whole genomes or gene families. Combining expression with phenotypes refined Bayesian networks underlying fruit body regulation, which is one of the least understood processes in multicellular development.
Schistosome eggs are an attractive targets for transgenesis because they have a high ratio of germ to somatic cells and can be propagated by infecting snails with miracidia hatched from treated eggs. We investigated the utility of square electroporation to deliver transgenes and macromolecules into Schistosoma mansoni eggs. Eggs were incubated with Cy-labeled siRNA and without electrop and Cy-signals were detected by microscopy in eggs and miria hatched from treated. Electrop was employed to introduce mRNA encoding firefly luciferase into eggs. Luciferase was detected 3 hours later, whereas lucifer was not evident in eggs soaked in mRNA. Schist eggs were exposed to Moloney leukemia virions ( ML ) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein ( V ). Proviral trans were detected by PCR in DNA from miria hatched virion-exposed, indicating trans in larval schosomes had been electorated. However, qPCR determined electrop virions resulted 2–3 times copies in schosomes compared to alone. In addition, qPCR indicated copy for proviral lucifer trans ∼20 copies 100 endogenous cathepsin.
Large macromolecular assemblies are important for many biological processes in cells, and allosteric communications between different parts of these machines play critical roles in cellular signaling. However, studies of the topology and fluctuation dynamics of coarse-grained residue networks do not provide characterization of the time-dependent behavior of macromolecular assemblies. Here, we develop a novel approach called Perturbation Markovian Transmission (PM) to study the dynamic responses of macrom assemblies. By monitoring responses of all residues (>8,000) across many (>6) decades of time from perturbation until equilibrium using Kry subspace projection, we show that this approach can yield rich information. With criteria of quantitative measurements of relaxation-time, flow change, and oscillation, this approach can identify residues important for macrom movement, messenger that mediate signal, and important for binding.
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is sensitive to the fungal galectin CGL2 from the mushroom Coprinus cinerea. When C. elegans is fed CGL2, its development is inhibited and it is ultimately killed. This effect is not due to the carbohydrate-binding activity of C2, but rather its interaction with a fucose-containing glycojugate. A screen of C2-resistant C elegans mutants identified the glycojugate as a Gal1, 4Fuc1, 6 modification of the nemode’s N-glycan core. This was confirmed by analysis of N-gcan structures in wild and C2-resistant C elegans and identification of a putative glycosyltransferase required for its biosynthesis. The X-ray structure of C2 bound to the Gal1, 4uc, 6lcNA trischar at 1. 5 Å resolution revealed the basis for this interaction. Our results suggest that fungal galectins play a role in defense against predators by binding specific glycojugates of these organisms.
Latent reservoirs of latently infected CD4+ T cells are a major barrier to curing HIV and have been extensively studied. However, the effect of these reservoirs on the evolutionary dynamics of the virus has received little attention. We present a within-host quasis model that incorporates a long-lived reservoir and nest it into an epidemiological model of HIV. For biologically plausible parameter values, we find that the presence of a reservoir severely delays evolutionary dynamics within a host, with longer delays associated with larger reservoir sizes and homeostatic proliferation of cells within reservoir. These delays change the dynamics of virus at epidemiological scale. In particular, the delay within evolutionary dynamics is sufficient for virus to evolve intermediate loads consistent with maximising transmission, as observed, not very high loads previous models predicted. This effect can be enhanced if viruses similar to those initiating infection are preferentially transmitted. Results depend on within characteristics such as reservoir size, with evolution observed only when dynamics sufficiently delayed.
Coxsackievirus B3 Inhibits Antigen Presentation In Vivo, Exerting Profound and Selective Effect on MHC Class I Pathway
Leprosy Type 1 reactions are a major cause of nerve damage and preventable disability. Lepros Type 1 reactions are treated with corticosteroids, but there are few data to support the optimal dose and duration of treatment. Lep Type 1 reactions have a Th1 immune profile with cutaneous and neural lesions expressing interferon-γ and interleukin-12. Methylprednisone has been used in Th1 mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis to switch off the immune response. We investigated the efficacy of three days high dose (1 g ) intravenous methylprednisone at start of prednisone therapy in Lep Type 1 reactions and nerve impairment. Forty individuals were randomised to methylprednisone followed oral predone ( n ) or oral predone ( n ). There were no differences in rate of adverse events or improvement at completion of study. Individuals treated methylprednisone were less likely those predone to experience deterioration in function between 29 and 113 of study. The study demonstrated 50% Type 1 and nerve impairment required additional predone despite weeks corticoids.
Regulatory CD4+CD25highFoxP+ T cells (Tregs) have been shown to modulate CD8 T cell responses in HIV-negative settings by maintaining the balance between memory and effector CD8 T cells, at least in part through the PD-1/PD-L pathway. Here, we investigated the effects of Tregs on CD8 responses in chronic HIV infection. Tregs from HIV-infected patients (Treg/HIV) did not inhibit polyclonal autologous CD8 T function, suggesting a defect in suppressive capacity of Treg or lack of sensitivity of effector cells in HIV. However, Treg inhibited IFNγ expression of autolog CD8 cells stimulated with CMV/EBV/Flu (CEF) antigens, but not HIV-specific CD8 cells. In cross cultures, Treg inhibited differentiation of CEF- or HIV-specific CD8 cells from infected patients. PD-1 and PD-L expression was higher on HIV-specific CD8 cells compared to CEF CD8 cells, and did not change after Treg depletion or co-culture with Treg, unlike C-specific CD8 cells. We show a defect of Treg in modulating differentiation and expression of PD-1/P-L on HIV CD8 cells. Our results suggest this defect might contribute to exhaustion of HIV-specific responses.
Lymphatic filarial parasites, such as Wuchereria bancrofti, survive in the lymphatic vessels for years by adopting immunomodulatory strategies, including the release of glutathione-transferases ( GSTs ) that counteract oxidative radicals produced by the host. Since GSTs are critical for parasite survival, several studies have evaluated GSTs as vaccine candidates against schistosiasis, fascias and Seteria. However, the potential of GSTs of lymphatic parasites has not been evaluated. In this study, GST was cloned from the third larval ( L ) cDNA of Wucher bancroft and recombinant GST ( rWGST ) was expressed and purified. Serum from individuals living in an endemic area were analyzed for reactivity with rWGST. Results showed that sera from endemic individuals ( EN ) carried significant levels of anti-WGST IgG compared to microfilaremic ( M ) or clinical pathology ( CP ) subjects. Isotype analysis of anti-WGST Ig showed predominance of Ig1 and Ig3 in EN. Subsequent analysis of rGST showed that rGST retained enzymatic activity and EN sera could inhibit this activity. Similar results were obtained when antiGST raised in mice were used in neutral assay. Brug mal GST and WGST show significant similarity. To evaluate rGST potential, we used B mal L as parasites. rGST was evaluated by confirming human and mouse GST in antibody dependent cytotoxic ( AD ) assay. Subsequent vaccination in j showed approximately 61% protection against B L challenge in jirds immunized rGST. Results show rGST is a candidate against lymphatic.
CRISPR-Cas technologies have revolutionized genome editing of experimental organisms and hold immense therapeutic potential. Despite advances in understanding of the CRPR-Cas system, concerns remain over potential off-target effects. Recent studies have addressed these using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of gene-ed embryos to search for de novo mutations (DNMs), which may represent changes introduced by editing. However, these studies used strain-matched but not pedigree-matched controls and were unable to distinguish generational or colony differences from DNMs. Here, we used a trio design and whole genome sequenced 8 parents and 19 embryos, 10 of which were mutised with well-characterised gRNAs targeting the coat Tyrosinase (Tyr) locus. Detailed analyses of these genome data allowed us to conclude that if CRPR mutagenesis were causing SN or indel off-target mutations in embryos then the number of these is not distinguishable from background DNMs due to other processes.
Stomatal aperture is a critical for photosynthesis and transpiration in plants. Stomata are located on the leaf epidermis and regulate CO2 uptake and water loss. Stomatal aperture affects photosynthesis, water use, and crop yields. Blue light is one of the environmental signals that regulates stomatal aperture and is perceived by blue/UV-A light-absor cryptochromes phototropins. The signal cascades that link light to stomatal response are largely unknown. We report two new players, Hypersensitive Red 1 ( HR1 ) and Proteinosphatase 7 ( PP7 ), and their genetic and biochemical interactions in stomatal control. Mutations in HR1 or PP lead to stomatal misregulation and reduce water loss under light. HR1 and PP are expressed in guard cells in response to light-dark or dark-light transition. HR1 interacts PP through N-terminal zinc finger motif and requires PP for stomatal response. HR1 is phosphorylated in vivo and PP dephosphorylates HR1. HR is dephosphorylated in 193 kDa complex in dark and light increases to 285Da. In PP mutant this shift is impaired and HR is phosphorylated. We propose HR modification by PP under light is essential for proper HR conformation or new components for HR complex.
The Mediator subunit MDT-15 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to ingested materials in Caenorhabditis elegans. MDT-15 is a component of the Mediator complex, a multisubunit that interacts with transcription factors such as the sterol response binding protein SBP-1 and the nuclear receptor NHR-49 to regulate fatty acid metabolism. Here, we show that MDT-15 has a broader role in integrating responses to ingested materials. Depletion of MDT-15 or mutation of the mdt-15 gene impairs induction of detoxification genes in response to xenobiotics and heavy metals, making animals hypersensitive to toxins. In contrast, MDT-15 does not affect other stress responses, such as thermotolerance. MDT-15 appears to selectively affect responses to ingestion, as MDT defects do not abrogate other stress responses. Together with previous findings that MDT:NHR-49 complexes coordinate the fasting response, we propose that MDT integrates several transcriptional pathways to monitor the availability and quality of ingested materials, including nutrients and xenobiotics.
The hippocampus is the brain region responsible for creating a mental map of an animal’s environment. It has been assumed that the hippocampus encodes geometric information such as distances and angles. However, the hippocampus consists of patterns of spiking activity across many neurons and downstream regions must be able to translate those patterns into information about an animal’s spatial environment. We hypothesize that the temporal pattern of neuronal firing, particularly co-firing, is key to decoding spatial information and since coiring implies spatial overlap of place, a map by coiring will be based on connectivity and adjacency, i. e. it will be topological. We test this topological hypothesis with a model of hippocampal activity varying parameters firing rate, place field size and number of neurons in simulations of rat in topologically and geometrically distinct environments. We find that patterns of neuronal coiring convey topological information about environment in biologically realistic time. Furthermore, simulations reveal a “learning” region that highlights interplay between parameters combining to produce hippocamp states more or less adept at map. For example, within learning a lower number of neurons can be compensated by adjustments firing or place size but beyond point formation begins to fail.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) production involves the assembly of virions on the surface of lipid droplets and envelopment at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in association with components of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis and egress via the secretory pathway. However, the cellular requirements and mechanistic understanding of HCV secretion are incomplete. We combined RNA interference (RNAi) analysis of host factors for HCV secretion with development of live imaging of H core trafficking to gain a detailed understanding of H egress. RNA studies identified components of the secretory pathway including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi trafficking, lipid and protein kinases that regulate budding from trans-Golgi network (TGN), VAMP vesicles and adaptor, and recycling endosome. Our results support a model wherein HCV is infectious enveloped at ER and exits the cell via secretory pathway.
Loss of imprinting of the gene Grb10 promotes tumor formation in irradiated Nf1−/− mice. Imprinted genes are expressed from only one parental allele and heterozygous loss of the allele is sufficient to produce complete loss of expression. Genetic alterations are common in tumorigenesis but the role of imprinted genes in this process is not well understood. In this work, mice were mutagenized heterozygous for the Neurofibromatosis tumor suppressor gene (NF1) to model radiotherapy-associated malignant neoplas that arise in irradiated NF patients. Expression of cell lines established from mouse models identified Gr10 as absent. Gr10 is imprinted and polymorphism of lines and tumors demonstrates the allele commonly lost in NF mutant arising in mouse. We performed studies to test whether Gr10 restoration or loss alter fundamental features the growth. Restoring10 in mutant tumors decreases proliferation, soft agar formation and downregulates Ras. Conversely,10 silencing in untransform embryo significantly increased proliferation and Ras-G levels. Expression a constitutively ME rescued cells from10-mediated in colony. These reveal that10 can occur during tumorigenesis with consequence in untransform primary. In,10 loss promotes Ras hyperactivation which proliferation, feature of development.
Pavlovian fear conditioning is an aversive learning process in which animals learn to predict threat from environmental cues. The neural mechanisms supporting this process are not well understood. Different computational models give different predictions for the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning. We investigated autonomic nervous system ( AN ) responses to conditioned stimuli during Pavlov fear conditioning. We used a statistical framework for psychophysiological modelling to obtain precise, trial-by-trial, single-subject estimates of AN responses. We considered previously proposed non-probabilistic, probabilistic, and non-learning models as well as different observation functions to link models with AN activity. Across three experiments, both skin conductance ( SCR ) and pupil size ( PS ) responses were best explained by a probabilistic model. Notably, SCR and PS reflect different quantities of the model: SCR a mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty, while PS track expected alone. By combining psychophysiological modelling with computational theory, we provide evidence that Pavlov threat in humans may rely on probabilistic inference and estimation of uncertainty.
In the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, the septation network (SIN) plays a key role in cytokinesis and asexual reproduction. The SIN is composed of a conserved SepH (Cdc7) kinase cascade, while the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) pathway responds to stress and environmental factors via successive phosphorylation. In this study, we identified PomA as a negative regulator of septation and conidiation in A. The pom mutant is defective in septation and conidiation, while overexpression of pomA suppresses septation. Under normal conditions, Sep positively regulates phosphorylation of MAP-Hog, while Pom negatively affects this process. In the absence of Pbs, a putative upstream member of Hog, Pom and Sep are unable to affect Hog phosphorylation. Under osmotic conditions, phosphorylated Hog bypasses the requirement of Sep, a key in early cytokinesis, but not Mob/Sid, last in the SIN kinase cascade, indicating osmotic-induced septation bypasses Sep requirement but not SIN. Our findings demonstrate crosstalk between SIN and MAP pathways. Pom and Sep indirectly regulate Hog phosphorylation through Hog upstream kinases.
Leishmanias is a vector-borne disease endemic in Latin America that causes approximately 20 thousand cases per year. The pathogenesis of the disease is not fully understood. Clinical manifestations vary from cutaneous leishmanias ( CL ) to severe outcomes such as disseminated leishiasis ( DL ) mucosal leishias ( ML ) and diffuse cutaneous leishias ( DCL. Recent studies have reported that the presence of Leish RNA virus 1 ( LRV1 ) is an important factor associated with the severity of ML in experimental models. This study investigated the presence of LRV in 156 patients with leishias clinical diagnoses (109 CL; 38; ML; 5 CL+ML; DL and 1 DCL and molecular diagnoses. LRV was tested by RT-PCR and Leish species were determined by HSP PCR-RPL. LRV was detected in 71. 1% ( n 27 ) of mucosal lesions and 36.7 ( n 40 ) of cutaneous lesions. The ratio of LRV+ to LRV- was 2.93 ( CI 1.57–5.46; p<.001. LRV is associated with the occurrence of mucosal leishias, as previously described in animal models. LRV is not the only factor contributing to disease.
Type I interferon (IFN) plays an important role in the host defense against Streptococcus pneumoniae infection by counteracting the transmigration of bacteria from the lung to blood. We show that mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (Ifar−/− ) or treated with a neutralizing antibody against type interferon exhibited enhanced development of bacteremia following intranasal pneumoccal infection, while maintaining bacterial numbers in the lung. In contrast, treatment of mice with IFβ or IF-inducing synthetic double stranded RNA ( poly:C ) dramatically reduced development of bacteremia following intral infection with S pneumonia. IFβ led to upregulation of tight junction proteins and downregulation of pneumoccal receptor platelet activating factor receptor (PAF receptor ). In accordance with these findings, IF reduced pneumoccal invasion across epithelial and endothelial layers and If− mice showed enhanced lung permeability.
Spiking neural networks with a single layer employing reward-modulated spike dependent plasticity (STDP) are capable of learning simple foraging tasks. Here, we demonstrate pattern and continuous learning in a network of spiking neurons with multiple layers. The network utilized both reward-modulated and non-rewardulated STDP and multiple mechanisms for homeostatic regulation of efficacy, including heterosynaptic plasticity, gain control, output normalization of STDP, and limits on synaptic strength. We found that addition of a layer of neurons employing nonrewarded ST created that responded to specific combinations of inputs and performed basic classification of patterns. When combined with a layer implementing ST, the network was able to learn discrimination between rewarding and punishing patterns despite absence of labeled data. Synaptic noise allowed trial-and-error learning that identified goal-oriented strategies effective in solving task.
ELF5 drives metastasis in luminal breast cancer through recruitment of Gr1+CD11+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells.
Chromatin loops play a crucial role in determining the level of cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. The interaction between chromatin loops can be characterized by three factors: connection pattern, distance between regulatory elements, and communication. We propose a model that maps three fundamental patterns of interacting DNA loops into a 4-state stochastic model of transcription. We show that side-by-side loops enhance expression and reduce noise, whereas alternating loops have opposite effects. We compare the effects of facilitated and direct looping on gene expression and find that the former performs better than the latter in controlling expression and reducing noise. However, this control is distance-dependent and remarkable for moderate loop lengths, there is a limit such that the difference between the two forms almost disappears.
Metabolic engineering is increasingly dependent on RNA technology to rewire the metabolism to maximize production. To this end, riboregulators allow dynamic repression of gene expression without the need of potentially burdensome coexpressed protein like Hfq small RNAs and clustered interspaced short palindrom repeats. Despite this advantage, no general principles are available to develop repress ribg, limiting the availability and development of these ribg. To overcome this lack of knowledge on repress ribg, translation inhibiting RNAs were developed from scratch. These ribg explore features related to thermodynam and structural factors attributed to translation modulation. A library of 12 structural and therm features were defined from which six were retained after correlations from in silico generated ribg. From this library, 18 ribg were selected using design and constructed coexpressed with two untranslated regions to link inhib RNA features to functionality. The ribg in design showed repression to% of original expression, which could be explained by ordinary squares model. To allow forward engineering, squares model was constructed and validated to link properties rib to repression. This model both structural and therm features important for efficient repression by rib.
Transient associations among neurons are thought to underlie memory and behavior. However, little is known about how such associations occur or how they can be identified. Here we recorded local field ( LFP ) activity at multiple sites within the cortex of awake monkeys and organotypic cultures of cortex. We show that when the activity of a neuronal group exceeds threshold, its pattern, reflected in LFP, occurs without distortion at other cortex via synaptic transmission. These large-amplitude LFPs, which we call coherence potentials, extend hundreds of milliseconds and mark periods of loss-less spread temporal information like action potentials single-cell.
Although the size of the nucleus is correlated with the size of the cell, the mechanism by which this correlation is achieved is not well understood. To identify the factors involved in this process, we performed a systematic screen of yeast deletion mutants. The screen identified 25 factors that are essential for nuclear size, and our analysis implicated RNA processing and LINC complexes in size control. This study has revealed both smaller and larger nuclear phenotypes and identified global processes and structural components important for size.
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor (ET). Presently, DB involves delivering a train of pulses with constant frequency via electrodes implanted in the brain. Closed-loop approaches deliver stimulation according to ongoing brain activity, potentially improving efficiency and reducing side effects. Success depends on devising a strategy that minimizes neural oscillations associated with motor symptoms. A step towards this is constructing a mathematical model describing how oscillations change when stimulation is applied. We use coupled oscillators to represent neurons generating pathological oscillations. A reduced Kuramoto model is used to analyse how patients respond to stimulation when oscillations have a given phase and amplitude, provided conditions are satisfied. For patients, the best strategy should be phase specific and stimulation should have greater effect when oscillation amplitude is lower. This is compared with data from ET patients. In light of this, we propose a new strategy combining phase-locked and adaptive DB.
Schistosomias is one of the most common parasitic diseases affecting over 230 million people worldwide. Schistoma mans is the main species causing intestinal and hepatic schosiasis and fresh water pulmon snails of the genus Biomalaria are best known for their role as intermediate hosts of the parasite. We developed a new molecular assay for large-scale screening of snails from transmission to detect the presence of schosomes. Our work focussed on developing and evaluating a LAMP assay with a simple DNA extraction to detect S mans in experimentally infected snails as diagnostic for field conditions. We designed a LAMP using a set of primers targeting S mans ribosomal intergenic 28S-18 rRNA. The limit of LAMP was 0. 1 of mans DNA at 63°C for 50 minutes. L was evaluated by S mans in B sn experimentally exposed at different times post-exposure: prepatent period before cercarial shedding, infections sn exposed a number of miria and detection sn in pooled samples within group uninfected sn. DNA LAMP was obtained using commercial kit or simple NaOH extraction. We detected mans in all sn using no complicated procedure for obtaining. Our assay, Biom-LAMP, is specific, rapid and potentially cost-effective for screening intermediate hosts with mans in snails and pooled samples. It is suitable for large-scale surveys schos campaigns in endemic areas.
Dengue has been reported as a public health problem in Sri Lanka since the 1960s and has become a priority for public health authorities. The Ministry of Health is responsible for controlling deng and other outbreaks and associated health care. Involvement of large numbers of health staff in deng control year-round and provision of free care to deng patients at secondary hospitals places a financial burden on the health sector. We estimated public costs of deng control and hospitalizations in Colombo, the most urban district in Sri Lanka, during epidemic 2012 from Ministry’s perspective. The costs borne by health agencies and hospitals collected using tools designed for study and retrospectively analysed using combination of activity and costing approaches. Total of deng control and hospitalizations estimated US$3.45 million (US.50 capita in Colombo 201. Personnel accounted largest of costs deng control (79% ) and hospitalizations (46% ). indicated capita of US0.42 deng control. Hospitalization ranged betweenUS–609 for pediatric andUS–866 adult according disease and treatment.
European Y-chromosome haplogroup R1b1b (R-M269) is the most common Y-chromosome lineage in Europe, carried by approximately 110 million men. Previous studies suggested a Paleolithic origin, but we show that the geographical distribution of microsatellite diversity is best explained by spread from a single source in the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic. This indicates that most European Y-chromosomes originate from the Neolithic expansion.
Motor learning is a complex process that can be influenced by a variety of factors. While it has been suggested that movement variability can increase the speed of motor learning, we use computational modeling to show that it can have both positive and negative effects on learning. Experimentally, we find that variability can also have decelerating effects on learning. However, through a meta-analysis of published papers, we find that across a wide range of experiments, movement has no statistical relation with learning rate.
RelA, a member of the NF-κ family, interacts with transcriptional co-activators CREB-binding protein ( CB ) and its paralog p300 to activate transcription. The Rel:CB/p300 complex is comprised of two components: the DNA-binding domain of Rel interacts with the KIX domain of CB/p300, and the transcription activation domain (TAD) of Rel binds to the TAZ domain of CB/p300. Phosphorylation of conserved Rel (Ser276) is required for the interaction to occur. The role of Rel:CB/p300 in Rel-activated transcription is unclear. Here, we provide the structure of the latter component of the Rel:CB complex by NMR spectroscopy. The structure reveals folding of Rel–TAD upon binding to TAZ through conserved hydrophobic sites on the TAZ surface. Mechanistic studies coupled with mutational and isothermal analyses allowed design of Rel-mutants that selectively abrogated the components of Rel:CB/p300. Detailed studies of Rel mutants using cell techniques, modeling, and genome-wide expression showed a set of Rel-activated genes is affected by this interaction. We show RelCB/p300 controls NF-κ response through negative loop of NF-κ pathway. Additionally, chromatin analyses Rel target promoters showed constitutive recruitment of CB300, indicating role of CB300 in recruitment Rel to sites.
Time-course Gene Set Analysis (TSA) is a novel method for analyzing gene expression data from longitudinal studies. It is an extension of gene set analysis, which has been applied to cross-sectional studies. The method is based on random effects modeling with maximum likelihood estimates and can use all available measurements while dealing with unbalanced data due to missing at random (MAR) measurements. It is a hypothesis-driven method that identifies a prior-defined gene sets with significant variations over time, taking into account heterogeneity within sets. When comparing biological conditions, it indicates if patterns of sets differ according to conditions. We illustrate the method with two real datasets: an HIV vaccine trial (DAL-1) and a study on influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. In the DAL-1 trial, TSA revealed significant change in expression over 69 gene sets during vaccination, while univariate gene analysis and Gene Set Enrich Analysis (GSEA) failed to detect any pattern over time. When applied to the second dataset, TSA identified 4 sets linked to influenza, although associated with pneumoccal in previous analyses. Our study exhibits TSA good statistical properties and increased power compared to other methods for analyzing time-course gene sets. The method is available through an R package.
Malaria caused by the parasite Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) is less well understood than P. falciparum and represents a barrier to control and elimination strategies. We present the first global map of P. viv endemicity. We updated the geographical limits of P. viv transmission to 2010 and used 9,970 geopositioned P. viv parasite rate (PvPR) surveys (1985–2010) with a spatiemporal Bayesian geostatistical model to estimate endemic age-standardised P. viv rate (Pv1–99) within 5×5 km grid squares. We incorporated Duffy phenotype to suppress endemic predictions, particularly in Africa. P viv was predicted within a narrow range throughout the world, rarely exceeding 7% P1–99. The Americas contributed 22% of global P viv risk, but high areas were sparsely populated and contributed 6% of 2.5 billion people at risk (PAR). Africa was constrained to Madagascar and parts of Horn, contributing 3.5% global PAR. Asia was home to 82% PAR with high areas coinciding dense populations India and Myanmar. South Asia contained highest endemic Indonesia and Papua New Guinea contributed 9% PAR.
Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogenic bacterium that causes skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and expresses a number of cell wall-anchored proteins that mediate adhesion and invasion of host cells and tissues, contributing to its virulence. The cell-anchored protein clumping factor B ( Clf ) has been shown to facilitate S. aureus nasal colonization through high affinity interactions with the cornified envelope in the nares. However, the role of Clf during SIs has not been investigated. This study reveals a novel role for Clf during SIs. Clf is crucial in determining abscess structure and bacterial burden in early infection and is dependent on interaction with loricin, a ligand expressed in abs tissue. Clf is a promising target for future SST vaccines.
To achieve the UNAIDS 90-90 goal, the number of new HIV infections needs to decrease to approximately 500, 000 by 202. One of the five pillars to achieve this goal is pre-exposure prophylaxis ( Pr ). Currently, Truv ( emicitabine-tenofovir ) is the only approved medication for Pr, but it is costly and requires a once-daily regimen. To improve Pr, next-generation regimens, including long-acting formulations are investigated. However, preclinical testing may not guide candidate selection since it fails to translate into clinical efficacy. We developed an efficient stochastic approach to predict prophylactic efficacy as an example with dolutegravir ( DT ). Combining population pharmacokinetics of DT with the framework, we predicted plasma concentrations of 145.18 and 722.23M prevent 50 and 90% sexual transmissions respectively. We predicted reduction in infection when DT was used in Pr, Pr ‘on’ and post-exposure prophylaxis ( P ) before/after exposure. Once Pr with 50 oral DT prevented 99–100% and 85% when 50% dosing were missed. ‘on’ Pr prevented 79–84 and P >80 when initiated 6 after virus and continued as possible.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces autophagy to enhance its replication. However, how HCV regulates the autophagic pathway remains unclear. In this report, we demonstrated that HCV could induce the expression of Rubicon and UVR, which inhibited and stimulated the maturation of autophagosomes, respectively. The induction of Rub by HCV was prompt, whereas induction of UVR was delayed, resulting in accumulation of autagosomes at early points of viral infection. The role of Rub in inhibiting maturation of autag in H-infected cells was confirmed by siRNA knockdown and overexpression of Rub, which enhanced and suppressed maturation of autag, respectively. Rub played positive role in H replication as suppression of its reduced H and overexpression enhanced H. In contrast, overexpression of UAG facilitated maturation of autag and suppressed H. H subgenomic RNA replicon, expressed only nonstructural proteins, also induced expression of Rub and accumulation autag. Further analysis indicated H NSB protein sufficient to induce Rub and autag. Our results indicated H, by differentially inducing Rub and UVR, temporally regulated autagic to enhance replication.
Cyclin-like 1 (Cny1) is a newly identified member of the cyclin family that is highly similar in sequence to Cyclin Y (ny. We found that Cny1 was most abundantly expressed in the testis of mice and was about seven times higher than the level ofny. Cny1-/- mice were infertile, whereas male and femaleny/- mice displayed normal fertility. These results suggest thatny1, notny, is indispensable for fertility. Spermatzo obtained fromny/- mice displayed impaired motility and a thinned annulus and/or head. We found the protein, not mRNA level of cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CD16) was in the test ofny/- mice. Further demonstrated thatny interacted with CD16 and this increased the stability of two. Moreover, increased the activity of CD16. In addition, observed alteration of CD16 in the presence ofny. We identified phosphorylation of CD by mass spectrometry and that several modifications on the-terminal of CD were indispensable forny binding and modulation CD16 activity.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHE) causes diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome resulting from toxin-mediated microvascular endothelial injury. HE hemolysin (HE-H), a member of the RTX repeats-toxin family, is an HE virulence factor of increasing importance. The toxin exists as HE-H and HE associated with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released by HE during growth. We demonstrate that OM-associated HE-H does not lyse target cells but triggers apoptosis in human microvascular endothelial (HBMEC) and intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells. OM-associated HE is internalized via dynamin endocytosis and trafficked into endo-lysosomal compartments. Upon acidification and pH drop, HE is separated from OM and escapes lysosomes via pore-forming activity and targets mitochondria. This results in mitochondrial transmembrane potential decrease and cytochrome translocation to cytos, indicating HE-mediated permeabilization of membranes. Subsequent caspase and casp activation leads to apoptotic death evidenced by DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation in intoxicated cells.
Transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPI ) is accompanied by conserved patterns of histone modifications. Histone modifications have established roles in transcription initiation, but their functions during elongation are not well understood. Histone H2 ( H2ub ) mono-ubiquitylation plays a role in coordinating co-transcription histone modification by promoting histone H3 methylation and regulates gene expression through an unidentified methylation-independent mechanism. Here, we reveal bidirectional communication between H2ub and Cdk, the ortholog of metazoan transcription elongation factor ( PTEb, in fission yeast Schizoscharomyces pombe. Chemical and genetic analyses indicate lowering Cdk activity or preventing phosphorylation of its substrate, transcription factor Spt, reduces H2ub in vivo. Conversely, mutations in H2ub impair Cdk recruitment to chromatin and Spt phosphorylation. Moreover, Spt phosphorylation-site combined with deletion histone H3 Lys methyltransferase Set phenocopies morph and growth due Hub loss. Surprisingly, mutation histone H2 ubiqu-acceptor relaxes Cdk activity in vivo anddk mutations suppress cell defects Hub-deficient. Genome analyses chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrate opposing Cdk and Hub on transcribing RNAPI.
Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in South America. To understand the evolutionary history of this emerging pathogen, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the largest YF data set compiled to date, representing the prM gene region from 133 isolates sampled from 22 countries over 76 years. We estimate that currently circulating YV strains arose in Africa within the last 1, 500 years and emerged in Americas following slave trade approximately 300–400 years ago. These viruses then spread westwards across continent and persist to this day in jungles South America.
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading bacterial pathogen that causes disease in humans. We studied a virulent isolate of this pathogen in an infant mouse model of colonization and disease transmission, with and without influenza A virus (IAV) co-infection. This model was used to identify bottlenecks in pneumocococcal pathogenesis. We found that in the setting of IAV co-infection, the pathogen must pass through single bottlenecks during invasion from the nasopharynx into the host and between hosts. Passage through these bottlenecks was not associated with genetic adaptation of the pathogen. The bottleneck occurred between exit from one host and establishment in another, explaining why number of organisms in secretions is critical to overcome.
Leishmania donovani is the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis in Eastern Africa and is transmitted by the sand fly Phlebotus orientalis. During feeding, the female sand fly salivates into the skin of the host and the saliva contains a variety of proteins that elicit specific antibody responses in the host. To evaluate exposure to sand fly bites in human populations from endemic areas, we tested sera from volunteers against recombinant P. orient salivary antigens. Recombinant proteins from P orient secreted salivary proteins were produced using either bacterial or mammalian expression systems and tested as antigens for detection of anti. orient Ig in human sera. Using these recombin proteins, sera from Sudan and Ethiopia were screened by ELISA and immunoblot to identify markers of exposure to orient bites. Two recominant proteins m5 and mY1 were identified as promising antigens showing high correlation and specificity to whole fly saliv gland homogen. Combination of proteins increased correlation as well as positive and negative values of orient exposure. This is the first report of screening sera for anti orient antibodies using recominant saliv proteins. Recombinant saliv proteins mY1 and m5 proved valid for screening sera from Sudan and Ethiopia for orient bites.
Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI) is a mobile genetic element that is frequently associated with multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae. It is mobilized by IncA and Inc plasmids (A/C plasmids) following its excision from the chromosome, an event triggered by the transcriptional activator ACD encoded by these plasmids. Although SGI is not self-transmissible, it carries genes tra,NS, traHS and tra, coding for distant homologs of the mating pore subunits TraNC,HC and TraGC encoded by A plasm. We investigated the regulation of tra and tra and the role of these genes in transibility of SGI. Expression of tra and tra is inducible by ACD. Mating experiments using combinations of mutants SGI and helperC plid pCR revealed interactions between these mobile elements. tra and tra are essential for plasm transfer, whereas SGI could rescue mutants of each gene, revealing thatNS,HS and are functional. Complementation of tra and mutants showed thatNSHS replaceNC/GC in the pore encoded by plasm and thatHS are required for optimal SGI transfer. Remodeling of the pore by SGI was found to be essential to enhance transfer of S over helper. Furthermore was found to be crucial to allow transfer between cells bearing helper plasmids, suggesting that S disables an entry mechanism. Hence facilitate invasion of by S of populations bearing plasm.
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo-like kinase Cdc5 promotes adaptation to DNA damage in addition to its roles in mitotic progression. We report that CDC5 is required for adaptation and its overexpression promotes adaptation, indicating that high levels of Cdc modulate the ability of the checkpoint to inhibit the cell cycle. To pinpoint the step in the pathway at which Cdc acts, we overexpressed CDC from the GAL promoter in damaged cells and examined key steps in checkpoint individually.dc overproduction had little effect on early steps to Rad activation. The sensors,dc ( member of the 9-1 complex ) anddc ( member thedc/Mec complex ) properly localized to damage.dc appeared active since Rad retained its phosphorylation, and the damage-induced interaction between phosphorylated and Rad remained. In contrast, Rad hyperphosphorylation was reduced, consistent with loss of cell arrest during adaptation. We conclude C acts to attenuate the damage through loss of Rad hyperosphorylation to allow cells to DNA.
Many neurological conditions, such as seizures and stroke, are associated with changes in ion concentrations in the extracellular space ( ECS ) of the brain. To understand the mechanisms that govern ECS dynamics, it is necessary to keep track of both ion and electric potential in the brain. This is currently unfeasible experimentally, but can be achieved with computational models based on biophysical principles. Previous models have been limited to small spatiotemporal scales ( micrometers and milliseconds ) or simplified 1-D transport on larger scales. We present the 3-D KirchhoffernstPlan ( K ) framework to explore electrodiff effects on large spatiemporal scales. By assuming electroneutrality, K circumvents charge-relax processes on spatiemp scales nanometers and makes simulations feasible on spatiemp scales millimeters on a standard computer. We use the 3-D K framework to simulate ion and electrical surrounding a morphologically pyramidal cell. In addition to elucidating electro effects in ECS, the simulation demonstrates the 3-D framework.
The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) proposal to cut funding for mosquito-borne disease surveillance has the potential to leave the country ill-prepared to handle emerging and existing diseases. We evaluated the impact of delayed responses to deng epidemics in an urban environment. We used a mathematical model to generate scenarios of delayed responses to deng introduction in Cairns, Queensland, Australia, and coupled the results with surveillance and management costs to estimate cumulative costs. Our results show that halting surveillance can increase epidemic management costs by an order of magnitude compared to sustained surveillance and early detection. The total costs of preparedness through surveillance are lower than needed to respond to vector-borne pathogens, even considering human lives and well-being.
Dengue is an important cause of acute febrile illness in children and adults in Nicaragua. In Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, suspected deng has been documented but unsuspected deng among children and adults with undifferent fever has not. A prospective study was conducted in semiurban and rural Nicaragua to determine the cause of acute febrile illness. We enrolled 740 consecutive patients ≥1 years presenting with feile illness from Monday to Saturday. We tested sera for deng IgG and IgM and deng virus using reverse transcriptase PCR. We found 63. 5% were seropositive for deng at enrollment. The seroprevalence increased with age and reached 90% in people over 20. We identified deng serotypes 1 and 2 in 5.1% patients. Only 8.1% of cases were clinically suspected. Dengue is an important and largely unrecognized cause of fever in western Nicaragua. Since Zika is transmitted by the same vector and associated with severe congenital infections, the population is at risk for Zika.
Plant-parasitic nematodes are major agricultural pests that cause billions of dollars in losses annually. Effective plant defense against these pathogens relies on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized receptors, leading to the activation of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). While PT has been extensively studied in various plant-pathogen interactions, little is known about PT in roots and plant-nemat interactions. Here, we show that nematode-derived elicitors are capable of inducing PT in Arabidopsis in a manner dependent on the immune receptor BAK. Consistent with the role of BAK, we identified a leucine-rich receptor-like kinase, NIL1 that is regulated upon nemat infection. We show that NIL1 is essential for PT responses to nematodes and NIL1 loss-of-function mutants are hypersusceptible to broad nematodes. To our knowledge, NIL1 is the first immune receptor involved in induction of basal PT in plants or animals to nematodes.
Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic flatworm that causes schistosomiasis, a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. Milteine is an anti-cancer drug that has been repositioned for treatment of Leishmaniasis and has shown promising effects against Schos spp. This study examined the effect of treating Schos mansoni adult worms with miline on exposure of worm surface antigens in vitro. In an indirect immunofluorescence assay, anti-S mansoni adult homate and anti-S mans infection antisera gave strong immunofluorescence of S mans adult surface after miline treatment. The latter antiserum had previously been shown to synergistically enhance schosidal activity of prazantel. Antibodies that recognised surface antigens on miline-treated worms were recovered by elution in low pH buffer and used in immunoblot to identify antigenic targets in homate of adult worms. Four antigens reacting in immunob were purified and proteic analysis ( MS ) combined with immunob indicated they were S proteins: fructose-1 6phosphate aldolase, Sm 6, alkaline phosphatase and malate dehydrogen. These antibodies also bound to surface schosula and induced agglutination, suggesting a role in immune protection.
Bacillus cereus is a human opportunistic pathogen that has evolved multiple systems to acquire iron from various sources in order to overcome its low solubility and bioavailability. While iron acquisition from heme and hemoglobin has been extensively studied, little is known about iron acquisition from ferritin, a 24-mer protein able to store thousands of iron atoms within its cavity. Here we demonstrate that IlsA, a surface protein of Bacillus cereus, acts as a ferritin receptor causing ferritin aggregation on the bacterial surface. Isothermal titration calorimetry data indicate Ils binds several types of ferritins through interaction with subunits. UV-vis data show significant enhancement of iron release from ferritin in the presence of Ils. We propose a new model of iron acquisition in Bacillus that involves binding of Ils to ferritin followed by siderophore assisted uptake. Disruption of siderophore bacibactin production drastically reduces ability of Bacillus to utilize ferritin for growth and results in attenuated virulence in insects.
The circadian clock in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis elongatus is driven by a phosphorylation cycle of three proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. KaiC forms a homohexamer with two domains, CI and CII. CI and CII can bind and hydrolyze ATP, but only CII can be phosphorylated at two residues in a well-defined sequence. We present a thermodynamically consistent statistical-mech model of the clock. The model is based on two ideas: i ) ATP hydrolysis in CI provides thermodynamic force for clock switching Kai between active and inactive conformation; ii ) phosphorylation in CII provides timer for hydrolysis in CI. The model explains how KaiA stimulates phosphorylation of KaiC by acting as nucleotide factor and how differential affinity of Kai for different KaiC phosphforms generates temporal order of phosphorylation. As phosphorylation in CII rises, release of AD from CI slows, making inactive conformation of Kai stable. Inactive Kai binds KaiB, stabilizing state and sequestrating Kai, leading to dephosphorylation.
Hepatitis B virus (HB) suppresses innate immunity to establish persistent infection. Although HB is a DNA virus, its pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) can be sensed by RIG and activates MAV to mediate interferon (IF) synthesis. Despite activation of R-MA axis by pgRNA, the mechanism explaining HB fails to induce interferonα (IF) synthesis remained uncharacterized. We demonstrate that HB induces parkin to recruit linear ubiquitin assembly (UB) complex to mitochondria and attenuate IF synthesis. Parkin interacts with MAV, accumulates unanchored polyubiquitin on MAV via UB to disrupt MAV signal and attenuate IR activation.
Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that affects the gastrointestinal tract and is associated with an abnormal immune response to enteric bacteria. A superantigens are bacterial proteins that stimulate T-cells and are associated with Crohn’s disease. Here, we report the structure of pfi, a superantigen from Pseudomonas fluorescens at 1.7Å resolution and its interaction with human class II MHC. Both pfi and its homolog PA5 bind to mammalian cells and stimulate proliferation of human lymphocytes. Binding was inhibited by anti-class II M HLA-DR antibodies and to a lesser extent by HLA-D and DP, indicating class II MHC specificity. pfi efficiently precipitated both endogenous and purified recombinant HLA-DR, indicating direct interaction with HLA-DR. Competition studies revealed pfi and superigen Mycoplas arthritidis mit ( M ) competed for HLA, indicating overlapping binding sites. Structural analysis established pfi belongs to Tet-family DNA-binding regulators. The pfi structure indicates a new family of T superigens.
Nanog is a key regulator of pluripotency in embryonic stem (ES) cells and exhibits a disperse distribution in vivo and in vitro. The role of Nanog heterogeneity in stem cell fate decisions is supported by increasing evidence. Recently, allelic control of the Nanog gene was reported in mouse ES cells. We developed a multiscale stochastic population equation framework to understand how this mode of regulation influences observed heterogeneity of Nan in stem populations. In addition to allelic control, we considered gene expression noise and partition at cell division. As a result of allelic Nan expression, Nanog exhibited three states. When combined with transcription noise, the profile became bimodal. Regardless of allelic pattern, uniform ES populations gave rise to same Nan heterogeneity within ten cycles. Depletion of Nanog in cells was slower than accumulation of intracellular Nan after at least one allele on. This points to Nan state-dependent dynamics. Allelic of Nan also raises issues in ES with reporter genes knocked in single locus. Significant divergence was observed in reporter and native profiles depending on half-lives insertion in one or both alleles. In populations with restricted Nan, allelic facilitates maintenance of self-renew cells with sufficient Nan to prevent aberrant pluripotency. Our findings underline role of allelic Nan as determinant of stem population heterogeneity and warrant further in specification and reprogramming.
The cost of protein expression is balanced by evolution through the expression of unused proteins that have no benefits in the current environment. However, expression of unused proteins incurs a quantifiable costs on cellular growth rates. The magnitude and variability of unused protein expression in natural settings is largely unknown due to the challenge in determining environment-specific proteome. We address this challenge using absolute proteomics and a genome-scale model of Escherich coli that computes environment-specific cost and utility of proteome on a gene basis. We show that nearly half proteome is unused in certain environments and accounting for cost of this protein explains >95% of variance in growth of Escheria coli across 16 environments. Furthermore, reduction in protein is shown to be common mechanism to increase growth in adaptive experiments.
Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci that harbor genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), many of which encode proteins not previously suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of T2. Most GWAS for T2 have focused on populations of European descent, and GW conducted in populations with different ancestry offer a unique opportunity to study the genetic architecture of T2. We performed genome-wide association scans for T2 in 3,955 Chinese (2,010, cases,1,945 ), 2,034 Malays (794,1,240 ) and 2,146 Indians (977,1,169 ). In addition to searching for novel variants in T2, these multi-ethnic cohorts assess the transferability and relevance of previous findings from European populations in the three ethnic of Asia, comprising half the world’s population. Of SNPs associated T2 in previous GW, only CDAL and HXIDE/KIF showed strongest association T2 in meta-analysis including all ethnic. However, consistent effect was observed many other SN in study and carried out European. Examination associations at CDAL and HXIDE/K loci provided evidence locus and allelic heterogeneity relation T2. We also detected variation disequilibrium between populations most loci previously identified. These factors, with limited power may contribute failure detect associations populations diverse.
In Cryptococcus neoformans is a basidiomycous yeast that undergoes nuclear division in the daughter cell. During mitosis, kinetochores cluster and the nucleus move to the bud. We show that the evolutionarily conserved Aurora kinase I1 (I1) localizes to the nucleus upon nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis in C. neoans. I1 is required for timely nuclear envelope breakdown and is essential for microtubule stability. Microtub stability is compromised upon I1 depletion, delaying kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration. We propose that cytoplasmic microtules and cortical dyneins promote nuclear division in C. neoans by generating an in silico model of mitosis. We improve the model by introducing additional parameters and predict that cortical generated by cytoplasmic dyin and dyin regulate kinet clustering and nuclear migration. In vivo alterations of dyin or dyin delay nuclear migration. In silico and live imaging suggest I1 spatio-temporally influences dyin and dyin with microtub to ensure timely division.
Synonymous mutations are a type of genetic change in the DNA sequence of a gene that do not alter the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded protein. They are often considered to be “silent” because they do not change the amino acid sequence of the protein. However, they can affect the expression of the gene. In this study, we investigated the role of a synonymous mutation in the RET gene in medullary thyroid carcinoma ( MTC ). RET is a gene that encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the development of MTC. In this study, we found that a synonymous mutation in the RET gene increased the expression of the protein. We found that the mutation created a new splicing enhancer motif that increased the recruitment of splicing factors to the mutant allele, leading to more efficient maturation of the pre-mRNA and increased abundance of mature mRNA encoding a constitutively active receptor. This is a novel mechanism by which synonymous mutations can contribute to cancer.
Metagenomic sequencing is a powerful tool for diagnosing human infections by capturing all DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a sample. Accurate characterization and identification of pathogens depends on the availability and quality of genomes for comparison. Thousands of genomes are available, and growing, increasing the power of metagen sequencing for diagnosis. However, recent studies have exposed contamination in published genomes used for diagnosis, increasing the risk of wrong pathogen identification. To address this, we developed a bioinformatics system to eliminate contamination and low-complexity genomic sequences in draft eukaryotic pathogen genomes. We applied this software to remove human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences in a comprehensive database of sequenced eukotic pathogen genomes. We also removed low-complex genomic sequences, another source of false positives. Using this pipeline, we produced a “clean” eukotic pathogen database for bioinformatics analysis. We demonstrate that when finding eukotic pathogens in metagen samples, this database provides better sensitivity than original genomes while reducing false positives.
Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), a major public health problem in Uganda. While the disease is declining on the continent, it remains a major problem in Uganda. We investigated the genetic diversity of T. brucei in Uganda and its implications for the epidemiology of sleeping sickness. We genotyped 269 T. brucei isolates from different regions in Uganda and southwestern Kenya at 17 microsatellite loci and checked for the presence of the SRA gene that confers human infectivity to T. rhodesense. We used Bayesian methods and Discriminant Analysis of Components to partition T brucei isolates into three genetic clusters. Cluster 1 and 3 include isolates from central and southern Uganda, while cluster 2 contains mostly isolates from southwestern Kenya. These clusters are not sorted by subspecies ( T. bruce vs. T. rhense ) or date of collection. Our analyses show genetic admixture among clusters and long-range dispersal, suggesting recent gene flow between them. We show the expansion of disease to new foci in central Uganda occurred from northward spread of T. rhense and emergence of human infect strains from non-infect T. br strains of different backgrounds. Our results confirm the importance of cattle as reservoir and shape the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region.
Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXIP) is a multifunctional protein involved in tumor suppression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. However, its role in the inflammatory process remains unclear. Here, we show that TXIP−/− mice are significantly more susceptible to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock. In response to LPS, TX−−/− macrophages produce significantly higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and iNOS inhibitor rescues TX−−− mice from endotoxic-induced death, demonstrating NO is a major factor in TXIP-mediated endotoxic shock. This susceptibility of TX−−− mice occurs despite reduced IL-1β secretion due to increased S-nitrosylation of NLRP3 compared to wild-type controls.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, we have identified ZTF-8 as a novel protein involved in the repair of both mitotic and meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) as well as in meiotic DNA damage response. ZTF-8 mutants exhibit sensitivity to γ-radiation and hydroxyurea, mitotic arrest at S-phase accompanied by activation of the ATL-1 and CHK-1 DNA checkpoint kinases, as well as accumulation of mitotic and meiotic recombination intermediates. This indicates that ZTF-8 functions in DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR). However, impaired meiotic DS progression fails to trigger the CEP-1/p53-dependent damage checkpoint in pachene, supporting a role for ZTF-8 in meiotic DNA damage response. Z-8 partially co-localizes with the 9-1 complex and interacts with M-2/R1, a component of this complex. Human RH rescues the phenotypes in z-8 mutants, suggesting conservation across species. We propose that Z-8 is involved in promoting repair of stalled replication forks and meiotic DS by transducing damage signaling via the 9-1 pathway. Our findings define a conserved function for 8/RHINO in genomic stability in the germl.
During the development of the neural tube, neural progenitors differentiate into motor neurons (MN) at a faster rate than other progenitors. We used single cell transcriptomics to define the transcriptional changes associated with the transition of neural progenitors into MNs. We found that the transcription factor Olig is pivotal just before MN differentiation. Olig represses the Notch signaling effectors Hes1 and H5. Olig repression of H5 appears to be direct, via a conserved element within the H5 locus that restricts expression from MN progenitors.
Influenza viruses are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The role of T cells in protecting humans against influenza remains unclear. Here, we show that cross-reactive T cells play an important role in early clearance of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (H1Npdm ) in nonhuman primates. We first infected rhesus macaques with a seasonal HN1 isolate. These animals developed cellular and antibody responses against H1 but no neutralizing antibodies against H1p. Four months later, we challenged the “primed” animals and naive controls with H1p. In naive animals, CD8 T cells appeared in blood and lung 5–7 days post inoculation ( p. i. ) with H1p and peaked 7–10 days. In contrast, T cells were recruited lung as early as 2 p. i. in “prim” animals and peaked blood and lung 4–7 p. Interferon (IF )γ Elisp and intracellular cytokine staining showed virus-specific response peaked and reached higher in “prim” than naive animals. This involved CD and CD T cells. Strikingly, “prim” cleared H1p from upper and lower respiratory tract before appearance H1p-neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest cross-react T can mediate clearance antigenically novel influenza in primates. Vaccines capable of inducing cross-react T may protect humans against severe caused by emerging influenza viruses.
Q fever is the most common zoonotic disease and domestic animals are the most common source of transmission. It is difficult to distinguish from other febrile diseases because of lack of specific manifestations in humans and difficult to identify in disease-carrying animals because of lack of identifiable features. Conventional serodiagnosis requires sera from acute and convalescent stages of infection, which are unavailable at early diagnosis. In this study, we developed Loop-Med Isothermal Amplification ( LAMP ) assay to identify C burnii rapidly and sensitively. A universal LAMP set was designed to detect the repeated IS1 of the htp gene of burnii using Primer V software. The sensitivity of LAMP was evaluated using known quantities of reference plasmids containing targeted. The specificity of developed LAMP was determined using 26 members of Ricketiae and 18 common pathogens. The utility of LAMP was compared with real PCR by examination of 24 samples including 6 confirmed and probable fever cases diagnosed by IFA and PCR. In addition,126 samples from 4 including 97, 7, 18, 3, and 1 were compared by these methods. The detection of LAMP for h gene was copy. The specificity of LAMP was 100% and no cross-reaction was observed among bacteria in study. The rate of febr patients was 33. 3% for LAMP and 8.3 for real PCR. The rate of animals was 7.9 for LAMP and 0. for real
Embryonic Stem (ES)-Specific Enhancers Specify the Expression of ES Genes in Cancer  
Embryonic stem (ES)-specific enhancers (ESs) are a class of regulatory elements that control the expression of genes in hematopoietic cells. We found that ESs are prone to DNA methylation, indicative of their chromatin activity. Strikingly, ES methylation is associated with transcriptional activity in cancer. Methylated ESs are hypermethylated in cancer relative to normal cells and co-local with silenced genes, whereas unmethyl ES tend to be hypomethyl in cancer and associated with reactivated genes. Constitutive hematopoietic stem-specific enhancers do not show these trends, suggesting selective reactivation of ESs in cancer. Further analyses of hypomethyl ES downstream the VFA gene revealed a regulatory circuit affecting VFA transcript levels across cancers and patients.
The role of population subdivision in crossing fitness valleys and plateaus in a rugged fitness landscape is investigated in this study. The effect of subdivision on the time it takes to cross a fitness valley or plateau is quantitatively investigated. A generic and minimal model is used that includes subdivision of a population into demes connected by global migration, and does not require significant changes in deme size, environmental heterogeneity or geographic structure. The optimal speedup of valley crossing that can be gained by subdivision is determined, if the process is driven by the dem that crosses fastest. We show that demes have to be in the sequential regime for subdivision to significantly accelerate crossing. Using Markov chain theory, we obtain expressions for the conditions under which optimal speed is achieved: valley crossing by the subdivided population is as fast as its fastest dem. Our predictions are verified through stochastic simulations. We demonstrate that subdivision can accelerate crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus in a wide range of parameters. The effect of subdivision degree of population is studied, and the trade-off between magnitude of speedup and width of range it occurs. Our results for fitness and plateaus also hold for weak beneficial mutations. Finally, we extend to the case of population connected by migration to several islands. Our results demonstrate subdivision with migration can accelerate fitness and plateaus, and conditions necessary for this occur.
Arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever are transmitted to humans by the mosquito Aedes aegypt. These viruses replicate and disseminate from the midgut, the primary site of infection and transmission. The metabolic environment within the midut plays a crucial role in these processes. Since these viruses are enveloped, replication and assembly occur on cellular membranes through manipulation of host metabolism. Interfering with the virus-induced metabolic environment is detrimental to replication in human and mosquito cell models. Here, we present the first insight into the metabolic environment during arboirus replication in Aedes aegypt. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we analyzed the metabolic perturbations following deng virus infection of the midut. This is the primary site of infection and replication, preceding systemic dissemination and transmission. We identified metabolites that exhibited a dynamic profile across early, mid- and late-infection points. We observed a marked increase in lipid content. An increase in glycerospholipids, sphingolip and fatty acids was coincident with viral replication. Elevation glycerolip levels suggested diversion of resources from energy to synthetic pathways. Elevated acylcarnines were observed, signaling disruptions in mitochondrial function and diversion of energy. A central in the sphingip pathway that influenced dihydroamide to ceramide ratios was critical for the virus cycle. This study resulted in the reconstruction of the sphip pathway in Aedesegypt.
Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Elucidating the mechanisms of arrhythmias requires integration of electrophysiological experiments, models, and theory. Existing models of the transmembrane action potential ( AP ) are complex, resulting in overparameterization and varied leading to dissimilar predictions. Thus, simpler models are needed to elucidate the “minimal requirements” to reproduce significant phenomena using few parameters as possible. Here, we develop a parsimonious rabbit AP model that is mathematically identifiable, combining a Hodgkin-Hux formulation of INa with a phenomenological model of repolarization similar to IK. The model was calibrated using experimental data from rabbit under physiological conditions: I-V relationships during the APstroke; recovery of excitability during the refractory period; and steady IN in voltage clamp. Simulations reproduced important phenomena including alternans rates >250 bpm, reentrant waves, and spiral breakup.
During the sexual cycle of the ciliate Parameum, the assembly of the somatic genome involves the precise excision of tens of thousands of short, non-coding germl sequences ( Internal Eliminated Sequences or IES ), each flanked by TA dinucleotides. These genome rearrangements are initiated by developmentally programmed DNA-strand breaks ( DSBs ), which depend on domesticated transposase PigMac. The DSBs exhibit a characteristic geometry with 4-base 5′ overhangs centered on conserved TA and may align and undergo ligation with minimal processing. However, the molecular steps involved in the final assembly of somatic genes remained unknown. We demonstrate that Ligase IV and Xrccp, components of non-homous endjoining (HE ) are required for repair of I excision sites and circularization of excised IES. Transcription of LIG and XR4 is induced during sexual cycle and Ligp-GFP accumulates in developing somatic nucleus by I excision takes place. RNA–mediated silencing either results in persistence of free ends apparently against resection.
Chagas disease is the most common cause of death in patients with heart failure. However, this information comes from a period before the introduction of drugs that changed the natural history of heart failure. We sought to study the mode of death in patients with heart failure caused by Chagas disease comparing with non-Ch cardiomyopathy. We examined the REMHE trial and grouped patients according to etiology ( Chagas vs nonagas ) and mode of death. The primary end-point was all-cause, heart and failure and sudden mortality; 342 patients were analyzed and 185 ( 54.1 ) died. Death occurred in 56.4 Chagas patients and 53.7 nonagas. The cumulative of allcause mortality and heart failure was higher in Chagas compared to nonagas. There was no difference in the cumulative of sudden mortality between the two. In the Cox model Ch etiology ( HR 2.76; CI 1.34–.69; p=0.006 ) LVED ( 1.07 CI1.04.10; p0.001 ) creatinine (.98 CI.97.99;=0.006 ) and amiodone (3.05 CI1.47.34;=0.003 ) were associated with failure.VED (1 CI1.01.07;=0.005 ) and beta-blocker (0.52 CI.34.94=.014 ) were associated sudden. In Chagas disease, failure is the most mode of death.
Plant cells have evolved complex defense mechanisms to counteract viral infections. Here, we show that the N1-interacting kinase (NIK) pathway is involved in plant defense against geminiviruses. However, the mechanism by which N1 activates antiviral response is unclear. We identified rp10, a ribosomal protein, as a specific substrate of N1 that acts downstream of N1 response. Phosphorylation of cytoplasmic rp10 by N redirects it to the nucleus where it may modulate viral infection. N1 or hyperactive mutant promotes accumulation of phosphorylated rp10 within nuclei, while inactive N fails to redirect to nuclei of co-transfected cells. Likewise, rp10 defective for N phosphorylation is not redirected to nucleus. Loss of rp10 enhances susceptibility to gemivirus, similar to nik null alleles. We also show gemivirus directly interferes with N1-mediated localization of rp10 as countermeasure. However, N1 defense neither activates silencing nor hypersensitive but inhibits plant growth.
Paracoccocidioides brasiliensis is a human pathogenic fungus that survives inside the host by adapting to different conditions, including oxidative stress imposed by the immune cells. In this study, we evaluated the role of alternative oxidase (AOX), an enzyme involved in intracellular redox balancing, during host-P brasiliensis interaction. We generated a mitotically stable P brasiliensis AOX (PbAOX) antisense RNA (RNA) strain with 70% reduction in expression. We evaluated PbX during conidia and yeast interaction with IF-γ activated macrophages in a mouse model of infection. Additionally, we determined fungal viability and PbX in presence of H2. Interaction with IF-γ macrophages induced higher PbX expression in conidia than yeast. PbXRNA conidia and yeast had decreased viability after macroph interaction. Moreover, in mouse infection model, we showed absence of wild-type PbX in brasili resulted in reduced fungal burden at weeks 8 and 24 post-challenge and increased survival. In presence H2, we observed Pb yeast increased PbX and presented higher viability with PbRNA cells. These data support that PbX is important in defense against oxidative stress by cells and relevant in virulence brasili.
Place cell remapping by CA3 recurrent attractors is thought to support episodic memory. Episodic memory is thought to be supported by attractor dynamics in the hippocampus. A possible neural substrate for this mechanism is remapping, which the spatial map of cells encodes contextual information through firing variability. To test whether memories are stored as multimodal attractors in populations of cells, experiments morphed one context into another while observing the responses of CA cell ensembles. Average activity in CA was reported to transition gradually rather than abruptly from one context to the next, suggesting lack of attractors associated with the representations. On the other hand, cells showed a mix of gradual and abrupt transitions different along the sequence and displayed hysteresis which is signature attractor. To understand these conflicting results commens with attractor theory we developed a network of CA with attract for both position and contexts. We found memories in overlapping ensembles within a single map position-dependent attract transitions at different along the sequence. Smooth curves arose from averaging the while heterogeneous was observed on the unit. In contrast, led abrupt and on both and unit as observed when remapping two independent maps. Strong feedback a hysteretic on the which diminished the amount in the. These suggest context-dependent can be by overlapping within a map CA cells.
Entamoeba histoly, a microaerobic enteric protozoan parasite, causes ameb colitis and intestinal abscesses in millions of inhabitants of endemic areas. Troozo of E. histoly are exposed to a variety of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species during infection. Since. hist lacks key components of canonical eukotic anti-oxid defense, alternative strategies have been postulated to operate in. We investigated metabolic responses in E. hist to H2O2 and paraquat-mediated oxidative stress by measuring metabolites by capillary electrophoresis and time-of-flight spectrometry. Oxidative caused drastic modulation of metabolites in glycol, chitin biosynthesis and nucleotide amino metabolism. Oxid resulted in inhibition of glycol as result inactivation of several enzymes leading redirection of flux towards glycer production chitin bios and nonoxidative branch pentose pathway. Oxid resulted in repression of gly evidenced by accumulation of intermediates upstream pyru and reduced levels nucleotide triosph. We showed presence of gly biosynthetic in E as evidenced by production glyol 3-phosphate gly upon oxidative.
IKAR is a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell fate and its dynamic expression is required for proper hematopoiesis. IKAR collaborates with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase ( Nu ) complex to promote gene repression and activation. However, it remains unclear how IKAR can support activation while associated with the HD-containing Nu complex. IKAR also binds the positive transcription elongation factor ( PTEb ) at promoters. Here, we show that Nu and Pb are assembled in a complex that can be recruited by IKAR to specific genes. IKAR expression influences recruitment of the NuPb complex to gene regions and facilitates transcription by transferring phosphatase 1 (PPα), an IKAR-binding Pb activator, to CD9. We show that IKAR mutant unable to bind PPα cannot sustain expression and impedes normal differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors. Finally, knockdown of the Nu subunit reveals that occupancy of Nu at transcribed regions favors relief of II promoter proximal pausing and promotes transcription.
Rabies is an emerging public health problem in the Americas. The Caribbean island of Trinidad experiences periodic outbreaks in the livestock population. We performed molecular characterization of rabies virus (RV) and used a phylogeographic approach to investigate the extent to which outbreaks are result from in situ evolution versus importation of virus from the nearby South American mainland. Our results show that Trinidadian RV are bat variant and clustered with Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat) sequences. They fall into two temporally defined lineages: I and II. The I includes sequences from 1997–200 (all from northeast of the island ) and is most related to RV from Ecuador (2005,7), Frenchiana (1990) and Venezuela (3,4). II comprises sequences from southwest of the island which cluster into two: IIa and IIb. IIa includes one from 0 and 7 and IIb all 0. II are most related to Brazil (9,4) and Uruguay (7,8). Phyloge analyses support three RV introductions from mainland which each of Trinidadian lineages arose. Estimated introductions and subsequent expansions suggest in situ evolution within Trinidad following each introduction. These also indicate co-circulation IIa and II during 0. In light these findings and likely bat origin of Trinidadian RV, further studies should investigate RV spatiemporal dynamics and bat ecology, particularly between mainland and Trinidad.
The development of the mammalian cerebral cortex is characterized by the emergence of functionally distinct areas, each of which is dependent on the expression of specific genes along the anterior-posterior axis. The genes Fgf, Em2, Pax, Coupfi, and Sp8 play a strong role in specifying areal identity. However, the interactions between these genes that lead to their confinement to particular spatial patterns are currently not well understood. We used a computational model of interactions between these five genes to determine which interactions and combinations of interactions occur in networks that reproduce the anterior-posterior patterns observed experimentally. The model treats expression as Boolean, reflecting the qualitative nature of the data available. We simulated expression patterns by all networks containing the five genes of interest. Only networks were able to reproduce the experimentally observed patterns. These all lacked interactions and combinations including auto-regulation and inductive. Many higher combinations of interactions never appeared in networks that satisfied our criteria for performance. While there was diversity in the structure of networks that performed, analysis of each interaction gave indication of which are likely to be in the network regulating area. We found that repressive interactions are more than inductive, but mutually repressive are not for correct functioning. Our model illuminates the design of the network regulating area and makes predictions that can be tested.
Polycomb group (Pc) proteins play a crucial role in regulating gene expression during development by modifying chromatin structure. PRC1 and PRC2 proteins achieve this through histone modifications: PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 and PRC-mediated H2A ubiquity. B1 is a key component of P1 and has been shown to be critical for H2 ubiqulation. Here, we report the genome-wide localization of B1-dependent H2 in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells using ChIP-Seq. We find that H2 peaks at the transcription start site (TSS) of well-annotated genes, enriched at promoters with H3me3 and low-expressed genes in MEF. We also identify regions of H enrichment throughout the genome, almost 700 promoters. Genes with H peaks have lower expression than those without peaks. We show that genes with peaks have increased expression upon B1 knockout. Importantly, H is not limited to regions with H3me3. We find enrichment at high CpG promoters and suggest that methylation may be linked H at these regions.
Pregnancy-induced non-coding RNA (PINC) and retinoblast-associated protein 46 (Rap46) are upregulated in alveolar cells of the mammary gland during pregnancy and persist in alve cells that remain in the regressed following involution. We show that INC is enriched in luminal and alve progenitors in the post-pubal mammary gland. INC levels increase throughout pregnancy and decline in lactation when alve cells undergo terminal differentiation. INC is significantly decreased when mammary epithelial cells are induced to differentiate and produce milk. This reduction in INC levels may be necessary for lactation as overexpression of INC in HC11 cells blocks differentiation while knockdown of INC enhances. We demonstrate that INC interacts with RAp, as well as other members of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PC2), and identify targets of INC that are differentially expressed following modulation of INC levels. Our data suggest that INC inhibits terminal differentiation of alve cells during pregnancy to prevent milk production until parturition.
PML/TR19 is a member of the tripartite motif (TR) protein family and is mainly expressed in the nucleus, where it forms structures known as PML bodies that recruit proteins such as Sp100 and Dax. While P/TR19’s role in antiviral defense is well documented, its effect on HIV-1 infection is unclear. We show that HIV-1 and other retroviruses trigger PML cytoplasmic body formation as early as 30 minutes post-infection. P cytoplasmic bodies last approximately 8 hours with a peak at 2 hours post-infection. P localization is blocked by reverse transcription inhibitors and not observed following infection with unrelated viruses, suggesting it is triggered by retroiral reverse transcription. We show P interferes with early retroiral infection since P knockdown increases reverse transcription efficiency. P does not inhibit retroiral but acts through stabilization of Dax. In presence P cytoplasmic Dax is found near HIV-1 capsids and inhibits reverse transcription. Dax inhibits exogenous and endogenous retroviruses, identifying Dax as cellular reverse inhibitor.
Proteins are the building blocks of all living organisms and are composed of long chains of amino acids that fold into complex three-dimensional structures. These structures are crucial for their function. However, there is no consensus on how proteins should be aligned when they are similar but not identical. One approach is fragment chaining, where short parts of proteins are aligned optimally and then chained together. Recently, it has been suggested that flexibility may help model proteins better. We introduce Matt, a fragment chaining algorithm that allows small translations and rotations to bring fragments closer, even if impossible under rigid transformations. After dynamic programming, consistency is restored before output. We tested Matt against other programs on the Homstr and Smark datasets. Matt is competitive on Homstr but outperforms on Smark, a benchmark of proteins with distant homology. On both, Matt better aligns α-helices and β-strands, important for structural library construction. We considered whether Matt can distinguish homologous from non-homologous proteins. For this, a score based on core length and root mean squared deviation is shown to separate homologs from nonhomologs in Smark. We postulate Matt's performance comes from modeling conformation states and backbone distortions in distantly related proteins.
Cell entry into mitosis is triggered by the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) and inactivation of its counteracting phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)/B55. Greatwall, a kinase that inactivates PP2/B by phosphorylating its substrates Ensa and AR19. Both Great and En/AR19 are regulated by phosphorylation, but the regulation of Great activity and phosphatases that control Great kinase and its substrates are poorly understood. We used a combination of mathematical modelling and experiments and phospho-specific antibodies to monitor Great, En/AR and Cdk phosphorylation during mitotic entry and exit. We show that PP2/B is required for Great dephosphorylation at the Cdk site Thr194. En/AR deosphorylation is mediated by the RNA polymerase II C-terminal phosphatase F1. Surprisingly, inhibition or depletion of F1 or PP/B does not block deosphory of the bulk mitotic Cdk substrates during mitotic exit. Our results suggest a hierarchy of phosphatases coordinating Great, En/AR and Cdk deosphory during mitotic exit.
Escape from autologous neutralizing antibodies in acute/early subtype C HIV-1 infection requires multiple pathways. Escape from autolog neutralizing antibodies (Nab) is a major goal for an HIV vaccine to limit replication of diverse viruses and prevent new infection establishment. We demonstrate that escape occurred despite high titer autolog ab in two subjects with acute/early subtype C infection. Escape was driven by multiple pathways in two subjects. In one subject, escape was driven by changes in gp120 V3-5. In the second, escape was driven by V2. Escape pathways oscillated and required cooperation between V2 and gp41 ectodomain. In the second subject, escape was driven by V2 and retained over time. This was reflected in virus ability to escape two monoclonal antibodies from same patient via single N-linked glycosylation in V2. Sequence changes in gp120 suggested selective pressure on same Env regions in subjects, though Env domains drove escape different. Together, findings argue single pathway not sufficient to escape early C-1 infection and support model multiple strategies including glycan shifts, epitope sequence alteration, and Env conformational masking to evade neutralization.
Positive and negative selection vary across different parts of the plant genome. We sequenced the genomes of 13 Capsella grandiflora individuals and estimated selection across the genome. Selection is strong in coding regions but weak in most non-coding regions, except for 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions ( UTRs ). However, selection on noncoding conserved across the Brassicaceae family shows strong signals. We see reductions in diversity around substitutions in both coding and conserved noncoding regions, indicating recent sweeps at these sites. Using tissue expression data, we show that highly expressed genes experience stronger negative selection but comparable positive to low expressed genes.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transforms resting B lymphocytes into proliferating lymphoblasts to establish latent infections that can give rise to malignancies. EBNA2, an EBV-encoded transcriptional regulator, drives the cooperative and combinatorial genome-wide binding of two master regulators of B-cell fate, EBF and RBPκ. Previous studies suggest that B-cell factors are statically bound to target promoters. In contrast, we show that EB2 induces the formation of new binding sites for Rκ and EBF, many of which are in close proximity to the cellular and viral genome. These induced sites are co-occupied by EB2-κ EBF and correlate with transcriptional activation of genes important for Blymphoblast function.
Aedes aegypt is the primary mosquito vector of the four deng virus serotypes (DENV). Previous studies have shown that Ae.egypt populations differ in their ability to transmit deng viruses. In Mexico, we found that the intersection of the Neovol axis (N) with the Gulf of Mexico in the state of Veracruz acts as a barrier to gene flow among Ae.egpt populations north and south of N. We also found that Ae.egpt populations north and south of N differ in their vector competence (VC) for deng serotype 2 (DENV2). The average VC for Ae.egpt from north of N was 0.55, while the average VC for Aeeg from south of N was 0.20. Most of this variation was due to midg infection barriers. In.eg north of N, 21.5% failed to develop midg infections and 30.3% of those with midg infections failed to develop disseminated. In contrast, south of N, 45.2% failed to develop midg and 62.8% of those with midg failed to develop disseminated.
Replication in Escherichia coli is driven by the Dna protein, which cycles between an active ATP-bound and inactive ADP-bound form. It has been suggested that Dna is the main controller of initiation frequency. Initiation is thought to occur when enough ATP-Dna accumulates. We performed cell cycle analysis on cells with a surplus of ATP-Dna and asked whether initiation occurs earlier. It does not. Cells with more than 50% increase in concentration of ATPna showed no changes in timing of replication. We suggest that ATPna is the actor in initiation of replication, but its accumulation does not control timing. It is the motor that drives initiation, but other factors are required for exact timing in response to environment. We investigated in vivo roles of Dna-dependent Dna inactivation (DA) and Dna-binding protein Dia. Loss ofDA affected cycle only during slow growth and made sensitive to Dia protein. This indicates cycle machines perform less robust.
Interactions in the Frequency Domain: Uncovering Oscillatory Interactions with Partial Grangerality  
    Oscillatory activity is a ubiquitous in biological processes, from subcellular to organismal and network levels, involving many interacting elements. We introduce partial Granger, a novel method to reveal patterns in multivariate data with exogenous and latent variables in the frequency domain. We test Granger with toy models and apply to experimental datasets: (1) microarray data of HeLa cell cycle; (2) in vivo multi-electrode array (MEA) local field potentials (LFPs) from inferotemporal cortex of sheep; (3) in vivo LFP from right hemisphere of macaque.
Many methods have been proposed for inferring local ancestry at each locus in the genome of admixed individuals, such as those of Latino descent. However, most are designed for use with genotyping arrays and fail to make use the full spectrum of data available from sequencing. In addition, haplotype-based approaches are computationally demanding, requiring large computational time for large sample sizes. We present new methods for local ancestry inference that leverage continent-specific variants (CSVs) to attain performance over existing approaches in admixed genomes. Our approach incorporates admixed genomes with public datasets, such as 100 Genomes, to improve accuracy of CSV. We show that our approach attains accuracy to widely used haplotype-based approaches with decreases in runtime. Our method recovers local ancestries as 100 Gen consensus in admixed from 100 Project. We extend to account for low-coverage and show that local inference can be attained at sequencing. Finally, we generalize to subcontinental-specific (sCSV) and show that it is possible to determine sub-ancestry for chromosomal on basis sCSV.
Circadian oscillations in gene expression have been described in the hypothalamus and multiple peripheral tissues in mammals, with 10–15% of genes oscillating in a daily rhythm regulated by an intrinsic molecular clock. However, statistical analyses of periodicity are limited by small datasets and high levels of stochastic noise. We propose a new approach applying digital signal processing algorithms to each group of genes oscillating in the same phase, combined with statistical tests for periodicity. This method identifies circadian oscillation in almost all expressed genes. Consequently, circadian oscillation in expression should be evaluated in any study related biological pathways. Changes in expression caused by mutations or environmental factors such as photic stimuli or feeding should be considered in context of changes in amplitude and phase of oscillations.
Recombination is a key process that generates genetic diversity and drives evolution. While the outcome of recombination can be detected by the inheritance of alleles in pedigreed families, the precise location of crossover and non-crossover events has been difficult to determine. We performed whole-genome resequencing at high coverage of a three-generation collared flycatcher pedigree to localize recombination with high resolution. We identified 325 crossovers at 1. 4 kb, with 86% in <10 kb. Observed crossover rates were in agreement with linkage data, 52% higher in male ( 3.56M ) than female (2.28 ) and increased towards chromosome ends in male but not female. Crossovers were non-random in the genome with distinct hotspots and concentration in genic regions, highest in promoters and CpG. We identified 267 non-crosso whose location was associated with crosso. We detected significant bias 0.18 in favour ‘’ over ‘ at nonrosso, providing evidence for process in avian.
Repeat-proteins are a class of proteins that consist of repeated stretches of 20–40 amino acids that fold into non-globular, elongated architectures. These proteins are stabilized by interactions within each repeat and between adjacent repeats, but lack contacts between distant residues in sequence. The inherent symmetries in sequence and three-dimensional structure are reflected in a folding landscape that can be analyzed as a quasi-one dimensional problem. We present a description of repeat-protein energy landscapes based on an Ising-like treatment of elementary interactions between foldons, whose ensemble are treated as spin variables. The folding properties of a complete domain ( stability and cooperativity of repeating ) can be derived from this description. The one-dimensional nature of the model implies simple relations for experimental observables: folding-energy ( ΔG ) and cooperativity denaturation (m-value ), which do not apply for globular proteins. We show how parameters for coarse-grained description in foldon variables can be extracted from detailed simulations on funneled landscapes.
Hepatitis, obesity, and alcoholism are major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although these conditions lead to integrated stress response (ISR) or unfolded response (UPR) activation, the extent to which these pathways influence HCC pathogenesis has not been tested. Here we show that the ISR-regulated transcription factor CH promotes liver cancer. CH is upregulated in human and mouse models of HCC. CH-null mice are resistant to chemical carcinogenesis and exhibit attenuation of apoptosis and proliferation. CH-null mice are also resistant to fibrosis, a key factor for H. Gene profiling suggests deletion of CH reduces basal signaling in the liver. Our results are consistent with a model whereby CH contributes to carcinogenesis by promoting, fibrosis cell death and compensatory proliferation. CH is a factor in the development of H in a variety of liver diseases.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania aethopica is a significant public health problem in Ethiopia, with severe cases such as diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL) and mucocutaneous leishiasis (MCL) requiring treatment. However, evidence-based treatment guidelines are lacking. We conducted a systematic review of clinical studies on treatment outcomes of CL due to Lethopica to identify potentially efficacious drugs for clinical trials. We identified 24 records on 506 treatment episodes of CL due to Lethica. The most used drugs were antimonials (201), pentamidine (150) and cryotherapy (103). There were 20 case/series with poor study quality. Only two small, poor quality randomized trials were conducted long ago. Two non-randomized studies reported cryotherapy, antimonials and pentidine. Cryotherapy cure rates were 60–80%, 69–85 with antimonials. Pentidine was effective against CL also cases non-responsive antimonials. All studies suffered methodological limitations.
In vitro circadian oscillators can be reconstituted with purified KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC proteins that display salient properties of circadian rhythms, including self-sustained 24-h periodicity that is temperature compensated. We analyzed the biochemical basis of this oscillator by quantifying the time-dependent interactions of the proteins by electron microscopy and native electrophoresis to elucidate the timing of complex formation among the proteins. The data were used to derive a dynamic model that reproduces the rhythms of Kai complexes and KaiC phosphorylation and is consistent with biophysical observations of individual protein interactions. We used FRET to confirm monomer exchange among Kai hexamers. The model demonstrates that monomer exchange may maintain synchrony among hexers in the reaction, sustaining high-amplitude oscillation. We applied perturbations to the oscillator using temperature pulses to reset the phase of Kai, testing resetting characteristics of this circadian oscillator.
It is well known that there is considerable trial-to-trial variability in both in brain activity and behavioral output, even under identical task conditions. Most event-related potential ( ERP ) studies investigating the relationship between trial-to-trial fluctuations in brain activity and behavioral have only tested a monotonic relationship between them. However, it was recently found that across-trial variability correlates with behavioral independent of trial-averaged activity. This predicts a U or inverted- relationship between trial-trial brain activity and behavioral, depending on whether larger variability is associated with better or worse behavior. Using a visual detection task, we provide evidence from electroencephalography ( EEG ) for an inverted brain-behavior relationship. When fluctuation in broadband EEG activity is closer to the acrossial mean, hit rate is higher and reaction times faster. Importantly, this relationship is present in both post-stimulus-evoked brain and pre-stim spontaneous activity, suggesting anticipatory brain dynamics.
Sexual reproduction is a key innovation in the evolution of eukaryotes. In many species, sexual reproduction involves interaction between compatible partners that can undergo cell fusion and subsequent steps including meiosis. In fungi, sexual compatibility is governed by the mating ( MAT ) loci. In basidiomycetes, the ancestral state is hypothesized to be tetrapolar, with two unlinked MAT loci containing homeodomain factor ( HD ) and pherone and pherone genes ( P ), respectively. Alleles at both loci must differ between partners for completion of sexual development. However, there are basidiomyc with bipolar systems, which arise through linkage of HD and P loc. In the Tremales, bipolarity is found only in the pathogenic Cryptoccus. Here, we describe MAT loci from 24 species of Trichporales, a sister to Tremales. In all species, MAT loci are fused with a single HD gene in each type, similar to pathogenic Cryptoccus. However, HD and P allele combinations in Trichporales differ from pathogenic. This and existence of tetrap in Tremales suggests fusion of HD and P occurred independently Trichporales and pathogenic, supporting convergent evolution towards fused regions.
Chagas disease is the most important vector-borne disease in Latin America. Initiatives based on residual insecticide spraying have successfully controlled domiciliated vectors in many regions. However, nonomiciliated vectors remain responsible for significant transmission and control is now a key for disease. A mathematical model was developed to predict temporal variations in abundance of nonomic vectors inside houses. Demographic parameters were estimated by fitting the model to two years of field data from Yucán Peninsula, Mexico. The model was tested on independent data and examined efficacy of control strategies based on insecticide, screens, and bednets. The model accurately predicted data in absence and presence of insecticide. Pyreth spraying was effective when 50 mg/m were applied within two-month matching immigration season. >80% reduction in abundance was not by larger doses or more interventions, and decreased different timing and frequencies. Alternatively, screens reduced abundance proportionally to immigration rate.
Feathers in birds are arranged in a precise pattern on the skin. They first appear in a row along the dorsal midline, with new feather buds added sequentially in a wave. We show that feather patterning relies on fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling together with mesenchymal cell movement in a coordinated reaction-diffusion system. This system is partly mechanochemical with mechanical-chemical integration through positive feedback on FGF20, which induces aggregation, compressing epidermis to intensify F20. The wave of feather formation is imposed by expanding Ectodysasin (DA) which initiates F20. DA spreads across mesenchym cell gradient, triggering formation by lowering mesench threshold to begin feather bud. These waves and feather primord arrangement are lost in flightless ostrich and emu, though different routes. Ostrich retains general bird arrangement but lays primord without wave, like mammalian hair follicle formation. Embryonic em lacks cells to enact formation, causing failure, instead entire skin gains primord through later.
Since the 2013–2015 Ebola outbreak, there was an unprecedented transmission of the virus within urban environments and thousands of survivors. In 2014, the World Health Organization stated that there was insufficient evidence to give definitive guidance on which body fluids are infectious and pose a risk to humans. We report a systematic review of evidence on the presence of filoviruses in body fluids of infected and survivors. We screened scientific articles for information on filirus in human fluids. The aim was to find primary data that suggested a high likelihood of active filirus in human fluids ( RNA ). Eligible infections were Marburg ( MARV or RAV ) and Zaire, Sudan, Taï and Bundibug species of Ebola. Cause of infection had to be confirmed in laboratory ( tissue culture or RT-PCR tests ) or evidenced by clinical history with subsequent filirus positivity or inflammatory factors. Data were extracted and summarized. We found 683 unique articles, and after screening 33 were eligible. Most fluid types had insufficient patients to draw conclusions and prevalence was highly variable. Fluids taken >16 days after onset were usually negative. The six studies that used both RTPCR tests for filirus RNA gave positive results about 4 times more often than culture. Filirus was in most fluid types but not every sample from otherwise confirmed patient.
Neuronal Spike Adaptation Described with a Fractional Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model  
Neuronal spiking activity can be characterized by multiple timescales that arise from correlated membrane conductance processes. These processes result in power-law behavior that cannot be described by a single time constant. The emergent effect of these correlations is a non-Markovian process that can be modeled by a fractional derivative. A fractional derivative is a non-local process where the value of the variable is determined by integrating a weighted voltage trace, also called memory. Here, we developed a fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model where the exponent of the derivative varies from 0 to 1, with 1 representing the derivative. As the exponent decreases, the weights of the trace increase. Thus, the value is increasingly correlated with the trajectory of in the past. By varying the exponent, our model reproduces upward and downward adaptations found in cortical pyramidal and tectal neurons in vitro. The model also produces spikes with longer latency and inter-spike variability and power-law distribution.
Paracoccoides is a pathogenic fungus that must be able to defend itself against reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by host cells to survive. To counteract these radicals, Parocoides expresses different antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutases (SODs). In this study, we identified six SOD isoforms encoded by Parocoides genome. We determined expression levels of SODs in three phylogenetic lineages of Paroces (PS1, PS2 PS3 and Pb01 ) using quantitative RT-PCR. We analyzed SOD expression in yeast, mycelia, mycel-to-yeast transition and yeast-to-myc germination as well as under oxidative treatment and phagocytic interaction. We observed increased expression of PbOD1 and Pb3 during transition, exposure to oxidative agents and phagoc interaction, suggesting these proteins assist in combating superoxide radicals during host-pathogen interaction. Using Pb1 Pb3 knockdown strains we showed these genes are involved in response against host cells, particularly oxidative stress, in mouse infection model.
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are highly susceptible to proteolysis in vitro, but surprisingly show no enhanced degradation in vivo. We hypothesize that IDPs preferentially interact with chaper proteins in the cell, which may protect them from degradation by proteases. To test this, we analyzed pairwise interaction data from high-throughput studies to see if disorder correlates with chaper binding. Our major finding is that predicted disorder by IUP correlates negatively with chaper binding in E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and metaz species. Since disorder correlates with partner binding in the interactome, the difference between chaper-binding and non-binding proteins is even more pronounced when normalized to their tendency to be involved in proteinprotein interactions. We argue that chaper binding is primarily required for folding of globular proteins, as reflected in preference for chones with at least Pfam domain.
In Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal discs are regulated by the Decapapentaplegic (Dpp) signalling pathway. The spalt (sal) and spalt-related (salr) genes encode Zn-finger transcription factors required for cell survival and proliferation in the central wing disc and vein patterning in lateral regions. To understand the genetic control of wing growth and patterning by Dpp, we need to identify direct Salm and Salr target genes and study their functions. We identified candidate Salm/Sr targets by comparing sal/sr knockdown wing discs with control discs in microarray experiments. We studied the expression of genes whose mRNA levels varied by in situ hybridization and uncovered a complex transcription landscape regulated by Spalt in the disc. Candidate Salmr targets include genes whose expression is turned off and genes whose expression is positively regulated by Salmr. Loss-of-function analysis of these genes indicates that a fraction of them are required for wing growth and patter.
Protein phosphatase 1 Regulates ZYG-1 Levels to Limit Centriole Duplication in Caenorhabditis elegans.
Visceral leishmanias in an environmentally protected area in southeastern Brazil: Epidemiological and laboratory cross-sectional investigation of phbotine fauna, wild and canine hosts. Leishmanias is a rapidly expanding zoonosis that shows increasing urbanization. Concern exists regarding the role of wildlife in visceral leishiasis ( VL ) transmission, due to natural or anthropogenic environmental changes that facilitate contact between wildlife, humans and their pets. The municipality of Campinas, in southeastern Brazil, initially recorded VL in 2009, when the first autochthon case was confirmed in a dog living in an upscale condominium, inside an environmentally protected area ( EPA ). Since then, disease remains restricted to dogs inhabiting two geographically contiguous condominiums within EPA. We conducted cross-sectional study of VL to investigate Leish spp. infection in domestic, wild mammals and sand flies using molecular and serological techniques. Canine seroprevalences 1. 5% and 1.2% were observed in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Six species, confirmed or suspected vectors or transmitters of Leish, were identified. Two of the main L. (. ) infant vector in Brazil, Lutzia longipal, were captured in EPA. Natural by L. (. infant was recorded in Expill firm and Pintia montola. Natural by L. infant and Leish subannia was also detected in white-eared opossum Did albivent, known VL reservoir.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus that is closely associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a highly metastatic type of tumor frequently reported in Asia. Previous studies have shown that several viral proteins promote the migration and invasiveness of NPC cells. However, not all tissues express viral oncoproteins, suggesting that other mechanisms may contribute to aggressive behavior of tumor cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of EBV-encoded microRNA miR-B9 in EB-negative and EB-positive NPC cells using gain and loss-of-function approaches. We found that mi-B9 promotes migration and invas of NPC cells. The promatory activity in vitro was manifested as metastatic ability in vivo. Computational analysis revealed that mi-B9 may target E-cadher, a protein pivotal in cell junctions and epithelial phenotype. Biochemical and functional analysis confirmed that mi9 inhibits Ead to induce mesenchymal phenotype and promote migration NPC cells.
Gash is a command-line tool for visualizing splicing events across multiple samples. Given a genomic region, gash creates sash plots for individual RNA-seq experiments as well as aggregated plots for groups of experiments. This is a unique feature of gash. Compared to existing programs generating sash plots, gash uses popular bioinformatics file formats, is annotation-independent and allows visualization of splicing events for large genomic regions by scaling down genomic segments between splice sites.
Comparative analysis of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) across species has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding their evolution and prediction. However, reliable sequence alignment remains challenging for conserved non-coding sequences. Existing models of DNA evolution do not explicitly treat properties of CRMs. We propose a probabilistic model of CRM evolution that captures modes of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and background sequences. A novel aspect is a probabilistic model of TFBS gains and losses, recognized as part of regulatory evolution. We present a computational framework that uses this model to solve CRM alignment and prediction problems. Our method is similar to statistical alignment but uses conserved sites to improve alignment. Our CRM method deals with uncertainties of binding annotations and alignment in a probabilistic framework. We demonstrate our program improves alignment and prediction over state-of-the-art methods in simulated and real data. Our alignments are used to study genome-wide binding of transcription factors in Drosophila blastod, with results: ( i ) factor-bound sequences are under evolutionary constraints if neighboring genes are not expressed in blastod ( ii ) distal sites tend to be more conserved than proximal.
Transposons and other selfish DNA elements are found in all eukaryotes and their mobilization can compromise genome integrity. The piRNA (PIWI-interacting RNA) pathway silences transpos in the germline, but it is unclear if this pathway has additional functions during development. Here we show that mutations in Drosophila piRNA genes, armi, aub, ago, andhi lead to extensive fragmentation of the zygotic genome during cleavage stage embryonic divisions. Additionally, aub and arm show defects in telomeresolution during meiosis and cleavage divisions and mutations ligIV, which disrupt nonhomologous end joining suppress fusions. By contrast ligIV mutations enhance chromosome fragmentation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies show aub and arm mutations disrupt telom binding of HO, a component of telomere complex and expression of subpopulation 19-22ntelomeric piRNAs. Mutations rhi and ago do not block HO binding or production of theseRNAs. These findings uncover genetically separable functions for DophilaRNA. Theub, arm,hi, andago silence transpos and maintain chromosome during cleavage embryonic divisions. However,ub and arm have additional in assembly telomere complex.
Since 2000, Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses have been responsible for large hemorrhagic fever (HF) outbreaks with case fatality rates ranging from 53% to 90%. In contrast, a third species, Côte d'Ivo ebolavirus caused a single fatal case of HF. In November 2007, HF cases were reported in Bundibyo District, Western Uganda. Laboratory investigation of the initial 29 suspect blood specimens by classic antigen capture IgM and IgG ELISA and recently developed random-primed pyrosequencing identified the outbreak to be associated with a newly discovered ebolavirus ( Bundibyo ebavirus ) distantly related to Côte dvo ebolavirus in western Africa.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a wide variability in disease progression rates among patients. Previous studies have reported differences in rates of progression, but there has been no quantitative assessment of the degree of heterogeneity in AD. To evaluate the results of clinical studies, it is essential to obtain a reliable measure of progression rates and variances among patients for each stage of AD. The Global Deteration Scale (GDS) and Functional Staging (FAST) procedures characterize seven stages of AD from normal aging to severe dementia, each with published mean durations but unknown variances. We used statistical analysis to reconstruct DS/FAST durations in a cohort of 648 AD patients with an average follow-up of 4.78 years. Calculations for DS/FAST stages 4–6 revealed that standard deviations for durations are comparable to mean values, indicating large variations in AD progression among patients. This heterogeneity in AD progression is consistent with the existence of several subgroups of patients differing by decline patterns.
Recent studies have shown that adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus is important for memory encoding and responding to changes in input statistics. Here, we extend this work to include realistic spatial input patterns from grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. We compare three adaptation strategies: synaptic plasticity, where the network is fixed but connectivity is plastic; neuronal turnover, where the network is fixed but units may die and be replaced; and additive neurogenesis, where the network starts with fewer units but grows over time. We show that additive neurogenesis is superior with realistic spatial patterns. We also show that a biologically plausible neurogenesis, incorporating cell death and plasticity of granule cells, has better performance than individual strategies. This rule can be tailored for short or long-term memory. We examine neurogenesis over lifetime under different rearing conditions. These profiles have features that could be tested experimentally. Finally, we show that place cells emerge in our model as a result of dentate gyrus sparsification.
Trypanosomes express three identical cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (Px)-type enzymes that detoxify lipid-derived hydroperoxides. In bloodstream Trypanosoma brucei lacking mitochondrial PxIII display a weak and transient proliferation defect, whereas parasites lacking cytosolic PxI and PxII undergo rapid lipid peroxidation and lysis. The phenotype is rescued by supplementing with α-tocopherol derivative Trolox. We show that the lysosome is the origin of cellular injury. Feeding PxII knockout parasites with Alexa-conjugated dextran or LysoTracker in presence of Tro yields discrete lysosomal staining. Upon Tro withdrawal, the signal spreads over the cell and is lost. T. bruce acquires iron by endocytosis of transferrin. Supplementing with iron or transferrin induces whereas ironchel deferox and apo-transferrin attenuates lysis of PxII cells. Immunofluorescence with Mito and lysosomal marker p67 reveals disintegration precedes mitochondrial damage. In vivo experiments confirm negligible mitochondrial role: PxIII cells display only slightly delayed disease compared to wild-type. Our data demonstrate that in bloodstream tryosomes, the lysosome is the primary site of damage and cytos Px protect the lys from iron-induced peroxidation.
Melanophilin (PM) is an amyloid protein expressed in pigment cells that forms intracellular fibrils within melanosomes early in the melanin deposition process. It is conserved among vertebrates and allelic variants in several species are associated with reduced melanin in epidermal tissues. However, it is unclear whether allelic variants reflect gain-of-function or loss-of-function and no PM loss-of-function has been reported in mammals. We generated a mouse line in which the PM gene has been inactivated (PM−/−). These mice are viable, fertile and display no developmental defects. Melanosomes in PM−− melanocytes are spherical in contrast to the elongated shape present in wild-type. This was documented in primary cultures of skin-derived melanocytes as well as retinal pigment epithelium and uveal melanocytes. Inactivation of PM has a mild effect on the coat phenotype in four genetic backgrounds with the clearest in mice carrying brown/Tp. This phenotype is similar to observed in spontaneous mice, suggesting other described alleles in vertebrates with striking effects are dominant mutations.
Vector control remains the primary method to prevent deng infections. Environmental interventions are sustainable and safe with limited risks of contamination and toxicity. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of the following environmental methods for deng vector control: (1) container covers with insecticides, (2) waste management and clean-up campaigns, and (3) elimination of breeding sites. Nineteen studies were eligible for review, sixteen contributed to meta-analysis. Quality was highest for container covers with insecticides, followed by waste without direct collection and elimination of breeding. Both review and meta showed weak effect on larval populations with no differences between methods. For meta, container without insecticides (BI: -7.9, DOE-5 ) and waste with collection (BI: -8.83, DOE-6.2 ) achieved strongest BI reductions, whereas P results were opposite with covers (P: -.83, 0.09 ) and elimination (P: -.95, -.83 ) showing strongest.
Small molecules that inhibit protein synthesis by selectively stalling the ribosome constitute a new strategy for therapeutic development. Compounds that inhibit the translation of PCSK9, a major regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, have been identified that reduce LDL in preclinical models and affect the translation of only a few off-target proteins. Here, we used a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify proteins and pathways that modulate growth in the presence of high doses of a PCS9 translational inhibitor, PF-06303 ( PF3 ). The most potent genetic modifiers of fitness in the presence of PF3 were the ubiquitin binding proteins ASC2 and helicase3, which bind to the ribosome and protect cells from toxic effects of high concentrations of the compound. Surprisingly, translation control proteins Pelota and H1 sensitize cells to PF3 treatment. In genetic experiments, helic3 acts together with ASC2 and functions downstream of H1. These results identify new connections between ribosome control pathways and provide insights into selectivity of compounds that stall translation.
Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is known to induce widespread destruction of cellular mRNAs in order to block host gene expression and evade immune detection. The viral protein SO is responsible for this phenotype, but the mechanism of SO-induced mRNA turnover has remained unknown, given its lack of intrinsic ribonuclease activity. Here, we report that SO stimulates cellular mRNA turnover via a novel mechanism involving aberrant polyadenylation. SO-expressing cells exhibit extended poly ( ) polymer II-generated poly A tails and polyaden-linked mRNA turnover. SO-induced polyadenylation correlates with RNA turnover, and inhibition of poly A tail formation blocks SO activity. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic poly A binding proteins are critical for SO function, the latter of which undergoes striking nuclear localization by SO.
Bacterial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa induce the production of type III interferon (IFλ) in the lung. IFλ is essential for host defense against some viral pathogens, but its role in innate response to bacterial pathogens is unknown. IFλ receptor (IL-28) is abundantly expressed in the respiratory tract. In mice lacking IL-28, clearance of bacteria from the lung was significantly reduced compared to controls. Clearance of bacteria correlated with reduced lung pathology and increased ratio of anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory cytokines in the airway. In human epithelial cells, IFλ inhibited miR-21 via STAT, resulting in upregulation of PDC4, a protein promoting inflammatory signaling. In vivo, following infection with either pathogen, mi-21 was reduced and P4 increased in lungs of wild type mice compared IL-28 null. Infection of P4 null mice with USA resulted in improved clearance, reduced pathology, and inflammatory cytokine production. These data suggest that during bacterial pneumonia IFλ promotes inflammation by inhibiting mi-21 regulation of4.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, we conducted a retrospective study on 781 naïve cases of advanced stage-2 sleeping sickness between 1989 and 2012 at the National Center for African Trypanosomiasis. The outcome was death, and predictors were age, gender, duration of disease, location of trypanosomes in body fluids, cyach, protach, clinical status on admission, and treatment. Death proportions were 17. 2% in the standard melop schedule, 12.1 in the short melop, 5.4 in first-line eornine, 9. in NECT, and 36 in the group with severely affected patients. After adjusting for treatment, death ratios were: 10.40 for clinical dysfunction on admission,2. for protach,.99 for presence in CSF and.1 for cyach. Multivar analysis retained clinical on admission and protach as predictors of death.
Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model organism to study social behavior. Isolation profoundly influences social behavior in all animals, and has serious effects on health in humans. However, analysis of social behavior in Dophila is hampered by the lack of effective and reliable tools. We built a new arena and improved tracking algorithm to follow a large number of flies simultaneously. Next, we designed an algorithm to quantify changes in social network in response to isolation based on automatic classification and graph analysis. We observed that isolation significantly enhanced individual and local network parameters near-neighbor relationships. We explored genome-wide molecular correlates of these changes and found that behavior changed throughout six days of isolation, gene expression occurred largely one day. These occurred mostly in metabolic genes and verified by increase of lipid in isolated flies.
The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for diarrheal disease management were adapted into a smartphone tool to improve clinical adherence in resource-limited settings. A pilot study was conducted in rural Bangladesh to evaluate the tool’s impact. The tool included a modality for age-based weight estimation, which was developed with end-user input and evaluated in a resource-limited district and sub-district hospital during the 2015 cholera season. Both hospitals lacked scales, necessitating weight estimation. The study consisted of a 6 week pre-intervention and 6 week intervention period with 10-day post-discharge follow-up. Standard care was maintained with the exception of admitting clinicians using the tool during intervention. Inclusion criteria were patients two months of age and older with uncomplicated diarral disease. The primary outcome was adherence to guidelines for intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics and zinc. A total 841 patients were enrolled (325 pre-intervention; 516 intervention ). During intervention, the proportion of prescriptions for IV fluids decreased at both district and subistrict hospitals (p<0.001) with risk ratios (RRs) of 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. However, when IV fluids were prescribed, volume adhered to recommendations. Proportion for recommended azithromycin increased (p<0.001; district p=0.035 subistrict) with RR of 6.9 and 1.6 while prescriptions for other antibiotics decreased; zinc adherence increased.
Host-parasite interactions are complex systems that are difficult to predict how they will respond to climate change. In particular, host and parasite traits such as survival and virulence may have distinct temperature dependencies that must be integrated into models of disease dynamics. Using experimental data from Daphnia magna and a microidian parasite, we fitted a mechanistic model of within-host parasite dynamics. The model comprised host mortality, parasite growth, virulence, and abundance parameters arising from the metabolic theory of ecology. The model effectively predicted survival, parasite growth, and cost of infection across temperatures using less than half the parameters compared to modeling discretely.
GABAergic interneurons play a crucial role in shaping the activity of excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs). However, the contribution of various inhibitory cell types to neuronal processing is not resolved. Here, we propose a functional role for a network motif consisting of parvalbumin (PV), somostatin (SOM) and vaso intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons. We suggest that PV and SOM interneurons control the distribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition onto PCs. Moreover, we propose that mutual inhibition between SOM and VIP interneurons translates VIP inputs into changes of somato-dendritic inhibition of PCs. Using a computational model, we show that neuronal and synaptic properties support this hypothesis. We demonstrate that the SOM-VIP motif allows inputs to persistently switch the circuit between two modes, in which top inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs are either integrated or cancelled.
Microbiome-wide association studies are widely used to investigate the relationship between microbial communities and host phenotypes, including disease. These studies compare microbial abundances between two groups of samples to link specific microbes to phenotypes. However, abundance differences reflect not only direct associations with the phenotype, but also indirect effects due to microbial interactions. We found that interactions can easily generate a large number of spurious associations that provide no mechanistic insight. We developed a method to remove indirect associations using techniques from statistical physics and applied it to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Our method corrected the inflation of p-values in standard tests and showed that only a small subset of associations is directly linked to disease. Direct associations had much higher accuracy in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate and brain-gut axis as important in inflammatory disease.
Dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV) replication and transmission in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are studied using three Wolbachia infection models: naturally infected Wolbach hosts, transinfected Wolbach (stably maintained infections ) and transiently infected Wolbach hosts. These models have been used to study the effect of Wolbach on transmitted pathogens such as DENV, WNV and Plasmodium. The interaction between Wolbach and pathogen is influenced by host-Wolbach interaction and infection model. Some studies suggest Wolbach can enhance pathogen infection under specific conditions. This study compares Wolbach effects in two models ( transected and transiently infected ) on DENV and WNV (Kun strain ) replication, infection and transmission rates. Results show Wolbach similar blocking effects in both stable and transient models, but lower magnitude in transiently infected Wolbach. Importantly, no enhancement of DENV or WNV (un strain ) infection found in Wolbach infected Ae.egypt.
Cilia are microtubular organelles that mediate signal transduction and are organized into structurally and functionally distinct compartments: the basal body, the transition zone ( TZ ), and the shaft. In vertebrates, the protein Invers localizes to a portion of the shaft adjacent to the TZ, termed the Invers compartment ( Inv ). The mechanisms that establish and maintain Inv are unknown. In C. elegans, the shafts of amphid and phasm sensory cilia are subdivided into regions by different microtub structure: a proximal doublet adjacent to TZ and dist singlet. We show that Inv is conserved and distinct from double region. n-2 ( Invers hom ) and double genes,,, and are redundantly required for cili. Inv and double can be sorted into modules—+ and — which are antagonized by deacetyl. The genes modulate the sizes of Inv and double. Glutamylation is not required for ciliary of Inv and double components; rather, is modulated by, and. The restricted localization does not require TZ, and Inv-associated genes. does require its domain for Inv.
Myelination and remyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) is a complex process that requires profound changes in oligodendrocy shape to initiate myelin sheath formation. Here, we show that the polarity protein Scribble is required for CNS myelination and remyination. Scribble is expressed throughout oligodendrogl development and is upregulated in mature oligodrocytes where it is localised to developing and mature myelin sheaths. In cultured oligodroglia, Scribble knockdown results in disrupted morphology and myelination. In myelinating glia of transgenic mice where Scri is conditionally eliminated, myination in CNS is disrupted during development and following demyelination, and myelin sheath extension is disrupted. At later myination stages, Scri acts to regulate myelin and suppresses the extracellular signal-related kinase (ER)/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) pathway, localising to noncompact myelin flanking the node of Ranvier where it is required for paranodal axo-glial adhesion.
Streptolysin S (S) is a bacteriocin-like hemolytic and cytotoxic virulence factor that plays a key role in the virulence of Group A Streptococcus (GAS), the causative agent of pharyngitis, impet, necrotizing fascitis and streptoccal shock. Although it has been thought that SLS and related peptides are produced by GAS and streptocci only, there is evidence to suggest that number of most Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, including Listeria monocytogen, Clostridium botulin and Staphlococcus aureus, produce related peptides. The distribution of L monocogen cluster is noteworthy in that it is exclusively found among subset lineage I; i. e., responsible for majority of outbreaks of listiosis. Expression of these genes results in production of hemolytic and cytotoxic factor, Listerin S, which contributes virulence of pathogen assessed by murine and human polymorph neutrophil–based studies.
Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease that can be caused by fungi or bacteria. The disease is characterized by the formation of macroscopic structures called grains, which are surrounded by a massive inflammatory reaction. The mechanisms leading to this reaction and the immunophenotypic characteristics of mycetoma granuloma are unknown. We hypothesised that the expression of interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) and matrixloproase-9 ( MMP-9 ) in myetoma was correlated with the severity of the disease and this was independent of the causative agent responsible for the reaction. To determine IL-17 and MMP-9 in myet lesions, we conducted a study at Myet Research Centre, Sudan. Surgical biopsies from 100 patients with myet were obtained and IL-17 and MMP9 in myet granoma evaluated immunohistochemically. IL-17 was mainly expressed in Zones I and II, and less in III. MMP-9 was mainly in II and III, and least in I. MMP-9 was highly expressed in Actinadura pelletii and Streptomyces somalis biies compared to Madura myetatis biies. MMP-9 was directly proportional to IL-17 ( p 0. 001 ). Only association between MMP9 and patients’ characteristics was disease ( p 0.001 ). There was no correlation IL-17 and patients’ characteristics.
Molecular recognition by intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) often involves specific contacts that induce disorder to order transitions. However, some IDPs remain disordered in the bound state, a phenomenon called “fuzziness”, characterized by ID polyvalency, sequence-insensitivity and dynamic disordered bound-state conformations. Besides general features, specific biophysical models for fuzzy interactions are lacking. The transcription activation domain of Ewing Sarcoma oncoprotein (E) is an ID that exhibits fuzziness with multiple E aromatic chains driving recognition. We hypothesized that E-target binding involves polyc-π contacts between disordered E residues and basic on target. We evaluated the pol-π hypothesis via functional and theoretical interrogation of E variants. The effects of E sequence variations, including aromatic number, density and perturbations support the model. Moreover, trends are captured by a coarse-grained E model and based on between E aromatics and cations of a generic target. E-target binding is driven by balance between E conformation and favorable c-π contacts.
Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, has two putative ATP-dependent Lon homologs, Lon-1 and Lon-2. Previous studies have shown that lon-1 is upregulated by blood in vitro while lon-2 is not. This study aimed to clarify the functional roles of these proteases in B. burgorferi. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that lon-1 and lon-2 cluster separately due to differences in the NH-terminal binding domains. Recombinant lon-1 manifested ATP-dependent chaperone-prote activity in vitro but did not complement E. coli mutant, while lon-2 corrected characteristic lon-mut phenotypes. We conclude that B burgorferi lon-1 and lon-2 have distinct functions. lon-2 functions in a manner consistent with Lon, engaged in cellular homeostasis. lon-, by virtue of blood induction, may be important in host adaptation from arthropod to warm-blood host.
Human Immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) evades antibody-dependent phagocytosis. Antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) is a function of the Fcγ receptor (FcR)-mediated antibody that plays a role in preventing other viral infections, but its role in HIV is unknown. We measured the ability of HIV-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (Abs) to mediate the internalization of HIV-1 virions and HIV-1-decorated cells by phagocytes. We used a green-fluorescent protein-expressing molecular of HIV-1JR, R, an R5 clinical isolate, in combination with polyclonal HIV or Abs to capture and neutralize HIV-1. THP and U937 cells, as well as freshly isolated monocytes from healthy individuals were used as phagytic effector cells, and uptake of virions was measured by cytometry. We found minimal AD of virions with any Abs. However, after virions were coated with gp41 or gp-derived peptides, gp41 ( but not gp120 ) Abs efficiently phagocytosed. We estimated a minimum of few gp41 were needed for phagytosis, similar to the number of envelope on viruses that are phagytosed ( e. g. influenza ). Employing fluorescence spectroscopy, we found a association between virus and AD. In contrast virions, vir-decor cells were targets for AD orgocyt in presence HIV Abs. Our findings indicate AD of vir may not play in preventing infection due paucity of trimers and inability vir-bound to cross FcRs phocytes. However, AD orocyt could play in HIV-infected cells verge.
Hookworm infection is a major public health problem in many countries around the world, but its global health and economic impact is not well known. We developed a computational model to estimate the economic and health burden of hookworm infection in every country, region, and globally in 2016 from a societal perspective. Globally, hook infection resulted in 2, 126, 280 disability adjusted life years ( DALs ) using 200 disability estimates and 4, 087 803 DALs using 201 estimates ( excluding cognitive impairment ). The total productivity losses varied from $7.5 to $138.9 billion annually using gross national income per capita as a proxy for wages and from $2.5 to $43.9 billion using minimum wage as proxy.
Hypoxia Disrupts Vertebrate CNS Pathfinding through EphB2 Rescued by Magnesium. Hypoxia is a major cause of chronic neurodevelopmental impairments, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Recent work in invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans has shown that hypia causes axon pathfinding errors in certain neurons. We found that hypia disrupts pathfinding of forebrain neurons in zebraf ( Danio rer ), leading to errors in commissural axons failing to cross the midline. The defects result from activation of the hypia-inducible transcription factor (h1) pathway and are mimicked by chemical inducers of h1 or expression of constitutive h1α. Further, we found that blocking hα prevented the defects. We identified ephrinB2 as a target of h activation, showed knockdown of ephB rescued the defects and that ephA is expressed in a pattern to the misrouting axons. By targeting constitutive ephB to neurons we found eph mediates via reverse-signaling. Finally, magnesium protects against errors by preventing eph upregulation.
Paracococciidioidomycosis (PCM) is an endemic fungal disease of pulmonary origin caused by Paracoccioides brasiliensis (Pb). This study aims to define the patterns and intensity of lung lesions in experimentally infected mice by comparing High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) and histopathological findings. Male BAL/c mice were intranasally inoculated with 3×106 Pb conidia (n=50) or PBS (n=50). HRCT was done every four weeks to determine pulmonary lesions, lung density, and structure. Lungs were also analyzed by histology and histometry. Three patterns were evidenced by HR and histology: nodular-diffuse, confluent and pseudo-tum. Lesions were mainly around the hilus and frequently affected the left lung. At 4 weeks post-challenge HR showed 80% Pb-infected had peri-bronial consolidations with significant increase in lung density compared to controls (−263±25 vs −42210HU p<0.001). After 8 and 12 weeks consolidation progressed to middle regions. Histology revealed consolidation by HR as confl granulomatous reaction while nodules corresponded compact granomas. At 16 weeks confl granomas formed pseudooral masses obstructing bronchi. Discrete fibrosis was around granomas but only evident histology.
Leishmania donovani is a protozoan parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a major public health problem in the Indian subcontinent. In endemic areas, a large number of individuals are infected but remain asymptomatic. We propose interferon-gamma release assay (IF-RA) as a novel marker for latent L. donov infection. We modified a commercial kit (QuFERON) with five leishmania antigens to detect cell-mediated response in VL. We evaluated the assay on venous blood samples of active VL patients (13), cured patients (15), non-endemic controls (11) and endemic controls (19). The assay based on soluble leishmania antigen (SL) had 80% sensitivity (95%CI=54.81–92.95) and 100% specificity (95%CI=74.–100). Our findings suggest a whole-blood SL-based QuFER assay can measure cell-mediated response in L.ov infection. The IF- response to leish antigen in VL patients was contradictory to conventional non-proliferative antigen response of blood mononuclear cells.
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is an enteric pathogen that causes gastrointestinal infections that can become persistent and complicated by relapsing enteritis and severe autoimmune disorders. To establish a persistent infection, the bacteria have to cope with hostile surroundings when transmigrating through the intestinal epithelium and colonizing underlying gut-associated lymphatic tissues. Here we show that the CNFY toxin enhances translocation of antiphocytic Y effectors, inducing inflammatory responses. This results in extensive tissue destruction of the intestinal microbiota and bacterial clearance. Suppression of CNFY function, however, increases interferon-γ responses comprising non-inflammatory antimicrobial activities and tolerogenesis. This is accompanied by preprogramming the pathogen’s transcription towards persistence, giving bacteria a fitness against responses and establishment of commensal life.
In this article, we describe a novel pathogenic gene, DES1, in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryza that suppresses basal defenses of the host plant. We identified DES1 by screening for pathogenic-defective mutants in a T-DNA insertional library. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that DES1 encodes a serine-rich protein with unknown biochemical properties and homologs conserved in filamentous Asycetes. Targeted deletion of DES1 had no effect on morphogenesis, vegetative growth, conial germination, appressium formation, and appium-mediated penetration. However, conial size of Δdes mutant was smaller than wild type and Δdes displayed no defects in cell wall integrity. Δdes mutant was hypersensitive to exogenous stress and activity and transcription of extracellular enzymes including peroxides and lases was severely decreased in Δdes. In addition, ferrous leakage was observed in Δdes. In interaction with susceptible rice, Δdes mutant exhibited strong defense responses by brown granules in infected cells, accumulation of reactive species (ROS), generation autofluorescent materials and PR induction in tissues. Δdes displayed significant reduction in hyphal extension and caused decrease in pathogenicity. Notably, suppression of ROS by DPI, inhibitor of NAD oxidases resulted in significant reduction in defense in tissues challenged Δdes. Furthermore, Δdes recovered normal growth in DPI-treated tissues.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma haematobium that is a major public health problem in Ghana. To determine where control programs should operate, it is essential to map the distribution of schosiasis. However, it is impractical to assess infection in every potentially endemic community, so model-based geostatistics (MB) is increasingly used to predict prevalence and determine intervention strategies. We evaluated the accuracy of MB predictions for Schos haobium in Ghana by comparing empiric values from 79 school surveys with values derived from published MB predictions. Schools were categorized according to WHO guidelines to determine practical implications of differences. Using predicted values alone, 21 of 25 empirically ‘high’ schools requiring praziquel would have been undertreated and almost 20% of remaining would have been treated despite empirically-determined absence of infection. This translates to 28% of children in 79 schools undertreated and 12% receiving treatment in absence of demonstrated need. Using current MB for Ghana as decision tool, aggregating prevalence to district level was not adequate for national program, but assessing each school in potentially endemic areas is not feasible; MB must be complementary to empiric assessments.
In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the mechanisms that guide motile sperm through the female reproductive tract to the oocytes are not well understood. We have shown that C. elegans oocytes synthesize sperm-guiding prostaglandins from polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PU ) precursors provided in yolk lipoprotein. Here we use genetics and electrospray ion tandem mass spectrometry to delineate F-series prostland metabolism. We show that omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs, arachidonic and eicosentaenoic acids are converted into more than 10 structurally related F prostagland, which collectively and largely redundantly promote sperm guidance. Disruption of omega-3 PU synthesis triggers compensatory upregulation of prostagland derived from omega-6 PAs. C eleg prostagland synthesis involves biochemical mechanisms distinct from mammalian cyclooxygen-dependent pathways, yet PG2α stereomers are synthesized. A comparison F prostagland in C eleg and mouse tissues reveals shared features. Finally, we show conserved cytochrome P enzyme whose human hom is implicated in Bti Crystine dystrophy negatively regulates prostland synthesis.
Immunogenicity is a major bottleneck in the development of biotherapeutic pipelines. To overcome this, there is a need for improved deimmization technologies. We have developed an algorithm that simultaneously optimizes proteins for reduced T cell epitope content and high function. In silico analysis of this dual objective space reveals that there is no single optimum with respect to deimmization. Instead, mutagenic epitope deletion yields a spectrum of designs that trade between immunogenic potential and function. The edge of this space is the Pareto frontier, i. e. undominated for no single design better in both criteria. We have constructed and experimentally evaluated the Pareto of a therapeutic enzyme. Various measures of performance were found to map functional space that correlated with predictions.
Meiosis is a fundamental process of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes that depends on reciprocal exchange of DNA between homologous chromosomes, known as crossovers ( COs), to ensure proper chromosome segregation. The frequency and distribution of COs are regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Here, we show that elevated temperature induces meiotic hyper-recombination in Arabidopsis thalian and use genetic analysis of mutants in different recombination pathways to demonstrate that extra COs are derived from the Type I interference pathway. We also show that heat-induced COs are not the result of increase in double-strand breaks and the hyper-recomant phenotype is likely specific to thermal stress rather than a generalized response.
Biomedical Discovery Acceleration with Applications to Craniofacial Development: A Novel Computational Approach to Navigating the Rapidly Evolving Terrain of Biomedical Literature and Experimental Data  
Biomedical discovery is a rapidly evolving field, with an explosion of new results in the literature, particularly in molecular biomedicine. Even experienced researchers can benefit from computational tools that help navigate this vast and rapidly evolving terrain. We describe a novel approach to this challenge, a knowledge-based system that combines reading, reasoning, and reporting to facilitate analysis of experimental data. This system extracts information from external resources, either by parsing structured data or biomedical processing to extract information from unstructured, and tracks provenance. Reasoning enriches results from reading, for example, noting genes annotated to the same ontology or database. Reasoning also combines sources into a network that represents all relationships between pairs of genes, and calculates reliability. Reporting combines network with congruent constructed from data and visualizes in tool that facilitates knowledge-based analysis of data. We demonstrate this approach, called Hanalyzer, on large gene array dataset relevant to craniofac development. The tool was critical in creation of hypotheses regarding genes never characterized in cranfac development; each validated by further work.
Helminth pathogen Fasciola hepatica secretes extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can be internalised by host cells to modulate the immune response. While the cargo of EVs has been characterised in many parasites, little is known about the surface-exposed molecules that participate in ligand-receptor interactions with host cells to initiate vesicle docking and internalisation. We describe 380 proteins on the surface of two EV subpopulations (15 and 120 EV) released by adult F. hepatica, including virulence factors, transport proteins and molecules in EV biogenesis/trafficking. Proteomics and immunohistochemical analysis show that 120 EV have endosomal origin and may be released via the protonephial excretory system whilst larger 15 EV are released from gastrodermal epithelial cells lining the fluke gut. Lectin microarray profiling of surface oligosaccharides of fluorically labelled EVs shows lectin profiles corresponding to glycoconjugates on 15 and 120 EV are identical but distinct from parasite tegument and predominated by mannose. F hep EVs are resistant to exo and endoglycosidase but glycosidase remodels surface oligoschar and blocks uptake by macrophages.
The Arabidopsis thaliana CDF2 transcription factor is involved in the regulation of microRNA (miRNA) transcription and processing. miRNAs are first transcribed as stem-loop primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II and then cleaved in the nucleus into mature miRNAs by Dicer-like 1 (DCL1). CDF2 interacts with D1 and regulates the accumulation of a subset of miRNAs. C2 binds directly to the promoters of some miRN and acts as a transcriptional activator or repressor of these miRNA genes. C2 preferentially binds to pri-miRNAs regulated by itself and affects D1-mediated processing of these priiRN. C2 genetically works in the same pathway as miR156 or mi172 to control flowering. We conclude that C2 regulates a group of priiRNAs at both transcriptional and post-transcription levels to maintain proper levels of mature miRN to control plant development.
Folliculogenesis is a complex and highly regulated process that is essential for providing ova for later in life. It requires bidirectional communication between the oocyte and granulosa cells. This communication conveys signals from the oocyte to granosa that regulate their proliferation and metabolites from granosa to the o for biosynthesis. However, the underlying mechanism of this communication is largely unknown. Here we report that oocyte geranyl diphosphate (GG), a metabolic intermediate in geranylation, is required for oocyte-granosa communication. GG and geranyliphosphate synthase (GPPS) levels in oocytes increase during early follicular development. GG depletion in oocytes impairs granosa proliferation, primary follicle transition and female fertility. Mechanistically, GG depletion inhibits Rho geranylation and its activity, responsible for accumulation of junction proteins in ocytoplasm and failure to maintain o-granosa connection. GG also blocks Rab geranylation, which accounts for impaired secretion o materials such as GDF. Moreover, GG restores defects o-granosa contact, granosa proliferation and primary follicle in PP depletion mice. Our study provides evidence that GG-mediated geranylation contributes to o-granosa communication and regulates primary follicle, a phase of essential for reproductive function.
The RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a eukaryotic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of messenger RNA using a DNA as a template. Despite numerous biochemical and biophysical studies, it remains unclear whether the secondary channel is the only route for NTP to reach the active site of the enzyme or the main channel could be an alternative. We have built a structural model of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble based on multiple sources of existing structural data and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to shed light on NTP pathways. We found that both channels have enough space to allow NTP loading, but the percentage of conformations with enough space for NTP through the secondary channel is twice that of the main. Further MD simulations with NTP in channels revealed that diffusion through the main is greatly disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between N and the highly charged backbone of nucleotides in non-template DNA.
Dengue is a reportable disease in Thailand and Cambodia, but the true burden of the disease is unknown due to underreporting. We estimated the magnitude of deng underrecognition and established more accurate burden estimates for these countries by calculating deng incidence from laboratory-confirmed outpatient and inpatient cases in prospective cohort studies. Cohort studies were conducted among children <15 years of age at deng field sites over at least 2 deng seasons. In Thailand, 14,627 person-years of cohort data were obtained from two provinces and 14,493-years from one in Cambodia. The average annual incidence of laboratory-confirmed deng was 23/1,000 and 25/1,000 in Thailand and 41/1,000 in Cambodia. Calculated age-specific factors (MF) varied by age and year (0.4–29). Average age-specific MF were applied to country-level data and indicated that in Thailand 229,886 (210,612–331,236) deng cases occurred annually 2003–2007 and 111,178 (80,452–357,135) in Cambodia. Average underrecognition of inpatient deng cases was 8.7 and 2.6 in Thailand and 9.1 and 1.4 in Cambodia. In 2007, >95,000 children in Thailand and >58,000 in Cambodia were estimated hospitalized due deng.
Natural Killer Cells Promote CD8 T Cell Responses against Murine Cytomegalovirus: A Novel Mechanism of Immune Defense against Viral Infection  
Natural killer (NK) cells are known to directly control viral replication, but their role in orchestrating global antiviral defense is largely unknown. We used congenic mice and genetically engineered viruses to examine the consequences of NK cell defects on antiv CD8 T responses against murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that NK cells accelerate CD8 T responses against viral infection in vivo. We identify the mechanism as the ability of NK cells to limit IFNα/β production, which is immunosuppressive to the host. This is achieved through early control of cytgalovirus, reducing activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) for cytokine production, preserving conventional dendritic cells (DC) and accelerating antiv CD8 T responses. Conversely, exogenous IFα administration ablates DCs and delays CD8 T activation in the absence of NK control of viral replication. Our data demonstrate that NK responses to cytgalovirus critically contribute to the balance of innate responses, dampening immunopathology and promoting initiation of antiv CD8 T responses.
In plants, rRNA genes are organized in tandem arrays that can range from hundreds to thousands of copies. Although not all copies are transcribed under normal growth conditions, the mechanisms controlling expression of specific rRNA variants are unclear. Here, we report four rRNA variants in Arabidopsis thalian. Interestingly, transcription of one variant is induced while others are repressed or unaltered in A. thalian plants with disrupted nucleolin-like gene Auc1. The most representedRNA variant, inactive in WT, is reactivated inuc1 mutants. We show pre–RNAs originate from Pol I transcription are accurately processed. Moreover, Atuc1 induces loss of symmetrical DNA methylation without histone epigenetic marks r genes.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a member of the herpesvirus family that causes a range of diseases in humans. In this report, we have investigated the role of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) in the context of CMV infection. We identified several CMV-coded proteins that interact with HD1, including UL38 and UL29. We confirmed the interaction of UL38 and UL29 with HD1 by reciprocal immunoprecipitation. HD1 is part of the NuRD complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and deacetylation. UL38 and UL29 associated with the MTA component of Nu, and RNA-mediated knockdown of RBP and CHD constituents of Nu inhibited CM immediateearly RNA and DNA accumulation. This suggests that multiple Nu components are needed for efficient CM replication. Consistent with a positive role for Nu during replication, growth of UL29- or UL38 deficient viruses could not be rescued by treating cells with the deetyl inhibitor trichostatin. Transient expression of UL29 enhanced the CM majorearly promoter in a reporter assay regardless of UL expression. Importantly, induction of the majorearly reporter by UL29 required Nu components, consistent with inhibition of RNA within cells after knock of RBP and CH4. We propose that UL29 modifies the Nu complex to stimulate accumulation of early RNAs.
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a major cause of pneumonia among infants and young children. Here, we elucidated the antibody repertoire following RSV infection and its evolution through adolescence and adulthood. We used whole-genome fragment display libraries to identify linear and conformational epitopes in the RSV fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins. Epitope profiling of infant sera prior to and following RSV infection revealed modest changes in anti-F epitopes and a 100-fold increase in G-reactive epitopes spanning the N- and C-terminus of G ectodomain along with increased reactivity to conserved domain (CCD). Panels of F and G antigen sites were synthesized to evaluate sera from children (<2yr), adolescents (14–18yr) and adults (30–45yr) in real-time assays. A steady increase in RSV epitopes from children to adults was observed using peptides and proteins. Importantly, novel epitopes were identified in pre-fusion and immunodominant in F27. In all groups, antibody to preusion was 2–3 higher than postusion. For RSV, responses were high following infection in children but declined in adults using proteins or peptides.
Filariae are parasitic nematodes that cause diseases such as lymphatic filariasis and elephantiasis and river blindness in millions of people in tropical and sub-tropical countries. Current drugs are ineffective against adult filariae macrofilar. Emodeide, a veterinary anthelmint, has been reported to have macroilaridal effects. Here, we explore its mode of action on Brugia mal, a species causing lymphatic filariasis. Emide potently inhibits worm motility by activating voltage-gated potassium channels, with males being more sensitive than females. RNAi suggests emide targets S-1 channels. We expressed slo-1 isoforms with alternatively spliced exons at the RCK domain in Xenopus lavis oocytes. The slo-1 iso found in males is more sensitive to emide than slo-1a found in females. Selective RNAi of slo-1 in females increased emide potency. In Onchercavolus, causing river blindness, has two isoforms in females with homology to B-S-1 and B-F at R1. In silico modeling identified emide binding in same R1 of species affected by splicing. Our results show emide has potent macroidal effects and splicing in R1 affects potency.
The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) relies on rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to determine where mass drug administration for LF is required and when it can be stopped. These tests detect Wuchereria bancrofti glycoprotein in the blood of infected persons via a carbohydrate moiety recognized by monoclonal antibodies AD12 and DH.5. Recently, Loa loa cross-reactivity with RDTs has been recognized as a serious obstacle to LF elimination in Loa-endemic areas. To understand the nature of this cross-reactivity, we used DH. 5 to immunoaffinity purify Loa antigens from the sera of individuals with positive DT to Loa. Immunlot analysis revealed many AD/DH.5-reactive antigens and proteomic analysis identified multiple Lo proteins in RDT-positive Loa sera. These included secreted and somatic proteins, suggesting they may be released by Loa adult and/or microfilar. Unlike the high molecular W bancft circulating filarial antigen present in blood of persons bancft, Loa antigens appeared only transiently in blood of subset Loa.
Defects in primary cilia cause inherited disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Bied syndrome (BBS), affecting multiple physiological and developmental processes across organs. Cilia formation and function depend on intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is driven by kinesin-2 and IFT-dyne motors and regulated by the Bardet-Bied syndrome (BS) cargo adaptor complex, Bome. To identify new cilium-associated genes, we employed the nematode C. elegans, where ciliogenesis occurs within a short timespan during embryogenesis when sensory neurons differentiate. Using whole-organ RNA-Seq, we discovered a signature profile highly enriched for ciliary transcripts, including FAM161, CC104, and RP1, which are cilium-localised in worms. From 185 candidate ciliary genes, we identified orthologues of MAP, Y, CC149, and R28 as conserved cilium components. Further analyses of C elegans R-28, associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, reveal that this GTPase is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons where it associates with IFT. R-bound R-28 displays no I movement and diffuse localisation, GTP-activated R-28 concentrates at periliary membrane in Bome-dependent and undergoes bidirectional I. Functional analyses reveal that cilium, sensory and I are normal in rab-28 allele, overexpression of GDP or GTP variants R-28 perturbs cil and sensory morphogenesis.
The brain is able to represent the world around it, but it is unclear how it does this. The brain can only rely on neural responses and does not have independent access to external stimuli in order to “decode” those responses. We investigate what can be learned about the space of stimuli using only the action potentials (spikes ) of cells with stereotyped unknown receptive fields. Using hippocampal place cells as a model, we show that can (1) extract features of the environment and (2) construct an accurate representation of space up to an overall scale that can be used to track the animal’s position. Unlike previous approaches to reconstructing position from place activity, this is derived without knowing place fields or other relating neural responses to position. We find that knowing which groups of cells fire reveals a surprising amount of structure in the underlying space; this may enable the brain to construct its own representations.
Viral fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a severe disease with high mortality resulting from excessive inflammation in the liver. We show that wild-type mice infected with murine hepatitis virus-3 (MHV3), a model for FH, manifest severe disease and high mortality with significant elevation of IL-1β in serum and liver. In contrast, viral infection in IL-1 receptor deficient (IL-1R-/-) or IL-1 antagonist (IL-Ra) mice show reductions in virus replication, disease and mortality. IL-R deficiency appears to debilitate virus-induced fibrinogen-like protein-2 (FGL) production in macrophages and CD45+Gr1 neutrophil in liver. The release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by infected macrophages suggests plausible initiation of NLR3 inflamome activation. Further experiments show mice deficient p47phox, nicotin adenine dinucleotide (NPH) oxidase subunit controlling ROS production present reductions in NLR3 inflamome and IL-β secretion during viral. Deficiencies of NLR and Caspase-1, inflamome components also reduce IL-β along with ameliorated hepatitis.
Hookworm infections are an important causes of severe anemia and iron deficiency in children in the tropics. Ancylostoma duale and Necator american are the two species of hookworms that are associated with disease, but their prevalence and load are rarely assessed due to the limitations of current diagnostic methods. In this study, we used multiplex real-time PCR to evaluate the prevalence of hookworm species, their load, and their contribution to severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children in Malawi. We analyzed 830 fecal samples of pre-school children participating in a case-control study investigating severe anemia. Using multiplex real PCR, hook infections were found in 34.1% of severely anemic cases and 27.0% of non-severely anemic controls (p<0.05 ) whereas 5.6% hook prevalence was detected by microscopy. Prevalence of A duale and american was 26.1 and 4.9 respectively. Moderate and high Aduale infections were associated with severe anemia (adjusted odds ratio 2.49 95CI 1–5.33 and 9.04 95CI2–32. respectively ). Iron deficiency through bone examination was associated with intensity Adu infection (odds ratio 3.63 95CI1–11.16 and 16.98CI3–74 and 44.95CI5–385 for low, moderate, and high respectively ).
Successful completion of meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans requires the faithful repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) via either homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). However, only HR can generate the interhom crossovers (COs) needed for meiotic segregation. Here, we identify COM-1, the homolog of CtIPae2/Ctp, as a crucial regulator of DS repair choice during Caenorhabdisis gametogenesis. COM-deficient germ cells repair DS via the error-prone NHE pathway, resulting in lack of CO, chromosomal aberrations, and near-complete embryonic lethality. In contrast to its yeast counterparts, COM1 is not required for Spo11 initiation of meiotic DS repair but instead promotes meiotic recombination by counteracting the NHE complex. In fact, animals defective for both COM1 and Ku are viable and proficient in CO formation. Further genetic dissection reveals that COM acts parallel the nucleaseEX-1 to promote interolog HR at early pachene stage of meiotic prophase and safeguards CO formation. Both nucleases are dispensable for RAD51 recruitment late pach stage when hom-independent pathways predominate.
Infection with Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of meloidosis, leads to high mortality rates of pneumonia and sepsis in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. To characterize the humoral immune response to aerosol infection, we used an outbred goat model of meloidosis. Infection was induced by intratracheal aerosol delivery of B. pseudallei strain MSH511. Humoral immune responses were analyzed by ELISA and western blot, and antigenic proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Throughout the course of infection, we observed a greater humoral response with IgG antibodies in both breadth and quantity compared to IgM. Pre-infection sera showed multiple immunogenic proteins reactive for IgG ( 7–20 ) and IgM (0–12 ) in most goats despite no previous exposure to B.alle. After infection, the number of Ig reactive proteins increased as disease progressed. Early infection ( day 7 ) showed reaction to chaper proteins Gro, EFu, and DK. These proteins were detected in all samples after infection with Gro immunodominant. Seven reactive antigens were selected for further analysis by ELISA. Gro1 elicited the strongest antibody response compared to other antigens. Most antigens showed peak IgM reactivity at 14 whereas Ig increased as disease progressed.
Cyclin B–cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) is a key regulator of mitotic entry. It is activated by a positive feedback loop at the end of the G2 phase and is inactivated by the anaphase-promoting/cyclos–dependent destruction of cyclin B in metaphase, allowing mitotic exit and cell division. Several models describe C1 kinetics in mitosis, but experimental data on activation in mitotic cells are largely lacking. We used a novel approach to determine cyclin B–dk activity in single cells. By quantifying dephosphorylation of C1 and phosphorylation of C1 target anaphaseprom/clos, we disclose cyclin–dk continues after centros separation. Importantly, cytoplasmic cyclin–dk can be maintained when cyclin translocates to nucleus in prophase. These data are into a model describing cycl–dk in human, revealing a resemblance to bistable circuit. In line with kinetics cycl–dk levels to enter mitosis are lower than cycl–dk needed for mitotic.
HIV-1 superinfection (SI) has been shown to elicit a broader and more potent neutralizing antibody (Nab) response compared to single infection. However, it is unclear whether SI impacts epitope specificity and if the epitopes targeted after SI differ from those after single infection. Here, we examined post-SI responses from 21 Kenyan women exposed to HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and D and superinfected after a median of ~1. 07 years following initial infection. Plasma samples were collected at ~2. 72 years post-SI. We focused on 4 main epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope: the CD-binding site, V1/V glycan, N supersite in V3, and membrane proximal external gp41. Using epitope mapping techniques, we found that SI did not induce a dominant response to any of these epitopes in the women. Computational analyses suggested that 20 of 21 superinfected women’s responses could not be ascribed a single specificity with confidence.
Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a leading cause of neurological disorders in children worldwide. In this study, we report that CMV infection downregulates Hairy Enhancer of Split 1 (Hes) protein in human neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Hes is an important for NPC fate and brain development. CMV 72Da immediate-early 1 protein (IE1) is involved in Hes degradation by assembling a ubiquitination complex and promoting Hes ubiquitination as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase, followed by proteasomal degradation of Hes. SpA, a component of PML bodies, is another target of IE-mediated ubiquitination. The C-terminal region of IE (amino acids 451 to 475) is required for IE/Hes interaction and IE-mediated Hes ubiquination, but not for IE/SpA interaction and ubiquination.
Drosophila Embryos with Highly Conserved Gene Expression. We undertook a systematic study of transcription factor binding and expression in blasterm embryos of four Drosophila species: D. melanogaster, D. yak, D. pseudocura and D. vir. We compared gene expression, measured by mRNA-seq, to genome-wide binding, by ChIP-seq of four transcription factors involved in anterior-posterior patterning. We found that mRNA levels are better conserved than individual factor binding events, and changes in gene expression were poorly explained by changes in factor binding. However, highly bound sites in regions bound by multiple factors and near genes are conserved more frequently than other, suggesting that considerable binding is weak or non-functional and not subject purifying selection.
Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti that is transmitted by mosquitoes. In India, the National Programme for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis aims to eliminate the disease by 2015. Monitoring and evaluation of the programme require assessments at least one sentinel site in each implementation unit ( IU ) and transmission surveys ( TAS ) that assess antigenemia ( Ag ) in children that have completed at least five rounds of mass drug administration ( DA ) with >65% coverage and microfilaria ( M ) <1%. However, this process is likely to miss transmission “hot” sites and statistical assumptions for decision-making have not been validated. We conducted a large epidemiological study in two primary health centres in Thanjavur, India that had undergone eight rounds of DA. The survey covered >70% of 50,363 population and found 0.2% and 0.004 prevalence of M and Ag respectively. Corresponding values were 2.3 and 17.3 Ag-units. Ag prevalence ranged 0.7 to 0.9 in children 2–10 and 2.7 to 3.0 in adults. We identified “residual” M-preval ≥1 irrespective Ag-status in children and “transmission” at least one Ag-positive child during DA hotspots. Antigenemic persons were clustered at household and site. We identified Agval ∼1 in children equivalent 0.4 Mval as possible value stopping DA.
Dengue vector control is a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. The organophosphate larvicide temeph is one of the most commonly used methods to control deng vectors. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of temeph in controlling deng vectors and deng transmission. A comprehensive literature search was performed in 6 databases ( PubMed, WHOL, GIFT, CDS, EMB, Wiley ) and grey literature. 27 studies were included in this review (11 single intervention, 16 combined ). All single intervention studies showed temeph reduced entom indices. 11 of 16 combined studies showed temeph with other methods reduced entom indices, but this was not sustained in 5 studies. The effectiveness of temeph was dependent on factors such as delivery quality, water rate, type, debris, temperature and sunlight. Timing and reapplication, reluctance to drinking water, cost, supplies, time and labour were limitations. When applied as single, temeph suppressed entom indices, but not when combined with other interventions. There is no evidence that temeph reduces deng transmission.
The cohesin is a protein complex that holds sister chromatids together from the time of their duplication in S phase until their separation during mitosis. It is found along the length of chromosomes, but is most abundant at the centromere surrounding region, the pericentere. Here, we show that the budding yeast Ctf kinetore complex and the replication-associated factor C3 are both important for pericentric cohesion, but act through distinct mechanisms. The Ctf complex directs the association of cohes with the perentere, while C3 is dispensable for cohes enrichment in the perere but essential for its functionality in holding centromeres together. Consistently, cells lacking C3 show additive cohes defects with mutants in thetf complex. Furthermore, delaying DNA replication rescues the cohes defect in cells lackingtf components but not3.
Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common arbovirus with an estimated 100 million infections occurring every year in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Dengue fever/deng hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) is a major public health concern. To understand the underlying mechanisms of deng pathogenesis, we characterized the serum metabolome and lipidome of adult patients at early febrile, defervence, and convalescent stages of DENV infection. We used liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-masspectrometry to identify metabolite and lipid changes in a large sample size (n=44) across three infection stages. Sixty metabolites were identified in metabolomics and main classes were fatty acids, acylarnitines, phosphipids, and amino. Major perturbed pathways included fatty biosynthesis and oxidation, phosphid catabism, steroid, etc. suggesting multifactor nature of host responses. Analysis of phosphip and sphingip revealed trends and association with lymphocytes and platelets. These metabolites were perturbed early and normalized at convales stage, suggesting utility as prognostic markers. DENV causes temporally serumome and lipidome changes, many metabolites involved in inflammatory responses. Our analyses revealed anti-inflammatory working to modulate early-inflammatory, preventing host development of pathologies by excessive inflammation.
Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) research has increased in recent years, but significant gaps in diagnosis and treatment remain. We used bibliometric analysis to reveal research efforts and partnerships. We mapped NTD research networks in Germany and abroad to evaluate German contributions to NTD research. We searched the SCOPUS database for articles with German affiliations published between 2002 and 2012 for kinoplast and helminth diseases. We used Open tools for data cleaning (OpenRefine), geocoding (OpenMaps) and TableNet to visualise and analyse co-author networks (Gephi). From 26,833 publications we identified 1,187 (4.4%) with at least one German affiliation and processed 972 for five most published diseases. We extracted 4,007 authors and 863 institutions to construct co-author networks. Most co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries, Brazil. Collaborations with African countries were scattered. NTD research in Germany was distributed among 220 institutions. We identified strong performers on individual using parameters (publications, h-index) and network (between centrality). The network varied between diseases. The share of NTD publications with German affiliations is half of other medical fields. This underlines the need to identify and expand Germany’s strong activities towards NTD. Spatial analysis of collaborations abroad can support decisions to strengthen capacity in low-middle countries less involved than high. Identifying knowledge within networks complements indicators to identify opportunities.
Since 2000, Haiti has targeted lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) with a mass drug administration (MDA) program led by the Ministry of Public Health and its international partners. By 2012, Haiti’s neglected disease (ND) program had reached national scale with good epidemiological coverage to stop LF treatment almost throughout the country. Key to this success was how MDAs were implemented. These program elements included: community awareness through evidence-based multi-channel education facilitated by voluntary distributors; community trust by respected members recruited, trained, supervised, and motivated; directly observed treatment; easy access through numerous posts and strong supply; and quality data used to guide strategies. These strategies were effective: 100% coverage in 201, all districts above 65% for LF and 75% STH targets—and 45 communes reached LF treatment threshold. International support, especially past eight years, resulted in progress toward LF elimination and strong STH control.
In Sinorhizobium meli is an alphaproteobacterium that forms a symbiotic relationship with legume hosts and undergoes cellular differentiation within host cells. This differentiation results in genome amplification, cell elongation, and loss of reproductive capacity. Similar to Caulobacterus cresus, S. meli differentiation is linked to the cell cycle via the activity of the master regulator Ctr. We investigated the regulation and function of Ctr in S. meli and found that depletion of Ctr causes cell elongation and genome amplification. We also showed that cell regulated proteolytic degradation oftr is essential in S.i, suggesting a mechanism oftr depletion in differentiated bacteroids. Using ChIP and expression analysis, we found that S.i Ctr regulates similar processes as Ctr, but through different genes. For example, Ctr does not regulate the F complex to control cell division, but instead negatively regulates the sept-inhibiting system. Our findings provide insight into how conserved networks can evolve to fit diverse lifestyles.
Francisella tularens is a highly infectious bacterium that causes tularemia, a zoonotic disease. Its ability to multiply and survive in macrophages is critical for its virulence. By screening a bank of HimarFT transposon mutants of the F. tularens vaccine strain L, we identified a mutant in a gene encoding a putative glutamyl transpeptase. This mutant showed impaired intracellular multiplication and was attenuated virulence in mice. We present evidence that the glutyl transpease activity of F. tulns allows utilization of glutathione and glutamylcystylglycine as cystine sources for intracellular growth. This is the first demonstration of the role of a nutrient system in intracellular multiplication of F. tulns. Glutathione is the most abundant source of cystine in host cytos.
Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania alternate between flagellated, elongated extracellular promastigotes found in insect vectors and round-shaped amastigotes enclosed in phagolysosome-like Parasitoph Vacuoles (PVs) of mammalian host cells. Leish amazonensis amastotes occupy large PVs which may contain many parasites in contrast, amastotes of Leish major lodge in small PVs which undergo fission as parasites. To determine if PVs of Leish species can fuse with each other, macrophages in culture were infected with non-fluorescent Le amazonensis amastotes, 48 h later superinfected with fluorescent L majorastig or promig. Fusion was investigated by time-lapse acquisition of living cells and inferred from colocalization of parasites of two species in same PVs. Survival, multiplication and differentiation of parasites that did not share same vacoles were also investigated.
Vaccine-elicited Tier 2 HIV-1 Neutralizing Antibodies Bind to Quatern Epitopes Involving Glycan-Deficient Patches Proximal to the CD Binding Site  
Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) are a major goal of HIV-1 vaccine research. Here, we investigated the ability of native membrane-expressed JRFL Env trimers to elicit nAbs. Usually potent nAb titers developed in 2 of 8 rabbits immunized with virus-like particles (VLP) expressing trimers (trimer VLP) and 1 of 20 immunized with DNA expressing Env trimer followed by protein (DNAimer). All sera neutralized quatern epitopes and exploited gaps in the glycan defenses of the conserved region of JRFL gp120. Specifically, trimerLP took advantage of the absence of glycan residue 197 present in 98.7% Envs. Removing the 197 glycan with loss of tier 2 phenotype rendered 50 or 16.7% (18) clade 2 isolates sensitive to trLP sera.
Buruli ulcer (BU) is a chronic skin and subcutaneous infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. While antibiotic treatment with rifampicin and streptomycin has improved outcomes and reduced recurrence rates, management of extensive lesions after successful therapy remains a challenge, particularly in rural African countries with the highest disease burden. We performed immunohistochemical investigations to identify markers for wound healing progression. We analyzed tissue specimens from eight BU patients with plaque lesions before and after chemotherapy by immunohistochemistry for markers of connective tissue neoformation, remodeling, and epidermal activation. Several proteins were suitable to monitor wound healing. α-smooth muscle actin positive myofiblasts were not present in untreated lesions but emerged during healing. These cells produced extracellular matrix proteins such as pro-collagen and tenascin and were found in fibronectin rich areas. After treatment, cells including myoflasts showed activated phenotype with ribosomal S6 phosphorylation, a marker for initiation. In addition, wounds showed dermal remodeling by apoptosis and increased cytokeratin 16 in epidermis.
Mitochondrial transport is a critical for the bioenergetic homeostasis of all cells. In neurons, high energy expenditure occurs at remote from the cell body due to the length of axons and variability of impulse activity. Mitochondria must be positioned at areas of high energy demand. We studied mitochondrial trafficking in resting and electrically active axons in vivo using confocal imaging of saphous nerves in anaestised mice. We show that low frequency electrical stimulation increases anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial traffic in myelinated and unmyinated axons. High frequency stimulation (50 Hz ) increases anterog but not retrograde traffic by increasing mobile mitochondria and velocity. Capsaicin increases traffic in both myinated and uninated axons. Mitochondria in conducting at higher frequency become shorter, supplying the population through fission. Mitria recruited do not accumulate at Nodes of Ranvier but continue anterograde.
Spondyndylocarparsal synostosis (SCT) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive vertebral fusions caused by loss of function mutations in Filamin B (FLNB). FLNB acts as a scaffold linking the actin cytoskeleton to signal transduction systems. Employing Fln knockout mouse, we found morphologic and molecular evidence that intervertebral discs (IVDs) of Fln–/–ice undergo rapid and progressive degeneration during postnatal as result abnormal cell changes in IVD, the annulus fibros (AF). In Fln––ice, AF cells lose typical fibroblast characteristics and acquire molecular phenotypic signature hypertrophic chondrocy. This is characterized hallmarks endochondral ossification including alterations in matrix, Collagen X, increased apoptosis, inappropriate ossification tissue. We show conversion AF into chrocy coincident upregulated TGF signaling via Smad/3 and BMP induced p38 as well sustained canonical noncanonical genes p21 Ctg.
Viruses have evolved a wide range of mechanisms to evade antiviral immune responses. Here, we describe a novel mechanism of immune evasion by the orthomyxirus Thog virus (THOV) through its ML protein, which targets the general transcription factor TFI. TFI is depleted from the nucleus and relocalized to the cytoplasm. Although this would be expected to broadly affect gene expression, only a limited number of genes are affected. Our data indicate that TFI is critical for de novo recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to promoters and that TFI is not required for regulated expression from paused promoters. Since many immune genes require de novo recruitment of Pol, targeting TFI by TH represents a mechanism to affect immune responses while keeping other transcriptional activities intact.
Human parvovirus B19 (B19) infection of primary erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) causes cell cycle arrest at both in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. B19 infection induces a DNA damage response (DDR) that facilitates viral replication but is not required for cell cycle arrest at G2; however, a putative C-terminal activation domain (TAD) within NS1 is responsible for G2 arrest. To understand the mechanism of B19 NS-induced G2 arrest, we established doxycine-inducible B19-permissive UT/E-S cell lines that express NS or NSmT2 and examined the function of T2 during G arrest. The results confirm that NS T2 plays a role in NS-induced G arrest. Mechanistically, NS activated cellular expression through T, which was responsible for ATR activation. Activated A phosphorylated CDC25 at serine, which inactivated cyclin/CDK without affecting nuclear import. Importantly, we found the ATR-CHK-CDC-CDK pathway was activated during B19 infection of PCs and A played a role in B19-induced G arrest.
Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most medically important mosquito-borne viruses, causing a spectrum of disease ranging from uncomplicated to life-threatening disease, characterized by endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage. Previous studies have shown that DENV nonstructural protein 1 ( NS ) induces endothelial hyperperability in a mouse and human endothelial cells, where NS disrupts the endothelial glycocalyx layer. Here, we investigated the relative contributions of inflammatory mediators and endothelial-intrinsic pathways. In vivo, we demonstrated that DENV NS but not closely-related West Nile virus NS triggers vascular leak in the dermis of wild-type C57/6 mice. In vitro, we showed that human dermal endothelial cells exposed to DENV do not produce inflammatory cytokines ( TN-α, IL-6, IL-8 ) and blocking these cytokines does not affect D NS-induced endothelial hyperability. Further, we demonstrated that D NS induces vascular in TLR- or TN- receptor-deficient mice similar to wild animals. Finally, we blocked D NS-induced vascular using inhibitors involved in glycocal disruption.
In budding yeast, the first step towards cytokinesis is the assembly of a septin ring at the site of bud emergence. The integrity of this ring is essential for proper cytokinesis, spindle positioning and the spindle checkpoint (SC). The SC delays mitotic exit and cytokinesis until the anaphase spindle is properly aligned with the division axis. SC requires the Kin4 protein and the Kin4-regulating Elm kinase, which also controls septin dynamics. Here, we show that the ubiquitin ligases Dma1 and Dma2 control septin dynamics and SC by promoting the recruitment of Elm to the bud. Indeed, dma1 dma2 mutant cells show reduced Elm at the bud and Elm-dependent Kin4 activation. Artificial recruitment of Elm to the bud of same cells is sufficient to re-establish normal septin, spindle positioning and proficient SC in dma2 cells.
Adaptations to Climate-Med Selective Pressures in Humans  
Humans inhabit a wide range of environments, and natural selection has likely played a central role in their capacity to survive and thrive in extreme climates. Here, we scan the human genome for signals of selection by identifying SNPs with strongest correlations between allele frequencies and climate across 61 worldwide populations. We find a striking enrichment of genic and nonsynonymous SNPs relative to non-genic SNPs among those strongly correlated with climate variables. Among extreme signals, several overlap with GWAS, including SN associated with pigmentation and autoimmune diseases. We find strong signals in gene sets related to UV, infection, and cancer. Our results imply that climate shaped spatial variation in humans.
Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by an abbreviated QT interval and increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death. This study identifies arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr)-linked SQT1 variant. Markov chain (MC) models were found to be superior to Hodgkin-Hux (HH) models in reproducing experimental data effects of the N588 mutation on KCNH-encoded hERG channel. These ionic models were incorporated into ventricular action potential (AP) models and 1D and 2 idealized and realistic transmural ventricular simulations into 3D anatomical. In single models, the N588 mutation abbreviated ventricular AP duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) and maximal transm voltage heterogeneity (V) during AP. This resulted in transm heterogeneity of AP90 and the effective refractory period (ERP) that are anticipated to be anti-arrhythmic rather than pro-arrhyth. However, with consideration of transm heterogeneity IKr in the tissue based the Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Pfil ventricular model, only the N588 mutation led to QT shortening and increases in T-wave, but V was found to be augmented in some regions ventricular tissue, resulting in increased vulnerability uni-directional conduction and predisposing to reentrant excitation. In 2 and 3D models, the N588 facilitated reentrant excitation due the reduced size necessary sustaining re-entry. Thus, S1 the N588-hERG mutation facilitates ventricular excitation, increasing lifespan reentrant waves and stability 3D tissue.
Collective behavior of zebraf (Danio rerio) has been studied using a variety of simple models. These models can be insightful but lack important elements to predict the motion of each individual in the collective. Here, we report that deep networks can obtain a model of collective behavior that is simultaneously predictive and insightful thanks to organization in modules. Using simulated trajectories, the model recovers the ground-truth rule used to generate them, as well as the number of interacting neighbours. For experimental trajectories of large groups of 60 zraf, the model obtains that interactions between pairs can be described as repulsive or attractive, but only when moving slowly. At high velocities, interactions correspond to alignment or mixed repulsion at close distances. The model shows that each zraf decides to move by aggregating information from the group as a weighted average over neighbours. Weights are higher for neighbours that are close, in collision or moving in frontal and lateral locations. The network extracts that the number of interacting is typically in the range 8–22, with 1– more important ones.
HIV drug resistance is a major threat to the long-term efficacy of antiretroviral treatment. Around 10% of ART-naïve patients in Europe are infected with drug-resistant HIV-1. To understand the dynamics of drug resistance, we employ a phylodynamic approach to quantify the fitness of major mutations in the Swiss cohort. The phylogeny reflects the transmission tree, which we model using stochastic birth–death processes with two types: hosts by sensitive or resistant strains. The fitness is quantified as the ratio of transmission rates of hosts by resistant strains and transmission of hosts by sensitive strains. The mutations 41, 67, 70, 184, 210,215,215, and 219 (RT-related ) and 103,108,138,181,190 (NNI ) in reverse transcriptase and 90 in protease are included. The 90 mutation in protease was found to have higher fitness than sensitive strains. The mutations associated with reverse transcriptase inhibitors were less fit than sensitive: 67,70,184,219. The posterior intervals for remaining mutations included 1, suggesting no effect on transmissibility. These patterns are consistent with alternative measures of fitness.
Elongator is a protein complex that interacts with RNA polymerase II and histone acetyltransferase Sin3/El3. Cells lacking Elong subunits display transcription defects. However, Elong also modifies tRNAs to modulate translation efficiency. We show that Sin/3El3 is important for oxidative stress survival. The transcription program governed by Sty1-Atf1-Pcr is affected in mutant cells, but not severely. Cells lacking Sin3/3 cannot modify uridine wobble nucleoside of tRNAs and other tRNA activities such as Ctu-C2 are essential for normal H2O2 tolerance. A plid overexpressing tRNAALUU complements stress phenotypes of Sin3El3 mutant. We show that H2-dependent genes, including Atf and Pcr, are highly expressed mRNAs with lysine codons. Their mRNAs are poorly translated in Sin3El3 or C2 cells, whereas mutatedf1 with AAG codons is translated in all backgrounds. Our study shows that lack of Elong results in stress phenotypes due to tRNA modification and translation of stress-induced mRN.
HIV-1 Nef is a viral protein required for sustained replication in vivo and progression to AIDS. We investigated the mechanism by which Nef increases the infectivity of cell-free virions and found a link between Nef and Env. Since Nef had no effect on the quantity of virion-associated Env, we searched for qualitative changes by examining whether Nef alters HIV-1 sensitivity to agents that target distinct Env. We found that Nef conferred as much as 50-fold resistance to 2F and 4, two potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) that target the membrane-proximal region (MP) of gp41. In contrast, N had no effect on HIV-1 neutralization by MP-specific Ab Z13, nor by peptide T20, nor a panel of Abs and reagents targeting gp120. Resistance to neutralization by 2 and 4 was observed with N from diverse HIV and SIV isolates, as well as HIV-1 virions bearing Env from CCR- and CXCR-tropic viruses, B and C viruses or primary isolates. Functional analysis of N mutants revealed this activity requires N myristoylation but is separable from other Nef functions such as enhancing infectivity and downregulating CD4. Glycosylatedag from MoV substituted N in conferring resistance 2 and 4, indicating this is conserved in retroirus that does not encode N.
The liver fluke Opisthorchis vivini is the causative agent of cholangiocarcinoma (CA) in the Greater Mekong subregion of Thailand. The snail Bithia siam gomphos is the intermediate host of O. vivini. Despite the severe public health impact of OCA, little is known about the molecular interactions between the parasite and snail host. We used high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analyses to characterize the transcriptomes of uninfected and O vivini-infected B. gomphos. We identified 7,655 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), associated with 43 biological pathways, including immune mechanisms against parasites. Among DEGs with immune functions, protease transcripts were downregulated in B infected by O ; conversely, heat shock and actin transcripts were upregulated in infected snails compared to uninf counterparts.
Leishmaniasis is a major public health issue in Brazil and the pathophysiological mechanisms are still incompletely understood. We investigated the role of complement receptor 1 ( CR ) in susceptibility to leishmaniasis. CR binds complement fragments C3/C4 deposited on mycobacteria, mediating its entrance into macrophages. We investigated CR polymorphisms, gene expression and soluble CR levels in a case-control study with leishmanis patients. Nine polymorphisms were hapyped by multiplex PCR-SS in 213 leishman patients (47% multibacillary ) and 297 controls. mRNA levels were measured by qPCR and CR by ELISA in 80 samples. Individuals with the most common haplotype harboring rs926*T in intron 21 and rs700*T in exon 26 presented higher susceptibility to leishmanis (OR=2.43, p=0.017 ). Paibacillary patients with these variants presented lower CR levels, reducing anti-inflammatory response (p=0.040 and =0.046 ). Furthermore, the most hapotype increased susceptibility to multibacillary form (OR=3.04 p=0.01 ) and presented intronic rs343*G allele which was associated higher expression (p.043 ) probably increasing internalization of parasite.
Sexual dimorphisms in Metabolic and Genetic Biomarkers: A Study of Sex-Specific Metabolite Concentrations and Their Genetic Determination. Metabolomics and whole-genome association has proven to be a powerful tool to comprehensively explore gene networks and investigate effects of variation at the molecular level. Metabolite concentrations allow a readout of biological processes and association of metabolite signatures with diseases such as Alzheimer’s and metabolic disorders has shown correlations between sex incidence, prevalence, age onset, symptoms, and reaction to drugs. This study investigated sex differences of metabolite concentrations and underlying determination. We used more than 3, 300 individuals from KORA F with metabolite measurements of 131 including amino acids, phosphatidolines, sphingomyins, acylcarnines and C-sug. Linear approach revealed differences between males and females for 102 out of 131 metabolites ( p<3.8×10−4; Bonerr-corrected ). Sex genome-wide association (GW) showed genome differences beta-estimates SNPs in CPS locus (carbamylphosphate 1 significance: <3.8×10−10; Bonerr-correct ) glyc. We showed metabolite profiles males and females are different, genetic in metabolism genes depict sexual.
Genome-scale metabolic networks provide a framework for modeling genotype-phenotype relationships through flux simulations. However, the solution space of the metabolic state of the cell is very large and optimization approaches are necessary for predicting the metabolic state under specific conditions. The objective used in such algorithms is linked to the biological hypothesis underlying the model and is one of the parameters for successful modeling. We show that the optimization is sensitive to stoichiometry of the network. This leads to different results using numerically but biochemically equivalent stoichiometries and makes interpretation ambiguous. We propose Minimization of Metabolites (MiBl), which decouples stoichiometry from formulation of functions by using metabolites rather than fluxes. By simulating perturbed networks we demonstrate that stoichiometry independent is for unambiguously linking results with interpretation.
Plague is a highly virulent, re-emerging disease that has been studied scarcely in Africa. In Madagascar, human seropreval data suggest that plague spreads heterogeneously across the landscape as a function of relief. As plague is primarily a disease of rodents, we investigated the relationship between disease distribution and population structure of the black rat, Rattus rattus, the main reservoir of plague in Madagascar. We conducted a comparative study of seropreval and genetic ( microsatellite ) in rat populations from four geographic areas differing in topology, each about 150–200 km within the Madagas plague focus. Seropreval levels in rat populations mimicked those reported for humans. Rat populations displayed more genetic structure with relief. However, serreval data and genetic differed between areas, suggesting plague distribution not related to rat dispersal. Genetic estimates suggested plague had weak impact on rat sizes.
Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic worm that maintains long-term intravascular residence in the definitive host through a unique anatomical adaptation called the heptalam-covered syncytial tegument. Recent studies have identified a number of novel tegument surface proteins, including SmLyA, SmB, and Sm29, which contain u/Ly domains. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the Schosoma mansoni Ly family (SmLyA-K) and extend the number of members to eleven, including three novel proteins. We provide evidence that Sm29, renamed Sm6, is a unique u/Ly domain-containing protein. All SmLy proteins are predicted to be surface-bound by the presence of cysteine residues, signal peptides, and GPI sites. We report IgG, IgA, and IgE responses to two surface-bound Sm6 members, SmA and SmB, in a cohort of S mansoni-infected Ugandan males before and after prazantel treatment. Pre-treatment IgG prevalence for SmA and SmB differs amongst the population (7. 4% and 25.3%, respectively ), but is higher than IgG for sub-surface antigen SmAL. Post-treatment Ig levels for SmA and Sm significantly drop compared to Ig for suburface SmAL. These results expand the number of SmLy proteins and demonstrate that surface SmA and SmB elicit immunological responses during infection in endemic communities.
Cells in the Drosophila retina have well-defined morphologies that are attained during tissue morphogenesis. We present a computational model of epithelial tissue in which the interfacial energy between cells is minimized. Experimental data for both normal and mutant cells lacking or misexpressing the adhesion protein cadherin can be explained by a model incorporating features of morphogenesis. The model includes the timing of cadherin expression in cells and its relationship to remodeling cell contacts. The simulations reproduce wild-type and mutant cell geometries, features of cadin dynamics and emphasize the importance of adhesion protein and its timing with respect to remodeling. The simulations indicate cadin protein is recycled from inactive to active interfaces thereby modulating adhesion between cells.
MT-M is a potent protease that promotes cancer cell invasion by degrading the extracellular matrix (ECM) at invadopodia. However, the rate of MT-M turnover and its contribution to ECM degradation at invadodia were unclear. To address this, we performed FRAP experiments with tagged MT-M at invadop and found rapid recovery approximated by double-exponential plots with time constants 26 s and 259. Recovery depended on vesicle transport but not diffusion. We constructed a computational model based on FR kinetics and it reproduced FR experiments. Inhibiting ves transport experimentally and in simulation blocked ECM degradation and showed no appreciable degradation under inhibiting transport. The degree of reduction in ECM degradation depended on MT-M turnover. Our experiments and simulations established the role of rapid MT turnover in ECM degradation invadia. Furthermore, simulations suggested synergistic contributions of proteolytic activity and MT turnover to degradation because there was nonlinear reduction in degradation when both factors were reduced. Our model provides a tool to design intervention in cancer invasion.
HIV-1 is a retrovirus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans. The process by which drug-resistant HIV-1 arises and spreads within an infected individual is not well understood. Most studies have found that HIV-1 in the blood differs from virus in other tissues, but have conflicting results about whether HIV-1 is homogeneously distributed throughout the body. To understand how drug resistance spreads within a host and how structure impacts emergence, we examined sequences from macaques infected with RT-SHm027, a sim immunodeficiency virus encoding HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, treated with RT inhibitors. We isolated viral DNA and RNA from blood, lymph nodes, gut, and vagina at four time points and characterized via single-genome sequencing. Our results reveal a dynamic system in which RNA rapidly acquires drug resistance across compartments through multiple mutations. The same genotypes are present across compartments but do not equilibrate immediately. Blood and lymph are compartmentalized, while blood and lymph are more different from mucosal tissues. Our findings suggest that sampled blood does not capture viral dynamics in other parts of body, especially gut where RNA was faster than plasma and retained fewer wild-type viruses than other compartments.
Tissue morphogenesis is the process by which tissues acquire their shape and form during development. It is a complex process that involves cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and patterning. Here, we explore the role of feedback in morphogenesis. We use mathematical modeling to show that a particular type of feedback in which both positive and negative diffusible signals act on stem and progenitor cells leads to a range of morphogenetic behaviors. These include bistable or bi-modal growth, ultrasensitivity to external cues, growth-driven budding, self-sustaining elongation, and triggering of self-organization in the form of lamellar structures. These behaviors arise not through regulation of cell cycle speed, but through control of stem and progenitor self-renewal. The spatial patterns that arise in this setting are the result of interactions between diffusible factors with antagonistic effects, but morphogenesis is not the consequence of Turing-type instabilities.
Myopia, or nearsightedness, is the most common eye disorder resulting from elongation of the eye. We report the largest genome-wide association study to date on myopia in Europeans (45, 771 participants ). We performed survival analysis on age of myopia onset and identified 22 significant associations, 10 of which replicate earlier associations with refractive error. Ten of the 20 novel associations replicate in a separate cohort of 8,323 participants who developed myopia before age 10. These associations explain 2.9% of variance in myopia age onset and point toward different mechanisms behind my development.
The role of curvature feedback in the energetics and dynamics of lamprey swimming: A-loop model. The lamprey has a central pattern generator ( CPG ) circuit that activates locomotion and adjusts to sensory inputs from the environment. The CPG is crucial for responding to perturbations, but also active during unperturbed swimming and influences the swimming pattern. This study investigates different forms of body-based feedback and their effects on swimming energetics and kinematics. The CPG is modeled as chains of coupled oscillators, with pairs representing left and right sides of the lamprey body. These activate muscles and move the lamprey through a Navier-Stokes simulated environment. The emergent body curvature serves as input to the oscillators, closing the loop. Two forms of feedback are considered, consistent with experimental results on lamprey sensory receptors. Directional feedback excites or inhibits oscillators on the same side, opposite on the other, depending on a gain. It does not affect frequency, but changes duration of activity. Magnitude feedback provides a symmetric effect on both sides, increasing frequency and reducing energetic cost when gain is high. Both feedback have similar curvature magnitude.
In Africa, HIV epidemics are typically dominated by a single viral subtype, indicating a strong founder effect. We hypothesized that competition between strains at the epidemic level may favor the strain that first colonized a population, slowing the invasion of new strains and diversification of the epidemic. We developed a stochastic framework to simulate HIV epidemics over contact networks. We simulated epidemics in which a second strain was introduced into a population where the first strain had established a steady state, assessing whether and on what scale the second spread in the population. Simulations were based on empirical data and tested scenarios with varying prevalence. The second strain spread on a slower scale than the first. With equal transmission efficiency, the second was unable to invade on a relevant time scale for the HIV pandemic. To become dominant over decades, the second needed >25% advantage in transmission over the first. The effect was weaker if second introduced while first in growth phase. We tested mechanisms of interference ( inhibition, superinfection, depletion of hubs, one-time peak infectious ) and confirmed a strong first advantage in HIV competition at the level. This may explain the global phyloge of the virus and influence the evolution of the pandemic.
The organization of muscle tissue is a complex process that spans multiple length scales, from the sarcomere to the muscle bundle. To address this multiscale problem, it is possible to constrain muscle cells in microenvironments that potentiate the organization of their intracellular space. We hypothesize that boundary conditions in the extracellular space potentiate the organization of cytoskeletal scaffolds for sareregenesis. We developed a quantitative model of the cytoskeleton of neonatal ventricular myocytes with respect to geometric cues in the extracellular. Numerical results in vitro assays control myocyte indicated that cytoskeletal architectures arise from tempor-ordered processes: interaction between actin,myofibrils and focalions as well as cooperative and bundling of nasmyofibr.
Wolbachia is a symbiotic bacterium that is being tested as a biocontrol agent to reduce dengue transmission. It can invade and infect wild mosquito populations, but requires high maternal transmission rate, strong cytoplasmic incompatibility and low host fitness costs to do so. However, differences in climate, field protocols, urbanization and human density amongst sites where Wolbach has been deployed have limited comparison of its invasive potential. We characterized the phenotypic effects of Wolbach in Aedes aegypt mosquitoes with Brazilian background to understand its invasive potential. We show that Wolbach causes cytoplasm incompatibility, high maternal transmission rate and no detrimental effect on host fecundity or fertility. Next, we examined the effects of urban landscapes on mosquito survival using Wolbach-infected mosquitoes in two Rio de Janeiro areas where Wolbach will be deployed. We characterized mosquito populations in relation to socio-demographic conditions at sites and three future areas. We constructed models using laboratory and field data to describe the influence of urban conditions on Wolbach infection reaching 100% following release. We predict successful invasion at all sites, however conditions vary greatly and are influenced by local population size.
Histone lysine methylation is an important epigenetic modification that regulates chromatin structure and gene expression. Histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation, which can be mono, di- or trimethylated, has been shown to play a role in gene expression involved in plant development and stress. However, the mechanism of this epigenetic modification is not fully understood. In this work, we identified JMJ, a histone lysine demethylase that reverses all forms of H3K in rice. Loss-of-function of the gene affected stem elongation and growth, which may be related to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase genes in mutant.
The HIV-1 capsid is a multifunctional protein that plays a central role in all steps of the viral life cycle from reverse transcription to integration and is a target for multiple host and pharmacologic ligands. However, structural studies have been limited to the capsid monomer ( CA ) and the mechanistic basis for how these ligands influence infection is not well understood. Here we show that a multi-subunit interface formed within hexamers mediates binding to linear epitopes within cellular cofactors NUP and CPS6 and is competed by antiretrovirals PF74 and BI-2. Each ligand is anchored via a phenylalanine-glycine ( FG ) motif to a pocket within the N-terminal domain of monomer and BI-2 also makes interactions across N-terminal: C-terminal (NTDCT) interface to second monomer. Dissociation of hexamer into monomers prevents high affinity interaction with CPS6 and abolishes binding NUP. The interface is conformationally dynamic but binding NUP or CPS is accommodated only one conformation. N and CPS have overlapping sites but each makes unique interactions when mutated selectively perturb cof dependency.
The Aedes aegypt is a mosquito species that transmits many important human arboviruses, including dengue fever and chikungunya. Its genome has been difficult to assemble due to its large size and many repetitive sequences, resulting in 4, 758 scaffolds, few of which have been assigned to chromosomes. To map genes affecting disease transmission, we improved the genome assembly by scoring SNPs in recombinant progeny from a cross between two Ae. aegyti strains and generated a genetic map. This revealed a high rate of misassemblies in the current genome, where sequences from different chromosomes were on the same scaffold. Once corrected, we assigned 60% of the genome to chromosomes and ordered scaffolds along chromosomes. We found large regions of suppressed recombination around centromeres, extending up to 47% of chromosome. We mapped a gene making Ae.egti resistant to Brugia malayi and listed candidate genes affecting the trait.
Aedes aegypt, the primary vector of dengue chikunya and yellow fever viruses, is an important target of vector control programs in tropical countries. We report the results of a multicentric entomological survey using four types of traps, besides larval survey, to compare entomological indices generated by different surveillance tools in terms of sensitivity to detect mosquito density variation. The study was conducted in five cities representing tropical climate variations. Surveillance using traps for adults ( BG-Sent, Adul and MosquiAP ) or eggs ( ovaps ) was applied to 1 km2 areas per city. Simultaneously, larval surveys were performed. Positivity and density in each area were regressed against meteorological variables to characterize the seasonal pattern of infestation in all cities, measured by each trap. The Index was low in most cities with median 0. Traps rarely produced null, indicating greater sensitivity in detecting Ae.egypt compared to lar survey. Positivity tended to plateau at high densities. Despite this, both indices agreed on seasonality of abundance in all cities. Mosquito seasonality associated with temperature than precipitation in areas with small temperature variation. All traps performed better than Index in measuring seasonal variation abundance and should be considered complements or alternatives to lar surveys.
Human cytidine deaminase APOECG3 (AG) is a potent inhibitor of retroviruses and transposable elements that deaminates cytidines to urines in single-stranded DNA replication intermediates. AG contains two cytidine deaminase domains (CDs), of which only the C-terminal one is known to mediate cyidine deamination. We show that tyrosine-124 and tryptan-127 within the enzymatically inactive N-terminal CD mediate AG oligomer, and this coincides with packaging into HIV-1 virions. AG oligization is also shown to be RNA-dependent. Homology of AG onto A2 template indicates accumulation of positive charge in putative dimer interface. Substitution of arginine residues 24, 30, and 136 resulted in reduced virion packaging and oligization. AG associated less efficiently with cellular RNA.
Quantitative trait loci (QTL) are important for many agriculturally, evolutionarily, and medically important characters. However, the genes and sequence variants accounting for this variation are largely unknown due to biological and technical challenges. Drosophila melanogaster has high levels of sequence variation and linkage disequilibrium, allowing us to dissect the effects of causative variants within a single locus. Here, we identify and characterize polymorphisms that comprise major Q alleles segregating at the bric-br locus. We show that bric-br alleles with large effects on cuticular pigmentation reflect a cumulative impact of polymorphisms affecting three regions: a promoter, a tissue-specific enhancer, and Polycomb response. Analysis of allele-specific expression at bric-br confirms polymorph modulate transcription at cis-regulatory level.
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus ) is a persistent cause of invasive mucosal disease in humans despite the use of antibiotics and vaccines. The organism’s resilience is due to its capacity for adaptation through uptake and incorporation of genetic material from the surrounding microbial community. DNA uptake and recombination is controlled by a regulated quorum sensing system triggered by extracellular accumulation of competence stimulating peptide (CSP). We demonstrate that CSP stimulates production of diverse bacteriocins. This occurs through increased production and secretion of bacterioc pherone BlC and requires functional competence system. A conserved motif in promoter of operon encoding BlC mediates upregulation by CSP. Accumulation of BlC following CSP stimulation results in activation of entire locus. Using biofilm organisms as model for competition and genetic exchange on mucosal surface, we demonstrate DNA is enhanced by bacterioc secretion suggesting co-stimulation bacterioc with competence provides adaptive advantage.
During poliovirus infection of neuroblastoma cells, the cellular protein SR20 (SRp20) relocalizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and partially co-localizes with the protein PC2 (PCBP) in the cytoplasm of infected cells. SR20 is associated with PC2 bound to polirus RNA in extracts from infected cells, indicating that this interaction occurs on the viral RNA. We generated a mutated version of SR20 lacking the RNA recognition motif (SR20ΔM) and found that this protein localizes similarly to full length SR20 and partially co-localizes with PC2 during polirus infection. Expression of this mutated SR20 results in a ∼100 fold decrease in polirus yield compared to wild type SR20, possibly via a dominant negative effect.
The neural crest (NC) is a population of embryonic stem cells that gives rise to numerous cell types, including glia and neurons of the peripheral and enteric nervous systems and melanocytes of the skin and hair. Mutations in genes and genetic pathways regulating NC development lead to a spectrum of developmental disorders collectively called neurocristopathies. We established an N-ethyl-nitrosurea (ENU) mutagenesis screen in a mouse model sensitized for NC defects, Sox10ac/+. Out of 71 pedigrees analyzed, we identified four heritable loci, modifier of Sox expression 1–4 (m1–4), which altered NC patterning. In homozygous m1 embryos Sox10ac expression is absent in cranial ganglia, cran nerves and sympathetic chain; however, development of Sox-expressing cells unaffected by mutation. Linkage analysis, sequencing, complement testing confirmed m1 is new allele receptor tyrosine kinase Erbb3, Er3m1 that carries single amino acid in extracellular protein. The ENU mutation does not alter expression, however is sufficient impair ER3 such that embryonic defects in resemble null alleles.
Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic flatworm that causes schistosomiasis, a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. Infection intensity and prevalence are influenced by factors such as environment, behaviour, immunology, and genetics. However, human populations are heterogeneous, making it difficult to distinguish between lack of cercarial exposure and reduced susceptibility to infection. This study investigates risk factors for S. mansoni infection in a rural Ugandan fishing community. We examine the influence of age, sex, and ethnicity on susceptibility to reinfection after anthelmintic treatment. We use estimates of cercarial exposure and multivariable methods to remove environmental and behavioural heterogeneities. We investigate whether schistosome IgE responses account for remaining susceptibility to rein. Our findings suggest ethnic and sex variations in S. mansoni rein are due to cercarial exposure, not biological susceptibility. Age differences in rein are not explained by exposure, but linked to IgE and IgG to tegument antigen SmAL. This study highlights the benefit of a multidisciplinary approach in field settings, allowing population ecology to be understood and robust conclusions to be made.
The present study investigated the correlation between the number of eggs per gram of feces (EPG) and the worm burden of Clonorchis sinensis in humans. A total of 50 egg-positive and 10 egg-negative residents in Sanche-gun, Korea participated in the study from 2006–2009. They were diagnosed by egg positivity in feces using the Kato-Katz method. After administration of prazantel, they were purged with cathartics and adult worms were collected from feces. EPG ranged from 0 to 65, 544. Adult C. sin were collected from 17 egg cases, ranging from 1 to 114 in each. A positive correlation between EPG and numbers was demonstrated (r=0.681, P<0.001 ). Recovery rates were 9.7% in EPG 1–1,000 and 73.7% in EPG over 1,000. No were detected from egg-negative subjects. Maximum count per worm day was roughly 3,770 in subject EPG 2,664 106 collected.
Antifungal drug resistance is a growing concern that requires the development of novel therapeutics or combination therapy. Current combination therapies are based on drug mode of action and resistance mechanisms, limiting the number of targets. We implemented an unbiased genome-wide screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing a Candida glabr P1 gain-of-function allele, which mediates fluconazole resistance in the human pathogen. Eighteen synthetically lethal S cerevisiae mutants were identified in cells expressing glabr P1. One mutant lacking histone acetylase G5 was further investigated. Deletion or drug inhibition of G5 caused lethal in glabr cells expressing P1 alleles. Moreover, deletion or drug inactivation of G5 inhibited emergence of fluazole-resistant glabr isolates in evolution experiments.
Poliovirus (PV) is a positive-strand RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm of host cells. During PV infection, membranes are observed to contain phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), which appears as vesicular in cross-sections. However, the induction and remodeling of PI4 membranes prior to or concurrent with genome replication has not been well studied. Here, we used two PV mutants, EG and GG, which exhibit aberrant proteolytic processing of P3 precursor that delays the onset of genome replication and impairs virus assembly to illuminate the pathway of PV-induced membranous structures formation. In wild-type (WT) PV, changes in the PI pool were observed as early as 30 min post-infection. PI remodeling occurred even in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, a replication inhibitor, and was accompanied by formation of tubules throughout the cytoplasm. Vesicular clusters appeared in perinuclear region of cell at 3 h postinfection, too slow for these structures to be responsible for replication delays in genome. Delays in onset of genome replication for EG and GG were similar to delays in virus-induced remodeling of PI pools, consistent with PI serving as marker of genome-replication organel. GG was unable to convert virus-induced tubules into vesicular clusters, explaining nearly 5-log reduction in virus produced by mutant. Our results are consistent with PV inducing temporally distinct membrous structures (organel) for replication (tubules) and assembly (vesicular).
Trypanosomiasis cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is a major public health problem in Latin America and South of the world. A validated target for chemotherapy is cruzain, a cysteine protease involved in the parasite life cycle. A multi-step strategy was developed to select cruzain inhibitors from the ZINC database using ligand- and target-based virtual screening. From 23 selected compounds, 12 non-covalent cruzain inhibitors with affinity in the low micromolar range (3–60 µM ) were identified through competitive inhibition. The binding mode of cruzain inhibitor Neimed176 was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Cruzain shares similarity with mammalian homolog cathepsin L, whose increased activity is related to invasive properties and metastatic cancer. Cruz inhibitors were assayed against catheps L, yielding affinity in the range (4–80 µM ) with poor selectivity towards cruz. This raised the possibility of investigating such inhibitors for their effect on cell proliferation. The most potent cruzain inhibitors were assayed against T. cruzi-infected cells. Two were found to have trypanidal activity. Using Neimed42 as precursor, structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies established the 2-acetamthiophene-3-carboxamide group as essential for enzyme and parasite inhibition. The IC50 for Neimed against the trypomastote form of TulahuenZ was 10.6±0.1 µM, tenfold lower than benznidazole. Employing molecular simplification, a compound derived from Ne42 with ligand efficiency (LE) 0.33 kcal−1 mol−1 was highlighted as a novel non-peptic, nonvalent cruzain as trypanidal candidate.
Yellow fever remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical areas of the world. The only vaccine available protection against yellow fever is the attenuated yellow fever virus 17DD vaccine, which generates long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses. However, this vaccine has rare but potentially fatal side effects. This study presents two non-viral DNA-based vaccine formulations encoding the full-length envelope protein (pYFE) or the full-length protein fused to lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1 (LFE), aimed at diverting antigen presentation through major histocompatibility II compartments. The formulations were evaluated in C57/6 and BAL/c mice, corresponding to H2 and H2 backgrounds. Both constructs induced strong T responses against all epitopes generated by 17DD vaccine, with LFE performing best. In addition to T response, LFE also stimulated high anti-Y neutralizing antibody titers comparable to 17 vaccine. Importantly, LFE conferred 100% protection against intracereally challenged mice. These results indicate LFE is an excellent candidate for further studies.
Chitin utilization is a critical for the persistence and horizontal gene transfer of the cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae in the marine environment. The chb operon encodes genes for the uptake and catabolysis of the chitinase chitobse. The orphan kinase ChiS regulates the ch operon, but the downstream mechanisms of ChiS that result in ch operon expression are poorly understood. Here, we show that the nucleoid protein SlmA is a transcriptional activator of the ch oper. SlmA is a member of the TetR family of proteins, generally transcriptional repressors. In vitro, we find that SlmA binds the ch oper promoter, and in vivo we show this interaction is required for oper expression and chitob utilization. Using mutations that disrupt distinct SlmA functions, we find that DNA-binding, not nucleoid occlusion, is critical for transcription activation.
The paper presents a scalable nonlinear programming (NLP) framework for solving parameter estimation problems that arise in dynamic modeling of biological systems. These problems are computationally challenging because they often involve highly nonlinear and stiff differential equations as well as many experimental data and parameters. The proposed framework uses cutting-edge modeling and solution tools that are computationally efficient, robust, and easy-to-use. It uses a time-discretization approach that i ) avoids repetitive simulations of the model ii ) enables algebraic implementations of model computation of derivatives and iii ) enables computationally efficient nonlinear point solvers that exploit sparse and structured algebra. We demonstrate capabilities by solving problems for synthetic gut microbiome models. We show that an instance with 156 parameters, 144 differential equations and 1,704 data can be solved in less than 3 minutes using proposed framework while off-the-shelf simulation solution requires over 7. We create large instances to show that proposed is scalable and solve problems with 2,352 parameters 2,304 differential and 20,352 in less than 15.
The West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans and animals. To understand the pathogenesis of WNV, it is essential to track changes in gene expression following infection. This study used the nCounter, a high-throughput gene expression system, to analyze the inflammatory response to WNV in the outbred Swiss Webster (SW) mouse model over nine days following intraperitoneal injection. The nCounter Inflammation gene kit containing 179 inflammation-related genes was used to analyze expression in spleen, lung, liver, kidney, and brain of mice infected with WNV. Protein levels of a subset cytokine/chemokine genes were determined using multiplex detection (Biolex ) and compared to RNA expression levels. The study revealed that Ccl and Ilb were differentially expressed in all tissues except kidney. Stratification of infected (W+) versus non-infected (−) tissues allowed differentiation of systemic gene response from tissue-specific responses arising from W infection. Significant decrease in C was found in− sple, while Il was upregulated in− lung and Il was downregulated− in− liver. In− liver, Stat, Tlr, chemok Ccl, Ccl,cl,cl,cl,cl, Il, Il, Il, and Il were upregulated. In− brain, C and Ccl were upregulated. Similar kinetics were found Ccl,cl,cl,cl,cl and correlated with presence of virus. This study demonstrates the utility of nCounter for rapid identification of expression in mice associated with W infection.
In 2014, an outbreak of rabies occurred in Maputo and Matola cities, Mozambique, prompting an investigation into the epidemiology, clinical features and risk factors of human rabies and animal bites in the two cities. Between April and August 2014, 14 cases of human rabies were detected in Maputo ( n = 10 ), Matola ( n = 3 ) and neighbouring Bo district ( n 1 ), all of whom had a recent history of dog bite. Only one of the 14 rabid dogs had been immunized. A total of 819 animal bites were registered, with 64. 6% ( 529/819 ) from Maputo and 97. 8% (801/819 ) from dogs. However, only 27. 0% (126/467 ) of dogs were immunized. Factors associated with human rabies were: age <15 years ( p = 0.05 ), bite by stray dog ( =0.002 ), deep wound ( = 0.02 ), bite in head ( = 0.001 ), by unimmun dog ( = 0.01 ), no soap and water ( 0.001 ) and no post-exposure prophylaxis ( 0.01 ).
The SCN9 gene, encoding the Nav1. 7 subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels, has been identified as a potential cause of febrile seizures ( FS ) in a large Utah family with significant linkage to chromosome 2q24. A highly conserved amino acid mutation, p. N641, in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains I and II was found in 21 affected family members and absent in ethnically matched controls. To establish a functional role for this mutation in seizure susceptibility, the mutation was introduced into the murine Sc9 ortholog using homologous recombination. Homozygous Sc9N641/N641 mice exhibited reduced thresholds to electrically induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures and increased corneal kindling rates. These data support SCN9 p. N641 as a disease-causing mutation in this family. In a collection of 92 unrelated FS patients, highly conserved Nav.7 missense variants were identified in 5%. One child with FS later developed Drav syndrome ( severe mylonic epilepsy of infancy ) and SCN1 was sequenced, identifying a heterozygous frameshift mutation. Subsequent analysis of 109 Drav patients yielded Nav.7 missense in 8%, all highly conserved amino. Six Drav patients with SCN9 missense also harbored miss or splice SCN1 mutations and three had SCN1 mutations.
Biologists have long sought to understand how complex tissue shapes arise through growth. In many cases, this involves preferential growth along particular orientations, raising the question of how these orientations are specified. Two possibilities exist: orientations are specified through stresses in the tissue (axiality system ) or independently through molecular signalling (polarity system ). The axial system has been recently been explored through computational modelling. Here, we develop the polarity system, which we call Growing Tissue (PT ). We treat tissue as a continuous material within which regionally expressed factors under genetic control may interact and propagate. Polarity is established by signals that propagate through tissue and are anchored in regions termed polarity organisers that also under genetic. Rates of growth parallel or perpendicular to polarity may be specified through a network. The growth depends on how specified patterns interact within constraints of connected tissue. This leads to emergence of features not specified by networks. Result growth feeds to influence spatial and orientations of tissue, allowing shapes to emerge from simple. Moreover, asymmetries emerge through polarity fields. We illustrate PT for morphogenesis by applying to growing flower and how underlying may be tested by simulation. We propose combinatorial between orientations and growth, feature of polarity, have been exploited to generate observed shapes.
During the early stages of HIV infection, multiple CD8+ T cell responses are elicited and exert strong selective pressure on different parts of the HIV genome. This leads to the emergence of mutations that are beneficial to the virus. Some studies have shown that the rate at which these mutations emerge and go to fixation decreases over time, a pattern known as the escape rate decline (ER). We investigated how interference between concurrent mutations affects escape rates in multiple epitopes and whether it is a source of the ER pattern. We developed a multilocus Wright-Fisher model of HIV dynamics with selection, mutation, and recombination as a null model for interference. We also derived an interference-free model assuming neutral evolution before immune elicitation. We found that interference between several advantageous mutations can generate the ER pattern. We found that the number of loci and recombination rates affect ER. This can be explained by the exponential decline of escape rates over time. We found that the ER pattern in HIV infected individuals is consistent with both interference-free and interference effects. Our results confirm that interference should be considered when analyzing escape mutations.
Title: In Silico Oncology: Quantification of In Vivo Antitumor Efficacy of Cisatin-Based Double Therapy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCL) through Multiscale Mechanistic Model
Bacterial biofilms are known to exhibit high levels of tolerance to antibiotics. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to this tolerance are not well understood. In this study, we used transposon mutagenesis to identify biofilm mutants that are tolerant to fluoroquinoloneloxacin in Escherichia coli. We demonstrated that starved biofilms are more tolerant toloxacin than their planktonic counterparts and that this tolerance is dependent on the SOS response to amino acid and carbon starvation and partially dependent on the stringent response leucine starvation. We further showed thatloxacin tolerance does not involve SOS toxin–antitoxin systems previously associated with tolerant persister formation. We demonstrated thatlox tolerance increases with biofilm age and is dependent on SOS. Our results show that SOS in nutrient-deprived biofilm microenvironments is a mechanism leading tolox tolerance.
Plasmodium falcumeroites invade human erythrocytes by interacting with host receptors and parasite ligands localized in micronemes, apical organelles. We show that cAMP is a key regulator of micron secretion enabling receptor engagement and invasion. In a low K+ environment, typical of blood plasma, a bicarbonate-sensitive cytoplasmic adeny cyclase raises cytosolic cAMP and activates protein A, regulating micron secretion. c also regulates meroite cytosolic Ca2 via Ep pathway and increases in both c and Ca2 are essential for micron secretion.
Strongyloides stercoris, a soil-transmitted worm, is one of the most neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). We reviewed studies from the last 20 years on S. stercis global prevalence in populations and risk groups. A literature search was performed in PubMed for articles between 1989 and 2011. Articles presenting information on infection were included. A Bayesian analysis was carried out to obtain country-specific prevalence and compare disease ratios in groups taking into account diagnostic sensitivities. A total 354 studies from 78 countries were included for prevalence, 194 (62.4%) were community studies, 121 (34.2%) were hospital, and 39 (11%) studies on refugees and immigrants. World maps with data are provided. In Africa, Asia, and South America, information on Sercis is lacking. The analysis showed an association between HIV/alcoholism and Sercis (OR:2.17;CI:1.18–4.01;OR:6.69;CI:1.47–3.38). Our findings show high prevalence in selected countries and regions. Sercis prominent in risk groups.
Stochastic noise is a fundamental to circadian oscillations, influencing how groups of cells entrain to external cues and generating cell-autonomous rhythms. However, few studies have investigated how clock perturbations affect stochastic noise. This is due to the difficulty in measuring cell-autonomous noise, which requires careful collection and processing of single-cell data. Here, we show that damping of population bioluminescence can serve as an accurate measure of stochastic, applicable to high-throughput circadian screens. Using fibroblast data, we show that higher single-cell noise results in faster population damping. We further show that damping can be changed by small molecule modulators in a dose-dependent fashion, and that such change can be explained by single-cell using a model. We demonstrate that our method can be applied to genome-wide siRNA, revealing that stochastic is altered from period and phase. Finally, we hypothesize that unperturbed clock is optimized for robust, few perturbations capable of increasing amplitude and lowering noise.
Bacterial cell division is a promising target for the development of new drugs to combat antibiotic resistance. The bacterial protein Fts is essential for cell division and has been identified as a target for drug development. Recent work on the allosteric inhibitor PC723 has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against Staphylococcus aureus. However, the mechanism of action and effect on Fts in other species is unclear. Here, we examine the structural environment of PC723 binding using PocketFEATURE, a method that scores similarity between small-molecule binding sites based on 3D structure and molecular dynamics. We find that species and nucleotide state have significant impact on the site, with disparate environments for species not in the Staphlocus genus. Based on Pocket analysis of S aureus bound to GTP with mutations that confer PC723 resistance, we predict PC strongly binds Staphlocus in nucleotide state. Simulations of dimer indicate polymer may enhance PC binding. Our results demonstrate that the pocket can vary across species, genetic and polymer states, important for further development ofts inhibitors.
Lentiviral integrase (IN) is a viral enzyme that enables lentiviruses, such as HIV, to integrate their genetic material into the host cell genome. The cellular protein LEDGF, also known as PC4 and SFR1 interacting protein 1 (PSIP1) transcriptional coactivator 75, is a binding partner of IN and is required for efficient lentiviral replication. Here, we present the crystal structure of the N-terminal and catalytic core (NTD) of HIV-2 IN in complex with the binding domain (IBD) of LEDGF. This structure extends the known IN–LED interface and reveals charge interactions between the NT of IN and IB. The NT of IN contains a constellation of acidic residues characteristic of lentiviruses and mutations of positively charged residues on IB affect interaction with lentiruses. We show that NT–IB contacts are critical for stimulation of lentiral DNA integration by LED in vitro and during early steps of HIV-1 replication. Furthermore, the structure enabled us to engineer a mutant HIV-1 IN that functions only with a complementary LEDGF mutant. These findings provide structural basis for lentiral IN–LED interaction and pave the way for LED-based therapies.
Tumors arise from cells that have an intrinsic set of kinetics that dictate their behavior. These kinetics are inherited by cancer cells and determine the initial and progression of the tumor. However, genetic and epigenetic alterations can change the kinetics of cancer cells and increase their fitness and accelerate progression. We investigated the intratumoral heterogeneity of cancer and the evolutionary trajectories of cell-intrinsic kinetics that yield aggressive growth. We developed a cellular automaton model that tracks the evolution of the malignant subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSC), which are exclusively able to initiate and sustain tumors. We explored cell traits including migration, invasion, spontaneous death due to genetic drift of deleterious mutations, symmetric stem cell division that increases the cancer pool, and telomere erosion as a counter for non-stem cancer proliferation. Our study suggests that proliferation is the strongest modulator of growth. Early increase in proliferation yields populations of non-stem cells that compete with CSC and inhibit division, while reduction loosens inhibition and facilitates CSC division. The subpopulation of stem itself is highly heterogeneous dictating dynamics that vary from dormancy to progression. Our study suggests that diversity in single samples represents only a proportion of total phenotypes.
Many zoonotic infectious diseases, such as influenza A (H5N1), appear as sporadic and spatially restricted outbreaks in humans. Adaptation is key for sustained human-to-human transmission. We use mathematical models to describe adaptation scenarios with reference to human population heterogeneity. We present expressions for emergence probability and time to successful event. We derive results for emergence properties, including outbreak size distribution. We compare with computationally studied stochastic model. Our results suggest weak effect of heterogeneity on outbreak size and emergence risk for typical connections between communities. For example, a village connected to a city by ten commuters is effectively part of the city for emergence and outbreak distribution. We present commuting data showing most communities are at least well interconnected. For plausible ranges, heterogeneity effects are likely dominated by host adaptation biology. We discuss implications for emerging infection surveillance and control.
Influenza A Virus Migration and Persistence in North American Wild Birds. Wild birds have been implicated in the emergence of human and livestock influenza. However, the prediction of viral spread and emergence, as well as formulation of preparedness plans have been hampered by a lack of knowledge of viral movements between host populations. Here, we analyze genomic data from 287 newly sequenced avian influenza A (A) virus samples over 34 years of continuous surveillance of North American migratory birds. We use Bayesian framework to test hypotheses of viral migration, population and genetic reassort patterns. Our results show that despite high prevalence of Charadriiform in Delaware, this host does not significantly contribute to North AIV diversity in Aniform. In contrast, viruses sampled Aniform in Alberta are representative of AIV in North Aniform. A may be restricted to migratory flyways over time, but large-scale analysis shows long-term A persistence is independent of fly with between populations throughout North.
Influenza A viruses are classified into 16 distinct subtypes (H1–16) based on their hemagglutinin (HA) proteins. Each subtype has little cross-reactivity to other subtypes, and it is generally believed that neutralizing antibodies are not cross-reactive among subtypes. We generated a novel monoclonal antibody (MAb), MAb S/1, which showed heterosubically cross-reactive neutralization and hemagutination of influenza A viruses. MAb S/1 reacted with many subtypes (1, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 13) in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and showed neutralization and hemutination activities against subtypes 1, 2, 3, and 13. Mutants that escaped neutralization by MAb S1 were selected from Aichi/2/68 (2), Aachi2/57 (2), and A/N/33 (1) and sequence analysis of HA genes revealed amino substitutions at 156, 158, and 193. Molecular study showed these amino acids located on globular head of HA and formed conformational epitope adjacent to receptor-binding domain. Passive immunization of mice with MAb S1 provided heterosubic protection.
Control of Strongyloides stercoralis infection in an endemic community may be possible by pharmacological means: Results of a three-year study. To assess the effect of ivermectin on the prevalence of S. stercis in an Australian Aboriginal population over three years, and to assess the validity of using a lower ELISA cut-off in diagnosis. A three-year study of 259 Australian Aboriginals in a remote northern community. Sercis was diagnosed by ELISA and a lower threshold for treatment than recommended. Follow up at 6 months and 3 years following ivermect treatment.ivermect was highly effective and resulted in a fall in prevalence in the group (35.3% to 5.8%, McNem’s2 = 56., p<.001. ). Results suggested use of lower EL threshold for treatment was valid in this setting. Follow identified a group with persistently positive EL serology despite treatment. Control Sercis in this cohort appears to be using pharmac treatment alone.
Prion diseases are caused by a misfolded isoform of the prion protein PrP. Prion strains are hypothesized to be encoded by strain-specific conformations of PrP and can interfere with each other when a long-incubation strain blocks the conversion of a short-incation strain. However, it is unknown if long-incation strains can interfere with each other. Here, we show that co-infection of animals with combinations of longation strains failed to show evidence of interference. To exclude the possibility that inability to interfere in vivo was due to failure to infect common neurons, we used protein misfolding cyclic amplification interference (PMCI). Consistent with animal studies, CI indicated both strains were amplifying independently, suggesting lack of interference is not due to failure to target same cells but an inherent property of strains. Importantly, CI reactions seeded with longation strains contained higher levels of Pr compared to seeded with shortation. Mechanistically, we hypo abundance of Pr not limiting in vivo or in resulting strains with low conversion to amplify independently.
Allosteric proteins are proteins that undergo a conformational change in response to ligand binding. Intrinsic disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDs) are prevalent in alloster proteins and were previously thought to be favorable for alloster coupling. We propose a comprehensive model to compare the roles of order-order and disorder transitions in alloster effect. The Monod-Wy-Wyman-Change (MWC) pathway, which involves an order transition, has a higher probability of alloster than the Monod-Wy-Wyman-Change (AM) pathway, which involves disorder. This suggests that IDPs/IDs have a complicated role in alloster regulation. We derive an analytic formula for maximal alloster coupling and show that too stable or unstable states are unfavorable for alloster. This is helpful for alloster drug design.
Prostate cancer is a major cause of death in the world, but few genetic alterations that drive cancer initiation and progression have been identified. βaten is essential for many developmental processes and has been implicated in tumorigenesis in many tissues, including prostate. However, studies on human cancer samples are unclear the role this protein plays in disease. Here, we extend our understanding of βaten in normal and neoplastic prostate using in vivo studies in the embryo and adult. Our analysis revealed that epithelial βaten is required for embryonic prostate growth but is dispensable in adult. During development, βaten controls number of progenitors in epithelial buds and regulates discrete genes, c-Myc and Nk3. Deletion βaten in Pten model of castration-resistant cancer demonstrated is dispensable for disease in this setting. Complementary experiments, in vivo showed βaten promotes squamous epith during development in absence andens.aten overexpression with Pten was able to drive invasive carcinoma with squamous metaplas. These demonstrate βaten essential for prostate and inherent high levels in epithelia drive squamous differentiation.
In developing countries where disease burden is high, there is an increasing need for biomedical research. Understanding the role of local factors is important for undertaking research in developing countries. We explored factors relating to information and communication during the process of informed consent, and the approach that should be followed for gaining consent. The study was conducted prior to a family-based genetic study among people with podoiosis (non-filar elephantiasis ) in southern Ethiopia. We adapted a method of rapid assessment in The Gambia. The methodology was entirely qualitative, involving focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. Discussions were conducted with podoiosis patients and non-patients in community, field workers, researchers, staff of local-government organisation ( NGO ) working prevention and treatment podoiosis and community leaders. We found that the extent of use everyday language, the degree which of expectations of participants were addressed, and techniques of presentation information had considerable impact on comprehension of information about research. Approaching podoiosis via trusted individuals and preceding consent with community sensitization were considered optimal of communication.
Cell proliferation is a common to all biological systems and is essential for the maintenance of body integrity through the continuous production of diversified lymphocytes in the thymus. This process involves proliferation, differentiation, selection, death, and migration of lymphocytes to peripheral tissues where proliferation also occurs upon antigen recognition. Quantification of cell proliferation requires experimental and mathematical methods. Here, we investigate the impact of genetics and aging on the immune system through the dynamics of proliferation of lymphocytes across thymus and spleen in mice. Our investigation is based on single-cell multicolour flow cytometry revealing the incorporation of thymidine analogue during pulse-chase-pulse experiments in vivo versus DNA content. A mathematical model simulates the evolution of single cell behaviour through Ordinary Differential Equations ( ODE ) during various durations of labelling. It allows us to fit our data, deduce proliferation and cell cycle durations in sub-populations. Our model is simple and validated with other pulsease experiments. Our results show that cell proliferation is highly heterogeneous with a specific signature that depends on genetic, specific cell stages in thym and sple and altered with age.
Mitochondrial tRNA mutations are a common cause of disease in humans, with about half of pathogenic mutations occurring in tRNA genes. These mutations are of particular interest because they can have different penetrance among patients and can be excellent examples of evolution and fixation of mitochondrial tRNA. We report the generation and characterization of the first pathogenic mitochondrial tRNA mutation in mice, m. 373G>A in the mt-T gene. This mutation recapitulates the molecular hallmarks of disease-causing mutations in humans, m 0T>C in the mt gene. We determined that the pathogenic mechanism of both mouse and human mutations is abnormal folding of tRNA that cannot be charged with isoleucine. We show that cells harboring mouse or human mutant tRNA have exacerbated mitochondrial biogenesis triggered by increase in ROS as compensatory response. We propose that pathogenic mechanism combined with compensatory can explain penetrance of this mutation.
In mammals, dosage compensation is achieved by doubling the expression of X-linked genes in males and X inactivation in females. However, the regulation of the active X chromosome may be controlled by DNA-based or epigenetic mechanisms that double the output in response to autosomal factors. To determine whether X expression depends on ploidy, we used expression arrays to compare X-linked and autosomal expression in human triploid cells. We found that the average X:autosome ratio was about 1 in diploid cells, but was lower (0.81–0.84 ) in triploid cells with one active X and higher (1.32–1.4 ) in triploid with two active X’s. Overall, X-linked expression in triploid does not strictly respond to autosomal nor is it adjusted to perfect. The unbalanced X:aut ratios could contribute to abnormal phenotypes with triploidy. Autosomal expression per gene was similar in triploid versus diploid, indicating no global effect on autosomal. In trip with two X our data support doubling X-linked expression. However, in trip with single X expression is upward presumably by epigen that senses ratio between X and autos. Such may act on subset whose expression in relation autos may be critical.
The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) is a widely used to quantify evolutionary pressures on proteins. It was originally developed for distantly diverged sequences, but is often applied to samples from a single population. We study the expected dN/d ratio in a single population under selection and find that it is insensitive to the selection coefficient. The hallmark of positive selection, dN/d>1, is violated within a population. The relationship between selection and d/d does not follow a monotonic function, making it impossible to infer pressures from d/d.
While a major goal of evolutionary biology is to understand how natural selection has shaped patterns of genetic variation across genomes, the effect of selection on neutral divergence between species remains ambiguous. Previous studies have reported correlations between divergence and recombination, interpreted as evidence for selection reducing neutral divergence, but theory argues otherwise, especially for species that have diverged long ago. Here, we examine whether selection can affect divergence between closely and distantly related species. We find that divergence between closely related species ( e. g. human-primate ) is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with recombination. We also find divergence between distantly related species ( e. g. humanrodent ) is negatively correlated with functional and positively with estimates of background selection from primates. These patterns persist after accounting for confounding factors of hypermutable Cp sites, content, and biased conversion. Coalescent models indicate that when the contribution of ancestral polymorphism to divergence is small, selection in the ancestral population can explain a large proportion of variance in divergence across the genome, generating correlations. Our findings show that, contrary to previous intuition, selection can indirectly affect divergence between closely and distantly related species. We cannot exclude the possibility that purifying selection drives some patterns, but this would require more of the genome to be under purifying than believed. Our work has implications for the evolution of genomes and interpreting genetic variation.
In Drosophila, CK2 phosphorylates and destabilizes the PER and TIM proteins, which inhibit CLOCK (CLK) transcriptional activity. Here we show that CK also phosphorylates and downregulates the activity of the catalytic α subunit of CLOCK (CLK). Downregulation of CKα induces CLK degradation, even in the absence of PER and TIM. Unexpectedly, the regulatory β subunit of the CK holoenzyme is not required for regulation of CLK stability. In addition, downregulation of CKα decreases CLK phosphorylation and increases PER and TIM transcription. These results indicate that CK inhibits CLK degradation while reducing its activity. Since CK promotes CLK degradation, we suggest that CLK stability and transcription activity result from counteracting effects of CK and CK.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is a protozoan parasite that has a complex life cycle involving mammalian and invertebrate hosts. Cysteine peptidases, such as cruzain, are involved in several aspects of the parasite life cycle and host-parasite relationships. However, little is known about the factors that contribute to the parasite-insect interaction. Here, we investigated whether cruzain could be involved in the interaction of T cruz with the invertebrate host. We analyzed the effect of treatment of T cruz epimastigotes with anti-cruzain antibodies or a panel of cystepeptid inhibitors ( cystatin, antain, E-64 leupept, iodetamide or CA-074-OM ) on parasite adhesion to Rhodnius prolix midut ex vivo. All treatments, with exception of CA-OM, significantly decreased parasite adhesion to R prolix midut. Cystatin presented dose-dependent reduction in adhesion. Comparison of adhesion among T cruz isolates revealed the isolate which possesses low active cruzain adhered less than D28 and CLner isolates. Transgenic epimastotes overexpressing endogenous cruzain inhibitor (CH )agasin adhered less than wild-type parasites. adhesion CH parasites was partially restored by addition exogenous cruzain. In vivo experiments revealed low CH parasites compared to wild after passage in insect presented drastic in expression cruzain.
Cytoplasmic dyne is a microtubule-dependent protein that plays a crucial role in mitotic processes including centrosome separation, metaphase chromosome congression, anaphase spindle elongation and chromosome segregation. It also functions during interphase for vesicle transport and organel positioning. To understand the mechanisms that regulate this microtub motor, we screened a Caenorhabditis elegans cytoplasm dyin heavy chain mutant at semmissive temperature with a genome-wide RNA interference library to reduce gene functions. We isolated and characterized twenty dyin-specific suppressors that reduce dyin mutants but not other conditional loci. Twelve of the twenty suppressors do not exhibit sterile or lethal phenotypes when reduced in wild-type worms. Many suppress proteins, including dyin chains, localize to subcellular sites that overlap with dyin heavy chain. Knocking down any of four putative dyin accessory suppresses the heavy mutants, suggesting some chains regulate heavy function. We also identified 29 genes that when reduced suppress not only dyin but loci for unrelated processes.
During somatic differentiation in the ciliate Paramecium tetra, physiological DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) drive programmed genome rearrangements (PGR), which are safeguarded by DNA repair pathways. Because of their unique nuclear dimorphism, ciliates are powerful unicellular eukaryotic models to study GR mechanisms. At each sexual cycle, the germline nucleus is transmitted to progeny but somatic nucleus, essential for expression, is destroyed and new somatic differentiates from gerine copy. In P. tetra, somatic nucleus development involves massive GR including elimination of at least 45,000 gerine sequences (Internal Eliminated Sequences, IES). IES excision proceeds cut-and-close mechanism: domestic transposase PigMac is essential for cleavage and DSB at repair excision involves Ligase IV, component of non-homous endjoining (NHE) pathway. At genome level, huge number of DS must be repaired to allow assembly of functional somatic chromosomes.
Prion diseases are characterized by a long preclinical incubation period during which the infectious prion particle propagates in the brain. During this time, abnormal neuritic sprouting and synaptic deficits are apparent, but gross neuronal loss is not detected until the onset of clinical disease. The molecular mechanisms of early neuronal damage and death remain obscure. We used laser capture microdissection to isolate hippocampal CA1 neurons and determined their preclinical transcriptional response during infection. We found that gene expression in these neurons is dynamic and characterized by distinct phases of activity. A major cluster of genes is altered preclinically, returning to basal or undergoing reversal during clinical. This cluster contains a signature of N-methyl-aspartic acid ( NMD ) receptor and neuroprotective pathways. Genes in neuronal and dendrite development are altered, culminating in decline of synaptic proteins. Deregulated miRNAs follow concomitant patterns. This is the first study describing preclinical response of hippocal neurons to prion replication. Our findings suggest prion results in stimulation of a response, at least by NMD receptor, promoting survival and neurite remodelling. However, this is terminated prior to clinical in hippocampus, pointing to a juncture in disease.
Leishmaniasis is an infectious disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani that leads to the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the liver, forming granulomas, which eventually eliminate the parasite. To understand granuloma formation and function, we developed an in silico Petri model that simulates granuloma development throughout infection. The model was validated with experimental data from mice and robustness was assessed by sensitivity analysis. The model recapitulated disease progression and predicted changes in granuloma composition over time. We conducted in silico experiments to identify granul diversity in anti-lemanial activity and simulated IL-10 deficiency in lymphoid and myeloid cells. Our data suggest IL-10 produced by Kupffer cells at the granoma core has a dominant regulatory role.
Transcriptional regulation of a gene can be viewed as a computational device with transcription factor concentrations as inputs and expression level as output. We show that different parameterizations of a simple kinetic model of transcription regulation are able to approximate four standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as equality and inequality operations. These approximations depend on sets of parameters and are independently tunable. We demonstrate that networks of “arithmetic” genes can be combined to accomplish more complicated computations by simulating a network that detects significant elevations in time-vary signal. We also show that analytic functions can be approximated by allowing transcription factor binding on promoter.
Chikungunya virus (CHV) is an RNA virus from the Togaviridae family that is transmitted by mosquitoes in both sylvatic and urban cycles. In humans, CHV infection leads to a febrile illness denominated Chikunya fever (CHF), commonly associated with intense and debilitating outcomes. CHV arrived in Brazil in 2014 through two independent introductions: the Asian/Caribbean genotype through the North and the African ECS genotype through the Northeast. Following their introduction, both genotypes established their urban cycle among naive populations causing several outbreaks in the Americas. Here, we sequenced CHV genomes from a recent outbreak in the Northeast of Brazil employing an in-house Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocol capable of detecting multiple CHV genotypes from clinical samples. Our results demonstrate that both Asian/ibbean and ECS genotypes expanded their range reaching cocirculation in Northeast Brazil. In addition, NG data supports findings of simultaneous infection by these genotypes suggesting coinfection might be more common than thought in highly endemic areas.
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a process by which bacteria acquire new genes from other bacteria. This increases their diversity and ability to colonize new niches, including the human host. However, it is unclear how this new DNA interacts with the cell's regulatory networks. Here, we show that the global regulator H-NS discriminates between horizontally acquired and core genes. It silences horizontally acquired genes in response to environmental stimuli such as osmolarity and temperature. In contrast, core genes are modulated by HNS homodimers. The presence of a helper protein, Hha, is required for differential regulation of core genes by chromosomal HNS. Silencing of horizontally acquired DNA is accomplished by HNS-H complexes. In contrast, core genes are modulated by H homodimers. Remarkably, H-like proteins are restricted to Enterobacteriaceae. In addition, conjugative plasmids encoding HNS variants have been isolated only from members of this family. Thus, the H system in Enterobacteraceae presents unique features. The ability to discriminate between core and horizontally acquired DNA may help maintain horizontally acquired genes silent and give bacteria a competitive advantage in adapting to new environments, including host colonization.
Leishmania species are a group of parasites that cause a range of diseases in humans and animals. They have a highly conserved gene content and synteny across the genus, but only a small number of genes are differentially distributed between the three sequenced species: L. major, L. infant and L. brazili. It is not known how many of these genes are expressed in disease-promoting intracellular amastigotes or whether conserved genes are differentially expressed in the host. We used custom oligonucleotide microarrays to confirm that all differentially distributed genes are expressed in intracellular amastotes, with few subject to regulation at the RNA level. In the first large study of gene expression in L brazili, we show ∼9% of genes are regulated in RNA during L braz life cycle, consistent with other Leish species. Comparing amigote expression between species confirms Leish undergo little regulation, but identifies conserved genes regulated differently in host. We also investigated host influence parasite expression by comparing RNA profiles L amigotes from wild-type BAL/c or immunocompromised Rag−/−− mice. While dissemination from site is enhanced in Rag−−− genetic, RNA profiles are unperturbed.
Amphimeris is a fish-borne disease caused by the liver fluke Amphimerus spp that has recently been reported as endemic in the Pacific side of Ecuador with a high prevalence in humans and animals. The current diagnosis is based on stool examination to identify parasite eggs but lacks sensitivity, and the morphology of eggs may be confounded with other liver and intestinal flukes. No immunological or molecular methods have been developed to date. To address this, we developed a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to detect Amphimer sp DNA in human stool samples. We designed a LAMP targeting the internal transcribed spacer 2 region of Amphimer sp and optimized the assay using DNA from adult worms recovered from animals. Conventional PCR was performed using primers F-B3 to verify amplification of Amphimer sp DNA sequence. LAMP was optimized and set up as LPhimer. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of both PCR and LAMP. The detection limit was 1 pg genomic DNA. Field testing was done using 44 stool samples from localities where fluke is endemic. Twenty-five samples were microscopy positive for Amphimer sp eggs. In molecular testing PCR-B was ineffective when DNA from fecal was used. When all stool samples included in study, diagnostic parameters for sensitivity and specificity were calculated for Limer assay, which were 76. 67% and 80.77, respectively. We have developed a specific and sensitive LAMP for Amphimer sp in stool. The procedure has been named Limer and has potential to be adapted for diagnosis and surveillance in amphias-endemic areas.
In Drosophila, the SNARE protein Ykt plays a non-canonical role in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Ykt forms a complex with Sy17 and Snap29 to promote autophagosome-lysosome formation. However, loss of Ykt leads to a large accumulation of autophagosomes that are unable to fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. In contrast, loss of Sy5, the partner of Ykt in ER-Gol trafficking, does not prevent autolys formation, suggesting a direct role of Ykt in fusion. Ykt localizes to lysosomes and autys and forms a SN complex with Sy17 and Snap. Interestingly, Ykt can be outcompeted from this complex by Vamp, and overexpression of V rescues the fusion defect in Ykt loss of function cells. A mutant Ykt with an R amino acid change in the zeroionic layer retains normal autagic activity and restores viability, whereas palmitoylation or farnesylation mutant Ykt does not. Ykt and V7 are both required for autag-lys fusion and are mutually exclusive subunits in Sy17-Snap complex. These data suggest V7 is directly involved in membrane fusion andkt acts as a non-conventional SNARE in this process.
Neisseria Haemophilus (NTH) is a commensal inhabit of the human nasopharyngeal mucosa and is commonly associated with opportunistic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts. NTH virulence is partly due to its ability to avert the bactericidal effects of host-derived antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). We previously determined that the periplasmic protein SapA bound AMPs and was required for NTH virulence in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that Sap functions directly counter AMP lethality during NTH infection by neutralizing AMP in vivo. We hypothesize that Sap delivers AMP to the inner membrane for transport into the cytoplasm. We show that AMPs localize in the cytoplasm of parental NTH and are susceptible to cytoplasmic peptase activity. In contrast, AMP accumulate in the perasm of bacteria lacking functional Sapase. These data support Sap-mediated AMP import, a novel strategy to reduce perasm and inner accumulation of host peptides.
Active degradation of MarA controls its coordination of downstream targets. MarA is a transcription factor that controls a variety of stress response genes in Escherichia coli. It has an unusually short half-life compared to other cellular proteins. We investigated the role of degradation in how Mar coordinates its downstream targets. We modified Mar’s half-life by knocking down the protease that targets it via CRISPR or by engineering Mar to protect it from degradation. Our results indicate that degradation impacts both the rate of coordination and maximum that downstream targets can achieve. In the context of multi-gene regulation, trade-offs between these properties show that perfect fidelity and coordination cannot coexist.
Leishmaniasis major is a protozoan parasite that causes cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans. We have previously shown that mice deficient in MAP kinase phosphatase 2 (MK-2 ) are unable to control infection with Leishmania mexicana. In contrast, the present study shows that MK-2 deficient mice are able to control infection with L. major, similar to their wild-type counterparts, as measured by lesion size and parasite numbers. Following infection, MK- mice have a reduced TH response compared to wild-type mice, with lower levels of IFN-γ and TN-α producing CD4 and CD8 T cells, and lower stimulated spleen IF-γ production. However, they also have reduced levels of IL-4 in spleen and lymph node cells, as well as reduced parasite-specific IgG in serum, indicating a general cell hypo-respons. The TH1/TH balance is unaltered in MK- mice compared to wild-type. Although MK- macrophages are more permissive to L growth than wild-type macrophages, LPS/IF-γ is equally effective at controlling growth in both MK- and wild-type macroph. Consequently, the absence of change in TH/TH balance in MK mice does not alter disease phenotype.
The development of the pancreatic ductal network in the mammalian pancreas is a complex process that has been poorly understood on both at the microscopic and macroscopic levels. The pancreas is a branched organ that does not exhibit stereotypic branching patterns similar to other glands. However, it contains a network of ducts that undergo a transition from unconnected micromen to a mesh of interconnected ducts and finally to a treelike structure. In this study, we quantify the network properties at different developmental stages and find that the pancreas exhibits stereotyp traits at each stage. The network properties change with time toward the most economical delivery of exocrine products into the duodenum. Using in silico modeling, we show that the steps of pancreatic development can be deconstructed into simple rules likely conserved for other glands.
Kines motor proteins drive intracellular transport by coupling ATP hydrolysis to conformation changes that mediate movement along microtubules. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of 114 experimental structures and results of conventional and accelerated molecular simulations that map the structural dynamics of the kines motor domain. All structures were found to reside in one of three conformation clusters: ATP-like, ADP-like and Eg5-bound. These differ in the orientation of key elements, notably microtub binding α–α8, loop subdomain and α2–β–β–β motor tip. Group membership did not correlate with the nature of the bound nucleotide in a structure. However, groupings coincided with distinct necker orientations. Accelerated molecular simulations of ATP, AD and Eg indicate all could sample majorlogically observed conformations. Differences in dynamic of dist sites were evident. In ATP simulations, necker, loop and α–5 display motions absent in AD bound. Dissection of these couplings provide evidence for network between active, microub-binding and necker via loop and loop. Simulations indicate mutations in loop reduce flexibility and couplings. Our results indicate ATP and AD conformations kines are intrinsically regardless nucleotide and support model where necker leads to tighter microub and nucleotide regions. Simulations highlight critical conformation and alloster between dist sites.
Bioluminescent reporters, based on the bacterial Lux system, are widely used as gene expression reporters. They are fast, sensitive, and non-destructive, allowing for high frequency measurements. Originally developed for bacterial cells, they have been adapted for eukaryotic cells and can be used for whole biosensors or in real time in live animals without euthanasia. However, interpretation of bioluminescent data is limited because biolumcence is different from gene expression due to nonlinear and molecular dynamics of the Lux system. We have developed a computational approach that allows users of Lux assays to infer gene levels from the output. This approach is based on a new model for Lux activity that includes LuxAB, LuxEC, and Fre with improved mechanisms for reactions as well as synthesis and turnover of Lux. The model is calibrated with experimental data for LuxAB and Fre from Photorhabus lumcens—the source of modern reporters—while literature has been used for Lux. Importantly, data show evidence for previously unreported inhibition for LuxAB. Model simulations show that biolumcent profiles can be different from changes in expression with peaks of light similar to output seen in experimental sets. By incorporating the model into a Bayesian scheme we can engineer promoter from biolumcence.
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA) are major causes of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. The capsid binder G3 (G3) can inhibit replication of these viruses. Here, we present the crystal structure of CVA in complex with G3, which clarifies the role of key residues in interactions with the inhibitor. Based on this structure, in silico docking was performed to investigate interactions with next-generation capsid binders NLD and AL, which are potent inhibitors of a panel of enteroviruses with interesting pharmacological properties. A meta-analysis was performed to obtain deeper insight into structural features required for capsid binders to interact and confer broad-spectrum anti-enterirus activity.
The immune response to fungal and Gram-positive bacterial infections in Drosophila melanogaster is regulated by the serpin inhibitor Necrot. Following infection, a proteolytic cascade is activated that signals through the Toll receptor, resulting in the synthesis of a range of antimicrobial peptides in the fat body and their export to the haemolymph. Necrot is synthesised in the fat body, but its site of degradation has been unclear. We demonstrate that Necrot is removed from the haemolymph by two groups of cells: glial cells and pericardial macrophages. Nec uptake is rapid, increased after 30 minutes and peaking at 6–8 hours. We show that Nec is processed through multi-vesicular bodies and delivered to the lysosome, where it co-localises with ubiquitin-binding protein H. Nec does not co-localise with Rab11, indicating it is not re-exported from macrophages. Instead, mutations blocking late endosome/lysosome fusion ( dor and car ) cause accumulation of Nec-positive endosomes even in the absence of infection. Knockdown of the Drosila orthologue of the mammalian LDL receptor with dsRNA identifies Lp1 as enhancer of the immune uptake of Necrot from the haolymph is blocked by chromosomal deletion of L1.
In sea urchins, Nodal signaling is known to prevent the formation of the left rudiment on the right side. However, the opposing pathway to Nodal signaling during left-right (LR) axis establishment is not clear. Here, we show that BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch, specifically in the veg2 lineage, but not in small micromeres. By perturbing BMP activities, we demonstrate that BMP signaling is required for the expression of left-sided genes and formation of left-sided structures. On the other hand, Nodal on the right inhibits BMP signaling and LR asymmetric separation and apoptosis of small miceres. Our findings show that BMP is positive for left-sided development in seaurch, suggesting that opposing Nodal and BMP roles in LR establishment are conserved deuteromes.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is strictly synchronized with the host cell cycle. Infected cells in the G0/G phase support immediate early (IE) gene expression and proceed to the G1 phase where they arrest. In contrast, S phase cells can be infected but block IE expression and this is not relieved until cells have divided and re-entered G. During latent infection IE expression is also inhibited and for reactivation to occur this block must be overcome. We show that the block to IE expression during S phase can be overcome by genotoxic stress and inhibitors of DNA replication, pointing to involvement of checkpoint-dependent pathways in repression. Checkpoint rescue of IE strictly requires p53 and absence is mimicked by proteasomal inhibition in p-dependent manner. Requirement for cyclin-dependent kinase (CD) inhibitor p21 downstream p53 suggests pivotal role in IE repression in S and treatment of cells with CD inhibitor alleviates repression independently p. Importantly, CD also overcomes block during quiescent NT2 cells. Thus, timely CD activity not only secures specificity of cycle-dependent IE program but also prevents establishment of latent state.
Dendritic cells (DCs) from HIV-1 elite controllers (EC) rapidly produce type I interferons and upregulate interferon-stimulated effector genes upon exposure to HIV-1. This cell-intrinsic immune response is associated with the induction of SAMHD1 and LEDGF/p75 and accumulation of viral transcripts, but is inhibited by pharmacological blockade of reverse transcription or siRNA-mediated silencing of cytosolic sensor cG. Importantly, cell-intrinsic recognition of HIV-1 in DCs from EC translates into stronger ability to stimulate and expand HIV-specific CD8 T cells.
Drosophila larvae with increased levels of fat were identified using a buoy-based screening method. Sixty-six genes were found to be associated with increased fat storage. One of these genes was Sir2, a member of the sirtuin family. Siruins regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism by deacetylating key proteins. However, mammalian sirtins function in different tissues, making it difficult to define their role in energy homeostasis under normal conditions. Sir2 was knocked down in the larval fat body, resulting in increased fat levels. Using genetic mosa, we show that Sir restricts fat accumulation in individual cells of the body in a cell-autonomous manner. Consistent with this, changes in metabolic enzymes in Sir mutants point to a shift from catabism. Surprisingly, although Sir is upregulated under starvation, Sir mutants survive better than wild type under amino-acid starvation as long as sugars are provided.
Asymmetric cell division is an essential for generating cellular diversity in animals. In many species, the cleavage plane is perpendicular to the mitotic spindle, and spindle positioning dictates the size of daughter cells. We recorded the first embryonic division of 42 nematode species closely related to Caenorhabditis elegans, an excellent model for studying biophysical properties of spindle positioning. Our recordings of 128 strains from 27 Caenorhabis and 15 non-Caenorhabis species ( http://www. ensly. fr/LMCematCell/videos ) constitute a powerful collection of subcellular phenotypes to study evolution of cellular processes. We analyzed our collection to study spindle positioning. All strains underwent asymmetric division, but exhibited intra- and inter-species variations in degree of asymmetry and spindle parameters including oscillation, elongation, and displacement. Notably, these changed during evolution with no direction in species phylogeny, except spindle transverse oscillations evolved at base of Caenorhabis genus. These were unrelated to embryo size variations. Importantly, elongation, displacement, and oscillation evolved independently. This contrasts with C elegans studies and reveals unrecognized changes in spindle mechanics.
Salmonella Typhimurium and Escheria coli are two bacteria that have identical Omp proteins, a DNA binding protein that regulates gene expression. However, they have different responses to acid stress. In S. Tyimium, Omp expression is elevated at low pH, while in E. coli it is not. This is due to differences in the promoter regions of the omp genes. The E. coli promoter can be made acid-inducible by introducing sequences from S. Tyium. The Omp regulon in S. Tyium overlaps with E coli at 15 genes and includes horizontally acquired virulence genes E coli does not have. We found that O binds its targets more when DNA is relaxed, which occurs in S Tyium as a result of acid stress. This is required for optimal expression of virulence genes. The targets of O do not share a nucleotide consensus. We propose that O can recruit additional genes to its regulon from its modest specificity for DNA and preference for relaxed allowing it to modulate transcription in response to stress.
Chlamydia trachomatis is an intracellular pathogen that secretes a novel effector protein via a type III secretion mechanism. This effector is a SET domain containing protein that functions as a histone methyltransferase and has been named Nuclear Effector ( NUE). During infection, N is translocated to the host cell nucleus where it associates with chromatin. We demonstrated that N is expressed in mammalian cells and reconstitutes nuclear targeting and chromatin association in vitro. N is a histone methyltransfer that targets histones H2, H3, and H4 and also methylates itself (automethylates). Mutants deficient in automethylation have diminished histone methylation activity, suggesting that automethylation enhances enzymatic activity. This is the first description of a bacterial effector that directly targets mammalian histones.
Human height is a highly heritable trait with 80–90% of variation explained by genetic factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many common variants influencing height; however, little attention has been given to recessive effects. We investigated genome-wide recessive effects of inbreeding on adult height in 35,000 people from 21 populations. We found a highly significant inverse association between height and genome homozygosity, equivalent to a 3 cm height reduction in offspring of first cousins compared to unrelated individuals. This effect remained after controlling socio-economic status (χ2=83.89, df=1; p=5.2×10−20 ). However, there was heterogeneity among populations: the effect direction was consistent but size differed. This likely reflects true heterogeneity: effect depends on homozygosity in population and inheritance of recessive genotypes. These results predict multiple, rare variants influence height.
Malaria is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum that is transmitted by the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. In this study, we investigated the phenotype and function of monocytes (MO), a type of white blood cell, in healthy individuals exposed to malaria and patients with acute uncomplicated malaria. We used flow cytometry to characterize the phenotype of MO and an in vitro antibody dependent cellular inhibition (ADC) assay to evaluate their function. We found that at the time of admission, the majority of patients had high percentages and absolute numbers of CD16+ and CCR2+CXCR1+ MO. Remarkably, expression of C2 and CR1 on the CDhigh MO subset defined two groups of patients that differed in their ability to limit parasite growth through ADC. The group with highest percentages and absolute of CDhiCCR+CX1 MO and highest levels of ADC activity had lower parasitemia (0.14±0.34%) than the second group (1.30±3%; p=0.005).
Schistosoma mansoni infection in Ugandan men is associated with increased abundance and function of HIV target cells in blood, but not foreskin: a cross-sectional study. Schistosoma mansoni infection has been associated with increased HIV prevalence in humans and SHIV incidence in primate models. We hypothesized that immune activation from gastrointestinal mucosa would increase HIV-susceptible CD T cell subsets in blood and fores through common mucosal homing. Fores tissue and blood were obtained from 34 HIV and malaria-uninfected Ugandan men who volunteered for elective circumcision, 12 of whom were definitively positive for S mansoni in stool and 12 definitively negative for S mans and worm. T and blood cell subsets were characterized by flow cytometry and immunohisto (IHC). Th and Th cells from both blood and fores expressed higher levels of CCR and were more activated than CD T cell. mans-infected men had higher of Th (22.9 vs.16.5% of CD T, p0.05, ) Th (2. vs.1.5,0.05, ) and Th (0. vs.0.3,0.01 ) than men. Additionally, Th in mans-inf men demonstrated enhanced (28. vs.16.3 producing cytokines =0.046 ). However, these alterations not observed in foreskin. mans was associated with increased of Th Th, Th and Th subsets in blood, but T differences did not extend fores. mans induced in cell immunology through mucosal are likely increase susceptibility in fores.
Filarial nematodes have a symbiotic relationship with the endosymbiont Wolbachia. Depletion of Wolbach results in profound defects in nemode development, fertility, and viability, and has promise as a novel approach for treating filarial diseases. Here, we demonstrate that Wolbach depletion induces apoptosis in the germline and somatic cells of embryos, microfilariae, and fourth-stage larvae ( L4 ). Surprisingly, apoptosis occurs in embryonic cells not infected prior to antibiotic treatment. In addition, apoptosis occurs in the hypodermis, which are populated with large numbers of Wolia, although disruption of the hypod cytoskeleton occurs following depletion. Apoptosis is non-autonomous, suggesting involvement of factors from Wolia in the hypod. The pattern of apoptosis correlates with nemode processes perturbed following Wolbach depletion, including embryogenesis and long-term sterilization. Our observations provide a cellular mechanism for sustained reductions in microilar loads and interruption of transmission following antibiotic therapy.
Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for malaria, requires extracellular pantoate for proliferation. It converts pantoate into coenzyme A ( CoA ) via five enzymes, with pantoate kinase ( PfK ) being the first. Anti-malarial panto analogues, such as pantoate and CJ-15, 801, kill the parasite by targeting Co biosynthesis. However, their mechanism of action is unknown. Here, we show that parasites treated with panto or CJ-801 become resistant to these analogues. Whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations in one of two putative PfK genes (Pf1 ) in resistant lines. These mutations significantly alter Pf activity, conferring a cost consistent with Pf coding a functional Pf that is essential for growth.
Genome-wide association studies of the PR interval in African Americans were performed to identify genetic determinants of the PR interval in individuals of African ancestry. The studies were conducted in four cohorts of African Americans (n=6,247) and genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray. Imputation was performed for 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using YRI and CEU Hap II panels. We observed a strong signal (rs3924) within the gene encoding the sodium channel (SCNA) with genome-wide association (p<2.5×10−8) in two cohorts and meta-analysis. The signal explained 2% of PR variability in African Americans (β=5.1 msec per allele, 95%CI=4.1–6.1, p=3×10−23). This SNP was also associated with PR (β=2.4 per allele, 95CI=1.8–3.0, p=×10−16) in individuals of European ancestry (n=14,042) but with smaller effect (p<0.001) and variability (0.5%). Further meta-analysis identified genome-wide associations in SCN (rs10), ME1 (rs) and TBX (rs) that were correlated with SNPs in European and Asian studies. African was associated with PR (13.3 msec, p=0.009) in one cohort but not others.
Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) is a positive-strand RNA virus that replicates its genomic RNA in replication complexes formed on intracellular membranes. Previous studies have shown that TOM1, a seven-pass transmembrane protein, is necessary for efficient MV replication. Here, we show that ARL8, a small GTP-binding protein, is co-purified with FLAG-tagged ToMV 180 replication protein from solubilized membranes of MV-infected Nicotiana tabacum cells. ARL is also co-purified with TOM in solubil membranes of MV-infected cells that expressed FLAG-tagged A8. The purified fraction showed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity transcribing MV RNA. In uninfected cells, TOM co-pur with FLAGged A8 less efficiently, suggesting a complex containing MV proteins, TOM, and ARL are formed on membranes in infected cells. In Arabidopsis thalian, ARL consists of four members. Simultaneous mutations in two A8 genes completely inhibited MV multiplication. In vitro MV RNA-replication system, lack of TOM or A8 inhibited production of replicative RNA, indicating TOM and ARL are required for efficient RNA synthesis. When MV180 protein was coexpressed with TOM and A8 in yeast, RNA5′-apping activity was detected in membrane. This was undetect or weak when 180 was alone or with TOM or A8.
In the olfactory system of the locust, two types of inhibitory motifs have been identified: feed-forward and feedback. Feed-forward inhibition is provided by a subset of lateral interneurons (LHNs) onto Kenyon cells (KCs) to maintain sparse firing, which is important for olfactory learning and memory. In contrast, feedback inhibition is mediated by a single inhibitory neuron, the GABAergic neuron (GN), which is the main source of inhibition in the mushroom body and is mediated by a feedback (FB) loop including KCs and GN. We used a model of the locust olfactory system to compare the effects of feed-forward and feedback inhibition. Both motifs were able to maintain sparse responses of KCs and provide optimal odor discrimination. However, only feedback inhibition was able to create a response consistent with in vivo data. These findings suggest that feedback is the primary source of inhibition onto KCs.
The diagnosis of lyssavirus infection, including rabies in animals and humans, is based on post-mortem laboratory confirmation using techniques such as direct immunofluorescence and virus isolation. However, molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) are increasingly used for diagnosing rabies in humans and for epidemiological analyses. We developed a combined real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR ) method for pan-lyssavirus detection. This method is based on two technologies: a probe-based TaMan RT-qPCR for detecting RAB species ( panAB RT-q ) and a second using intercalating dye SYBR to detect other lyss species ( panly-q ). We evaluated this assay with a large panel of animal samples covering almost all genetic variability at the species level and extended to all lyss species characterized to date. This method was also evaluated for human rabies diagnosis on 211 samples (76 positive and 135 negative ) including saliva, skin and brain biops. It detected all human rabies cases and confirmed sensitivity of skin biopsy (91. 5% ) and saliva (54 ) for intra-vit diagnosis of human rabies. Finally, this method was implemented in two rab reference laboratories in endemic countries ( Cambodia and Morocco ).
Tset-transmitted trypanosomiasis is a significant threat to pig farming in Ghana. In 2007, more than 50% of domestic pigs in the Eastern Region were lost to the disease. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets were tested as a control method. Two villages were selected: one as control with 14 pigies and one experimental with 24 pigies protected by insecticide-treated nets. The nets were 100 cm high, 150 denier polyester with 100 mg/m deltamethrin and UV protector attached to timber and planks. Tset densities were monitored bi-monthly with geoferenced traps. The protected village showed more than 90% reduction in two months and further 95% in subsequent months. The control village showed only seasonal variations. Fifty pigs from each village were ear-tagged and treated with diminazene acate 3.5 mg/kg after blood samples were taken. Initial trypan prevalence was 76% and 72 in protected and control, and 16% in protected and 84 in control three months. After six 8% protected were infected and 60 in control.
Biomedical articles published between 2000 and 2014 were assessed for reproducibility and transparency. The study found that only one article provided a full protocol and none made raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare ( n = 4 ) and only 16 had data included in a systematic review or meta-analysis. The majority did not mention funding or conflicts of interest. Between 200 and 201, the percentage of articles with no funding statement decreased from 94. 4% to 34.6 and the percentage reporting conflicts (0 in 200,15.4 in 201 ) or none (5.6 in200,50. in201 ) increased. Articles in clinical medicine were twice as likely to have no funding information and private funding compared to other fields.
Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of primary pneumonic plague, a highly lethal disease with mortality rates approaching 100%. The disease progression of pneumonic plague is biphasic, with an initial pre-inflammatory phase characterized by bacterial growth in the absence of host inflammation, followed by a pro-inflammatory phase marked by neutrophil influx, inflammatory cytokine storm and tissue destruction. Using a FRET-based probe to quantify effector protein injection by Y. pestis type III secretion system, we show that bacteria target alve macrophages early during mouse infection, followed by switch in host preference to neutrophils. We demonstrate that neutrophil influx is unable to limit bacterial growth in lung and is responsible for severe inflammation during pro-inflammatory phase.
Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by Leishmania parasites, transmitted by sandflies. One of the challenges in studying visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) is diagnosing asymptomatic carriers. This study evaluated the performance of serological tests to identify asymptomatic VL in a cohort of 136 participants from an urban area in Southeast Brazil with a two-year follow-up period. Blood samples were collected from 136 participants ( 97 positive and 39 negative by PCR ) and clinically none progressed from asymptomatic to disease. Controls included blood from 22 healthy individuals and 8 patients with kala-azar. Molecular tests were performed: PCR with Leish generic primer followed by hybridization with L. infant probe and PCR with L donovani specific primer. Plasma were tested by ELISA with three antigens: L infant, amazon, and r39 recombin protein. The presence of Leishmania was confirmed by molecular in all kala patients and 117 ( 86% ) of the cohort. Kala patients showed high reactivity in ELISA whereas asymptomatic presented low reactivity against antigens tested. Compared to molecular, amazon and infant antigens showed higher sensitivity (49.6% and 41.% ) than r39 (26.5% ) ; however r39 had higher specificity (73.7 ) than amazon (52.6 ) and infant (36.8 ). There was low agreement among antig used (kappa0.10 ) Serological tests were inaccurate for asymptomatic compared molecular; this could lead misclassification in studies.
Retrotransposons are abundant in mammalian genomes due to their ability to amplify in pluripotent and germ cells. However, mechanisms that silence retrotransons in germ and pluripotent cells are important for limiting the accumulation of repetitive elements in the genome during evolution. Although silencing of individual retrotransons is relatively well-stud, many retrotransons are seldom analysed and silencing in germ, pluripotent or somatic cells remains poorly understood. Here, we show that cryptic repetitive probes present in Illumina and Affymetrix gene microarray platforms can accurately monitor retrotrans expression. This approach has allowed us to identify histone deetylase Hd1 as a component of retrotrans silencing machinery in mouse embryonic cells and determine retrotrans targets of Hd1 in these cells. We also identify retrotrans that are targets of retro silencing mechanisms such as DNA methylation, E-mediated histone modification and Ring1/E-containing polycomb repressive complexes in embryonic cells. Our analysis suggests that multiple silencing mechanisms target retrotrans in embryonic cells, different genomic copies of the same retro can be differentially sensitive to silencing, and define retro elements targeted by silencing machineries.
In Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 ( CRY ) is a key regulator of flowering time in response to light. C1 ( CRY-interacting bHL 1 ) is a bHL protein that interacts with CRY in response to blue light to activate the transcription of FT (Flowering Locus T ). In vitro, C1 binds the canonical-box (CGT, also referred to G-box ) with higher affinity than non-canonical-box (CAN ) sequences. However, in vivo,1 binds the chromatin region FT promoter, which contains non-canonical sequences. We show thatRY also interacts with least1 in response blue, but not darkness or other wavelengths. Genetic analysis demonstrates1,1,2,4,5 act redundantly activate FT and are positive regulatorsRY mediated flowering. Importantly,1 and other form heterodimers and some heterodimers have higher affinity than homodimers non-canonical-box in vitro assays.

Refugee arrivals to the United States from Asia are at risk of intestinal parasitic infections such as hookworm, Trichuris trich, Ascaris lumicoid, and Strongloides steral. These infections are rare in the United States and may be underdiagnosed or misagnosed, leading to serious consequences. This study examined the costs and benefits of overseas presumptive treatment of parasitic diseases vs domestic screening/treatment vs no program. An economic model was developed to estimate the cost and health impacts of four interventions on an annual cohort of 27, 700 U. S.bound Asian refugees: 1) “No, 2) “Domestic Screening and Treatment,3) “Overse Albazole Ivermect” presumptive, and 4 “se Albazole Domestic for Strongloides. The “No” option is the least expensive ($165,923 ) and least effective (145 outpatient,4 hospital,0 deaths over 60-year for one-year ). “se Albazole Iverect” ($418,824 ) is less than “Domestic Treatment ($3,832,572 ) “se Alb Domestic Stronglo ($2,182,483 ). The most effective option is “se Alb Iect, which reduces outpatient deaths hospital by 80% at estimated cost $458,718 per death averted $2,21924/QAL/year relative “No”. Overse presum treatment for U.bound refugees is cost-effective less expensive domestic programs. Addition of Iect to Alb reduces Stronglo and disseminated.
Microsporidian parasites are a type of obligate intracellular pathogen that infect nematodes, including Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we report the discovery of a new microidian species, Nematoda displere, that displays a unique tissue tropism compared to previously described parasites of this host. Nematida displere can invade and replicate in multiple tissues of C. elegans, including the epidermis, muscle, and intestine. However, the majority of replication occurs in the epider and muscle, with little replication in the intestine. This is in contrast to two closely related species, Nematida paris and Nematida sp. 1, which exclusively invade and replicate in the intestine. We characterized the life cycle of Nemat displere, including pathogen entry, intracellular replication, and exit. The genome of Nemat displere was compared to Nemat paris and Nemat sp.1, revealing that Nemat displere is the earliest diverging species of the Nematida genus. Over 10% of proteins encoded by the Nemat displ genome belong to a species-specific family of RING-domain proteins of unknown function. These proteins may mediate interactions with the host. Altogether, this system provides a whole-animal model to investigate factors responsible for pathogen growth in different tissue niches.
Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CS) is a protein essential for transcription-coupled DNA repair, and mutations in CS are associated with Cockayne syndrome, a devastating disease characterized by premature aging, sun sensitivity, and neurological and developmental defects. CS belongs to the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler family, but the extent to which CS remodels chromatin and whether this is utilized in repair is unknown. Here, we show that CS repositions nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner in vitro and this is greatly enhanced by N1-like histone chaper, which we identify as CS-binding partners. By mapping domains and analyzing CS derivatives, we demonstrate that chromatin remodeling by CS and N1-like chaper is required for transcription-cou repair. Moreover, we show that chromatin and repair mediated by CS are separable activities.
Genome-wide maps of epigenetic variation have not yet been fully elucidated in humans. We identified clusters of CpG dinucleotides with high inter-individual epigen variation, termed Variably Methylated Regions ( VMRs, in five purified cell types. VMRs preferentially occur at enhancers and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs). The majority of VMRs have high heritability, but a subset of VMs show low herit and are correlated between cell types, enriched for transcription factor binding sites and biological pathways relevant to each tissue. For example, in T cells we identified a network of co-regulated VMs enriched for genes in T-cell activation; in fibroblasts a network of co-reg VM comprising four HO gene clusters for growth control; in neurons a network of VM enriched for synaptic signaling. We cultured genetically-identical fibroblasts under varying conditions and demonstrated that some VM networks are responsive to environment, with methylation at these loci changing in trans dependent on growth. These environmentally-responsive VM showed strong enrichment for imprinted loci (p<10−80 ). Our study provides a map of epigen variation in the genome showing both genetic and environmental causes this variation.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that can be difficult to diagnose in the early stages of illness. Serological tests for IgM and IgG are used to differentiate between primary and secondary infections. Dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 ( NS1 ) is an early marker for acute deng and is present between days 1–9 post onset of illness. However, seroconversion can be difficult to detect in serum. To evaluate the performance of a newly developed Panbio Dengue Early Rapid test for NS1, we determined if it can improve sensitivity when used in combination with a commercial Ig/Ig test. We evaluated the performance of Deng Early in Vietnam with 198 laboratory-confirmed positive and 100 negative samples, and in Malaysia with 263 laboratory-confirmed and 30 samples. In Vietnam, the test had 69. 2% sensitivity (95% CI 62.8 to 75.6 ) and 96. % specificity (95 CI 92.2 to 99.8 ). In Malaysia was similar with 68.9 sensitivity (95 CI 61.8 to 76.1 ) and 96.7 specificity ( CI 82.8 to 99.9 ) compared to RT-PCR. Importantly, when Deng Early was used with Ig test sensitivity increased to 93. When tests were compared each day post onset of illness, there was differentiation between antigen and antibody.
Trans is a new computational method for detecting conserved helices of functional RNA structures, including transient, pseudo-knotted and alternative structures. Unlike existing RNA prediction methods, which assume a unique functional structure and do not predict features required for folding in vivo, Trans aims to understand how functional structures form in vivo. It is based on the hypothesis that evolutionarily related genes fold similarly in vivo. We have developed Trans to detect conserved helices of high statistical significance. We present a comprehensive evaluation showing that Trans can predict structural features of reference structures, including pseudo-kotted ones and alternative configurations. It can also identify unstructured subsequences bound by molecules and provide evidence for new helices defining folding pathways. This supports the notion that homologous sequences do not only assume similar structures but also fold similarly. Finally, we show that Trans predicted features differ from thermodynamic ones. Unlike existing folding methods, Trans works in a comparative way. This has the advantage of highlighting conserved features and not requiring detailed cellular knowledge but the disadvantage of not predicting function over time.
The Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant species, has a complex immune network that protects it from pathogenic microbes. This network must function even when components are targeted by pathogen effectors. We used a network reconstitution strategy to study the immune network that mediates Pattern-Triggered-Immunity. We disassembled and reassembled the Arabidopsis immune network step-by-step and resolved systems-level mechanisms underlying the transcriptome response to flagellin-22 ( fl22 ). We found widespread interactions among sub-networks, called sectors, in the fl22-responsive transcriptome. Many of these interactions result in buffering. Regulatory mechanisms show how jasmonate ( JA ), ethylene ( ET ), phytoalexin-deficient 4 ( PAD ) and salicylate ( SA ) sectors control transcriptional response to fl22. We show that many regulatory mechanisms are not detectable by traditional single-gene null-mut analysis. Similar to pathogenic perturbations, nullut effects on signaling can be buffered by the network.
In Drosophila, the central nervous system develops from a monolayered neuroepithelial sheet. In a first step, patter mechanisms subdivide the uniform epithelia into domains, allowing for an increase in neuronal diversity in a tightly spatial and temporal manner. The neuroepith patterning of the embryonic optic placode gives rise to the larval eye primord, consisting of two photoreceptor ( PR ) types, primary and secondary, as well as the opticobe prim, which develops into prominent ganglia during lar and pupal stages. Here, we characterize a genetic network that regulates the balance between lar eye and optic precursors, as well as primary and secondary precursors. The proneural factor Aton ( A ) specifies lar precursors, while the orphan receptor Tailless ( T ) is crucial for specification of prec. The Hedgehog and Not signaling pathways act upstream of A and T to coordinate specification in a timely manner. The placement of the boundary between A and T is required to control the number of primary and secondary precursors. Not signaling also controls a cell decision, acting in a cascade of transcription interactions to define PR identity.
Human β-defensin 1 (hBD1) is a ubiquitously expressed endogenous antimicrobial peptide that exhibits qualitatively distinct activities between its oxidized (h1ox) and reduced (red) forms. Here, we explore the antimicrobial mechanisms of h1. Using electron microscopy, we detected a previously unknown net-like structure surrounding bacteria treated with the reduced but not oxidized form of h1. A transmigration assay demonstrated that h1-derived nets capture bacteria and inhibit bacterial transmigration independent of killing. The presence of nets completely prevented migration of h1-resistant pathogens and were stable in the presence of human duodenal secretion with a high amount of proteases. In contrast, cysteines are necessary for net formation. This redox-dependent serves as an additional mechanism of action for h1 and differs from formation by other defensins such as Paneth-derived human-defin 6 (h6). While h1red and hox have distinct antimicrobial functions, only the form provides additional protection by entrapping bacteria in extracellular structures preventing invasion.
Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 are genetic disorders caused by mutations in the inositol 5-phosphatase OC1 (OCRL1) gene. While the cellular functions of OC1 are well understood, the molecular basis for the renal tubulopathy seen in both disorders, characterized by low molecular weight proteinuria, is unknown. Here, we show that OC1 deficiency causes a defect in endocyt in the zebraf pronephric tub, a model for the mammalian renal tub. This coincides with reduced levels of the scavenger receptor megal and its accumulation in endytic compartments, consistent with reduced recycling within the endytic pathway. We also observe reduced numbers of early endytic compartments and enlarged vacuolar endosomes in the sub-apical pronephric cells. Cell polarity in the pronephric tub is unaffected in mutant embryos. OC1-deficient embryos exhibit mild ciliogenesis, but this cannot account for observed endocytic defect. Catalytic activity of OC1 is required for renal endytic and endytic can be rescued by suppression of P5. These results indicate that OC1 is required for endytic in vivo and support hypothesis that endytic defects are responsible for renalulopathy in Lowe and Dent-2. Moreover, our results indicate P5 as potential therapeutic for Lowe and Dent disease.
Rift Valley fever (RV) is a zoonotic disease transmitted by ticks that affects livestock and humans. In recent years, evidence of RV transmission during interepid periods has been reported in parts of Africa. We studied the presence and determinants of interepid RV transmission in the Kilom river valley, Tanzania. A cross-sectional serosurvey was conducted in cattle and sheep from May to August 2011, approximately four years after the 2007 RV outbreak in Tanzania. The presence of RV virus (RVV) was determined using ELISA kits detecting IgM and IgG antibodies in serum. Information about determinants was obtained through interviews with herd owners. Overall seroprevalence was 11. 3% ( n=168 ); 5.5% in animals born after the 2007 outbreak and 22.7% in present during the outbreak. There was a linear increase in prevalence in postepid cohorts. Nine ELISA positive samples were also positive for RVV IgM indicating recent infection. The distribution of serreval exhibited hotspots. There was no difference in serreval in animals after the epidemic (6.1% vs.4% for females and males, p.158 ) whereas it was significant during the outbreak (26.%.% for females and males,<.001 ). Animals >15 km from the plain were more likely to have antibodies than <5 (1.92;.04–.56 ). Species, breed, herd, grazing and altitude were not associated with seros. These findings indicate postepid transmission of RVV in the area.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, is an obligate intracellular pathogen that has conserved a contractile vacuole complex ( CVC ) to regulate osmolarity. We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to delineate the contribution of the CVC to the traffic of glycosylosphatidylinositol ( GPI )-anchored proteins to the plasma membrane of the parasite and promote invasion. T. cruzi Rab11 ( GFPcTab11 ) localized to the C, while a dominant negative mutant ( GFPcTabDN ) localized to the cytosol and epastigotes expressing this mutant were less responsive to hypo- and hyperosmotic stress. Parasites were still able to differentiate into metacylic forms and infect cells. GPI-anch transialase ( TTS ) of the 60–200 KDa family and trypastigote surface antigen (TSS II ) co-localized with GFPcTab to the C during intramastigote to trypastote transformation. Parasites expressing GFPcTabDN prevented TS, but not other proteins, from reaching the plasma and were less infect compared to wild cells. Incubation of mutants in presence of exogenous recombin active TS and sialic donor before infecting cells partially rescued infectivity trastotes.
A phase III clinical trial was conducted to compare the immunogenicity and safety of a purified chick-embryo cell rabies vaccine (PCV) administered according to a shortened post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) 4-site/1-week intradermal regimen with the currently recommended 2-site Thai Red Cross (TR) regimen. The trial enrolled healthy individuals ≥1 year of age and randomized into four groups to receive intradermal PCV according to one of the two regimens or without human rabies immunoglobulin (HR) administration at visit in adults. Rabies virus neutral antibody (RV) concentrations and percentages of participants with RV concentrations ≥0. 5 IU were assessed up to day (D) 365 post-vaccination. Noninferiority of the 4-site/week regimen to 2/TR was demonstrated at D49, the lower of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for difference in percentage participants with RV concentrations was-5. Of 443 participants receiving 4/week, 88 received HR; 442 received 2/TR (88 HR ). All achieved RV concentrations D14. At49, difference percentage with RV concentrations between 4/week and 2/TR was-1 (95CI-2–0 ; thus noninferior was concluded. RV geometric concentrations IU in 4/week and IU in 2/TR at14, subsequently declined all. RV concentrations were lower with HR administration than without. The regimens had similar profiles Of 15 adverse reported 4/week and 19/TR, none were vaccination.
The salience network (SN), anchored in the anterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortex, plays a crucial role in the detection of goal-relevant events and facilitation of access to appropriate cognitive resources. We investigated the spatiotemporal organization of the SN using subsecond resolution multisession fMRI data from the Humanome Project and graph-theoretical techniques. The SN demonstrated the highest flexibility in time-vary connectivity with the frontopari network (FPN), cing–opular network (CON), and ventral and dorsal attention (VAN) networks. Functional interactions of the SN were the most spatially varied in the brain. SN maintained a consistently high level of centrality over time, indicating it is a hub for facilitating cross-network interactions. Connectivity profiles of SN were distinct from other prefrontal control systems. Temporal flexibility of SN uniquely predicted individual differences in cognitive. These results were also observed in a second dataset, demonstrating robustness of findings.
Viral particles of the non-enveloped virus Simian virus 40 (SV40) are released from the host cell by a poorly understood process. The virus assembles in the nucleus and must be released from the cell without being encapsulated by cellular membranes. This process appears to involve the insertion of viral proteins into cellular membranes, making them permeable to large molecules. A newly identified SV40 gene product, VP4, is expressed late in the viral cycle and corresponds to the time of cell lysis. We investigated the role of this protein in viral release by expressing VP as a GST fusion protein in bacteria. Purified VP was found to bind membranes and disrupt them. VP perforated membranes by interacting with the bilayer demonstrated by assays and release of markers into unilamellar vesicles or liposomes. The hydrophobic domain of VP was essential for binding and disruption. VP displayed preference for membranes of lipid composition of plasma over nuclear membranes. Phatidylethanol, found in bacterial membranes, inhibited membrane activity of VP. Disruption of membranes by VP involved formation of ∼3 nm pores in mammalian cells including permissive SV host. These results support a role of VP as virop in perforation of membranes to trigger SV release.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Current control of the disease is hampered by the absence of antivirals or vaccine, resulting in an estimated half of the world population at risk of infection. The immune response to DENV is not fully understood and better knowledge of it is recognized as main challenge for vaccine development. We previously reported that a DNA vaccine containing the signal sequence from human plasmin activator (tPA) fused to DENV NS1 gene (pcANS) induced protection against DENV in mice. We aimed to elucidate the contribution of cellular and humoral responses elicited by this candidate for immunity. pcANS induced robust protection against DENV, considerable levels of anti-NS antibodies and cell responses. Passive immunization with anti-NS antibodies conferred protection in mice with low virus load (4LD50), which was abated with increase of viral dose (40LD50). pcANS also induced CD+ and CD+ T cells. We detected production of IF-γ and cytotoxic by CD+ T induced by vaccine, although contribution in protection not evident compared CD+. Depletion CD+ in mice completely abolished protection. Transfer experiments revealed animals receiving CD+ cells with anti- antiserum, both from vaccinated, survived infection with rates not different pcANS-immunized.
Streptocococci are Gram-positive bacteria that rely on cell-to-cell communication to regulate important processes such as sporulation, conjugation, and virulence. They use extracellular signaling peptides to elicit a response, either by triggering a two-component phosphore or by binding to cytoplasmic effectors. The latter comprise the RNPP family ( Rgg, Rap, Npr, Prg and Plc ), whose members regulate important processes such as sporulation, conjugation and virulence. RNPP are increasingly considered as targets for new antibacterial agents. These proteins are characterized by a TPR peptide-binding domain, except Rap proteins also contain an N-terminal H-type DNA-binding domain and display transcriptional activity. Here, we elucidate the structure-function of ComR, a new member of the RNPP, which controls competence for natural transformation in streptocci. Com is activated by the binding of its pheromone XIP, the form of the Com/sX-inducing-peptide ComS. The structure of Com from Streptoccus thermus combined with mutational and in vivo assays allows us to propose an original mechanism of Com regulation. XIP induces release of the sequestered H domain and Com dimerization to allow DNA binding. Importantly, we bring evidence that this mechanism is conserved and specific to Com orthologues, demonstrating Com is not Rap as proposed, but instead a member of the RNPP. In addition, identification of X and Com residues important for activation constitutes a step towards antagonistic strategies to control exchanges streptocci.
The pentameric ligand-gated ion channel ELIC is a member of a large family of ligand-gated ion channels that has recently been characterized at high resolution by X-ray crystallography. However, detailed investigation of its function has been hampered by the lack of knowledge of its activating ligands. Here we describe the characterization of ELIC by electrophysiology and X-ray crystalraphy. We show that ELIC is activated by a class of primary amines, including the neurotransmitter GABA, at micromolar to millimolar concentrations. These ligands bind to a conserved site and evoke currents that slowly desensitize over time. The protein forms cation channels with properties that resemble the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The single channel conductance and comparably simple behavior make ELIC an attractive model to study mechanisms of ion conduction and gating in this family of neurotransmitter receptors.
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common skin condition that often precedes the development of asthma in individuals. However, the mechanism underlying progression from AD to asthma is unclear. Here, we show that mice with skin-barrier defects develop AD-like skin inflammation and are susceptible to asthma. Furthermore, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSL), overexpressed by skin keratinocytes is the systemic driver of bronial hyperresponsiveness. In an AD-like model, mice with keratin-specific deletion of RBP develop high levels of TSL. Antigen challenge to the lung of RBP–deficient mice resulted in asthmatic phenotype seen in wild-type littermates. Elimination of TSL signaling blocked the march, demonstrating high TSL levels required to sensitize lung to inflammation. Furthermore, K-TSL mice maintained high TSL without skin pathology. Importantly epidermal T was sufficient to trigger march, sensitizing lung to allergens in absence epicutaneous sensitization.
The genome of Thermotoga marima, a phylogenetically deep-branching, hypermophilic bacterium, has been characterized using an approach that integrates multiple omics data with bioinformatics tools. Experimental data were generated for whole-genome resequencing, transcription start site (SS) determination, transcriptome profiling, and proteome profiling. These datasets were analyzed in combination with bioinformatics tools to improve gene annotation, elucidate transcription units (TUs), identify putative noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), and determine promoters and ribosome sites. The analysis revealed distinctive properties of T. marima genome relative to other bacteria. The genome has a high number of genes per TU (3. 3), a paucity of putative ncRNAs (12), and TUs with multiple SS (3.7% ). Quantitative analysis of promoters and ribosome sites showed increased conservation relative other. The 5′UTRs follow atypical length comprised “short”5′Rs (11–17) and “common”5′Rs (26–32). Transcription regulation is limited by lack intergenic space for majority TUs. Lastly, a fraction annotated genes expressed independent growth and linear mRNA/protein observed (Pearson r=0.63, p2×10−16-test ).
Visual perception is highly susceptible to contextual influences. In this study, we investigated how contextual bars affect the perception of a target bar at the center of a display. Observers judged whether a bar was present at the center of a display given a weak or strong contrast at the target location with or without other bars. We found that observers are more likely to perceive a target when the context has weak rather than strong contrast. When the context perceptually groups with the target, weak contextual bars bias observers to perceive target relative to without context, as if filling the target. Meanwhile, high-contrast bars, regardless of grouping with target, bias observers to perceive no target. A Bayesian model of visual inference accounts for the data, illustrating that context influences perception in two ways: (1) biasing observers’ prior that target should be present according to grouping principles, and (2) biasing observers’ model of likely contrasts caused by target. According to this model, our data suggest context does not influence perceived contrast despite bias to perceive target, suggesting areas beyond primary cortex are responsible for inferences.
Defectors can sometimes create conditions that rescue cooperation from defector-induced destruction. This is counterintuitive because cooperation is vulnerable to exploitation by defectors, which enjoy a fitness advantage by consuming the common good without contributing. However, defector-induced population collapse can lead to small population size, which is known to favor cooperation. This is because small size increases variability in cooperator frequency across locations. Individuals in cooperator locations grow more than in defector locations, allowing cooperators to outgrow defectors globally. This raises the possibility that defectors can lead to conditions that rescue cooperation from defector destruction. We demonstrate this using an individual-based model of birth, death, migration, and mutation. During defector collapse, def occasionally go extinct before cooperators by chance, allowing cooperators to grow. Empty locations, either pre-existing or created by def-induced extinction, favor cooperation because they allow cooperators but not defectors to grow. These factors lead to the counterintuitive result that initial defectors allow better survival of cooperation compared to defectors absent.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes infections in patients with altered epithelial barriers. In this study, we show that P. aeruginosa interacts with polarized epithelium and adheres almost exclusively at multi-cellular junctions, where it attaches to extruded apoptotic or apoptotic cells. This tropism is independent of cell death type, as P aerugin also binds necrotic cells. We further show that aerugin is internalized through efferocytosis, a process in which epithelial cells engulf and dispose of extruded apoptotic cells. Intracellularly, along apoptotic cell debris, aerugin inhabits eocytic phagosome that acquires lysosomal features and is killed. We propose that elimination of aerugin through eocytosis is part of host defense mechanism.
During Drosophila embryonic development, the gonad is formed from two cell types: primordial germ cells (PGCs) and somatic gonadal precursors (SGPs). PGs form at the posterior of the blastoderm and are carried inside the embryo during gastrulation. To reach SGs, PGs must traverse the midgut and migrate through the meserm. We investigated the role of the hedgehog (hh) pathway shifted (sh) in PG migration. sh encodes a secreted protein that transmits Hh through the proteoglycan matrix after release from basolateral membranes of H expressing cells in the wing disc. sh is expressed in gonadal meserm, and loss and gain-of-function experiments show it is required for PG migration. The hmg-dependent isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway generates the PG attractant by SGs and other tissues when hmg is ectically expressed. We show that this attract depends on sh as well as a second pathway g1. The PG attractant is linked to H by showing that ectopic hmg in the nervous promotes release of H from cells into the mesermal layer where H contacts PGs. H potentiation of H by hmg depends on cholesterol.
Vaccines are being developed to protect against HIV infection and control the virus replication in the body. To understand how these vaccines work, it is important to know how the immune system fights HIV. In people who control HIV for a long time, the immune cells that kill HIV-infected cells are more active than those who progress to disease. Here, we measured how well immune cells kill HIV-infected cells in people who got a vaccine and compared to those who are HIV-negative and those who progress to disease. The vaccine was based on adenovirus type 5, a common virus that infects humans. We measured how well immune cells killed HIV-infected cells in people who got the vaccine and compared to those who are HIV-negative and those who progress. We found that people who got the vaccine had immune cells that killed HIV-infected cells, but not as well as those who control HIV for a long. However, people who got vaccine and had HLA class I alleles B27, B57 or B58 had immune cells that killed HIV-infected cells better than those who progress. These alleles are associated with controlling HIV in people who are infected.
Shared intentionality is a key factor in the evolution of humans’ unique cognitive abilities. We model the coevolution of intentional behavior and cumulative culture, showing that rapid technological advance goes hand in hand with emergence of ability to participate in intentional behavior. In absence of opportunities for significant technological improvement, ability to undertake intentional behavior is selected against. We provide unified mechanism for emergence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans, as well as cause for species diversity in prevalence of such behavior.
Oligoastoteratozoospermia and Infertility in Mice Deficient for mi-34/c and mi-449 Loci.
Escherichia coli Nle 191 (EcN) is a bacterium that has been used therapeutically for over a century, but the determinants of its probiotic properties remain elusive. Ec produces two siderophore-microins (Mcc) that are responsible for antagonistic activity against other Enterobacteriaceae. Ec also synthesizes the genotoxin colactin encoded by the p island. Colactin is a virulence factor and putative proarcinogenic compound. We aimed to decouple antagonistic activity of Ec from genotoxic activity. We demonstrated that p-encoded ClP, peptase that activates colactin is required for antagonistic activity of Ec. Analysis of ClP mutants revealed that activity is linked to transmembrane helices of ClP and not periplasm peptase domain, indicating transmembrane domain is involved in aspect Mcc biosynthesis or secretion. Single amino substitution in ClP inactivates genotoxic but maintains antagon activity. In vivo salmonelis model, this mutant reduced clinical signs and fecal shedding of Salmonella similarly wild type, whereas ClP mutant could not protect nor outcomp pathogen. ClP-dependent antibacterial effect also observed in vitro other Ec strains carry truncated form M gene and p island. In such, siderore-M synthesis also required glucosyltransfer I involved salochelin production. This interplay colact, salochelin, and biosynthetic pathways suggests genomic were co-selected played role evolution Ec from phyroup.
Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes cryptococcal meningitis and is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. Cryptoccal glycans are required for survival in the host and pathogenesis. Most glycans are synthesized in the secretory pathway, although precursors are made in the cytosol. Nucle sugar transporters solve this problem by exchanging nucleotide sugars for nucleoside phosphates. The major virulence factor of C. neoans is anti-phoc capsule that is displayed on surface; capsule is also shed and impede host response. Here we show that U1 and U2 transport UDPxy, although exhibit distinct localization patterns and parameters. Both also transport UDPgalactose. U1 and U2 are required for xylose incorporation into capsule and necessary for C to cause disease in mice, although not for viability in context.
Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a major public health burden in developing countries. To control and eliminate NTDs, disease risk estimates are key to target interventions and monitoring. However, currently, there is a lack of a global database providing access to NTD data that is constantly updated and can be utilized by researchers and disease managers. We describe the development of a georeferenced database that can be employed for disease modeling and control of NTDs. We searched the literature and contacted Ministries of Health and institutions in schistosiasis-endemic countries for location-specific data. Data were extracted, geferenced, and stored in a database with a web interface allowing free access and management. Our database contains more than 12, 000 gefer schosomiasis locations from 35 African countries available at http://www.nt. org. The database is expanded to include other NTDs, e. g. soil-transmitted helthiasis and leishiasis. An open, spatial NTD database offers opportunities for disease modeling, control, monitoring, and surveillance. Moreover, it allows detailed analyses of disease distribution in space and time. We demonstrate the establishment of a global NTD database is feasible and should be expanded.
Helminth Infections Do Not Exacerbate Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection in Cotton Rats  
Helminth infections are known to induce a Th2 immune response and immunoregulatory environment, which can suppress Th1 immunity necessary for Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MT ) control. We hypothesized that helminth infections may exacerbate MT infection. Co-infections were conducted in cotton rats, the natural host for filarial nematode Litomoides sigmodis and excellent model for MT. Immunological, histological, and mycobacterial studies were performed two months after MT challenge in cotton with and without L sigmodis. Sple cell proliferation and interferon gamma response to purified derivative were similar between coinfected and MT animals. In contrast to our hypothesis, MT loads and lung granuloma size were not increased in coinf animals. These findings suggest that filaria infections do not exacerbate MT in cotton model.
In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the DEG/ENa channel family represents one of the largest families of ion channels. Although the physiological functions of these proteins are poorly understood, we found that the DE/ENa channel pp23 is expressed in a subpopulation of sexually dimorphic gustatory-like chemosensory bristles. These bristles are distinct from those expressing feeding-related gustatory receptors. Disrupting pp23 or inhibiting activity of pp23-expressing neurons did not alter gustatory responses. Instead, blocking pp23-positive neurons or mutating pp23 delayed the initiation and reduced the intensity of male courtship. Furthermore, pp23 mutations altered the response of males to the female-specific pheromone 7, ( Z ) 11 ( Z )Heptadiene. These data indicate that pp23 and cells play an important role in the sensory system that determines sexual behavior inrosila.
Mitochondrial tRNAs are imported from the cytosol into mitochondria to ensure proper translation. This process is conserved across diverse phyla, including protozoa, fungi, plants, and humans. However, the mechanisms of tRNA import are not well understood. In the unicellular alga Chlamdomonas, a correlation was found between mitochondrial cod usage and the amount of imported tRNAs. This led to the hypothesis that tRNA import might be dynamic and adapt to the mitochondrial content. To test this, we modified the Chlamdomonas mitochondrial genome by introducing mutations in cod usage. This resulted in reduced levels of translation as well as decreased activities of respiratory complexes. These effects were linked to limitations of tRNAs in mitochondria. This suggests that tRNA import cannot rapidly respond to genetic changes and is not dynamic. Rather, steady levels of tRN in mitochond result from co-evolution between tRNA import and translation machinery.
Diabetes is a major public health problem affecting nearly 30 million people in the United States, 10% of the population, and 84 million are prediabetic. Current methods for quantifying blood glucose dysregulation in diabetes and predabetes are limited by single-point measurements or average measures of overall glycemia. We used continuous glucose monitoring ( CG ) to evaluate the frequency of postprand glucose elevations, types, and patterns between individuals given an identical challenge. Measurement of insulin secretion highlights that underlying physiology is highly variable between individuals. We developed a framework to group individuals according to specific patterns called “glucotypes” that reveal heterogeneity within traditional categories of regulation. Importantly, individuals considered normogc by standard exhibit high variability using CG, with levels reaching predabetic and diabetic 15% and 2% of time, respectively. We show that dysregulation by CG is more prevalent and heterogeneous than thought and can individuals considered normc by standard, and patterns reflect underlying physiology. The interindividual variability in responses to meals highlights the nature of regulation. We developed a model for identifying mechanisms of dysulation and a web for visualizing user-uploaded profile and classifying into glucotypes.
Plant innate immunity is regulated by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades. The Raf-like MAP kinase kinase (MAPK) EDR1 negatively regulates plant defense and cell death responses. Here, we show that EDR1 negatively regulates the MK4/MK5PK/MPK3/MP6 MAPK cascade in Arabidopsis. We found that edr mutants have highly activated MPK/MPK activity and higher MP/MPK protein levels than wild type. EDR physically interacts with MK4 and MK5, and this requires the N-terminal domain of EDR. E1 also affects MK4/5 protein levels. In addition, mpk, mkk and mkk mutations suppress edr-mediated resistance and overexpression of MK or MK causes edr-like resistance and mildew-induced cell death.
Infectious diseases are a major cause of mortality worldwide, resulting in millions of deaths annually. To develop effective prevention and control strategies, it is necessary to have reliable computational tools to understand disease dynamics and predict future cases. These tools can be used by policy makers to make informed decisions. In this study, we developed a computational framework based on Gaussian processes to perform spatiotemporal prediction of infectious diseases. We exploited the structure of similarity in our formulation to obtain an efficient implementation. We tested our framework on the problem of Crimean–Congo–hemorrhagic fever cases between 2004 and 2015 in Turkey. We showed that our Gaussian formulation obtained better results than frequently used machine learning algorithms ( i. e., random forests and boosted trees ) under temporal, spatial, and spatiemporal scenarios.
Rift Valley fever (RV) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis that causes significant morbidity and mortality in humans and livestock in Africa and the Middle East. Outbreaks of RV are sporadic and associated with both seasonal and socioeconomic factors. Here, we propose a three-patch model to investigate the transmission of RV virus (RVV) among ruminants with spatial movements. Our findings indicate that in Northeast Africa, human activities associated with the Eid al-Adha festival along with climatic factors such as rainfall and hydrological variations contribute to the transmission and dispersal of the pathogen. Moreover, sporadic outbreaks may occur when two events occur: 1 ) abundant livestock are recruited into areas at risk of RV due to demand for the festival and 2 ) abundant mosquitoes emerge. These factors have impacts on severity of RV outbreaks. Our results present the dynamics of the pathogen over short and long periods, particularly during festival time.
Anthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis anthracis that affects both humans and animals. In Azerbaijan, we assessed the spatio-temporal changes in human anthrax occurrence from 1984 to 2010. We analyzed data on livestock anthrax outbreaks, vaccination efforts, and human anthrax incidence during the Soviet and post-Sov governance periods. We used spatial analysis, cluster detection, and weighted least squares regression to evaluate changes in the spatio-temporal distribution of anthrax. Our results showed a 11. 95% increase in annual incidence from 1984 to 1995, followed by a 35.24% decline after the initiation of livestock vaccination in 1996. We also found geographic variation in the distribution of cases; they were primarily concentrated in the west in the early period and shifted eastward as time progressed. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the distribution of anthrax in Azerbaijan underwent marked changes. Despite decreases in incidence, continued control measures in livestock are needed to mitigate its occurrence.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been shown to modulate the activity of voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels, which are proteins that respond to changes in membrane potential by allowing K+ ions to cross the membrane. PUFAs can induce channel opening by modifying the voltage-sensitivity, providing a potential treatment for refractory epilepsy through a ketogenic diet. While PUFs have been reported to influence the gating mechanism by electrostatic interactions with the voltage-sensor (VSD) domain, the exact PUFA-protein interactions are still unknown. Here, we report the interactions between the Shaker KV channel in open and closed states and a PU-enrich lipid bilayer using microsecond molecular simulations. We determined a putative PU binding site in the open state of the channel at the protein-lip interface in the vicinity of the extracellular halves of the S and S helices of V. The PU tail covered a wide range of non-specific hydrophobic interactions in the hydroobic core of the proteinip interface, while the carboxy head displayed specific interactions to polar/charged residues at the extracellular of the S and S helices encompassing the S-S linker.
Cryptosporidiosis is a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium parum that is responsible for a significant burden of disease in children in developing countries. In addition, it can result in chronic and life-threatening enteritis in AIDS patients. Current drugs lack efficacy in treating these conditions. The discovery of novel anti-cryptporid therapeutics has been hampered by the poor tractability of this pathogen. The genome effort has identified new targets including inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ). We have developed a pipeline to accelerate in vivo screening of C. parum IMP inhibitors. We engineered the related parasite Toxoplas gondii as a model of C. parum infection for the screen. This provides target validation and a large window not possible in C. parum assays. We established a fluorescence assay of cell proliferation and C. par growth that utilizes automated imaging for throughput. We used these assays to evaluate C par IMP inhibitors from our chemistry and identified a subset 1, 2, 3-triazole that exhibit in vivo selectivity in T gondii and anti-cryptid activity.
Tooth development is a highly heritable process that interacts with the development of the entire craniofacial complex. Abnormalities of tooth development are common, with tooth agenesis being the most common developmental anomaly in humans. We performed a genome-wide association study of time to tooth eruption and number of teeth at one year in 4, 564 individuals from the 196 Northern Finland Birth Cohort ( NF196 ) and 1, 518 from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSP ). We identified 5 loci at P<5×10−8 and 5 with association P<5×−6. The loc included several genes with links to tooth and other development ( KCNJ,DA, HOXB, RADL51, IGF1, HM2 MS3 ). Genes at four of the identified loci are implicated in development. A variant within the HO gene associated with occlusion requiring orthodontic treatment by 31.
Down syndrome (DS) is the most common human aneuploidy caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (H21). In contrast, complete monomy of H21 is lethal and only partial or mosaic monomy of H21 is seen, leading to variable physiological abnormalities with intellectual disability, locomotor deficits, and altered muscle tone. To identify dosage-sensitive genes involved in DS and M21 phenotypes, we created two mouse models: TsY carrying a tandem duplication and MsY carrying a deletion of the Hspa-App region syntenic with 21. 11-q21. We report that trisomy and monomy of this region alter locomotion, strength, muscle mass, and balance. Expression of skeletal muscles revealed changes in regulation of genes in energetic, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. These are downregulated in TsY mice and upregulated in MsY mice. The shift in muscle metabolism correlates with change in proliferation without alteration in function. However, reactive species (ROS) from I decreased in MsY mice while permeability of TsY mitochondria slightly increased.
G protein-gated potassium channels (GIRK; Kir ) are activated by Gβ subunits derived from Gi/o proteins and regulate heartbeat and neuronal excitability and plasticity. Both neurotransmitter-evoked (evoked ) and neurotransmitter-independent (basal ) GIRK activities are physiologically important, but mechanisms ofbas and its relation toev are unclear. We have previously shown for heterologously expressed GIRK/2, and now for native GIR in hippocampal neurons thatbas andev are interrelated: the extent of activation by neurotransmitter ( Ra ) is inversely related tobas. We have developed a quantitative model of GIRK/2 function. We characterized single-channel and macroscopic GIR/2 currents and surface of GIR2 andβ in Xenopus oocytes. Our model recapitulatesbas andev in Xen o, HE293 and hippocal neurons; predicts dose-dependent activation of GIR2 by coexpressedβ and accounts for inversebas-Ra correlation. Modeling indicates 3–4β dimers are available for GIR2 under all conditions and different expression levels. In contrast, decreases from ~ to less than per GIR2 as increases. The persistentβ/channel but not α/channel support association GIR2 withβ, consistent with recruitment to surfaceβ but notα by GIR2. Our suggests stoichiometry 4β but only per GIR2.
Plant pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria secrete transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) into host cells, where they act as transcriptional activators on plant genes to support bacterial virulence. LEs have a modular DNA-binding domain composed of tandem repeats. Two amino acids within each repeat, termed repeat-variable diresidues (RVDs), bind to contiguous nucleotides on the DNA and determine specificity. We propose a novel approach for LE prediction to identify potential virulence targets. Our approach accounts for recent findings concerning LE targeting, including frame-shift by repeats of aberrant lengths and the flexible orientation of target boxes relative to the start of the downstream gene. The model accounts for dependencies between RVD positions. Parameters are learned from a wealth of quantitative data generated over the last years. We benchmark the novel approach, PredTA, using RNA-seq data Xanthas infection in rice and find an improvement in performance compared to previous approaches. PredTA is able to predict several putative virulence targets. We also observe that no genes are predicted by any tool for several LE, termed orphan for this reason. We postulate one explanation for orphan LE are incomplete annotations, hence propose promoter-wide genome scans for boxes. We demonstrate targets from promoter-wide scans may be by genome-wide, the latter combined with RNA-seq detect putative of existing annotations.
Mitochondrial non-synonymous variations are changes in the mitochondrial DNA that do not alter the encoded amino acid sequence of a protein. However, the vast majority of these changes have not been functionally evaluated, and their pathogenicity has been assessed in silico by software. These tools have been shown to be incongruent. We have developed APOEE, a machine-learning algorithm that outperforms existing methods in estimating the harmfulness of mitochondrial non-syn variations. APOEE was trained on a manually curated set of 189 non-syn variants that have been functionally evaluated in the laboratory. The algorithm was tested on a test set of 189 variants that have not been functionally evaluated. AEE outperformed existing methods in predicting the harmfulness of these variants. AEE was also able to predict the harmfulness of variants that were not in the training set. AEE was able to predict the harmfulness of variants that were not in the training set. AEE was able to predict the harmfulness of variants that were not in the training. AEE was able to predict the harmfulness of variants that were not in the training.
Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common mosquito-transmitted viral infection, causing a range of diseases from self-limiting deng fever to life-threatening deng hemorrhagic fever and shock. Thrombocytopenia is a characteristic of both mild and severe deng disease and correlates with disease progression. Previous studies have shown that DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), secreted into patients’ blood, can stimulate cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and cause endothelial leakage. However, it is unclear whether DENV NS can induce platelet activation or thrombocytopenia during DENV infection. Here, we show that DENV but not Zika virus culture supernatant induces P-selectin expression and phosphatylserine (PS) in human platelets, abolished when NS is depleted from D supernant. Similar results are found using recombinant NS from four D serotypes and effects blocked by anti-NS F(ab)2, antiTLR antibody, TLR antagonist Rhobacteroid lipopolyscharide (LPS), and TLR inhibitor (AK242), but not polymyxin (PS inhibitor. Activation of plate by DENV promotes adenos diphosphate (AD)-induced aggregation and plate adhesion to endothelial cells and phagocyt by macrophages. Finally, D-induced thromocytopenia and hemorrhage are attenuated in TLR knockout and wild-type mice when NS is depleted from D supernant.
Vascular blood pressure homeostasis is a complex physiological process that involves the interaction of multiple regulatory systems to maintain blood pressure and volume. We performed a mathematical analysis of the dynamic loops that regulate vasotone of vascular smooth muscle, blood, and mean arterial pressure, which include the arginine vasopressin ( AV ), atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ), and renin-angiotin-aldosterone ( RAAS ) systems. Our analysis of the AV-AN-RA system revealed the presence of two mechanisms that perform the same function: one affects pressure by vasoconstriction, the other by volume. Both are oscillators consisting of negative feedback of monotone systems, admitting a single equilibrium that can be stable or rise to oscillatory.
Thromboembolic disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this paper, we identify a novel mechanism of thrombus formation related to the formation of a fibrin cap, an important component of thrombus. We studied protein transport through the fibr network by integrating experiments with simulations. Our results show that network permeability and diffusivity are important for protein transport through the fibr network. Previous in vivo studies in mice have shown that non-occluding thrombi are covered by a fibr network (fibrin cap). Simulations, using microfluidic devices and accounting for the permeable structure of fibr cap, demonstrated that thrombin inside thrombus was washed through fibr network, limiting exposure of platelets on throm surface throm. Moreover, restricting approach of platelets in flowing to throm core, fibr impaired platelets from regions high throm concentration necessary for plate activation and throm growth.
Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are known to be activated during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, but their role in limiting microbial growth is not well understood. We investigated how iN cells control intracellular Mtb replication when co-cultured with infected macrophages. We found that iN cell activation, as measured by CD25 upregulation and IFγ production, was primarily driven by IL-12 and IL-18. In contrast, i cell control of M growth was CD1-dependent and did not require IL-12, IL-18, or IFγ. This suggests that conventional activation markers do not correlate with i cell effector function during M infection. We also found that i control of M replication was independent of TN and cell-mediated cytotoxicity. By dissociating cytokine activation from CD1-restricted effector function, we identified a novel mediator of i cell antimicrobial activity: granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). i cells produced GMF in vitro and in vivo during M infection in a CD1-dependent manner, and GMF was both necessary and sufficient to control M growth. GMF is a novel i cell antimicrobial effector and may play a role in cell immunity against M.
The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is a common component of the human intestinal flora. To gain insight into C. albicans colonization, we studied the genes expressed by fungi grown within the host. The EF1 gene, encoding a putative transcription factor, was highly expressed during growth of C. albicans in the intestinal tract. In contrast, an ef1 mutant exhibited increased colonization of the murine intestinal tract, a model of commensal colonization, whereas EF1 overexpressing exhibited reduced colonization of the intestinal and oral cavity of athym mice, the latter modeling mucosal candidiasis. When inoculated into the bloodstream mice, both ef1 and EF1 overing strains caused lethal infections. In contrast, mutants attenuated in virulence following intravenous inoculation exhibited normal levels of intestinal colonization. Finally, expression of several genes dependent on factor E1 during growth was observed in laboratory, but E1-independent expression during growth within murine tract.
Immunization with irradiated sporozoites is the most effective strategy against liver stages of malaria. However, the mechanisms underlying this success are unknown. We show that CD8 T cell responses require prolonged antigen presentation. Using TCR transgenic cells specific for the circumsporozoite protein, we found sporozoite antigen persists over 8 weeks after immunization. This is remarkable since irradiated sporozoites are incapable of replication and do not differentiate beyond liver stages. Persisting antigen is detected in lymphoid organs and depends on CD11+ cells. Prolong antigen enhances CD8 T response in several ways. Firstly, primed CD8 cells exposed to antigen in vivo severely reduce final memory population size. Secondly, memory cells expand in immunized mice but not transferred naïve. Finally, persist antigen primes naïve cells, including thymic emigrants, to become effector capable eliminating parasites in liver.
Leishmanias is a neglected tropical disease caused by Leishmania parasites transmitted by sandflies. Most treatments require hospitalization and present side effects or parasite resistance. To overcome these barriers, we tested the potential of polymyxin B to kill Leishmania amazonensis. Polymyxin B was adsorbed in PBC nanoparticles ( PBCp ) to augment its internalization in infected macrophages. PBCps were fabricated by anionic polymerization and analyzed by Dynamic Light Scattering ( size, ζ potential ), Nanoparticle Analysis ( size/concentration ) vertical cell diffusion ( rate drug release ) drug incorporation indirect protein determination and cell viability. Nanoparticles with polymyx B (BCpB ) presented adequate size 261. 5 ± 25.9 nm low polydispersity index 1.79 ± 0.17V stable for 45 days. The drug release from BCpB was 6 times slower than free polymyx, favoring a prolonged release profile. In vitro, polymyx alone reduced amastigote infection in macrophages 10 μg/mL without complete elimination at higher concentrations. However, this limits its application as adjuvant leishic therapy or antimicrobial coating. The nanocar BCp also presented leishic effect surpassing polymyx activity but no antimicrobial was detected. Polyx maintained activity against E. coli Pseudomonas and Klebsella adding antimicrobial to nanoparticles.
Visceral leishmanias (VL) is a major public health problem in Brazil, with high lethality. This study investigated prognostic factors for death from VL in Belo Horizont, Brazil. The study was based on data from the Report Disease Information System-SAN ( Brazilian Ministry of Health ) relating to clinical manifestations of the disease. The study included two periods: 2002–2009 and 2007–2009. During the first period, the SIN platform changed from Windows to Net-version, differing in some parameters. Multivariate regression models were performed to identify variables associated with death from VL and included in prognostic score. In the first period, variables associated with greater risk of death from VL were weakness, Leishmanias-HIV co-infection, and age ≥60 years. In the second period, variables associated with death were bleeding, other infections, jaundice, and ≥60 years. The prognostic score was developed using variables associated with death from the latest version of SIN. The performance was evaluated by sensitivity 71. 7%, specificity 73.7%, positive predictive values 28.9% and 94.5, and receiver operating curve 75.6.
Plants rely heavily on receptor-like kinases (RLs) for the perception and integration of internal and external stimuli. The Arabidopsis thaliana regulatory leucine-rich receptor kinase (LRRK) BAK1 is involved in steroid hormone responses, innate immunity, and cell death. Here, we describe the differential regulation of three BAK-dependent pathways by a novel BAK allele, bak1-5. bak-5 mutants are severely impaired in innate signaling mediated by the BAK-dependent RLKs FLS and EFR. bak-5 mutants are not impaired in BR signaling or death. We show that the non-kinases FLS and EFR have low kinase activity and are unable to phosphorylate BAK in vitro. Furthermore, kinase activity is dispensable for ligand-induced heteromerization of F or E with BAK in planta. The suppression of F and E-dependent signaling in bak-5 is due to BAK-5 interaction with the respective ligand RK but requires BAK kinase activity. Our results demonstrate phosphorylation-dependent control of growth, immunity and death by the RL BAK.
Antiproliferative response to anticancer treatment is a complex process that cannot be captured by current methods. The proposed computational approach uses time-lapse cell microscopy and flow cytometry data to render the proliferative process through the cell cycle and subsequent generations during treatment. The effects of treatments are modelled with modules describing the activity of main pathways causing arrest, repair and death in each phase. A framework is created to apply different types of modules in each phase and test at the complexity justified by data. The method is challenged with time-course measures in parallel with flow cytometry and timeapse cell microscopy in X-treated human ovarian cancer cells spanning a range of doses. The most model of treatment including dose-response effect is progressively built combining modules with a strategy fitting all data of different doses and platforms. The model gives the first complete in silico rendering of the process following X-ray, providing quantitative measures of dose-dependence of G1, S, and G2 checkpoint in subsequent.
Coenzyme Q (Co) is a critical electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain that has been implicated in a wide range of human diseases. Its biosynthesis involves a multi-step process that requires enzymes encoded by PDSS and PD2 genes. Mutations in either of these genes in humans lead to severe neuromuscular disease with nephrotic syndrome in PD2 deficiency. We show that renal disease in mice with missense PD2kd genotype is due to Co biosynthetic defect. Co9 and Co10 levels in kidney homogenates from PD2kd mutants were lower than controls. Disease originates in glomerular podocytes, as seen in Podin/Pd2 mice but not in tubular epithelial or hepatocyte conditional knockouts. Liver PD2/Alb mice have no disease despite undetectable Co9, impaired capacity and altered metabolism.
Although phenotypic robustness, the ability of an organism to maintain its phenotype in the face of environmental and genetic perturbations, is important for all forms of life. Development has long been viewed as a key component of robustness, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we report that the determinative developmental lineages of protostomes and deuterostomes are structured such that the cellular composition of the organism is only modestly affected by cell death. Several features of the lineages, including shallowness, topology, early ontogenic appearance of cells, and non-clonality of cell types, underlie the robustness.
EmbryoPhenomics is an open-source, high-throughput platform for phenomics in embryos. It comprises an Open Video Microscope ( OpenIM ) that captures high-resolution videos of embryos under controlled conditions. These videos are then analysed by Embryo Computer Vision ( EmbCV ), which extracts phenomic data for morphological, physiological, and behavioural traits during embryonic development. We demonstrate Embryoenomics in a series of experiments assessing chronic, acute, and multistress responses to environmental ( temperature and salinity ) in > million embryos of two species with different patterns of development—the snail Radix bica and the amphod Orchestia gammellus.
Malaria parasites (Plasium spp. ) undergo dramatic changes in metabolism during their complex life cycle between mosquito and human hosts. These changes are associated with a shift from glycolytic metabolism in asexual stages to increased dependence on tricarboxy acid (TCA ) metabolism in mosquito stages. We used stable isotope labelling, targeted metabolomics and reverse genetics to map stage-specific changes in Plasium berghei carbon metabolism. We show that glutamine is the predominant input into TCA in both asexual and sexual stages and is important for gametogenesis. Glutamine catabol, as well as reactions in intermediary metabolism and CoA synthesis are essential for ookin toocyst transition in mosquito.
Many biological signaling pathways exhibit the ability to differentiate between pulsatile and sustained signals in the regulation of gene expression. While the underlying networks are diverse, they are built around a common motif, the incoherent feedforward loop (ILFIL), where an input simultaneously activates an output and an inhibitor of the output. This motif can exhibit temporal adaptation, where the system is desensitized to a sustained input. Here, we examine another property of IFLs—the ability to process oscillatory signals. Our results indicate that the system’s ability to translate pulsatile signals is limited by two constraints. The kinetics of IFL components dictate the range for which the network is able to decode pulsatile dynamics. In addition, a match between network and signal characteristics is required for optimal counting.
Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, is a leading cause of serious febrile illness in Southeast Asia. It is an obligate intracellular bacterium that can only be cultured in mammalian cells and requires specific methodologies for propagation and analysis. Here, we describe improved methods for quantification, propagation, purification, and long-term storage of O. tsugamushi. We cultured O. tsamushi in mouse embryonic fibroblast ( L ) cells and measured bacterial growth using O. tsamushi-specific qPCR. We monitored the effect of various conditions on bacterial viability and growth in mammalian cells. We present a standardised method for comparing O. tsushi viability after purification and propagation under different conditions. Our data support improved techniques for propagation, purification, and storage of this important human pathogen.
Schistosoma haematobium Infection in 1–5 Year Old Children: Safety and Efficacy of Antihelmin Drug Prazantel (PQ)  
Schistosomiasis is currently controlled by treating schistosome infected people with the antelminic drug prazantel (PQ). Children up to 5 years are excluded from schist control programs due to lack of PQ safety data in this age group. This study investigated PQ safety and efficacy in Zimbabwean children aged 1–5 (n=104) treated with P tablets. Side effects were assessed by questionnaire administered to caregivers within 24 hours of P. Efficacy was determined 6 weeks after P through schosome counts in urine. The change in infection in children 1–5 (n=100) was compared to 6–10 olds (n=435). Pre-treatment S haobium infection in 1–5 was 14.6 eggs/10 urine and prevalence 21%. Of 104 children 3.8% reported side effects within 24 hours P. These were stomach ache, loss of appetite lethargy and inflammation of face and body. P treatment reduced schosome levels 1– with egg rate 99% and cure 92%. This was comparable efficacy P in 6– olds where was 96 and 67. P is safe and efficacious in 1– olds as in 6 olds whom is drug for sch control.
A genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila identifies Tetrasin 29b as an evolutionarily conserved suppressor of Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis. Ras oncogenic mutations in the GTPase contribute to ~30% of human cancers, but are insufficient for tumorigenesis. Therefore, it is paramount to identify cooperating cancer-relevant signaling pathways. We devised an in vivo genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosila and discovered multiple evolutionarily conserved pathways controlling Ras-driven epithelial tumenesis. Human orthologs of the hits were significantly downregulated in thousands of primary tumors, revealing novel prognostic markers for epithelial tumors. Of the top 100 candidate suppressor genes, 80 were validated in secondary Drosila, identifying known and novel genes that cooperate with Ras-driven tumenesis. Low expression of the hits significantly correlated with KRAS12 status and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer.
Meiotic drivers are selfish alleles that subvert meiosis to increase their transmission into progeny at the expense of the rest of the genome. In Schizosaccharomyce pombe, we discovered that wtf13 is a meiotic driver that kills spores that do not inherit it by generating a diffusible poison and spore-specific antidote. We show that w13 is suppressed by another w gene, wtf-2, that arose in the lab and only makes antidote. w-2 does not indiscriminately prevent spore destruction, instead rescuing only spores that inherit w-2. This establishes a novel paradigm for meiotic suppressors and provides insight into mechanisms of drive systems.
Genome-wide association studies have identified many genetic variants that are correlated with gene expression changes across individuals. However, the ability of these variants to predict expression in unseen individuals has rarely been evaluated. We present an algorithm that predicts expression of genes in unseen individuals given their genotype in the genomic vicinity of the gene, using training and expression data from a set of individuals. The predictions are remarkably robust and agree between training and test sets, even when the sets consist of individuals from distinct populations. The number of genes that can be predicted is relatively small, as we ignore effects such as environmental and sequence variation. The robustness of predictions means that the identity and degree of genes that can be predicted in advance is known. We also present an extension that incorporates different types of genomic annotations to weigh the importance of variants. Assigning higher weights to variants with annotations such as proximity to genes and high GC content improves predictions. Genes that are successfully predicted have higher expression and variability across individuals, providing insight into characteristics of genes that can be predicted from cis variation.
Plasmodium falciparum infections are genetically diverse, leading to competitive interactions between parasite strains. This study investigates the cause of competitive suppression of an avirulent Plasmodium falciparum clone (AS) by a virulent clone (AJ) in immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. We use dynamical based Bayesian inference to test whether suppression is caused by clone-specific differences in one of the following processes: adaptive clearance of meroites and parasitised red blood cells (RBCs), loss of meroites and parasised RBCs, RBC preference, R infection rate, burst size, and within-R interference. These processes are parameterised in dynamical mathematical models and fitted to experimental data. We find that just one parameter, the ratio of loss rate of meroites to invasion of mature RBCs, needs to be clone-specific to predict data. This parameter is the same for both clones in single infections but different between clones in mixed infections. The size of difference is largest in immunocompet mice and smallest in immunodef. This explains why suppression is alleviated in immunodef mice. We find that suppression acts early in infection, even before day of parasitaemia.
DNA replication errors are a major driver of evolutionary changes in the genome, from single nucleotide polymorphisms to large copy number variations (CNVs). Here, we propose a replication-based model to explain the generation of interstitial inverted duplications. The model—Origin-Dependent Inverted-Repeat Amplification ( ODIR )—proposes that replication at short, interrupted, inverted repeats in genomic sequences generates an extrachromosomal, dimeric, autonomously replicating intermediate; subsequent integration of dimer yields CN without loss of distal chromosomal sequences. We tested the feasibility of the proposed error and its consequences on chromosome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In vitro, we show that ligation of leading and lagging strands to “closed forks” can occur at short, inverted repeats. Removal of molecules with closed forks results in hairpin duplex that replicates in vivo to create dimer plasmid that integrates into genome by homologous recombination, creating inverted. Our model can explain generation of human, de novo invertedamplicons with 2:1 mixture of sequences from homologues—a feature by plasm intermediate from one homologue integrates into other prior meiosis.
Influenza virus infection in mammalian cells can initiate translation at non-canonical start codons in response to stressful stimuli. Recent studies suggest that viral infection and anti-viral responses alter translation initiation sites and lead to novel epitope production. Here, we investigate the extent and impact of alternate initiation in cells infected with influenza. We show that selection against non-canonical initiation at CUG codons in influenza lineages adapted to mammalian hosts. We use ribosome profiling with lactimidycin to delineate initiation sites in human epithelial cells infected with influenza. We identify candidate alternate initiation sites in influenza mRNAs, all at AUG codons downstream canonical. One candidate truncates 14 amino acids N-terminus N neuraminidase, resulting in loss cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain. This truncated neuraminase is expressed on surface during infection, enzymatic and conserved in N1 line. We do not detect higher alternate initiation host transcripts upon infection or antiiral response, but subset induced by antiiral is enriched alternate.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (E. coli ) is a foodborne pathogen that causes severe diarrhea and potentially fatal hemolytic uremic syndrome. E. coli and other enteric pathogens utilize a type III secretion system ( TSS ) to inject virulence effectors into host cells. In this study, we present evidence that E. coli O157:H7 Nle1 and N2 genes encode TSS effectors that bind human ribosomal protein 3 ( R3 ), a subunit of nuclear factor kappa-light-enhancer activated B ( NF-κ ) transcription complexes. N1 and N2 localize with R3 in cytoplasm but not nuclei. The N-terminal of N1 and N2 binds to N-terminus of R3. N1 and N2 are autophosphorylated Ser/Thr kinases but binding to R3 is independent of kinase activity. N1 but not N2 reduces nuclear R3 abundance without affecting p or p65 NF-κ subunits or phosphorylation/abundance of inhibitory NFκ chaperoneα N1 represses transcription of R3/NF-dependent reporter but not R3-independent. In contrast N2 stimulates R3 transcription as well as AP-dependent. We identified region N1 (40-45 ) responsible for inhibitory activity toward R3. Deleting N from E. O:H produced hypervulent phenotype in gnotic pig model Shiga toxin E infection.
Transcription factor (TF) binding to its target DNA is a fundamental regulatory interaction. The most common model used to represent TF binding specificities is the position specific scoring matrix (PM), which assumes independence between binding positions. However, in many cases this simplifying assumption does not hold. Here, we present feature models (FMs), a novel probabilistic method modeling TF–DNA interactions based on log-linear models. Our approach uses features to represent TF specificities, where each may span multiple positions. We develop the formulation of our model and devise an algorithm for learning structural features from binding data. We also develop a discriminative finder which discovers de novo Ms enriched in sets compared to background sets. We evaluate on synthetic and the widely used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) dataset of Harison et al. We then our algorithm to high-throughput TFIP from mouse and human, reveal features present in specificities and show Ms explain better thanMs.
Adrenergic αC receptor 2 (AD2C ) is an inhibitory modulator of the sympathetic nervous system. Mice lacking this gene show physiological and behavioral alterations associated with the fight-or-flight response. We find that AD2 expression is lower in humans and chimpanzees than in other primates. On the basis of three-dimensional chromatin structure, we identified a cis-regulatory region whose sequences have been accelerated in humans and chimpanze. This region has active histone marks in rhes macaque but repressive marks in human and chimpanzee. This region contains neuron-restrictive silencer (NRS ) motifs, each harbouring a polymorphism. Our genotyping of population data indicate that both polymorphic alleles have reached fixation in humans and chimpanze but not bonob, whereas the ancestral allele is present in macaque. CRISPR/C9 genome and reporter assays show that derived alleles repress AD2, likely by increasing NRS binding. In addition, we detected signatures of positive selection for lower AD2 in humans. Our findings indicate that there has been selective pressure for enhanced sympathetic activity in humans and chimpanze.
C4 photosynthesis is one of the most remarkable examples of convergent evolution in plants, with at least 60 independent origins in monocotyledons and dicotyled species. It is associated with a 50% increase in productivity in tropical and subtropical areas. We developed a new informatics framework to compare gene expression in species lacking reference genomes. We compared gene expression in two C4 lineages ( Cleomeynandra and Zea mays ) that diverged ∼140 million years ago. We identified 3, 335 conserved genes in leaf and photosynthetic development. We show that C cycle genes are recruited into photosynthesis networks. Despite independent origins, we report homologous transcription factors induce C photosynthesis and specific expression. We define a molecular signature shared by angiosperms derived from common ancestor. We show that deep comparisons can reveal insight into complex phenotypes and evolution of transactors underpinning C photosynthesis.
During the 2013–2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic in West Africa, the virus spread to Europe and North America, infecting several Health Care Workers (HC). To develop new countermeasures and understand EBO infection in different body compartments, we longitudinally explored EBO-specific negative sense RNA (neg-RNA) and positive RNA (posRNA), including replication (intermediate-RNA) and messenger (mRNA) molecules in upper and lower respiratory tract compared to plasma in HC infected with EBO in Sierra Leone, hospitalized at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases “Lazz Spallani” (INMI), Rome, Italy. We observed posRNA and negRNA in longitudinally collected lower respiratory specimens after viral clearance from plasma, suggesting local replication.
Hemorrhagic fever (BHF) and Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) are caused by Machupo virus (MAC) and Jun virus (JUN), respectively. We previously reported that a recombinant chimericMAC (rMAC/Cd1-G) expressing glycoprotein from the Candid1 (Cd1) strain of JUN is attenuated in a murine model and protects from lethal challenge with MAC. Here, we investigated the role of different domains of Cd1 glycoprotein (G) in attenuation of MAC. We rescued rMAC expressing the ectodomain of G from Cd1 alone (MC1), with the transmembrane domain (TMD) F438 substitution (MC2), or the TMD of Cd1 (3). All rMAC exhibited similar growth in cultured cells. In mice, MC1 displayed significant reduction in lethality compared to rMAC. MC1 was detected in brains and spleens of MC-infected mice and was associated with inflammation. On the other hand, all survived MC2 and MC3 infection without detectable virus in organs while producing neutralizing Cd1 antibody. Our data suggest the indispensable role of each G domain in full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMAC/Cd1G.
Mutations in the centromere histone CEN3 induce postzygotic lethality and uniparental inheritance. The centrom histone CEN3 is essential for the segregation of sister chromatids during mitosis and meiosis. To define the functional constraints of CEN3, we complemented a null allele in Arabidopsis with a variety of mutant alleles, each inducing a single amino acid change in the conserved residues of the histone domain. Many of these transgenic lines displayed wild-type growth and fertility on self-poll, but exhibited postzyotic death unipal inheritance when crossed with wild-type. The failure of centrom marked by these mutations in the histone domain of C3 reproduces the genome syndromes with chimer C3 and C3 from diverged.
Alternative splicing plays a crucial role in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into cardiac precursors. The role of alternative splicing in self-renew, pluripotency, and lineage specification of hESCs is largely unknown. We modified the H9 hESC line to allow selection of pluripotent hES by neomycin resistance and cardiac progenitors by puromycin. Exon microarray expression data from undifferentiated hES and cardiac precursors were used to identify isoforms with cardiac-restricted or common/neural differentiation patterns. Splice events corresponded to cytoskeletal, RNA, muscle, and cell cycle control as well as ser/threon kinase and helicase. Using AltAnalyze, we identified changes in protein and microRNA binding architecture that affect function and expression. These included isoforms that oppose cell arrest in hES and promote signaling and development in prec. Our data suggest mechanisms that may influence commitment and maintenance at the level of isoforms and regulation.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis ) is a major human pathogen for which causes tuberculosis (TB). Trehalose biosynthesis is considered an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials against M. The most biosynthetic route involves trehal-6-phosphate (TP) synthase A and TP phosphatase B that generate trehalose from AD/UDP-glucose and glucose-6-phosphate. In order to assess the drug potential of TP phosphat, we generated a conditional mutant of M allowing regulated silencing of the TP phosphat gene B. We found that B is essential for growth of M in vitro as well as the acute phase in mice following aerosol infection. By contrast, B is not essential for chronic phase mice, highlighting remodelling of trehal metabolism by M. Blocking B resulted in accumulation of TP, which appears to be toxic leading to self-poison of cells. Accordingly, blocking TP in ΔA mutant abrogated B essentiality. TP accumulation elicited upregulation of more than 800 genes which might result from increase in RNA stability by neutralization of ribonuclease activity. Surprisingly, overlap with stress caused by accumulation another sugar molecule maltose-phosphate was minimal.
Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite responsible for Chagas disease, a life-threatening illness affecting 11–18 million people. Current treatments have limited efficacy and safety profiles. Recent studies have identified T cruzi proline racemase ( TPR ) as a candidate for chemotherapeutic intervention. Conformation changes associated with substrate binding to TPR are believed to expose residues eliciting a mitogenic host-cell response, contributing to parasite persistence and immune evasion. Characterization of TPR conformation states requires long-time motions currently inaccessible by standard simulations. We describe accelerated molecular dynamics that extend simulation time and capture large motions of relevance. Conservation and fragment analyses identified conformation epitopes in vicinity of transient binding pockets. Newly identified TPR conformations revealed along with knowledge of interconversion mechanism advance understanding of TPR function.
Inducible and reversible gene expression is a powerful approach for uncovering gene function. We have established a method to efficiently produce reversible and inducible knockout (iKO) and rescue in mice. The system, named iKO, allows the target gene to be turned on and off by treating mice with doxycycline. This method combines two genetically modified mouse lines: a) a KO line with tetracycline-dependent transactivator replacing the endogenous target, and b) a line with tetrcline-inducible cDNA of target inserted into tightly regulated (TRE) genomic locus, providing low expression and high inducibility. This locus occurs infrequently in the genome. We developed a method to introduce genes into TRE of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by recombinase-mediated insertion. Both KO and TRE lines have been engineered for high-throughput, large and cost-effective production of iKO mice. As proof of concept, we created iKO in apolipoprotein (apoE) gene, allowing sensitive and quantitative phenotypic analyses. Results demonstrated reversible apo transcription, plasma levels, atherosclerosis, and regression.
Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasite that causes Chagas disease and can be transmitted congenitally from mother to offspring. Little is known about the genetic response of the placenta to this infection. We studied the response of the placenta in mice infected with two strains of T. cruzi: K98, a non-lethal strain, and V, isolated from a human congenital case. We analyzed the placenta of infected and uninfected mice by microarray to see which genes were differentially expressed. We found that the “secretory granule” pathway was downregulated in both groups, but “inmate response” and “to interferon gamma” were upregulated in V but not K. We also found that metabolic processes and macromolecular transport were downregulated in infected placentas and some signaling pathways had opposite regulation: overpresent in V and downregulated K. We found that V had stronger tropism to the placenta by detection of parasite DNA and RNA. Our study is the first to describe the genetic response of placenta to T. cruz in mice and suggests a strong parasite-dependent immune response to detriment of cellular metabolism that may prevent congenital transmission.
Sindbis virus (SINV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes polyarthritis and rash. It was first recognised in northern Europe about 50 years ago and is known as Ockbo disease in Sweden and Pog disease in Finland. SINV is mainly occurs in tropical and sub-tropical countries, and in Europe it is suggested to cause regularly recurring outbreaks. Here, we evaluated mosquito and SINV prevalence in vectors from an endemic area in Sweden. Mosquitoes were collected in the Riveräl floodplains before, during, and after the hypothesised 2002 year outbreak and assayed for virus on cell. Obtained isolates were partially sequenced, and nucleotide sequences were analysed using Bayesian clade and median network. Only SINV was recovered in 200, and 4 in 200, while 15 were recovered in 200 with increased infection rates in both enzotic and bridgeectors. In 200, Maximum Likelihood infection rates were 10.0/100 in enotic Cx torrent/piens and 0.62/100 in bridge A cinus compared 4.9/100 and 0.0/100 in200 and 0.0/100 and.0/100 in200 Sequence showed all belonged to SINV-I. Genetic analysis revealed four S-Iades in Riveräl over years.
In the locust olfactory system, neural circuits transform odor information from the antennal lobe (AL) into a sparse representation in the mushroom body (MB), a region associated with memory. We investigated the interaction of multiple coding mechanisms in this system. In vivo recordings from the MB demonstrated highly specific responses to odors in Kenyon cells (KCs). Typically, only a few Cs from the recorded population responded reliably to a specific odor. Different odors induced different responses in Cs. We explored the possibility that synaptic plasticity controls the specificity of Cs responses to familiar odors. We found that plasticity at AL-MB synapses efficiently regulated the delicate tuning to selectively filter the AL output and condense to a sparse in MB. Activity-dependent plasticity drove the specificity, reliability, and persistence of odor representations. This suggests a role for plasticity in processing and making testable predictions about plasticity at AL-MB synapses.
The Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene (ST) study aimed to identify functionally important genes for the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) by analyzing transcriptional profiles of liver, skeletal muscle, visceral fat, and atherosclerotic and unaffected arterial wall tissues from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Using two-way clustering, a total of 60 clusters (395 genes ) were identified from 15,042 mRNA signals in each tissue. In the second step, atherosclerotic and visceral clusters segregated patients into two groups differing in coronary stenosis extent (P=0.008 and P=0.000 ). Associations with atherosclerosis were validated by carotid expression profiles. Remarkably, one cluster relating caridosis (P=0.04 ) and 27 genes relating coronaryenosis were confirmed (P<−27−10−30 ). Genes in transendothelial migration leukocytes (TE) were overrepresented in all atherosclerosis clusters, referred to as A-module. In a second step, A was found enriched in CAD by 1.8-fold (P0.004 ) in three independent cohorts. The co-factor LIM binding 2 (L2) was identified as potential regulator of A, supported by subnetwork, cellular and expression of L2, and expression of 13 TE genes in L2–deficient wall. Thus, A appears important for atherosclerosis, with L merits further CAD research.
In the circadian clock of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis, the KaiC protein plays a central role in the regulation of the circadian rhythm. Our studies have shown that KaiC is involved in both the activation and repression of its own transcription. During the 24 hours, KaiC undergoes different phosphorylation states during the day. It has remained unclear which phosphorylation state of KaiC promotes kai expression and opposes transcriptional activation. We have systematically analyzed various combinations of positive and negative transcriptional regulation by introducing a combined transcriptional/translational feedback loop (TT/PT) model that considers all four phosphorylation states of Kai and transcriptional/translational feedback. Only one particular two-loop mechanism out of 32 tested is able to reproduce experimental observations, including effects of knockout or overexpression of kai genes. Here, threonine and phosphorylated Kai hexamers activate unphosphorylated Kaiam suppress kai transcription. Our simulations suggest that the peak ratio of positive and negative components of kai expression is the factor for how two-loop models respond to removal or overexpression of k genes.
Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) has a low pathogenic and replicative potential compared to HIV-1. We investigated whether HIV-2 reservoirs follow the same distribution as HIV-1/SIV infections, i. e. limited infection of central-memory CD4 T lymphocytes (TCM). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were sorted into monocytes and CD T-cell subsets (naive, central, transitional, effector-memory ). HIV-DNA was quantified by real-time PCR. HIV-DNA was undetectable in monocytes from all individuals and quantifiable in transitional-memory (TM) cells from 4 individuals (median:2.25×10^6 cells) but in central-memory (TCM) from only 1 individual (1.75×10^6). HIVDNA in PBMC (median:1.94×10^6) correlated with TM (r=0.66,p=0.01) but not TC. HIV-activation was observed in cells from only 3 individuals. The CCR5 co-receptor was similarly distributed in populations from individuals and donors.TC had lower expression of CX6 transcripts (p=0.002) than TM and higher of TR5 (p=0.004). Thus HIV-2 reservoirs differ from HIV-1 by lack of monocytic infection and limited TC associated with lower expression of CX6 and higher of TR5.
Visual attention is known to modulate the activity and selectivity of cortical neurons. However, spiking neuron models that can reproduce a wide range of these effects remain elusive. We present the Attention Routing Circuit (ARC) model, a mechanistic description of selective attention processing in cortex. The model is mathematically implemented at the level of spiking neurons, with computations for selective attention mapped to specific neuron types and laminar circuit. The model is used to simulate studies in macaque and is shown to quantitatively match several forms of attentional modulation. Specifically, ARC demonstrates that shifts of attention may exhibit shrinking of receptive fields, increases in responses without changes in selectivity for non-spatial features ( i. e. response gain ), and that the effect on contrast functions is better explained as response-gain than contrast-gain. Unlike past models, ARC embodies a single mechanism unifying forms of attention modulation, consistent with a wide of available data and makes specific quantifiable predictions.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in humans. AF is a complex and multifactorial disease, and genetic factors are thought to contribute to susceptibility. However, the contribution of coding variation to AF remains poorly understood. We performed whole exome sequencing in a large sample of 1, 734 individuals with AF and 9, 423 without AF from the Framingham Heart Study, Cardio Health, Atherosclerosis in Communities, and NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. We also examined genetic variation in 37 suspected AF genes in cases versus controls. The mean age ranged from 59 to 73; 8, 656 (78 ) were European. None of 99, 404 common variants was associated with AF after adjusting for multiple testing. The most associated variant was a common missense in SYN2 (rs3819, pPro707,odds 1.27, CI 1.13–1.43, P.6x10-5 ) at a known AF locus and in linkage disequilibrium with a marker from prior analyses. We did not observe associations between rare variants and AF in gene-based tests. Individuals with AF did not display significant enrichment for common or rare variation in previously implicated genes. We did not observe associations between coding variants and AF, suggesting large-effect variation is not predominant underlying AF. A variant in SYN2 requires further evaluation to determine causality to AF. Efforts to identify biologically meaningful variation underlying AF may require large samples or populations with large effects.
Between 1990 and 2011, a total of 121 human cases of alveolar echinoccosis (AE) caused by Echinoccus multilocis were detected in Poland. The cases were verified by clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory criteria. Among them, 83 ( 68. 6% ) were classified as confirmed, 16 as probable and 22 as possible. During the two decades, a continuous increase in detection rate was noticed. The mean age at diagnosis was 47.7 years and sex ratio M/F was 0.86/1. AE was fatal in 23 ( 19% ) patients with mean age at death 54.1 years. The disease was found in 4 foci involving 9 patients. Seventy of the cases were diagnosed in an advanced stage. In all cases the liver was the primary location of AE. In 30 ( 24.8 ) patients spread to other organs was observed. Ninety of patients were treated with albendazole. In 73 ( 60 ) a surgical operation was performed, including 15 transplantations.
Zinc homeostasis is essential for the survival of both beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms. To understand how microorganisms respond to dynamic changes in zinc availability, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the zinc-sensing zinc uptake regulator (Zur) in Escheria coli. We solved the structure of zinc-loaded Zur bound to the PnuABC promoter and found that this metalloregulatory protein represses gene expression by cooperative binding of two dimers to the core element of each Zur-regulated promoters. This cooperativity requires a pair of salt bridges between Arg52 and Asp′ that connect independent dimers. The protein-DNA interface led to the discovery of a new Zur-regulated gene, pliG, which is directly regulated by Zur in a zinc-dependent manner. The plG promoter forms complexes with either one or two dimers with less cooperativity than other Zur-reg promoters. We compared in vitro Zur-DNA binding at each Zur-reg promoters and found a 10,000-fold variation in ZurNA constants. The degree of repression in vivo parallels this trend, with a 100-fold difference in transcript copy number between wild-type and Δur strains. We conclude that the number of Fur dimers that bind any promoter varies and the thermodynamic profile of Zur-D interactions correlates with physiological response at different promoters.
Rift Valley fever (RV) is a vector-borne zoonotic disease that causes high morbidity and mortality in ruminants. In 2008–2009, RV affected the whole island of Madagascar, including Anzobe district in the highlands. Entomological survey showed absence ofedes among potential RV virus (RV) vector species in this area and overall low mosquito abundance due to unfavorable climatic conditions during winter. No serological nor virological sign of infection was observed in wild terrestrial mammals, suggesting absence of RV virus (RV) reservoir. However, three serological virological follow-up in cattle showed recurrent RVV circulation. This study aimed to understand key determinants of this recurrent transmission. A spatial deterministic discrete metapulation model combined with cattle network was designed to reproduce local conditions using observational data. Three scenarios explained RVV circulation: (i) RV overwintering thanks to direct transmission between vemic cows, vectors absent during winter, (ii) low vector circulation thanks residual population without direct transmission, (iii) combination both. Multi-model methods resulted in incorporating low RV winter-borne transmission and direct between animals. Predictions satisfactorily reproduced field, 84% infections attributed to vectororne, 16 to direct. These appeared robust sensitivity analysis.
The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an invasive and aggressive daytime-biting mosquito species that is a major public health threat throughout its expanding range. We used 13 microsatellite loci on 911 individuals and mitochondrial COI sequences to gain a better understanding of the historical and contemporary movements of Ae. albictus in the Indo-Pacific region and characterize its population. Our results show that Ae.ictus was most likely introduced to New Guinea via mainland Asia before colonizing the Solomon Islands via Papua New Guinea or Asia. We also show that the recent incursion into northern Australia’s Torres Islands was seeded from Indonesia. For the first time in this species, we provide evidence of a recently colonized population in the Torres Islands that has undergone rapid changes in its genetic makeup. This could be the result of genetic drift or represent a secondary invasion from an unknown source. There is high genetic structure and gene flow between geographically distant populations. The species’ structure in the region tends to be driven by human movements.
Infection with Schistosoma mansoni has a negative impact on quality of life, but not physical fitness in schoolchildren in Mwan Region, North-West Tanzania: A Cross-Section Study. Infection with Schistoma mans negatively affects children’s health and may influence their general well-being. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of S mans infections on morbidity with emphasis on quality of life (PQL) measured in four dimensions and physical (VO2max) among 572 schoolchildren aged 7–8. Prevalence S mans was 58.7% with an arithmetic mean (95% CI) among positives 207.3 (169.–245.4) epg. Most were light 56.5% while 16.4 had heavy infections. Girls had higher mean intensities (95 CI) than boys 247.4 (189–305.2) vs 153. (110–195.6); P.004. A total 30.1 were anaemic with no difference. Stunting and wasting found less than 10% population. There was no association mans prevalence intens and parameters: anthropometry, anaemia, or spleen pathology neither univar nor multivar analyses.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the spiroch Leptira. The main reservoirs of Leptira are wild rodents, such as the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus ), which present asymptomatic infection. Experimental studies of Leptira colonization in rats have used intraperitoneal inoculation. However, knowledge of ratat transmission requires a natural inoculation route, such as mucosal or subcutaneous. We investigated the effects of subcutaneous and mucosal inoculation compared to intraperinal Leptira infection in adult rats. Infection was studied using Leptira isolation, serology, and histological analyses. Leptira was asymptomatic in each inoculation and caused similar antibody production regardless of colonization. Renal colonization rates were 8/8, 5/8, and 1/8 for intraper, mucosal subaneous and subcut inoculation, respectively. Mucosal inoc was more efficient for renal colonization with urinary excretion than subcut and induced slower infection than intraper.
Seps is a life-threatening disease characterized by excessive inflammation, tissue injury, and organ dysfunction. Currently, there are limited therapeutic options for this disease, so understanding the molecular mechanisms of seps may help develop effective treatments. Here, we identify a novel role for Annexin A2 ( AnxA ), a multifunctional protein, in modulating inflammatory response during seps. In polymicrobial sepsis models, AnxA-/- mice showed increased inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration, but decreased bacterial clearance and survival. In addition, AnxA deficiency led to increased ROS and IL-17. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we found that cystine 9 of AnxA was the most important site for ROS regulation. Furthermore, ROS appears to be responsible for elevated IL-17 and subsequent inflammatory response. Depletion of IL via CRISPR/Cas KO downregulated inflammation and conferred protection against seps in An-/- mice. Our findings reveal a previously unknown function for AnxA in inflammatory response polymicrobial se models via AnxA-IL-17 axis, providing insight into pathophysiology of seps.
HIV-1 infection of macrophages plays a key role in viral pathogenesis and progression to AIDS. Polyinosine-polycidylic acid ( poly I:C ), a synthetic analog of dsRNA, and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ), ligands for Toll-like receptors TLR3 and TLR4, respectively, are known to decrease HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM ). We found that poly I:C and L-stimulation of MMs abrogated infection by CCR-using macrophage-tropic HIV and vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein-pseudyped HIV-1 virions, while TLR TLR or TLR agonists only reduced infection to varying extent. Suppression of infection did not correlate with differential effects on CD or CCR expression, type interferon induction, or pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Integrated viruses were detected in unstimulated TLR and T9-stimulated cells, but in TLR or T4-stimulated MMs, suggesting alteration of post-entry preintegration events. We found increased microRNA mi-155 levels in M upon TLR4 but not T-stimulation, and mi-155 inhibitor partially restored infectivity in poly I-stimulated MMs. Ectopic mi-155 diminished HIV-1 in primary M and cell lines. Furthermore, poly I-stimulation and mi- expression did not alter early RT products but resulted in accumulation of late products and undetectable or low levels of integrated viruses and 2TR circles. Reduced mRNA and protein levels of HIV factors involved in trafficking/import preintegration (AD10, TN3,up, N153 LED/p75 ) were in I-stimulated mi-trans M, and reporter suggested authentic mi targets.
Most organisms use daily light/dark cycles to control many physiological processes. In plants, growth of the embryonic stem ( hypocotyl ) is maximal at different times of the day, depending on external photoper and internal circadian. However, the interactions between light, circadian, and growth-promoting hormone in growth remain poorly understood. To determine the transcriptional component of rhythmic growth, we analyzed the Arabidopsis thaliana seedling transcriptome under multiple conditions and backgrounds. We show that a group of hormone-associated genes are coexpress at the time when hypocyl growth is maximal. This correlates with overrepresentation of cis-acting (CAT ) in hormone promoters, which is sufficient to confer diurnal and circadian patterns in vivo. Using circadian and signaling mutants, we show that both internal hormone capacity and coincidence with darkness are required for wild-type growth. We argue that the circadian controls growth by permissive of hormone levels to the time of day.
Genetically modifying the gut microbiota of the insect vector Rhodnius prolixus to control Chagas disease may be achieved through systemic RNA interference (RNAi) technologies. Here, we used Escherichia coli HT115(DE3) expressing dsRNA for the Rhodni heme-binding protein (RHBP) and catalase (CAT) to modify the gut microbiota of nymph and adult stages. RHBP is an egg protein and CAT an antioxidant expressed in all tissues by developmental stages. The RNA interference was systemic and temporal. Concentrations of E. coli115(DE) above 3.35 × 10^7 CFU/mL produced significant RHBP and CAT knockdown in nymphs and adults. RH expression in the body was reduced by 99% three days after feeding, returning to normal levels 10 days after. CAT expression was reduced 99% and 96% in ovary and posteriorgut, respectively, five days after ingestion. Mortality increased 24-30% in first instars fed RHBP and CAT. Molting were reduced 100% first and 80 third instars fed bacteria RHBP or CATRNA. Oviposition reduced 43% RH and 84% CAT. Embogenesis arrested 16% RH and 20% laid. Feeding 105 CF/mL natural symbion Rhodoccus rhodii transformed to express RHBP hairpin RNA reduced RH expression 89 and oviposition.
Malaria was the leading cause of death in pregnant women in refugee camps on the Thai-Burmese border in the 1980s. However, with the introduction of artemisinin combination therapy, the incidence of malaria in the population has significantly decreased. Despite this, the causes of fever in pregnancy are not well documented. Pregnant women attending antenatal clinics, where screening for malaria is routine, were invited to have a comprehensive clinical and laboratory screen if they had fever. Fever occurred in 5. 0% (409 ) of pregnant women attending anten clinics from January 2004 to May 2006. Malaria was the cause in 55.5% (227 ) of febrile episodes. A cohort of 203 women had detailed investigations and follow up. Arthrop-borne diseases, ricketial infections, dengue and zoonotic leptpirosis accounted for nearly half of febr illnesses, 47.3 (96 ). Coinfection was observed 3.9 (8 ) of women, mostly malaria ricketia. Pyonephritis 19.7 (40 ) was also a common cause of fever. Once malaria pyoneph and respiratory illness were excluded by microscopy/or clinical findings, one-third of febr infections were caused by ricketia or leptpi. Scrub murine typhus was associated with poor outcomes including stillbirth and low birth weight.
Recombination is the process by which genetic material is exchanged between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. In humans, recombination has been associated with aneuploidy. Here, we examine the relationship between maternal age and recombination in humans. We used a panel of 69 French-Canadian pedigrees genotyped with over 600, 000 markers to localize recombination events in 195 maternal meios. We observed a general pattern of variation in fine-scale recombination rates previously reported in humans. However, we found a significant decrease in recombination with advancing maternal age in humans. This effect appears to be chromosome-specific and localized to the middle of chromosomal arms and subtelomeric regions. We propose that for some chromosomes, protection against non-disjunction provided by recombination becomes less efficient with advancing maternal age, contributing to higher aneuploidy in older women.
Cryptocococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes disease in immunocompromised patients. Vaccines against this pathogen are difficult to develop as most patients at risk of disease are deficient in adaptive immunity. Here, we describe an experimental strategy to induce innate immunity in macrophages in vivo. Unlike current models of trained immunity, we present an innate-like phenotype in macrophages that is maintained for at least 70 days post-immunization and results in complete protection against secondary challenge in the absence of adaptive cells. Macrophages were primed with IF-γ in vivo and challenged with C. neoans 70 days later. RNA-seq analysis revealed upregulation of IF-γ and STAT1 pathways following challenge. Enhanced cytokine responses were pathogen-dependent and correlated with increased STAT binding to promoter regions of genes associated with anti-fungal immunity. Thus, we demonstrate an alternative to induce macroage innate immunity in vivo that facilitates pathogen-specific vaccine responses.
Polycomb repressive complexes (PCs) are involved in transcriptional regulation and developmental processes in both plants and animals. In Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), depletion of different members of PC causes both overlapping and unique phenotypic defects. Here, we show that CURLY LEAF (CL), a catalytic subunit of PC2, coordinates with members of PC1 in suppression of distinct developmental programs. We found that expression of flower development genes is repressed in seedlings preferentially via non-redund role of CL, which is associated with LIKE HETCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP). In contrast, expression of embryo development is repressed by PC-catalytic subunits AtBMI and AtRING in common with PC-catalytic CL or SWINGER (SW).
The RNA polymerase II is a multisubunit enzyme that plays a central role in eukaryotic transcription. It has a trigger loop ( TL ) that is involved in substrate selection, catalysis, and translocation. To understand the structure and function of TL in Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II, we quantitatively phenotyped nearly all TL variants at the individual residue level. We found three classes of mutants with distinct phenotypes linked to transcription defects or stress. Mutations in the intra-TL hydrophobic pocket, proposed to provide a mechanism for substrate-trigger TL folding through destabilization of the catalytically inactive state, conferred phenotypes consistent with pocket disruption and catalysis. Furthermore, allele-specific interactions among TL and TL-proimal residues support the contribution of the funnel and bridge helices ( BH ) to TL dynamics.
Rabies virus (RV) infections are usually caused by bites or scratches from rabid carnivores or bats. The virus spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) via retrograde transport within the neuronal network, replicating in neuronal somata and infecting other neurons via transynaptic spread. We speculate that in addition to neuronal transport, hematogenous spread from the site of infection to the brain might represent an alternative way for RV to invade the CNS. To determine whether RV variants can invade the CNS from the periphery via hematogenously, we infected mice intramuscularly (i. m. ) or intravenously ( i. v ) with dog-associated DOG or silver bat-associated SB. We monitored the progression of clinical signs of rabies and followed the spread of virus from infection to brain using immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In contrast to i. m. infection, both variants caused lethal encephalopathy, only i. v infection with SB resulted in lethal infection. RT-PCR did not reveal differences in virus loads in spinal cord or brain at times after i. m or i. infection of SB. Immunohisto analysis showed only i. administered SB directly infected the brain. The earliest affected regions were hypothalamic nuclei connected by neurosecret fibers to circumventricular neurohypophysis and medianence. Our data suggest hematogenous SB can lead to fatal encephal through direct invasion of CNS at neuro interface of hypothalamus-hypysis.
Since 1918, the H1N1 subtype of the influenza A virus has been responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality in humans, with the most notable being the global pandemic of 1918. However, the evolutionary history of the H1N1 virus is not well understood, particularly the virological basis for several epidemics of unusual severity in the 1940s and 1950s. In this study, we show that segmental reassortment has played an important role in the evolution of H1N1 since 1918. We demonstrate that an H1N1 isolate from 1947 acquired novel PB2 and HA genes through intra-subtype reassortment, which may explain the abrupt antigenic evolution of this virus. Similarly, the 195 influenza epidemic may have been associated with reassort H1N1 viruses. Intra-subtype reassortment appears to be more important in the evolution and epidemiology of HN1 influenza virus than previously realized.
Nicotine acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to stimulate dopamine (DA) release from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but the mechanism of action is debated: direct stimulation of DA cells through nACh activation or inhibition through desensitization of nA on GABAergic interneurons. We used a computational model of VTA circuitry and nCh function to shed light on this issue. Our model shows that α4β-containing nChRs on DA or GABA cells mediate acute nicotine effects. We account in vitro and in vivo data and predict conditions for direct or inhibition to be origin of DA increases. We propose experiments to disentangle both mechanisms. We show that endogenous acetylcholine crucially determines evoked DA for both mechanisms. Our results delineate mechanisms by which V mediates acute properties of nicotine and suggest acetylcholine hypothesis for nicotine.
Leishmanias is a disfiguring skin disease caused by Leishmania tropica infection. It is often complicated by bacterial and/or fungal infections. We studied a novel concept to prevent superinfections, accelerate wound closure, and improve cosmetic outcome. From 2004 to 2008, we performed a randomized, double-blinded phase II trial in Kabul, Afghanistan. Patients with L. trop CL were treated with high-frequency electrocauterization ( EC ) followed by daily moist-wound-treatment ( MWT ) with polyacrylate hydrogel ( group I ) or without ( II ) pharmaceutical chlorite ( DAC-055 ). Patients below 5, facial lesions, pregnancy, or comorbidities were excluded. The primary outcome was time for complete epithelialization. Biops were taken before EC, after wound closure, and after 6 months. The mean time for wound closure was short in both groups (59.1 d and 54.2; p =0.83 ). DAC-055 caused more rapid epithelial in patients with Leish-positive biops (37.2 vs.58. p=0.08 ). Superfections occurred in both groups (8.8% ). Except one, ulcers (10.2 in I 18.5 II; p=0.158 ) were in cases with persistent parasite after healing. In vitro, DAC-055 showed leishicidal effect on amastigotes. Compared to intraional injections, EC plus M led to rapid closure and lower relapse rate.
RAS is a small GTPase that is one of the most prevalent oncogenes. It transmits proliferative signals in normal and cancer cells through the evolutionarily conserved RAF-MEK-MAP module, which is one of the main conduits downstream of R. Over the last two decades, genetic and biochemical studies have uncovered a small set of factors regulating R/MAP signaling. Most of these were found to control RAF activation, suggesting a central role for this event. However, whether additional factors are required at this level or further remains open. To obtain a comprehensive view of elements functionally linked to R/MK, we conducted a genome-wide RNA screen in Drosila cells for factors impacting R-mediated MAP activation. This led to the identification of 101 validated hits, most of which were previously associated with this pathway. Epasis experiments were carried out on individual candidates to determine their position to core components. This revealed new factors acting at different steps along pathway, including a protein modulating RAF activation. However, most hits work downstream ME and influence MAP expression. These consist of constitutive splicing factors and suggest splicing plays role in establishing MAP levels.
Cryptocococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are two species of the Cryptococcus neoformans/C gatt complex that cause cryptococcosis in humans and animals. In Thailand, a retrospective study of 498 isolates from clinical, environmental, and veterinary sources was conducted. The majority of the isolates ( 68. 9% ) were from males with a mean age of 37.97 years, and 88.5% of C neoans and 37.5 of gatt were from HIV patients. The majority of the isolates (94.8% ) were C neo molecular type V regardless of source (94.6% clinical, 98.8% environmental and 86.2 veterinary ). In addition, types II (2.4% clinical and 33. veterinary ), IV (0.% environmental ), I (0. clinical ) and II (2. clinical ) were less frequent. Multilocus Sequence Type ( ML ) analysis identified 20 types in Thailand. The isolates are part of the global population with 30 for gii and 82, 83 137 141 172 and 173 for neo being unique. Most gii were ST7VGb, identical to the virulent Vancouver outbreak. The study revealed greater diversity and major types than previously reported.
Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to cis-regulatory elements in the genome. The evolution of cis-regulatory networks is thought to underlie much of the phenotypic variation observed across organisms. We analyzed the evolution of the largest class of metazoan TFs, Cys-His2 zinc finger (CH-ZF) TFs, across 12 Drosophila species spanning ~45 million years. We found that a significant fraction of CH-Z TF 1-1 orthologs in flies exhibit variations that affect their DNA-binding specificities. In addition to loss and gain of CH-Z domains, we found diverging DNA-contact residues in ~44% of domains between D melanaster and other species. These diverging residues, found in ~70% of D melan CH-Z genes and ~26% all melan TFs, show evidence of constraint: conserved across phylogen clades and evolve slower than diverging residues. These variations were rarely found as polymorphisms within D melan flies, indicating rapid fixation. The specificities of these domains change gradually across phylogen distances suggesting stepwise trajectories for TF divergence. Further, proteins with conserved CH domains are enriched in developmental functions, those varying exhibit no enrichments.
Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paraty A are the causative agents of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers. However, the lack of typing sera and the need for culture in some cases hinders diagnosis. To overcome this, serotype-specific PCR assays are required. However, the sensitivity and specificity of such assays must be demonstrated on large collections of strains representative of the targeted serotypes and other bacterial populations with similar clinical symptoms. We developed a conventional multiplex PCR and EvaGreen-based real-time singleplex assays for detection and differentiation of serotypes Typhi and Paraty A using a new family of repeated DNA sequences, CRIS (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats) as a serotype target. We achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity for each assay after validation on 188 serotype Typhi and 74 ser Paraty A strains from diverse genetic, geographic and time origins and 70 strains of frequently encountered in bloodstream, including 29 Salmonella serotypes and 38 other species.
Leishmaniasis is an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes leishmaniasis in humans. The immune response to this parasite involves the differentiation of IFγ-secreating CD+ T helper 1 (Th1) cells. Notch receptors are known to regulate cell differentiation, but their role in Th1 polarization is not well understood. Here, we investigated the role of Notch in Th1 differentiation following infection with Leishmania major. We generated mice with cell-specific deletion of Notch1 (N1), Notch2 (N2), or both (N1N2CDCre) and infected them with Leish major. Mice lacking both Not1 and Not2 (N2) developed unhealing lesions and uncontrolled parasitemia. This correlated with impaired secretion of IFγ by draining node CD4 T cells and increased secretion of IL-5 and IL-13. In contrast, mice with single deletion of Not1 or Not2 were resistant to infection and developed a Th1 response. We show that Notch is required for IFγ secretion by Th1 cells. This effect is independent of CSL/RBPκ, the major effector of Notch, since mice with deletion of RBPκ in T cells were able to develop IFγ-secre Th and kill parasites. Collectively, we demonstrate a crucial role for RBPκ-independent Notch in Th1 differentiation following Leish infection.
Schistosoma mansoni Infection Increases Susceptibility to Systemic SHIV Clade C Infection in Rhes Macaques after Muc Virus Exposure. Infection with the parasitic worm Schistoma mansoni is common in sub-Saharan Africa, where 10% of the world's population lives and 2/3 of all HIV/AIDS cases occur. We tested the hypothesis that pre-existing infection with this worm increases susceptibility to HIV-1 in a relevant in vivo model. We infected rhesus monkeys with Schistoma mansoni and challenged them with decreasing doses of R-tropic simian immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-C). Systemic infection occurred in parasitized monkeys at doses that remained sub-infectious in normal hosts. The 50% infectious dose of SHIV-C was 17-fold lower in parasitized animals compared to controls (P<0. 001 ). Coinfected animals had higher viral loads than controls (P0.001 ) as well as viral replication in CD4 central cells (0.03 ).
Acetylcholine (ACh) is a key regulator of neural excitability and one of the neurochemical substrates of sleep. We demonstrate in a biophysical model how changes in neural excitability and network structure interact to create three functional regimes: localized, asynchronous, traveling, and synchronous. Our results qualitatively match those observed experimentally. Cortical activity during slow sleep (SWS) differs from that during REM or waking states. During WS there are traveling patterns of activity in cortex; in other states stationary patterns occur. Our model is composed of Hodgkin-Hux type neurons with M-current regulated by ACh. Regulation of ACh can account for dynamical changes between regimes. Reduction of this current recreates reduction in spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) shift from type 2 to type 1 phase response curve (PRC) in presence of A. When S is minimal in waking or REM state high A, patterns are localized and easily pinned by network inhomogeneities. When S is present (decreasing A) traveling of activity arise. Further in A leads high degree of synchrony within waves. We show level A determines network sensitive activity to heterogeneity.
Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a cancer that develops in an inflammatory microenvironment with reduced microbial diversity. We hypothesized that mutations in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway could disrupt innate immune signaling and promote a microenvironment that favors tumenesis. We found that non-synonymous mutations affect the TLR pathway in 25/171 ( 14. 6%, Path p = 8.7x10-5 ) tumors. TLR mutant cases were associated with more proximal tumors and metastatic disease. We validated our findings in an external dataset with non-syn TLR pathway mutations in 33/149 ( 22.1%, Path = 0.05 ) tumors and other tumor exposed microbiomes in COSMIC (10, 318 samples ) including uterine endrioid carcinoma 188/320 (58.8% ) cutaneous melanoma 377/988 (38.2 ) colorectal adenarcin 402/151 (26.5 ) and stomacharcin 151/579 (26.1 ). TLR was most frequently mutated with eleven in 10/171 (5.8 ) E tumors. TLR mutants 439, 570, 703 and 787 had impaired reactivity to lipopolyscharide with reductions in signaling by lucifer assays.
Taste is a critical for animal survival, but the development of taste cells is still largely unknown. We used a novel approach to investigate the molecular regulation of taste development in mice by combining in silico and in vivo analyses. We found that taste receptor molecules (TRMs) colocalized within developing circumvallate papillae (CVP) and used computational analysis to investigate the possibility of a common regulatory network for TRM transcription. We identified Hes as a likely regulatory factor and examined its function in vivo. Expression analyses revealed that decreased nuclear H1 correlated with type II taste cell markers. After E18, the VP of H1−/− mutants displayed 5-fold more TRM-immunactive cells than the VP of wild-type littermates. Our analyses suggest that H1 plays a role in orchestrating taste cell differentiation in developing buds.
Rice is an important monocotyledonous crop that differs from the dicotyledonous Arabidopsis in many aspects. In Arabidopsis, ethylene and auxin act synergistically regulate root growth and development. However, their interaction in rice is unclear. We report that transcriptional activation of OsIL on expression of Y8RE7 and indole-3-pyric acid (IPA)-dependent auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation. Using inhibitor of Y activity, which regulates auxin biosynthesis via conversion of IPA to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), we show that eth-inhibited root elong is dependent on Y-based auxin biosynthesis. By screening of seedling root from mutagen libraries following ethylene, we identified eth-insensitive rein-1, which YRE7 is truncated at C-terminus. Mutation Y7 reduced auxin biosynthesis in, while Y overexpression enhanced eth sensitivity in roots. Moreover, catalyzed conversion of IPA to A, truncated Y resulted in significant reduction of enzymatic, indicating Y is required for IPA-dependent auxin bios and eth-in elong in seedlings. Further indicated eth induced Y expression and promoted accumulation in roots. Addition of low rescued eth response in, strongly that elong depends on-dependent auxin bios. Genetic revealed Y-mediated auxin function downstream OsIL, which directly expression.
The first nationwide epidemiological study of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases in Saudi Arabia was conducted over a period of 24 months. A total of 527 NT isolates were collected with a higher proportion of Saudi citizens (76.5% ), elderly patients >60 years (34.2% ) and male (65.3 ) respectively. The majority of isolates (75.1% ) were pulmonary with 44.7% proven clinical significance. A total of 34 NT species including 17 rare were identified, in addition to 8 undefined isolates. M. simiae (22.6 ) M. fortuit (18.1 ) and. absus (17.8 ) were predominant. Interestingly, 27 new cases of clinically relevant M.iyense were noticed. The study showed rare events such as mycobacteremia, abscess, peritonitis and ascites caused by. wolii,. hatic, duii and monence respectively. Diabetes mellitus (P-0.04 ) and history of tuberculosis (P-0.001 ) were risk factors associated with NT diseases.
Upon starvation, yeast cells exit the mitotic cell cycle and acquire characteristics of quiescent cells to ensure longevity. Little is known about the molecular determinants that orchestrate quies entry and extension. Using starvation-specific reporters, we screened a subset of the deletion library representing genes encoding signaling proteins. Apart from previously characterised Rim15, Mck and Yak1 kinases, the SN1/AMP complex, cell integrity and cycle regulators were necessary for quies establishment and extension of chronological lifespan (CLS), suggesting quies requires integration of starvation signals via multiple pathways. CL correlates with the amount of carbohydrates but not cell cycle status. Combined removal of glycogen and trehalose biosynthetic genes, especially GSY and TPS, abolishes accumulation and severely reduces CL. Concurrent overexpression of GSY and T1 or supplementation trehal to medium ameliorates CL defects by rimΔy1 orΔmckΔ. We reveal that intracellular ROS are cooperatively controlled by Yak, Rim and Mck, and mediate TOR-regulated accumulation and CL extension. Our data support that metabolic reprogramming to accumulate stores and activation of antioxidant systems are coordinated by Yak, Rim and Mck to ensure quies and extension in yeast.
Influenza A virus hemagglutinin glycosylation compensates for antibody escape fitness costs. Antigenic evolution enables the persistence of seasonal influenza A and B viruses in human populations despite widespread immunity. The mechanisms that enable antigenic evolution are critical for designing durable vaccines and therapeutics. Here, we reveal an unexpected role for hemagglutinin ( HA ) glycosylation in compensating for fitness defects resulting from anti-HA neutralizing antibody escape. Antibody-free propagation of antigenic escape viruses selected for mutations that modulated receptor binding through addition of N-linked glycans to the HA globular domain.
Cardiac arrhythmias are often caused by drugs that prolong the cardiac action potential (AP) in a way that is dependent on the heart rate. This means that arrhythmia suppression is reduced at fast heart rates and increased at slow rates. The opposite property, forward dependence, would overcome these problems, but forward dependent antiarrhythmics remain elusive. Moreover, there is evidence that reverse dependence is an intrinsic property of perturbations to the AP. We performed a comprehensive analysis of ventricular myocyte models to address the possibility of forward dependence. By simulating populations of myocytes with varying properties and analyzing results, we predicted the rate-dependent effects of changes in multiple parameters. We tested 40 parameters in each model and assessed AP duration at slow (0. 2 Hz ) and fast (2 ) rates. We identified a variety of forward dependent current perturbations and specific mechanisms. For example, an increase in L-type current is forward when accompanied by indirect rate-dependent changes in delayed rectifier potassium. We compared predictions across models and identified inward rectifier current and sodium-potassium pump as the most likely to produce forward prolongation. Finally, a statistical analysis demonstrated that models with minimal rate changes in AP have little capacity for perturbations, whereas models with large changes have considerable potential. This can explain differences between species and ventricular types. Overall, this study provides new and general insights into determinants of AP dependence and illustrates a strategy for beneficial antiarrhythm drug design.
Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PAS) is a method that investigates whether genetic polymorphisms associated with a phenotype are also associated with other diagnoses. In this study, we have developed methods to perform PW based on ICD-10 codes and biological results, and use a quantitative trait as criterion. We tested our approach on thiopur S-methylase (TPM) activity in patients treated thiur drugs. We developed two methods for ICD-10 codes: I-10 hierarchy and mapping to existing I-9M PW codes. Eleven biological results were analyzed using discretization algorithms. We applied methods in patients with TP activity from clinical warehouse of a French hospital between 0 and 3. Data initiation thiur treatment were analyzed and groups compared according to TP level. A total records were analyzed representing, I-10 codes and, biological results. The I-9 PW codes and I-10 codes were concord. Cross-validation biological results allowed to validate phenotypes. Iron-deficiency anemia and mellitus were with very TP activity ( = .4 and =.5, respectively.
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that causes substantial morbidity and mortality for which no treatments are currently available. Stem cells offer some promise in restoration of neurological function. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to study the impact of stem cell biology and experimental design on motor and sensory outcomes following stem treatments in animal models of SCI. One hundred and fifty publications using 45 different stem preparations met our inclusion criteria. Only one used autologous stem cells. Overall, allogenic stem treatment appears to improve both motor (effect size 27.2%; 95% CI 25.0–29.4%; 5 comparisons in 628 animals ) and sensory (effect 26.3%;% CI 7.9–44.7%;23 in 473 animals ) outcomes. For sensory outcome most heterogeneity between experiments was accounted by facets of stem biology. Differentiation before implant and intravenous delivery favoured better outcome. Cell implant did not appear improve sensory in females and was enhanced by isofurane anaesthesia. Biological plausibility supported by dose–response. For outcome facets had little effect. Instead heterogeneity explained by experimental and outcome used. Location, method injury and immunosup all had impact.
Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, caused by Ascaris lumbricoid, hookworm, and Trichuris trura, affect more than a billion people worldwide. Preventive chemotherapy, or repeated administration of anthelmint drugs to at-risk populations, is the main control strategy. However, this does not prevent reinfection. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess patterns and dynamics of STH reinfection after treatment. We searched PubMed, ISI of Science, EASE, Cochr Database Systematic Reviews, China Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanang Database, Chinese Journal, and Scholar. From 154 studies, 51 were included and 24 provided STH rates pre- and post-treatment, whereas 42 reported determinants of predisposition to rein. At 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, A. lumbroid reached 26% (95% CI:16–43 )%, 68 (95% CI:60–76 ) and 94 (95 CI:88–100 ) of pretreatment levels. T. trura reached 36% (95 CI:28–47 ), 67 (95 CI42–100 ) and 82 ( CI62–100 ), and hookworm 30 (95 CI26–34 ) 55 ( CI34–87 ) and 57 (49–67 ). Prevalence and intensity of rein were positively correlated with pretreatment status. STH reinfections occur rapidly after treatment, particularly A lumbr and Tura.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of metabolic disorders ranging from simple steatosis to complex nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. To identify deregulation of metabolic processes at the molecular level that give rise to various NAFL phenotypes, algorithms such as pathway enrichment analysis (EA) can be used. However, these analyses are subject to biases associated with different pathway annotations and cannot capture complex interactions of genome-scale metabolic networks (Gs). Here, we introduce Minimum Enrichment Analysis (MiA) that applies to Gs to generate all possible minimal networks (Ms) composed of reactions pertaining to metabolic subsystems that synthesize a target metabolite. We applied MiA to deregulated Ms to identify regulators in NAFL phenotypes, such as fatty liver and inflammation in humans and mice by integrating transcriptomics data from liver samples. We identified deregulations in synthesis of cholesteryl esters, cholesterol, and hexadecate in humans and mice, and found regulators of hydrogen synthesis were differently regulated in humans and mice. We identified Ms that demonstrate characteristics of different NAFL phenotypes. MiA is applicable to any G and any metabolite, making it flexible to study metabolism for any disease or organism.
Olfactory discrimination is a challenging because of the large number of odors that need to be identified independent of their intensity. Primacy coding, where the odor identity is encoded by the earliest responding receptors, provides a compact representation that can be efficiently interpreted by the brain. We show that primacy information depends on the number of receptors in the representation, but only weakly on the size of the repertoire. The representation is independent of odor intensity and the information is useful for olfactory tasks close to experimentally measured. Interestingly, we find that smaller repertoires are advantageous for discriminating odors. The model suggests that overly sensitive receptors dominate the response and make the array useless, allowing us to predict receptor adaptation to environmental changes. We show that primacy is more useful than binary and normalized because sparsity is independent of odor statistics, in contrast to alternatives.
HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bnAbs) are a promising candidates for HIV therapy and vaccine design. However, some bnAbs occasionally display unusual neutralization profiles with non-sigmoid slopes and plateaus at <100% neutralization. Here, we investigated the extent of non-sigmoid slopes and plateaus <100 for bnAbs. We used a panel of 278 pseudoviruses in a CD4 T-cell assay and 117 viruses in the TZM assay. We found that bnAbs targeting the V2 apex of Env and gp41 had neutralization profiles that plateaued at <100. Conversely, bnAbs targeting high-mann epitopes were less likely to show this behavior. CD4 binding Abs showed this behavior infrequently. We also observed incomplete neutralization in a PBMC-grown virus panel from patient swarms. In addition, we compared bnAbs against 18 virus clones produced in 293 cells and PBs and assayed in TZM cells. Plateaus <90 were seen with both types of virus with no consistent patterns. Our results suggest that incomplete neutralization and nonigmoid neutral curves are possible for all bnAbs against a range of viruses in both cell and primary cells. This has implications for use in therapy and vaccine design.
The Warburg effect is a metabolic trait of cancer cells that involves the production of lactate from glucose in the presence of oxygen. In addition to this, cancer cells utilize glutamine extensively and have impaired mitochondrial electron transport. It is unclear how these metabolic rearrangements contribute to a selective advantage for cancer cell proliferation. To understand how glucose and glutamine are converted to energy and biomass, we used a model of human metabolism. We simulated cells with different glutamine and glucose uptake rates and observed that in proliferating cells fermented glucose to lactate in the presence of oxygen. At high glutamine utilization, glucose oxidation was decreased and lactate production from glutamine was enhanced. This was only observed when carbon exceeded the amount that could be oxidized by oxygen. Flux Analysis indicated that this pattern is optimal for biomass and ATP production. It requires a branched TCA cycle and glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation for lipid and protein production. It is sustained by redox-controlled reactions. We experimentally validated glutamine metabolic changes in a K-ras transformed cell line. These findings offer new understanding of metabolic reprogramming that underlies cancer growth.
Prion protein (Pr) is a misfolded protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The cellular environment in which Pr is converted to its disease-associated isoforms is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the interactome of Pr in a cell culture model permissive to prion replication. We extended our study to Doppel (PrPND) and Shadoo (Spr), mammalian Pr paralogs. We found that all three prion family members interact in neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, we confirmed interactions between Pr and the cell adhesion molecule laminin, Na+/K ATPases, and protein disulfide isomerases (PDI), reconciling previous findings. We also found that Pr interactions with PDIs may extend beyond the endoplasmic reticulum and play a role in PrSc accumulation. We propose that Pr organizes its environment by binding adhesion molecules with immunoglobulin domains, which recognize oligannose-bearing membrane proteins.
Respiratory virus infections, such as influenza, induce a robust type 1 pro-inflammatory cytokine response. However, the production of type 2 cytokines has been observed. Type 2 cytokine production during respiratory infection is linked to asthma exacerbation; however type 2 cytokines may also be protective. Interleukin ( ) is a prototypical type 2 cytokine that is essential for eosinophil maturation and egress of the bone marrow. Using a mouse model of influenza infection, we found a transient release of IL-5 into airways along with a significant accumulation of eosophils into the lungs during the recovery phase of infection. The source of IL-5 was group 2 innate lymphoid cells (IL2 ) infiltrating the lungs. The accumulation of eosoph following clearance is reflected in the expansion of c+ IL-5 IL2. Enhanced IL-5 production by IL2 is concomitant with expression of the IL-33 subunit, by IL2. NKT cells and alveolar macrophages (AM ) are sources of IL that enhance IL-5 from IL2.
Invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (NT) infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children and HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of NT disease in Asia are not well documented. We retrospectively identified 102 cases of NT infections in an infectious disease hospital in Southern Vietnam between 2008 and 2013. Clinical records were accessed to evaluate demographic and clinical factors associated with NT infection and identify risk factors with death. Multi-locus typing and antimicrobial testing was performed on all organisms. Of 102 NT patients, 71% were HIV-infected, >90% were adults,71% were male and 33% reported intravenous use. Twenty-six/92 (28%) patients had known outcome; HIV was associated with death (p=0.039). Enteridis Sequence (ST)11 (48%,43/89) and Typhimium (ST19,34,44) (26%,23/89) were most identified serovars. Tyim was more common in HIV-infected (p=0.003). Isolates HIV-infected were more likely reduced against trimethoprim-sulfamox than HIV-negative (p=0.037).
Bacteriophages play a crucial role in the survival and pathogenicity of their hosts via lysogenic factors and nutrient redistribution via lysis. Analyses of phage and viral genes in environmental samples provide insights into the impact of viruses on microbial communities and human health. However, phage ORFs are extremely diverse, with over 70% dissimilar to genes with annotated functions in GenBank. Better identification of viruses would aid in disease detection, vaccine development, and physiological understanding of environment. In contrast, viral structural proteins are challenging to detect from sequence data due to low conservation, few conserved catalytic sites, and limited data. We designed a method to predict phage protein sequences using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). First, we trained ANNs to classify structural proteins using amino acid frequencies, correctly classifying a large fraction with high specificity and sensitivity. Subsequently, we added isoelectric points as a feature to ANNs classifying specialized proteins, namely capsid and tail proteins. Expectedly, these ANNs were more accurate than structural ANNs. We experimentally validated ANN predictions by examining ORFs with no similarities to sequences that ANN-predicted proteins by transmission microscopy. Some self-assembled structures resembling virion structures. Our ANNs are new tools for identifying phage and prophage proteins difficult to detect by bioinformatic analysis.
Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic virus that encodes more than 85 proteins, including both unique and conserved herpesviral proteins. KSH ORF20 is a member of the herpesiral UL24 family, but its function and role in the viral life cycle is not well understood. OR20 encodes three largely uncharacterized isoforms that are predominantly localized in the nucleus and nucleolus. We found that OR20 interacts with the interferon-stimulated gene product oligoadyl synthase-like (OL) protein, which has antiviral activity against some viruses, but its role in gammaherpesviruses is unknown. Characterization of OL partners by quantitative affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (q-APMS) identified a similar interactome to OR20. Both OR20 and OL copurified with 40S and 60 ribosomal subunits and associated with polysomes. OR20 did not have a global effect on translation, but enhanced RIG-induced expression of endogenous OL in an IR3-dependent but IFN-independent manner. We show that OL and OR20 expression were induced after reactivation of latently infected HuLT-KSH.219 cells. Interestingly, we found that OL enhanced KSH infection. During KSH OR20 mutant infection, however, OL-dependent enhancement was lost. Our data suggest that OR20 usurps the function of OL to benefit KSH infection.
Lassa fever (Lassa virus disease ) is an important cause of undifferentiated fever in children in endemic areas. In Nigeria, there is a dearth of data on the prevalence and clinical presentation of Lassa fever in febrile children. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and presentation of Lassa fever in feile children with and without convulsions. This was a prospective study of consecutive feile children ≥1–15 years admitted to the Children’s Emergency of Irrua Specialist Hospital over 1 year. Feile children with convuls (Cases ) were compared with those without convuls (Controls ). Lassa was defined by positive Lassa virus RT-PCR. Rates were compared between groups using χ2 or Fisher’s tests and p<0. 05 taken as significant. Of 913 feile admissions, 373 (40.9% ) had fever. Of these, 108 (29% ) presented convuls. The overall prevalence of Lassa was 13/373 (3.5%; 95% CI 1.9, 5.7 ) in feile, 3/108 (2.8 ) in Cases and 10/265 (3.8 ) in Controls. Only vomiting and bleeding were significantly associated with increased prevalence of Lassa.
Arabidopsis thalian is a model organism that is widely used to study plant biology. Drought is a major factor that reduces crop yields worldwide. We identified the karri receptor KINSENSITIVE2 ( KAI2 ) as a factor that regulates drought resistance in Arabidopsis. Karrins are butenol compounds found in smoke that promote seed germination and improve seedling growth under stressful conditions. We found that mutations in K2 result in hypersensitivity to water deprivation. We performed transcriptomic, physiological, and biochemical analyses of k2 plants to understand the basis for K2-regulated drought resistance. We found that k2 have increased rates of water loss and drought-induced cell damage, enlarged stomatal apert, and higher cuticular permeability. In addition, k2 have reduced anthocyan biosynthesis during drought and are hypersensitive to abscic acid ( ABA ) in stomatal and cotyledon assays. We identified genes that are associated with the physiological and biochemical changes through genome-wide transcript analysis of k2 under well-water and dehydration. These data provide evidence for cros between A- and K2-dependent pathways in drought responses. We compared the stract receptor mutant DW14 to k2 and found that stract also contribute to drought, although not affecting cuticle. Our findings suggest that chemical or genetic of K2 and14 may improve drought resistance.
Schistosoma japonicum is a parasitic flatworm that causes zoonotic schistosomiasis in China and the Philippines. To understand the role of insulin signaling in its growth and reproduction, we have focused on the insulin receptor ( SIR ) of S. japonicum, which we previously cloned and characterised. We show that human insulin binds to the insulin binding domain of recombinant SIR1 and SIR2 ( SLD1 and SLD2 ) produced in Drosophila cells. We used RNA interference to knock down SIR in S. japon in vitro and found that in addition to reduced SIR transcription, other insulin pathway genes associated with glucose metabolism and schistosome fecundity were also impacted. Furthermore, SIR-knockdown worms had reduced glucose uptake compared to luciferase controls. In vaccine experiments, we found that SLD and SLD depressed growth, intestinal granuloma and faecal production in S japon in mice with low dose infection.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a leading cause of disability in the Pacific region, where >96% of 1.7 million people are at risk of LF infection. Current mass drug administration (MDA) has reduced LF prevalence, but vector biology complicates MDA. In some regions, LF elimination cannot be attained via MDA alone. Obligate mosquitoes provide additional targets for breaking the LF cycle, but existing methods are ineffective for Aedes aegypti in the Pacific. We demonstrate that interspecific hybridization and introgression results in Aedes aegypt strain ‘CP’ that is stably infected with endosymbiotic Wolbachia fromedes albopictus. The CP strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory assays demonstrate CP males are competitive, resulting in elimination when introduced into wild Aedes aegpt populations.
Trypanosomias is a vector-borne disease that is fatal if left untreated. In Tanzania, it is a major public health and socio-economic problem in affected communities. This study estimated the burden of rhodes H in terms of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALs) and costs in a highly endemic area of Tanzania. Data was obtained from 143 patients admitted in 2004 for treatment at Kali Health Centre, Uram District. The direct and indirect costs incurred by patients and health services were calculated. DALs were estimated using the Global Burden Project methods and previous rhodes H estimates, assuming 45% under-reporting. In Uram District, DALs were 215.7 (95% CI 155.–287.5 ) and 281.6 (95% CI 209.–362. ) respectively. With 45% under-reporting, results were 622.5 (95 CI 155–109.9 ) and 978.9 (95 CI 201–187.8 ). Treating 143 patients cost US$15,514, patients paid US3, and health US11,. Indirect costs for 143 were US9.
Deficiency of the cytoplasmic N-gly-glycosidase enzyme Ng1 (Ng1) is embryonically lethal in C57BL/6 mice. However, additional deletion of the gene encoding endo-β-N-acetylglucosidase (Eng), another de-N-glycosidating enzyme that leaves GlcNAc at glycosylated Asn residues, partially rescues the lethality of Ng1-deficient mice. We also found that changing the genetic background of C57/6 mice by crossing with outbred ICR mice partially rescues embryonic lethality of Ng1-deficient mice. Viable Ng1-deficient mice in C57/6 and ICR background, however, show a severe phenotype reminiscent of symptoms of Ng1-deficiency. Again, many defects are strongly suppressed by deletion of Eng in C57/6 and ICR background. Defects in Ng1Eng-deficient C57/6 and Ng1-def mice C57/6 ICR resemble some symptoms of patients with Ng-deficiency.
In Drosophila embryos, the activation of the hunch ( hb ) gene is regulated by a maternally-derived gradient of the Boid ( B ) protein. This process is one of the classic systems for studying spatial patterning in development. However, gene expression is subject to intrinsic noise which can produce variability. This variability must be constrained in the highly reproducible and coordinated events of development. We identify how noise is controlled during expression by characterizing the dependence of hb mRNA and protein output on promoter structure and transcriptional dynamics. We use a model of the hb promoter in which the number and strength of B and H ( self-regulatory ) binding sites can be varied. Parameters are fit to data from WT embryos, self-reg mutant hb14, and lac reporter constructs using different portions of the promoter. We corroborate model predictions experimentally. The results indicate that WT self-regulatory hb output is dependent on transcription and translation of its own expression rather than B fluctuations. Constructs lacking self-reg indicate that multiple B sites in the promoter and their strength also play a role in buffering. The model is robust to variation in B site number across species.
Neanderthal introgression is the process by which Neanderthals interbred with modern humans, leaving Neander alleles in the genomes of many modern humans. After interbreeding, natural selection appears to have removed Neander alleles from the human population. To understand this process, we need to quantify the strength and causes of selection against Neander ancestry. Here, we develop a new method to estimate the genome-wide strength of selection and density of selected sites using Neander allele frequencies in modern humans. We find that East Asians have more Neander ancestry than Europeans, even after accounting for selection. Most selection against Neander is due to weak deleterious alleles. These alleles were neutral in Neander, but became selected in humans. They had small effects, but imposed a heavy load on early hybrids. This suggests differences in population size may play a larger role in introgression than thought.
HIV-1 gene expression is controlled by the viral promoter within the long terminal repeat (LTR), which orchestrates the viral life cycle from gene expression to replication and establishment of latency. After integration into the host genome, stochastic gene expression is amplified by the Tat feedback loop, contributing to a productive or inactive state. In a fraction of cells harboring HIV-1 provirus LTR-GFPRESat, bimodal expression is dynamic, continuously switching between active (Bright) and inactive (Off) modes. These dynamics contribute to establishment and maintenance of latency, as viral expression is delayed before transactivation. The HIV-1 promoter contains cis-acting Sp and NF-κ elements that regulate expression via recruitment of activating and repressing complexes. We hypothesized that interplay of positive and negative factors modulates Bright and Off stability and viral expression sensitivity to fluctuations in Tat loop. Using lentivirus variants with Sp and NF-κ mutations, we employed flow cytometry, mRNA, pharmacological perturbations and chromatin immunoprecitation to reveal contributions to viral regulation. Sp sites apparently stabilize both Bright and Off, mutation promoting noisy expression and histone acetylation deacetylation. NFκ sites exhibit distinct properties, κ I serving stronger role than II. Moreover, Sp site plays role in recruitment of p300 and Rel to promoter. Analysis of 362 clonal populations revealed mutations yield 6-fold higher frequency bifcation compared to wild-type. Thus, Sp and NFκ differentially contribute to regulation, Sp functionally “en” transcription noise and modulate viral latency.
Accurate genome-wide identification of orthologs is a central problem in comparative genomics, reflected by the numerous orthology projects developed in recent years. However, only a few have compared their accuracy, and, recent efforts have not been systematically evaluated. We collected the results of nine orthology projects ( CO, KOG, Inanoid, OrthM, Ensembl Com, Homene, Round, EggG, OMA and ) and two standard methods ( bidirectional best and smallest ) and compared their predictions with respect to both phylogeny and function, using six tests. This required the mapping of millions of sequences, handling of hundreds of millions of predicted orthologs and computation of tens of thousands of trees. We find that OMA and Homene perform best in phylogen and functional analysis. At lower specificity but higher coverage, OrthM outperforms Ensembl and to extent Inan. Egg can be of interest for broad functional but not phylogen or detailed analyses. In terms methodology, we observe that En Com was outperformed by pairwise approaches even in phylogen tests. Furthermore, bidirectional often outperforms projects with complex.
Schistosomiasis is a highly prevalent and chronic disease caused by parasitic helmin infection, with three species of the genus Schistos infecting humans. Currently, a single drug, prazantel, is available to treat all infective species, but its use in mass administration is leading to signs of drug-resistance. To meet the challenge of developing new therapeutics against this disease, we developed an innovative drug repur pipeline supported by phenotyp screening. The approach highlighted protein kinases as new targets for schosiasis as they play an essential role in parasite’s biological processes. We report the elucidation of the kinome of Schos japonicum, as well as updated kinomes of S mansoni and haobium. In comparison with human kinome, we explored kinomes to identify targets of inhibitors unique to Schos species, allowing us to identify targets and suggest drugs that might inhibit them.
Transcription factors are central components of intracellular regulatory networks that control gene expression. Here we study the folding and binding of the pID domain of the transcription factor CREB to the K domain of the coactivator CB. Our simulations of a topology-based G-type model predict a coupled folding and binding mechanism, and the existence of partially bound intermediates. We find that the transition state resembles the unstructured state in solution, implying that CREB becomes structured only after committing to binding. The change of structure following binding is reminiscent of an induced mechanism and contrasts with models in which binding occurs to prestructured conformations that exist in the unbound state. Interestingly, increasing the amount of structure in the unbound pID reduces the rate of binding, suggesting a “fly-casting-like” process. We find that inclusion of non-native interactions results in formation of non-specific complexes that enhance the rate of binding but do not change the mechanism. Our study explains how unstructured can confer an advantage in target recognition.
Schistosomiasis Prevalence and Intensity Infection in Latin America and the Caribbean Countries, 194-2014: A Systematic Review in the Context of Regional Elimination Goal. In 2012, the World Health Assembly adopted WHA 65.21 on the elimination of schosomiasis, calling for increased investment in schomias control and support for countries to initiate programs. This study aims to analyze the prevalence and intensity of Schomia mans infection in children in Latin America and the Caribbean countries (LAC) at the second administrative level. A systematic review of schomias prevalence and intensity was conducted by searching PubMed, LACS, and EMBASE. Experts on the topic were consulted and institutional pages reviewed (PA/WHO, Ministries of Health). Only infection among children was registered because it can be ‘pro-indicator of recent by time the study is conducted. One hundred thirty full-text articles met the criteria and provided 1,242 prevalence and intensity data points. Most were from Brazil (69.7%). Only published after 200 showing ‘hot’ with prevalence Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname and Lucia need to update the epidemiological status of schomias to re-design national programs and target elimination Schia mans by 202. Antigua and Barb, Republic, Guadelpe, Martinique, Montserrat and Rico schias transmission may be interrupted. However, compilation and follow surveys per WHO, are needed to verify status. Hence, burden may still present even in countries have transmission.
Heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 is characterized by a genetic bottleneck that selects a single viral variant, the transmitted founder (TF), during transmission events. To assess viral characteristics influencing HIV-1 transmission, we sequenced 167 full-length viral genomes and generated 40 infectious molecular clones (IC) including TF and non-transmitted (NT) HIV-1 C variants from six heterosexual transmission pairs at the time of transmission. Consensus-like genomes sensitive to antibodies were selected during transmission in six pairs. However, TF variants did not demonstrate increased viral fitness in terms of infectivity or replicative capacity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDC). In addition, resistance of TF to antiviral effects of interferon-α (IF-α) was not significantly different from nonmitted variants from same pair.
Lymphangiogenesis and Lymph Remodeling Induced by Filarial Parasites: Implications for Pathogenesis. Lymphatic dilatation and dysfunction occur in filarial infections, even in the absence of an adaptive immune response in murine models. However, severe lymphedema and elephantiasis appear to require an intact adaptive response in human infections. To understand how filarial parasites and antigens influence lymphatics, human lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) were exposed to filarial antigens, live parasites, or patient serum. Live parasites or antigens induced significant LEC proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures in vitro. Moreover, serum from infected patients (microfilar positive ) and those with chronic lymphatic obstruction significantly increased LEC proliferation compared to uninfected. Differentiation of LEC into tube-like structures was associated with increased matrix metalloproteases and decreased TIM inhibitors (tissue of metalproteases ). Comparison of gene expression by live parasites LEC to parasite-exposed LEC demonstrated filarial altered expression of genes involved in cellular organization and junction pathways that decreased transendothelial transport assessed FIT-Dextr.
Since only a small fraction of environmental bacteria can be cultured in the laboratory, there is great interest in sequencing genomes directly from single cells. The Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) method can provide sufficient DNA for sequencing from a single cell, eliminating the need to develop culture methods. Here, we used a microfluidic device to isolate Escherichia coli and amplify genomic DNA by MD in 60-nl reactions. Our results show that reduced MD reaction volume lowers nonspecific synthesis from contaminant DNA and unfavourable primer interaction. The quality of amplification was assessed by qPCR and compared to single-cell amplifications in standard 50-μ volumes. Amplification was greatly reduced in naniter, providing more representation of all sequences. Single amplicons from microliter and naniter provided high-quality data by high-throughput pyrosequencing, demonstrating a route to genomes from cells.
Hantaviruses from the genus Orthohant are known to cause severe disease in humans and are mainly transmitted by Sigmodinae rodents in the tropical forests, savannas, and wetlands of South America. These rodents can shed different hantaviruses, such as the emerging Arquara orthantavirus. We tested the effect of landscape structure on the proportion of hant rodent hosts in the Atlantic Forest using 283 rodent capture records and geographically weighted models. We also assessed the correspondence between hant host proportions in rodent communities and human vulnerability to havirus infection across the Atlantic Forest. We found that hant host proportions were more influenced by landscape diversity than habitat or agricultural type. Small mammal diversity positively influenced pathogenic hant host proportions, indicating plasticity to habitat quality may be more important than competition with native species. Sugarcane plantations positively influenced rodent proportions, whereas defaunation did not correlate with pathogenic havirus genotypes. The match between hotspots and human vulnerability was 17%, coldspots 20. We found strong land change influences hant hosts across the Forest. Our findings suggest disease surveillance must be reinforced in southern and southeastern regions where h host and vulnerability match. Importantly, our analyses suggest complex rodent dynamics with disease than hypothesized.
Flaviviruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) induce apoptosis in infected cells via the mitochondrial pathway. We show that BCL, a pro-surv BCL protein, is required for the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses. BCL suppresses the expression of MCL, another pro-sur BCL protein, thereby preventing apoptosis. Treatment with BCL inhibitors or deficient BCL expression induces BAX/BA-dependent apoptosis upon flavivirus infection. Flavivirus infection reduces protein synthesis of short-lived proteins such as MCL. BCL inhibition increases phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages, suppressing viral dissemination and chemokine production. We also show that BCL is required for survival of JEV-infected cells in vivo. BCL deficiency or BH mimetic compounds increase survival after JEV infection and suppress inflammation.
The economic burden of canine rabies in Viet Nam from 2005 to 2014 was estimated to be $719 million. The largest portion of this cost (92% ) was due to post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ). Canine rabies resulted in 36, 560 to 45,700 disability adjusted life years ( DALs ) and 914 human deaths over the study period. The cost per dog vaccinated was $1.75.
The assembly of the Type II Secretion System (TSS) in Vibrio cholera depends on a novel pilot protein called Asp. The TSS is a molecular machine that secretes fully-folded proteins across the bacterial outer membrane. The secretin, a multimeric outer membrane protein, is a key element of the machinery that forms the secretion pore. We have distinguished three forms of TSS based on the characteristics of their secretin pores. The Klebsella-type and Vibrio-type TSS are further distinguished by the pilot that mediates their transport and assembly into the outer membrane. We have determined the crystal structure of the novel pilot Asp from Vibrio cholera. The structure shows that Asp is functionally equivalent yet structurally unrelated to pilotins found in Klebsella and other bacteria. Asp binds to a specific sequence in the Vibrio secretin and enhances the kinetics of secretin assembly. Homologs of Asp are found in all species of Vibrio as well as few strains of Escherichia and Shella that have acquired Vibrio TSS.
Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptira spp., which are shed in the urine of reservoir hosts and transmitted to susceptible hosts through skin abrasions or mucous membranes. The ability of Leptira to adhere to cell surface and extracellular components is crucial for dissemination and colonization of host tissues. In this study, we elucidate the roles of transmembrane outer proteins Omp36 ( LIC66 ), O37 ( LIC63 ) and O47 (50 ) recently identified on Leptiral surface. We determine the capacity of these proteins to bind host components by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. O37 binds preferentially, exhibiting dose-dependent saturating binding to human skin (104 nM ) and aorticin (152M ). It also binds fibrin (244M ) fibrin fragment (132 ) plasmaectin (359M ) and murine (410M ). The binding to skin by recombinant O and Leptira is enhanced by antiser for O, suggesting involvement in Lept binding and possibility that host-generated antibodies promote rather than inhibit adherence to elastin-rich tissues. We also demonstrate O is recognized by acute convalescent sera and Leptira-infected hamster sera. Finally, is detected in pathogenic Lept and not saprophy Lept. Thus, is a novel elastin-binding of pathogenic Lept that may promote attachment to host tissues.
Antibodies 4E10 and 2F are two broadly neutralizing antibodies isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals that recognize epitopes in the membrane-proximal region (MP) of gp41. These epitopes are transiently exposed during viral entry. We present a model to calculate the probability that an antibody will disable trimeric gp41 before fusion is complete. When 4E or 2F bind the MP, a conformational change results in a stable complex. The model predicts that for these antibodies to be effective, the time to disable epitope must be shorter than the antibody remains in conformation, about five minutes or less for 4E and 5. We investigate the role of avidity in neutralization and show that 2F is more effective than 4. We attribute this to 2 interacting more stably with viral. We use the model to elucidate parameters that determine ability to disable and propose an extension to analyze neutral data. The extended model predicts dependencies for neutral on constants that characterize binding, rate of gp41, and number of gp bridging virus and cell at start prehair.
Onchocercias Elimination with Ivermect Treatment in Endemic Foci in Africa: Final Results of a Study in Mali and Senegal. A longitudinal study was undertaken in three hyperendemic foci in Mali and Senegal with 15 to 17 years of annual six-month ivermect treatment to assess residual levels of infection and transmission and whether treatment could safely be stopped. Skin surveys were undertaken in 131 villages where 29,753 people were examined and 492,600 blackflies were analyzed for Onocerca volulus lar using a DNA probe. There was a trend in infection and transmission after the treatment. In two sites prevalence microfilar and vector rate were zero to years after treatment. In the third site infection were high before treatment there was also a decline to very low years after treatment. All indicators were below thresholds for elimination. The study established that onocercias elimination withiverm treatment is feasible in some foci in Africa.
Human rhinovirus is a non-enveloped virus of the picornavirus family, which causes the common cold and includes other significant pathogens such as poliovirus and foot-and-mouth disease. During cell entry, the myristoylated capsid protein VP4 is released from the virus and interacts with the cell membrane to deliver the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. In this study, recombinant C-terminal histidine-tagged rhinovirus VP4 was produced and shown to induce membrane permeability in liposome model membranes. Size-exclusion studies, crosslinking and microscopy demonstrated that VP4 forms a multimer membrane pore with a channel consistent size for single-stranded RNA transfer. The permeability induced by recominant VP was influenced by pH and comparable to that induced by infectious virions.
Tularemia is a highly infectious disease caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Francisella tularensis ( Ft ), which is classified as a class A select agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Human isolates of Ft produce lipid A similar to that of Francisella novicida ( Fn ), a pathogen of mice. We identified three enzymes required for lipid carbohydrate modification of Ft A, specifically the presence of mannose ( flF1 ), galactosamine (F2 ) or both ( flK ). Mutants lacking galosamine (2 ) or galosamine/mannose (K ) were attenuated in mice by both pulmonary and subcutaneous routes of infection. In addition, aerosolization of mutants fl2 and flK provided protection against challenge with wild-type Fn, whereas subaneous administration of flK provided protection from challenge Fn. Furthermore, infection of alveolar macrophage line by flK induced higher levels of tumor necrosis-α (TN- ) and macrophage inhibitory-2 (M- ) compared to infection with Fn. Bone–derived macrophages (Bø ) from Toll receptor 4 (T4 ) and TLR/4 knockout mice infected with flK produced higher amounts of interleukin-6 (IL ) and M- than Bø infected Fn. However, production IL and M was undetectable in Bø from My− mice infected either. My− mice were also susceptible toK infection.
The ribosome-associated GTPase (RA-GTP) is a conserved across all domains of life and acts as a molecular switch to coordinate ribosome assembly. In Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus ), we previously identified the RA-GTP Era as a target for the stringent alarmone ppGpp, leading to inhibition of GTP activity. Here we show that Era is not essential in S. aureus but important for 30S ribosomal subunit assembly. Era interacts with the 16S rRNA endonuclease Y and the DEAD RNA helicase C. Era and C are required for growth at suboptimal temperatures and rRNA processing. Era and C also interact with the ppG synthase Rel, with Rel positively impacting Era GTP activity but negatively C helic activity. In its G-bound form, Era acts as a hub on the ribosome to direct enzymes involved in rRNA degradation and ribosome assembly to their site. This is impeded by components of the stringent response, contributing to slowed growth synonymous with this stress pathway.
Anthrax lethal toxin (LT) causes vascular insufficiency in experimental animals through unknown mechanisms. In this study, we show that neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) deficiency in mice causes strikingly increased sensitivity to LT, while deficiencies in other NOS isoforms (iNOS and eOS) have no effect on LT-mediated mortality. The increased sensitivity ofN−/− mice was independent of macrophage sensitivity to toxin or cytokine responses and could be replicated inN-sufficient wild-type (WT) mice through pharmacological inhibition of with 7-nitroazole. Histopathological analyses showed LT-induced changes in heart morphology ofN−− mice with rapid appearance of inter-fiber spaces but no apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. LT-treated WT mice had no histopath observed at light microscopy. Electron analyses of LT-treated mice revealed pathological changes in hearts of both−− and WT mice varying in severity. Endothelialap necrosis and degeneration interocyte edema myament and mitochondrial degeneration and sarcoplasmic reticulumistae were observed in LT-treated and− mice. Furthermore, biomarkers of cardiac injury myoglobin cardiac tropon-I and heart acid protein were elevated LT-treated rapidly by 6 h after injection and reached rarely in mice. Cardiac protective therapy allopurin did not have effects LT-treated mice. Surprisingly, nitric scavenger carbox-PT showed some effect LT. Echocardiography LT-treated indicated reduction in fraction following treatment in− and WT, indicative of contractile in heart.
Parasitic nematodes infect over 1 billion people worldwide and cause some of the most common neglected diseases. However, the biology of parasitic nematodes has been limited by the lack of tools for genetic intervention. Here we report the development of a method for introducing CRISPR-C9-mediated gene disruptions in the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercalis. We disrupted the S. steralis twitch gene-22, resulting in nematodes with severe motility defects. The S-22 mutations were resolved by homology-directed repair when a template was provided. Omission of a template resulted in deletions at the locus. S-22 mutations were heritable; we passed S-22 mutants through a host and recovered mutant progeny. Using a similar approach, we also disrupted the gene of the parasitic nemode Strongloides ratti. Our results demonstrate the applicability of CRPR-C9 to parasitic nemodes and enable future studies of function in medically relevant but previously intractable parasites.
Ribosome drop plays a crucial roles in translational accuracy and nutrient responses during stress. When cells are under stress, such as amino starvation or aminoacyl-tRNA depletion due to high recombinant protein expression, ribosome drop can affect protein expression efficiency. We introduce a model that describes ribosome drop effects on ribosome density along mRNA and conitant synthesis. Our results show that ribosome premature termination leads to non-intuitive ribosome profiles, such as rib density increases from 5’ to 3’ end. Importantly, the model predicts rib drop effects on translation are mRNA-specific and quantify resilience to drop, showing mRNAs with ribosomes are less affected than those without. Moreover, among mRN without ribosomes, resilience to drop correlates with elongation, so fast codons are less affected by drop. This is consistent with genome-wide S. cerevisiae, under favourable conditions mRN coding proteins involved in machinery, highly cod biased fast cod, are resilient to drop. Moreover, physiological conditions mRN coding stress proteins are resilient to drop.
The World Health Organization’s current strategy to control soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in children is based on morbidity control through routine deworming of school and pre-school children. However, transmission continues to occur due to persistent reservoirs of infection in untreated individuals and environment. In many settings, this strategy needs to be continued for extended periods or until social and environmental conditions result in interruption of transmission. There is discussion on accelerating interruption using alternative strategies of mass drug administration (MDA). However, the feasibility of achieving interruption using MD remains uncertain due to challenges in sustaining MD coverage across communities. The DeWorm trial tests the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission. In Deorm, three years of treatment will be followed by two years of surveillance. Given reinfection rates, two years is regarded as adequate to assess bounce or interruption. This study investigates criteria to determine interruption can be defined earlier. A stochastic individual-based model simulates Deorm community cluster-randomized trial. This compares control (annual treatment of children with MD) with intervention (community-wide biannual MD). Simulations were run for both Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm (Necator american). Prevalence at six months after last MD and MD levels were evaluated to assess likelihood of bounce or elimination.
Cholera is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Protective immunity against cholera is serogroup specific and is determined by the O-specific polyscharide ( OSP ) of lipopolyschar ( LPS ). Generally, polyschar are poorly immunogenic, especially in children. Here, we report the evaluation of a cholera conjugate vaccine ( OSP:Tc ) made from Vibrio cholera O1 Ogawa OSP and recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain (Tc ). Mice were immunized intramuscularly on days 0, 21, and 42 with OSP:Tc or OSP only, or with dmLT, a non-toxigen immunoadju derived from labile toxin Escherich coli. We detected significant serum IgG responses targeting OSP following immunization in mice receiving OSP:Tc or without adjuvant. Anti-LPS Ig responses were detected following immunization in these cohorts. No antiOSP or anti-L Ig responses were detected in animals receiving unjugated OSP or immunoadjuvant, and animals immunoadju alone. Responses were highest immunization adjuvant. Serum-OSP Ig were detected mice OSP:Tc or immunoadjuvant, and unconjug OSP. Serum-L Ig and vibocidal responses were all cohorts except immunoadju alone. No Ig antiOSP or anti-L responses any group. Administration OSP:Tc adju also induced memory cell targeting OSP and 95% protective lethality cholera model.
Candida albicans inhibits the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa through suppression of pyochelin and pyoverdine biosynthesis. In a neutropenic mouse model of gastrointestinal colonization, we show that C. albicans suppresses P. aeruginosa virulence by inhibiting pyelin and pyd gene expression, which plays a critical role in iron acquisition and virulence. Deletion of P. aerugin pyelin and pyd genes attenuates P aerugin virulence. Heat-killed C albicans has no effect on P aerugin, whereas C albicans secreted proteins suppress pyd and pyelin expression and inhibit aer vir in mice. Interestingly, deletion of pyelin and pyd genes has no effect on aer’s ability to colonize the GI tract but decreases aer’s cytotoxic effect on colonocytes. Finally, iron supplementation restores aer vir in aer and alb colonized mice. Our findings provide insight into bacterial-fungal modulation of virulence in the intestine.
HIV-1 and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) mutants that evade CD8+ T cell recognition are frequently observed following infection. These mutants are often less replicatively fit compared to wild-type (WT) virus, as demonstrated by reversion to WT upon transmission to a naive host and association with lower viral load in vivo in HIV-1 infection. However, the rate of reversion is highly variable. We quantified reversion to WT of a series of SIV and SHIV viruses containing minor amounts of WT in pig macaques using PCR. Infection with mixes of EM and WT containing ≥10% WT results in rapid outgrowth of WT at SIVag CD8 cell epitopes within 7 days of infection. In contrast, biologically passaged SHIV229 viruses with smaller proportions of WT or molecular pure EMIV239 demonstrated delayed re. WT was not detectable ≥8 days after inoculation and ≥ weeks to become dominant quasis. Delayed re was associated with lower loads.
Natural populations of yeast collected from the Dead Sea of Evaporation (EC), Israel, exhibit extremely high tolerance to the heavy metal cadmium. We found that cadmium resistance is primarily caused by enhanced function of a metal efflux pump, PCA1. Molecular analyses demonstrate that this enhancement is largely due to mutations in the promoter region, while mutations in the coding region have minor effect. Reconstruction experiments show that single nucleotide substitutions in PCA promoter quantitatively increase its activity and enhance cells' cadmium resistance. Comparison among yeast species shows that critical nucleotides found in EC are conserved and functionally important for cadmium resistance in other species, suggesting they represent ancestral. However, nucleotides diverged in Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, which gave growth advantages under cadmium low or absent.
Gastric cancer (GC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. GC is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in the deregulation of different oncogenic pathways. In this study, we sought to identify the major oncogenic pathways in GC with significant relationships to patient survival. Using gene expression signatures, we devised an in silico strategy to map patterns of oncogenic activation in 301 primary gastric cancers. We identified three oncogenic pathways ( proliferation/stem cell, NF-κ, and Wnt/β-caten ) deregulated in the majority (70%) of gastric cancers. We functionally validated these predictions in a panel of gastric cancer cell lines. Patient stratification by oncogenic pathway showed reproducible and significant differences in multiple cohorts, suggesting that pathway interactions play an important role in disease behavior. Individual GC can be taxonomized by oncogenic activity into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups.
In this study, we investigate the distribution of stress-induced DNA destabilization (SIDD) sites in the Escherichia coli K12 genome. We find that strongly destabilized sites occur preferentially in intergenic regions that are known or inferred to contain promoters, but rarely in coding regions. We then investigate whether genes in different functional categories have characteristic SIDD properties in their upstream regions. We find that strong S sites in E. coli12 are statistically overrepresented in the upstream of genes encoding transcription regulators. In particular, the upstream of genes that respond to physiological and environmental stimuli are more destabilized than those that do not. We also find that if a pathway is controlled by a transcription regulator whose gene has a destabilized 5′ flank, the genes in that pathway usually have strongly destabil S sites in their 5′ flanks. This association is observed in 38 of 43 free-living bacteria, but only 4 of 18 endosymbion or obligate parasitic bacteria. We propose that S sites in 5′ genes may be involved in transcriptional responses to changes that transiently alter superhelicity.
Podospora anserina, a filamentous ascomyc fungus, contains 12 HMG-box transcription factors that play a role in the regulation of genes involved in developmental and metabolic pathways. Systematic analysis of the eight uncharacterized HMG genes indicated that none were essential for viability, but seven were involved in sexual cycle. PaMG5, an ortholog of Ste11 from Schosaccharomyces pombe, is a pivotal activator of mating-type genes in P.serina, whereas PaMG9 is a repressor of several specific to stationary phase, notably hyph anastoses. PaMG5 is at the hub of a network of H-box factors that regulate mating-type and mating target genes. This network also controls fertility genes not regulated by mating transcription factors. PaMG and Ste11 are conserved regulators of mating genes in P.ser and S.pom, although they diverged 550 million years ago. Two H-box genes SO9 and its regulator RY also play a role in sex determination in mammals. Pser and Spom mating genes and their upstream factor form a module of H-box analogous to SRY/SOX, revealing commonality of sex regulation in animals and fungi.
During the 2013–2016 West African Ebola epidemic, there was an unprecedented number of cases and survivors. Prior to the epidemic, there was limited data on the persistence of Ebola virus in survivors’ body fluids and the risk of transmission, including sexual transmission. An observational study was implemented during the epidemic response in Sierra Leone to determine the persistence of Ebola in survivors’ body fluids. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase, initiated within five months of protocol discussions, assessed the persistence of virus in semen of 100 adult men. The second phase assessed the persistence in multiple body fluids ( semen, vaginal fluid, blood, breast milk, urine, rectal fluid, sweat, saliva, tears ) of 120 men and 120 women. Data informed national and global guidelines in real-time and demonstrated the need for semen testing among Ebola survivors. The study accelerated implementation of programs in affected countries and informed persistence of Zika studies.
Chemotaxis is the process by which bacteria sense and respond to chemical stimuli in their environment. Chemotaxis is mediated by sensory systems that respond to certain properties and transmit this information through biochemical pathways. In this study, we use FRET experiments to characterize the chemotaxis system of Escherichia coli and predict the chemical gradients they encounter in their natural environment. We use Weber’s law and its generalizations to predict average gradients experienced by cells and information theory to obtain full distributions of gradients. We consider limitations of transmission from both internal and external noise. Our results show broad distributions of gradients lead to log-normal stimuli and maximal velocity.
The lifespan of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which give rise to all blood cells, has been thought to be indefinite due to their self-renew capacity. However, there is increasing evidence that genetically identical HSCs differ in lifespan and that the lifespan of HSC is predetermined and H-intrinsic. We present a new model based on reliability theory to account for the diversity of lifans of Hs. Using clonal repulation experiments and computational-mathematic modeling, we tested how small, molecular failures are dissipated at the H population level. We found that the fit of the data is provided by a model where repulation kinetics of H are largely anti-persistent or mean-reverting processes. Thus, failure rates increase during population division events are counteracted by repair processes. In the long, a crossover from anti-persistent to persistent occurs. This is due to an increase in mean failure rate of selfnew leading to clonal extinction. We show that lifespan of H depends on amplitudes and frequencies of fluctuations in failure kinetics. Short and longer lived Hs differ in ability to dissipate perturbations.
Helminth infections affect approximately one-third of the world's population, with no vaccines currently available. Antibodies and alternatively activated macrophages ( AAM ) are important components of protective immunity against helmin infections, but the mechanisms by which antibodies target helmin remain obscure. We demonstrate that helmin-specific antibodies induce the trapping of migrating helmin larvae and prevent tissue damage following infection with the murine parasite Heligomosomoides polygyrus bakeri ( Hp ). In the absence of antibodies (J−/− ) or activating Fc receptors (cγ/− ), larvae were highly motile and caused extensive tissue damage and accumulated Arginase-1 expressing macrophages around the larvae. Antibodies induced Fcγ and complement-dependent adherence of macroph to larvae in vitro, resulting in complete immobilization. Antibodies with helmin reprogrammed macro to express wound-healing genes, including Arginase, and Arginase product Lornine impaired larval motility. Antib-induced Arginase in vitro and in vivo occurred independently of IL-α signaling.
Chromosome breakage is a major threat to genome integrity and the most accurate way to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is homologous recombination (HR) with an intact copy of the broken locus. However, the mobility of the broken DNA has been seen to increase during the search for a copy. To observe chromosome dynamics during the early steps of HR, mainly resection from DS ends that generates recombinogenic strands, requires a system that does not interfere with the process and is relative to few kilobases of DNA that undergo processing. We have developed a new non-invasive method that uses oligomerization rather than multiplicity to form visible foci. By applying it to cleavage of the MAT locus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III, we provide the first-time analysis of resection in living cells.
Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease, a major public health problem in Latin America. People living in areas with active vector-borne transmission have multiple contacts with T. cruzi and can become reinfected. Although reinfections are thought to increase the risk of chronic disease manifestations, little is known about their frequency and timing in humans. We used stochastic models to estimate re-infection rates in humans and assess reinfections during acute and chronic disease stages according to alternative hypotheses on adaptive response following primary infection. We fitted models to epidemiological data from Argentine villages with mixed T. cruz genotypes in 56% of humans. The best model predicted 0. 032 ( 0.008–.042 ) annual reinfections per individual with 98.4% in chronic. Parasite escapes immune response after primary infection in 20% of re-infections. Annual reinfection rates during chronic disease are 14% (4%–18 ) and 60 (21–70 ) after 5 and 30 years with individuals reinfected 1–3 overall.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a major public health concern due to the global expansion of all four DENV serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4). While most DENV infections are subclinical, epidemiological studies suggest that cross-reactive immunity can influence disease outcome in subsequent infections. However, the mechanisms controlling differential clinical outcomes remain poorly defined. In this study, blood samples were collected from a cohort of school-aged Thai children who experienced subclinical DENV infection or developed deng illness. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected prior to infection were stimulated in vitro with DENV and secretion of 30 cytokines was measured using multiplex bead-based array. Significant differences were found in cytokine production based on the type of D used for stimulation and occurrence of illness. Secretion of IL-15 and MCP-1 was significantly higher by PBMC of subjects who developed symptomatic D infection. In addition, IL-6 was produced by PB from subjects who developed symptomatic infection versus 59% who had subclinical. Secretion of IL-12, IL-2, MIP-α, RANT, GM-CSF and TNα was lower by PB from subjects with symptomatic infection.
In Drosophila wing imaginal discs, Hedgehog (H) forms an extracellular gradient that organizes patterning along the anterior–posterior axis and specifies at least three different domains of gene expression. The prevailing view is that H functions in therosila wing disc as a classical morphogen, but a direct correspondence between the borders of these patterns and H concentration has not been demonstrated. Here, we provide evidence that interpretation of H signaling depends on the history of exposure to H and that a single concentration is sufficient to support multiple outputs. Using mathematical modeling, we predict that steady, only two domains can be in response to H, suggesting that the boundaries of or more gene patterns cannot be specified by static H gradient.
Ethanol is one of the most widely used anesthetics in the world. However, the mechanisms by which it influences the nervous system are poorly understood. Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of a new mutation in mice that disrupts the homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. eleg ) unc-79 gene. This mutation, Lightweight ( Lwt ), was isolated in an Nethyl-nitrosourea ( ENU ) mutagenesis screen for animals with enhanced locomotor activity. Lwt/L homozygotes are perinatal lethal, while Lwt heterozygotes are dramatically hypersensitive to acute ethanol exposure. Experiments in C. elegans demonstrate conserved hypersensitivity to ethanol in unc-79 mutants and extend this observation to related unc-80 and nca-1;n-2 mutants. L heterozygotes also exhibit altered response to anesthetic isoflur, reminiscent of unc-vertebrate mutant phenotypes. In addition, heterozygotes are hyperactive in novel environment and smaller than wild-type. They also exhibit increased food consumption and lean body composition. Interestingly, heterozygotes consume more ethanol than wild-type littermates.
Anopheles gambiae has been identified as a potential source of anti-Plasmodium mechanisms to control malaria transmission. One such mechanism is the Imd pathway, a conserved signaling pathway with anti-P. falcum activity. Silencing cas, a negative regulator of Imd, or overexpressing rel, an I-controlled NFappaB transcription factor, confers resistant A. gambiae with an array of effector genes. Using RNA interference to silence cas and other Imd components, we identified genes in the anti-Plmod module regulated by cas, each a potential target for pathway overactivation. We found Imd most potent against the parasite’s ookin stage, with activity against early oocysts and lesser against lateocysts. Cas silencing alone induced a robust anti. falcum response even in the absence of gut microbiota. We established the relevance of Imd components TEP, APL, and LR1 in infection-dependent defense, shedding light on laboratory versus natural intensity.
Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) have been proposed as a potential therapy for treating fibrotic diseases. In this study, we investigated the anti-frotic effect of BSCs in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis caused by infection with Paroccidioides brasiliensis. BSCs were isolated from BAL/c mice and mice were inoculated with P. brasiliensis by intranasal infection. At 8 weeks post-infection, BSCs were administered intravenously. An additional group was treated with itraconazole (ITC) 2 weeks before BSC administration. Animals were sacrificed at 12 weeks post-infection. Histological examination, fibrocy counts, soluble collagen, and fibrosis-related genes in lungs were evaluated. Additionally, fibroblasts were treated with homogenized lung supernatants (HLS) to determine collagen expression. Histological analysis showed increased granulomatous areas in BSC-treated mice. Fibcy count, soluble collagen-α, T-β, MMP-8, and MMP-15 expression increased in BSC-treated mice. Combined BSC/IT therapy decreased TIM- and MMP-13 expression in infected mice. Fibrobl stimulated with HLS from infected BSC-transplanted mice showed higher collagen expression.
Leishmanias caused by Leishmania infantum is transmitted by phlebotine sand flies in the Mediterranean region. Climate change is thought to be responsible for the recent expansion of leishmanias vectors in this area. Sand fly activity is typically seasonal and sensitive to climate variations. In 2011–2013, a consortium of eight Mediterranean countries carried out entomological investigations in sites where L. infant transmission was recently reported. Sand flies were collected by CDC traps and sticky traps. Collections were replicated for more than one season to reduce weather effects. Data from 99,000 specimens were analyzed, resulting in the description of seasonal dynamics of 56,000 sand flies belonging to L. infant vector species in a wide area, namely P. periciosus ( Portugal, Spain and Italy ), P.ri ( France ),.neglectus ( Greece ),.bbi ( Cyprus and Turkey ),.balicus and.kakii ( Georgia ). Time of fly appearance/disappearance differed between sites and densities varied. Significant correlations were found between latitude/annual temperature and i ) first fly appearance (April–June; ii ) density trend (July–September. A novel 3-modal trend was recorded for.bb in Cyprus. Adults ended activity from September–November without correlation with latitude/annual temperature. The period of exposure to L infant in the subregion, inferred by adult densities, was a bell-shaped curve with peak July–September and May–October. No risk took place from December–March. Nocturnal females peaked 11–2 am. Annual collections provided homogeneous patterns of lemanias vectors, which may represent sentinel areas for future. In the years, higher risk L infant in the Mediterranean was June–October (97% density ), however risk was not equally distributed, since waves occurred earlier and more in southern territories.
Orientalia tsutsamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, is an obligate intracellular bacterium that mainly infects endothelial cells. We demonstrate here that O. tsugamushi also replicates in monocytes isolated from healthy donors. In addition, O. tsamushi alters the expression of more than 4, 500 genes, as demonstrated by microarray analysis. The expression of type I interferon, interferon-stimulated genes and genes associated with M1 macrophage polarization was significantly upregulated. Otsamushi induced the expression of apoptosis-related genes and promoted cell death in a small percentage of monocytes. Live organisms were indispensable to the type I interfer response and apoptosis and the expression of M-associated cytokines. These data were related to the transcription changes in mononuclear cells from patients with typhus. Here, microarray analyses revealed the upregulation of 613 genes, including interfer-related and features of M polarization in patients, similar to what was observed in Otsamushi-stimulated monocytes in vitro. This is the first report that monocytes are clearly polarized in vitro and ex vivo following Otsamushi exposure.
Ants are able to learn and follow complex routes through natural environments by using visual memory. However, the neural basis of this capability is unknown. The mushroom body, a key part of the insect brain, has been shown to be important for memory, but its function has been mostly studied in simple tasks such as smell. Here we show that a model of the mushroom body, originally developed to describe fruit fly memory, can also explain how desert ants learn to follow routes through complex environments. We also show that the key principles of this circuit, including one-shot learning of sparse codes, enable the mushroom body to store hundreds of images.
Plants have an innate immune system to protect themselves from disease. They have a number of unique defense mechanisms, particularly at the physiological level. One of these mechanisms is pathogen-triggered abscission, a process by which leaves are shed in response to infection. We studied pathogen-triggered abission in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves infected with Pseudomonas syringae, a bacterial pathogen lacking a functional type III secretion system. Pseudas syring failed to elicit abission, suggesting abission is a novel form of immunity triggered by effectors. We found that HAESA/ESA-like 2, INFRESCENCE DEFICIENT ABSCI, and NEVERED are required for pathogen-trigger abission to occur. We also found that phytoalexin deficient 4, disease 1, sallic acid-deficient 2, and senescence-associated 101 plants with mutations in genes necessary for bacterial and sallic acid signaling and NahG transgenic plants with low sallic fail to abise leaves normally. Bacteria that contact abission zones trigger abission, but long signals are also sent from distal tissue to abission, alerting abission of danger. We propose a model regulating leaf defense where minor infections are handled by bacterial growth, but when infection is out of control, leaves are shed.
Retinal starburst amacrine cells (SACs) play a major role in the detection of motion direction in the retina. They generate larger dendritic Ca2+ signals when motion is from their soma towards their dendrites than in the opposite direction. To study the mechanisms underlying direction selectivity (DS) in SACs, we measured responses to expanding and contracting circular visual stimuli via somatic whole-cell recordings and quantified using Fourier analysis. We found that fundamental and especially harmonic frequency components were larger for expanding stimuli. This persists in the presence of GABA and glycine receptor antagonists, suggesting that inhibitory interactions are not essential. The presence of harmonics indicates nonlinearity, as the relationship between harmonic amplitudes and potential indicates is likely due to activation of voltage-gated channels.Ca2+ changes in SACs evoked by steps monitored by two-photon microscopy suggest that distal dendrite is tonically depolarized relative to soma, in part by resting mediated by tonic glutamgic synaptic, and high-voltage–activated Ca+ channels at rest.
Parasites are a diverse group of pathogens that cause a wide range of diseases in humans. The number of parasites required to infect a host, termed the infective dose, varies dramatically across species. It has been predicted that the infect dose depends on the mode of action of molecules used by the parasite to infect. Specifically, parasites that use locally acting molecules require a lower infect dose than those that use distantly acting molecules. It has also been predicted that distantly acting modulators may be more virulent because they have a large number of cells in the inoculum, which cause more harm to host cells. We tested these predictions for the first time using data on 43 parasites from a range of taxonomic groups with diverse life histories. We found that locally acting parasites have lower infect doses but are not more virulent than distantly acting. Instead, we found virulence was negatively correlated with infect dose and higher in parasites infecting skin compared to ingested or inhaled.
Schistosomes are parasitic helminths that cause schistosomiasis, a disease that affects approximately 200 million people, primarily in underprivileged regions of the world. Schistos mansoni is the most experimentally tractable schosome due to its ease of propagation in the laboratory and high quality of its genome and annotation. In this study, we investigated the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the developmental processes of schistosomes. We used the bioinformatics tool Sanger to analyse the 3’-UTRs of transcripts differentially expressed between juvenile and adult worms. We found that the miR-277/498 family is significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult worms. We also identified a novel miRNA, sma-mi-498 that is proximal to smi-277, suggesting they form a miRNA cluster. We propose hairpin structures for both miRNAs compatible with the miRNA pathway. We found that smi-277/498 are upregulated in adults while their predicted targets are downregulated in adults but remain unchanged in immature females. Finally, we show that smi-498 is expressed in tegument cells proximal to oesophagus and throughout male body.
Since 2005, a number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) have been detected in horseshoe bats in different areas of China. However, these SARS-Co show differences from SARS (SARS-CoV) in genes and are unlikely to be the direct progenitor of SARSV. Here, we report the findings of 5-year surveillance of SARS-Co in a cave inhabited by multiple horsesh bats in Yunn Province, China. The full genomes of 11 newly SARS-Co strains, together with previous findings, show that S-Co circulating in this location are highly diverse in OR3 and OR8. Importantly, strains with high similarity to S-Co in hyperviable N-terminal (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S gene OR3 OR8 were discovered in this cave. In addition, we report the discovery of S-Co highly similar to S-Co in OR3 and OR8. Moreover, S-Co from this cave are more related to S-Co in non-structural genes OR1 and compared to those elsewhere. Recombination analysis shows frequent recombination events in gene around OR8 between S-Co. We hypothesize the progenitor S may have originated after recombination between precursors S-Co.
Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are controlled by mass drug treatment of people in endemic areas with benzimidazole and imthiazole drugs. However, high levels of resistance have developed in roundworms of livestock. To monitor drug efficacy in humans, the faecal egg reduction test (FECRT) measures faecal output pre- and post-treatment. We examined the impact of density dependent fecundity on ECRT. In canine hookworms, density dependent egg production shows a dynamic response to treatment. This affects drug efficacy and resistance measurements. Surviving worms may respond to relaxation of density constraints by increasing egg output compared to pre-treatment levels. This underestimates drug efficacy in ECRT. The degree of underestimation depends on worms’ ability to increase output, which depends on extent output prior to treatment. Worms in humans will be at different densities prior ECRT, so effects may vary within groups. Measurement may be improved by ensuring consistent underestimation in groups. This may be achieved by omitting heaviest cases from ECRT as they may increase output upon removal of density constraints. This highlights the need for new resistance methods examining drug effects on worms in vitro or changes in genotypes.
Epithelial heparan sulfate (HS) plays a crucial role in regulating Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling during lung development. SHH is a key regulator of branching morphogenesis, the process by which the mammalian lung acquires its tree-like structure. In this study, we show that deletion of HS synthet1, the enzyme responsible for HS synthesis, results in abnormal lung development. Lungs with Ext1 mutant mice have expanded branching tips and reduced branching, as well as mesenchymal defects. We further show that fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) expression and signaling are increased in Ext1 mutant lungs, suggesting a non-autonomous mechanism. This is consistent with reduced SH signaling, which suppresses F10 expression. Moreover, reactivating SH signaling in mutant lungs rescues the tip phenotype and attenuates F signaling. Importantly, reduced SH activity is not due to decreased Shh expression or protein stability, but rather reduced biologically active SH proteins in both Ext mutant epithelium and wild type mesenchym cells.
Paired-end sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for detecting genome rearrangements and structural variations on a genome-wide scale. This technique is particularly useful for detecting copy-neutral rearrangements, such as inversions and translocations, which are common in cancer and produce novel genes. Rearrangement breakpoints are difficult to detect because they are rare and often small. We derive a formula for the probability that a fusion exists in a genome given a collection of paired-end sequences. We use this formula to compute fusion probabilities in breast cancer samples and find that we can accurately predict genes with a small number of fragments. We demonstrate that fusion detection depends on gene length distribution and evaluate how sequencing parameters impact breakpoint detection, localization, and gene detection in the presence of false rearrangements.
Chemotaxis is the process by which cells move in response to chemical stimuli. It is composed of three interrelated processes: motility, sensing, and polarization. We propose that these processes are mediated by separate modules that account for each process individually and, and when combined, recreate chemotactic behaviors. Here, we describe a mathematical model where these modules are implemented in terms of reaction-diffusion equations. Migration and accompanying changes in cellular morphology are demonstrated in simulations using a mechanical model of the cell implemented in the level framework.
Tudor Domain Containing 6 (TDR6) is a male germ cell-specific protein that is essential for the formation of the chromatoid body and elongated spermatid, as well as male fertility. In meiotic prophase I spermatocytes, DR6 interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), which is involved in splicing. DR6 also associates with spliceosomal protein Sm in the absence of RNA and in an arginine methylation dependent manner. In DR6 deficient spermatocytes, PR5 association with Sm and arginine methylation of Sm are reduced. DR6 deficiency impairs assembly of spliceosomes, resulting in 3.5-fold increased levels of U snRNAs in the nucleus. These deficiencies in spliceosome maturation correlate with decreased numbers of SMN-positive bodies and Cajal bodies involved in snRNA maturation. Transcript analysis of DR6 deficient spermatocytes reveals high levels of splicing defects such as aberrant intron and exon usage as well as aberrant splice junctions.
Bacterial populations that colonize a host can play important roles in health by serving as reservoirs for transmission to other hosts and from which invasive strains emerge, emphasizing the importance of understanding rates of acquisition and clearance of colonizing populations. Previous studies of colonization dynamics have been based on assessment of whether samples represent a single or distinct colonization events. However, this approach is often inadequate to account for the diversity of the underlying within-host population, the time between consecutive measurements and the uncertainty in estimated rates. Here, we present a Bayesian model that provides probabilities of whether strains should be considered the same, allowing to determine acquisition and clearance from sampled over time. Our method models the within-host population using genetic simulation and is done using a combination of Approximate Bayesian Computation ( ABC ) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCM ). We validate the method with simulations and demonstrate its use by analyzing a collection of methicillin resistant Staphlococcus aureus ( MRSA ) isolates from a longitudinal study.
Plants generate new organs through the activity of stem cell populations called meristems. The shoot apical meristem initiates leaves, flowers, and lateral merist in highly ordered, spiralled or whor patterns via a process called phyllaxis. Auxin transport plays a major role in this process. Current hypotheses propose that hormone transporters of the PIN family create auxin maxima at precise positions, leading to organ initiation. To explain how transporters create distinct auxin fluxes within the plant, different concepts have been proposed. Canalization suggests transporters amplify and stabilize existing fluxes, which could be initiated by diffusion. This explains organized auxin flux during vein formation, but shoot apical meristem requires a second hypothesis where hormone is transported towards areas with highest concentrations. This implies two different mechanisms for PIN in the membrane, based on sensing flux and concentration. Because patterning requires hundreds of cells, it is impossible to estimate if a scenario is plausible. Therefore, modelling provides a means to test this type of hypothesis. Using a computer tool, we show that flux polarization is able to explain auxin at shootistem, providing a unifying concept for auxin control in the plant.
Visceral leishmanias (VL) is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania parasites transmitted by sandflies. Early detection and monitoring of the disease are required for effective treatment. Previous studies have shown that IgG1 is a potential biomarker for VL, but crude antigen ( CL ) used in rapid diagnostic tests ( RDTs ) may not be sufficient. Here, we combined bioinformatic tools with wet lab experiments to develop improved RDTs. We identified L.ovani protein as a potential antigen by immunoblot, which was confirmed by mass spectrometry. We searched for proteins with constitutive expression and antigenic domains accessible to B-cells, and selected candidates with linear epitopes predicted in silico. Epitopes from shortlisted proteins were screened in peptide arrays, and the most promising was tested in RDT prototypes. Over 90% of proteins from immunoblot did not satisfy selection criteria and were excluded from epitope mapping. Screening predicted epitopes from shortlisted identified the most reactive, with 84% (95% CI 60–97 ) sensitivity for Ig1 in Sudan VL sera RDT. None from nonendemic healthy controls were positive. We employed sil searches to reduce lab experiments, focusing on candidates with selected features. By predicting epitopes inico we screened large peptides, identifying the most promising for Ig1 sensitivity and specificity. This proof-of-concept strategy can be applied to RDT development for clinical status in VL.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a zoonotic disease caused by Leishmania parasites transmitted by sandflies. Caseating granulomas are often associated with mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis (TB) and are thought to be rare in CL. However, no large series have documented the incidence of caseating granomas in CL. We reviewed a multiregional cohort of 317 patients with CL from Syria (157), Pakistan (66), Lebanon (47), Saudi Arabia (43), Ethiopia (2) and Iran (2). All cases were confirmed by PCR followed by restriction length polymorphism analysis and were negative for other organisms. Granulomas were identified in 195 (61. 5%) of CL cases and were divided into caseating (25.2%), suppurative (4.6%) and tuberculoid without necrosis (70.%). Caseating and tuboid granoma groups were different in terms of geographical source with more cases in Saudi Arabia (p<0.000). Histologically both groups were different in distribution of Ridley’s pattern (p<.000) with doubling 3 in caseating granomas (31%) vs 5 in tuboid granoma (38%). Time to achieve healing was shorter in tuboid vs case group (4.0 vs.6.2 months. Parasitic index, species and other variables did not differ between granoma groups. In multiregional cohort, notable 18.2% of CL cases harbored caseating granomas; CL should be considered in differential for cases with caseating granomas in endemic regions.
Polygenic type 2 diabetes in mice is associated with obesity and results from a combination of adipogenic and diabetogenic alleles. Here we report the identification of a candidate gene for the diabetogenic effect of QTL NiddJ, contributed by the SJ, NON, and NZ strains in cross with New Zealand Obese ( NZ ) mice. A critical interval of distal chromosome 4 ( 2. 1 M ) conferring the diabetic phenotype was identified by interval-specific congenic introgression of SJ into diabetes-resistant CBL/6, and subsequent cross with NZ. Analysis of 10 genes in the interval by sequencing, q–PCR, and RT–PCR revealed a striking allelic variation of Zfp encoding zinc finger transcription factor 69. In NZ and C57/6, a retrotranson ILTRa in intron 3 disrupted the gene formation of a truncated mRNA lacking the coding for KR ( Krüpp-associated ) and Znf2 domains of Zfp, whereas diabetogenic SJ, NON, and NZ generated a normal mRNA. When combined with B–Lob background the diabetic ZfpSJ allele produced hyperglycemia, reduced gonadal fat, and increased plasma and liver triglyceride levels. mRNA of human orthologue Zfp, Z642 were significantly increased in adipose from patients with type 2 diabetes. We conclude Zfp is most likely the candidate for diabet effect of Nidd, and retrotranson ILTRa contributes to genetic heterogeneity of strains. Expression of transcription in adipose may play a role in pathogenesis type 2.
In this paper, we propose an integrated model of the regulatory network and signalling pathways controlling cell differentiation in the vertebrate hematopoietic system. We use a formalism to perform dynamical analyses of the available qualitative data. To cope with the size and complexity of the network, we use an original reduction approach with a stable identification algorithm. We assess the effects of heterogeneous environments on cell differentiation by performing a series of simulations considering prototypic environments. We identify stable states corresponding to Th1, Th, Th and Treg subtypes that coexist with transient cell types coexpressing combinations of Th, Th, Treg and Th markers in an environment-dependent fashion. Our analysis highlights the nature of these types and their relationships with canonical subtypes.
Transcription factors are proteins that regulate gene expression during animal development by binding to thousands of genomic regions. However, the forces that determine where, when, and to what extent they bind remain poorly understood. Here, we use a thermodynamic model of transcription factor binding to evaluate the contribution of biophysical forces to the binding of five regulators of early embryonic-posterior patterning in Drosophila melanogaster. The model predicts binding based on DNA and protein affinities achieves a correlation of ∼0. 4 with experimental measurements in vivo. Incorporating cooperativity and competition among the factors and spatial patterning in every nucleus has little effect on accuracy. A major source of error is the prediction of events that do not occur in vivo, hypothesized to reflect reduced chromatin accessibility. We test this by incorporating measurements of genome-wide DNA into our model, restricting binding to regions of chromatin. This improves predictions to ∼0.6–.9 for various factors across target genes. Finally, we use our model to quantify the roles of DNA, accessibility, and cooperativity. Our results show that in chromatin, binding can be predicted by the sequence of individual factors, with minimal for interactions.
In Drosophila imaginal discs, the transcription factors Daughterless (Da) and Extramacchaetea (Em) are the only members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHL) protein family that regulate cell proliferation. These factors are frequently deregulated in cancerous cells. We show that Em controls the G2/M transition and proliferation in epithelial cells of imaginal discs via Da. The main activator of this transition is the Cdc25 phosphatase string. We show that ectopic expression of string in cells with reduced Em or high Da rescues the proliferative defects in mutants. Moreover, we present evidence that Da is a transcriptional repressor of string. Our findings define a mechanism through which Em controls proliferation by regulating Da, which transcriptionally represses string.
In this study, we propose a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing phosphoproteomics data from interventional experiments to identify key proteins in signaling pathways, protein-protein interactions and infer signaling networks. Phosphoproteomics differs from proteomics by limited sampling due to few detectable sites per protein. We used SILAC ( Stable Isotope Labeling Amino acids in culture ) with interventional kinase-dead experiments. The pipeline includes phosphopeptide meta-analysis, network analysis and causal discovery. We applied it to interventional phosphorylation underlying filamentous growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identified 5 proteins from meta-analysis and 19 from correlation ( P2 and H were both ), all involved in stress. Nine have direct or indirect involvement in filament growth. We tested four predicted N, P, P, P and R by interphenotypic experiments, all present differential growth, validating our approach.
In Drosophila melanogaster, males have one X and one autosomes, while females have two X and one autos. The evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes has led to the evolution of two kinds of chromosome-specific regulation: dosage compensation and meiotic inactivation. Dosage compensation is the equalization of X gene expression in males and females, while meiotic inactivation is the silencing and heterochatinization of the X during meiosis in the male or female gerine. In Drosila, the X is regulated in the male germline is unclear. Here, we report three findings concerning X expression in Drosila testes. First, X-wide dosage compensation is absent in most Dila male germl. Second, microarray analysis provides no evidence for X-specific inactivation during meiosis. Third, we confirm that expression of reporters driven by autos spermatogenesis promoters is strongly reduced when inserted on X versus autos; this difference is established premeiotic and persists meiotic.
Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) is a major cause of diarrheal disease in humans and can be modeled by Citrobacter rodium infection in mice. The pathogenesis of both species depends on their ability to form epithelium-adherent microcolonies, also known as “attachment/effacement” (A) lesions. These microcolonies must be dynamic and able to self-renew by continuous re-infection of the regenerating epithelium. We show that colonic epithelial A microcolonies are clonal populations and depend on local growth to persist. In wild mice, microies are established within 18 hours of infection. These events shape intestinal geography and severity of infection despite presence of virulent luminal bacteria. Mechanistically, resistance to A lesion formation is mediated by TLR-My88/Tr-dependent and induced by virulent C. rodium in vir-dependent manner. Our data show that C rodium pathogenesis in vivo is restricted to short window that determines disease and severity.
Measuring the overlap between two populations can be done directly by counting the number of shared objects upon fully sampling both populations. However, in practice, only a fraction of each population’s objects are likely to be sampled due to data collection or sequencing limitations. Although methods exist for quantifying overlap under subsampled conditions, their bias is well-documented and the uncertainty of their estimates cannot be quantified. Here, we derive and validate a method to rigorously estimate population overlap from incomplete samples when the number of objects in each population is known. This is a special case of the general β-diversity problem, particularly relevant in ecology and epidemiology of malaria. By solving a Bayesian inference, this method takes into account subsampling rates and produces unbiased Bayes-optimal estimates of overlap. In addition, it provides a framework for computing the uncertainty of its estimates and can be used in planning by quantifying the tradeoff between sampling and uncertainty.
Protein kinases are a family of enzymes that regulate most cellular functions by phosphorylating proteins. They have a conserved catalytic core that oscillates between open, intermediate, and closed conformations. However, the intramolecular interactions that regulate these conformational changes are not well understood. Using cAMP-dependent protein kinase as a model, we identified a set of conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that regulate the active state. These include a salt bridge between lysine from β-strand and glutamate from α-helix as well as electrostatic interaction between phosphorylated loop and α-helix and hydrophobic residues of Regulatory Shell.
American Samoa conducted seven rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) for lymphatic filariasis (LF) from 2000–2006 under the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis. The World Health Organization recommends systematic post-MDA surveillance using Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) for epidemiological assessment of recent LF transmission. We compared the effectiveness of two survey designs for post-M surveillance: school-based survey of children aged 6–7 and community-based survey of people ≥8. In 2016, we conducted a school-based TAS in all elementary schools (N=29) and a survey in 28 villages on two main islands of American. We collected information on demographics and risk factors using electronic questionnaires, and geo-locations of schools and households. Blood samples were collected to test for circulating filarial antigen (CFA) using Alere Filasis Strip. For positive, we prepared slides for microscopic examination microfilar and provided. Descriptive statistics were performed for variables. Data were weighted to account for design and sex both surveys and age in community. The school TAS (n=114) identified antigen-positive children and overall C prevalence 0.7% (95%CI:0–.8) Of positive, we identified microilar 7-year-old. The survey (n=7,711) identified antigen people and overall C prevalence 6.% (95%CI4–.6) Adjusted village prevalence ranged –. C prevalence increased age and was in males. antigen community from whom slides prepared 25.% were microilar. School TAS had sensitivity range– and predictive value range– but specificity range and value– for identifying villages ongoing. The TAS failed in 201, survey identified higher numbers antigen people. School was logistically simpler sampling larger population but results did not overall prevalence older groups and not identifying foci transmission. survey, although operationally identified individuals ages and foci high. Both confirmed recrudence transmission.
Sex determination in zebraf is a complex and polygenic trait, influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. The role of germ cells, particularly oocytes, in sex determination is well established, as animals lacking germ cells or oocytes develop exclusively as males. However, oocytes are also required throughout adult life to maintain the female phenotype. We report a novel role for the oocyte-produced molecule Bmp in maintaining female differentiation in zraf. Females lacking Bmp develop normally but switch sex during mid to late juvenile stage and become fertile. We also show that estrogen is necessary for female development and that Bmp function in sex maintenance is linked to regulation of estrogen biosynthesis via promoting development of estrogen-producing granulosa cells in oocyte.
Hox proteins are key regulators of morphogenesis along the anterior–posterior body axis of animals by controlling distinct sets of target genes within their broad expression domains. Individual Hox proteins control cell diversification and patterning and target gene expression in a highly localized manner, sometimes only in a single cell. To achieve this high regulatory specificity, it has been proposed that Hox proteins co-operate with other transcription factors to activate or repress their targets in a highly context-dependent manner in vivo. Here, we describe the regulation of the cell death gene reaper (pr ) by the Hox protein Deformed (fd ). We show that activation ofpr in the anterior part of the maxillary segment is achieved through a combinatorial interaction offd with at least eight functionally diverse transcriptional regulators on a minimal enhancer. This suggests that context-dependent combinations of H proteins and other factors on small, modular H response elements (HREs ) could be responsible for the spatio-temporal expression of H targets.
Plant innate immunity is mediated by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) at the cell surface and inside the cell. Pathogen effectors (virulence factors) are monitored by intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins in plants. Here, we study the genetic requirements for defense responses of an autoactive ADR1-L2, an Arabidopsis coiled-coil (CC)-NB-LRR protein. ADR-L functions upstream of salicylic acid (SA) accumulation in several defense contexts and can act as a helper to transduce specific activation from sensor NB-LRs. This activity does not require an intact P-loop. ADR-L and two closely related NB-L members are required for propagation of unregulated cell death in l1 mutant. We demonstrate that in this context A-L function is P-dependent. We generated an autoactive missense A1-LD484 in a homology motif M. Expression of A-LD leads to dwarf plants with increased resistance and constitutive high SA. The phenotype also requires intact P, suggesting A-LD phenotypes reflect canonical NB activation. We used A-LD to define requirements for signaling. Signaling from A does not require NAD oxidase and is negatively regulated by E1 and MC. Transcription of A is correlated with phenotypic outputs; these are SA-dependent and-independent. The requirements resemble SA-dependent signal amplification of death observed in absence. Importantly A autoactivation is controlled by E and SA separable but linked.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, two components of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway, SUVH and ID2, interact with MOR6 to mediate transcriptional silencing. SUV2 and SUV9 can act in the same pathway as MOR6 or synergistically with MOR6 to mediate silencing, while ID2 interacts with MOR6 to mediate silencing of a subset of MOR target loci. Other RDM components, including IV, V, R2, and DRM2, are also required for silencing at a subset of MOR6 loci. MOR6 was previously shown to mediate silencing through heterochrom condensation. We demonstrate that SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling components SWI, SWI, and SW interact with MOR6 as well as SUV9 to mediate silencing. These results suggest that RDM components are not only involved in methylation but also in MOR6-mediated heterrom condensation. This study illustrates how methylation is linked to heterrom condensation and enhances silencing at methylated regions.
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that has been shown to buffer genetic variation in phenotypes in both flies and plants. In vertebrates, the protective role of H90 could account for the variable penetrance and severity of some developmental malformations. We used zebraf as a model to study the effects of H90 inhibition on development. In wild-type zraf, H90 inhibition did not induce a heat shock response or perturb phenotype. However, H90 inhibition increased the severity of the recessive eye phenotype caused by the paxb mutation and decreased the severity of the eye phenotype caused by the su mutation. In addition, H90 inhibition uncovered a previously unobserved spectrum of severe eye malations reminiscent of anophthalmia, microphthalm, and nanthalmia in humans. Inbreeding of offspring from unaffected parents led to elevated malformation frequencies and revealed the oligogenic nature of this phenotype. Unlike Drosoph, H90 inhibition decreased developmental stability in zraf, as indicated by increased presentation of anophthalm, microphthalm, nanthalm and sunrise phenotypes. Analysis of the paxb mutation suggests a molecular mechanism for buffering by H90. The zraf studies imply that mild perturbation of H90 at developmental stages may underlie the penetrance and expressivity of developmental anomalies where genotype and environment interact.
N-terminal acetylation is a post-translational modification in which the N-terminus of a nascent polypeptide chain is co-translationally acetylated after the removal of the initiating methion residue. In Drosophila melanogaster, we identified more than 1, 200 mature N-terminally acetylated proteins and found that N-terminal acety occurs with similar frequency to humans. We extracted the X PX rule as the sole determinant of N-terminal acety, indicating that acetylation occurs under all circumstances. This rule was used to engineer proteins to study the biological relevance of acetylation by generating a generic assay to probe the importance of N-terminal acety. We applied the assay by expressing mutated proteins in cell lines and flies. We present a strategy to systematically study the relevance of N-terminal acylation in cells and organisms.
The ability of RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) to recycle from termination to reinitiation is essential for abundant tRNA production during cellular proliferation and development, as well as in cancer. However, the mechanisms of termination used by RN III are incompletely understood, and its link to high transcription output is unclear. We used tRNA-mediated suppression to screen for RNAP mutants with gain and loss of termination phenotypes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. 122 mutants were mapped to the recently solved 3. 9 Å structure of yeast RN III elongation complex (EC) ; they cluster in the active bridge helix and loop, as well as the pore and funnel, the latter indicating involvement of the cleavage domain of the C subunit in termination. Purified RN III from a readthrough (RT) mutant exhibits increased elongation rate. The data support a kinetic model in which elongation rate is inversely related to termination. The mutants exhibit correlations of RT in vitro and in vivo, as well as amounts in vivo. Because in vivo can be confounded by parameters, we used a tRNA with a processing defect and strong terminator. ruling out differences in RNA rates, the indicate mutants with RT phenotype synthesize more than wild type, and can be accounted by increased rate. Finally, increased by mutants appears unrelated to III repressor. The results show the elements of III active, including, are determinants of termination and some activate III for transcription.
Many protein-protein interactions remain uncharacterized by current experimental methods. We developed a method to predict SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions using the structure of SH-phosphopeptide complexes and the FoldX algorithm. We show that our method performs similarly to experimentally derived consensus and substitution matrices for known in vitro and in vivo targets of SH domains. We used our method to predict a set of high-confidence interactions for human SH domains with known filtered secondary structure and phosphorylation state. We validated predictions using literature-derived SH interactions and a probabilistic score from naive Bayes integration of coexpression, conservation of interaction in other species, shared partners, and functions.
Accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders. In tauopathies, such as Alzheimer’s disease ( AD, aberrant accumulation of microtubule associating protein ( MAP, tau ) into toxic oligomers and amyloid deposits is a primary pathology. Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein, enriched with proline residues that regulate secondary structure and aggregation. The orientation of proline residues is regulated by cis peptid-proly isomerases ( Pases. Here, we show that cyclophil 40 ( Cy40 ), a Pase, dissolves tau amyloids in vitro. Additionally, Cy40 ameliorated oligomeric tau in a mouse model of accumulation, preserving neuronal health and cognition.
Heteroc differentiation in cyanobacteria filaments is one of the simplest examples of cellular differentiation and pattern formation in multicellular organisms. However, the knowledge of the genetic circuit underlying the behavior of a single cyanobacter under nitrogen deprivation is still unknown. Here, we explore heteroc differentiation under the paradigm of systems biology. We formulate the dynamical ingredients of the genetic circuit of a cyanacter into a set of differential equations describing the evolution of the concentrations of the molecular products. We study the behavior of a cyanacter under external conditions, emulating nitrogen deprivation and simulate the dynamics of cyanacteria by their respective circuits via diffusion. This allows us to understand the principles by which heteryst can be generated and sustained. Our results show that including diffusion and external conditions in the model, we can reproduce the features of formation and sustainment of heteryst in cyanacteria as observed experimentally.
Despite the success of the Community Directed Treatment with Ivermect (DTI) program in the fight against oncherciasis in Africa, onchias prevalence remains above the transmission threshold in Cameroon after more than 15 years of mass treatment. This study aimed to explore the association between people’s perceptions of onchias and DTI, and adherence toiverect in three regions of Cameroon. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in three districts with high onchias prevalence. Participants were randomly selected in 30 clusters per district. Adherence toiverect was comparable in Bang and Bafia (55. 0% and 48.8%, respectively, p>.05 ) and lower in Yab (40.7%. Among factors related to program and disease representations, perceptions of the program were most determinant of adherenceiver. People with a “not” opinioniverect campaigns were less compliant than those with a positive opinion (40% vs 55 in Bang, 48 vs 62 in Bafia p.01, as well as those with negative appreciation of distributors’ commitment (22 vs 53 in Bang 33 vs 59 inafia 27 vs 47 Yab p.01. The most common misconception waschias transmission was lack of hygiene, especially inafia and Yab. In Bang, high proportions believedchias due to sugar consumption (31 vs less inafia and Yassi p.001. There are frequent misconceptions aboutchias transmission in Cameroon. Perceptionsiverect campaigns are strongly associated with adherence.
The contribution of DNA methylation and genetic variants on protein biomarkers for human diseases was investigated in this study. We combined DNA methylation and genetic data with protein biomarkers for cancer and cardiovascular disease to investigate the relative contribution of genetic and epigenetic variation on biomarker levels. A total of 121 protein biomarkers were analyzed in relation to DNA methylation at 470,000 positions and over 10 million SNPs. We performed epigen-wide study (EW) and genome-wide study (GW) analyses, and integrated biomarker DNA and methylation data between 698 and 103 samples depending on availability. We identified 124 loci with effect up 0.22 units change per 1% DNA methylation and up four units per copy allele in EW and GW respectively. Most GW loci were cis-regulatory whereas EW loci were trans. Eleven EW loci were associated with multiple biomarkers, one with NL5 associated CX11, CX9,12, and levels. All EW signals overlapped with GW locus were driven by variants and EW signals were confounded by smoking. While cis SNPs for biomarkers had effect on methylation, SNPs for methylation did not affect biomarkers. We present associations between biom and methylation at loci in the genome.
Natural killer (NK) cells are important effectors of the innate immune response against varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. We demonstrate that VV potently impairs the ability of NK cells to respond to target stimulation in vitro, leading to loss of cytotoxic and cytokine responses. This impairment is not only observed in VV infected NK cells, but also in V negative NK cells exposed to virus in culture. The impairment is dependent on direct contact between NK cells and VV infected cells. Profiling of NK surface receptors by multiparameter flow cytometry reveals that receptor expression is predominantly stable. However, NK cells are still capable of releasing cytotoxic granules when stimulation is bypassed, suggesting that V paralyses NK from responding. Examination of the degranulation signalling cascade reveals perturbation following VV culture. In addition to inhibiting degranulation, IF-γ and TN production are repressed by VV culture, most strongly inV infected NK. Interestingly, closely related herpes virus simplex type 1 (HSV-1) also efficiently infects NK in cell-associated manner and renders NK unresponsive to target stimulation. However, HSV differentially targets cytokine production compared VV.
Apparent motion (AM) is a phenomenon in which two alternately presented stimuli at different locations evoke a perception of a stimulus moving between the locations. The neural mechanism underlying AM is thought to be increased activation of primary visual cortex (V1) neurons tuned to locations along the AM path. However, evidence remains inconclusive. AM masking, which refers to reduced detectability of stimuli along AM, has been taken as evidence for AM-related V1 activation. AM-induced responses are thought to interfere with responses to physical stimuli along path and impair perception of these stimuli. However, AM can also be explained by predictive models, predicting responses to stimuli on AM are suppressed when match spatio-temporal prediction of stimulus along path. In this study, we find AM has distinct effect on detection of gratings, limiting performance at high levels. This is strongest when target is identical to orientation of inducers. We developed V-like model of early processing based on standard normalization. We find AM-related in V is too small to cause masking or perceived motion. Our instead predicts suppression early during AM consistent with predictive framework.
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) oncoprotein Tax plays a key role in the transformation of CD4+ T cells by promoting cell proliferation and survival, mainly through the activation of the NF-κB pathway and induction of NF-κB target genes. To understand the underlying mechanism of HTLV-1-mediated transformation, it is critical to elucidate the mechanism of Tax-induced NF-κB activation. Current studies have suggested multiple controversial mechanisms regarding Tax-induced IK activation mainly due to blending of primary Tax-induced IK events and secondary IK events induced by cytokines secreted by Tax-induced IK-NF-κ activation. Here, we reconstituted Tax-stimulated IK activation in a cell-free system to dissect the essential components for IK activation by Tax and the underlying biochemical mechanism. We found that Tax is a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, which, together with Ubc2, U5, or U7 catalyzes the assembly of mixed-link polyubiquitin chains. These mixed-link polyubitin chains are responsible for IK activation by binding to the NEM subunit of IK. Our studies revealed the biochemical function of Tax in IK activation which utilizes minimal ubiquitination components for NF-κ activation.
Species invasions: A Meta-Analysis of the Propagule Pressure Effect. The success of an alien species appears to depend on the number of individuals introduced to a population (propagule pressure). However, the form of this relationship has been largely unexplored. We present the first quantitative review of this, using meta-analytical methods. The relationship between propagule pressure and success has been evaluated for a range of taxa including invertebrates, herbaceous plants, long-lived trees, and aquatic vertebrates. We found a positive effect of propagule pressure on success in every hypothesis tested. However, success most depended on propagules in the range of 10–100. Heterogeneity in effect was associated with analytical approaches, with evidence of larger sizes in animal than plant introductions. No variation was accounted for by scale ( field to global ) or methodology ( observational, experimental, proxy ).
Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is a cytokine implicated in chronic and severe inflammatory diseases that enhances the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by attenuating the decay of encoding mRNAs. The decay of these mRNAs depends on AU-binding proteins (AUBPs) that target AU-rich elements in the 3′-UTR of mRNAs and facilitate either decay or stabilization. Here, we show that AUB and target mRNAs assemble in a ribonucleoprotein complex in the presence of microRNA (miR16), leading to degradation of target mRNAs. Notably, IL-17 attenuates miR expression and promotes binding of stabilizing AUB over destabilizing AUB, reducing decay. These findings indicate miR independently of sequence directs competition between degrading and stabilizing AUB for mRNAs. Since AUB affect about 8% of human transcriptome and miR is ubiquitously expressed, IL- may in addition to inflammation affect other cellular processes.
Sleeping sickness, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma brucei brucei, is a major public health problem in Uganda. The disease has two forms: acute and chronic. Acute sleeping sickness is considered to be restricted to the southeast of the country, while the chronic form is confined to the northwest. However, acute sleeping has been spreading to new areas, linked to the movement of infected cattle. Cattle are long-term reservoirs of human infective T. brodesense, showing few signs of morbidity yet posing significant risk to human health. This paper examines the relationship between cattle and human T brucei infection in villages in Kaberido and Dokolo Districts, Uganda. The study was undertaken in villages that had a case of sleeping in the six months prior to sample and those that never had a case. Sleeping status of villages had a significant effect on odds of infection in cattle from case than non-case villages for brucei (OR 2. 94, 95%CI 1.38–6.24 ). Cattle age had a significant effect on the likelihood of bruce infection within cattle between 18–36 (OR 3.51,95CI 1.63–7.51 ) and over 36 (4.20,95CI 2.08.67 ) had higher odds of bruce than under 18 months. Village sleeping status had a significant effect on detection of br in cattle, with higher likelihood in case villages (25,95CI 1.2–520.71 ). Overall higher bruce prevalence >16.3 in a herd was associated with higher br being detected in a herd (25,95CI 1.2–520.71 )
In Drosophila, the major histone H4 lysine 16 (H4 ) acetyltransferase MO is involved in the regulation of X-chrom and autosomal genes as part of the MSL and NS complexes. While the function of MSL as a dosage regulator is well understood, the role of NS in gene regulation is poorly characterized. Here, we report a comprehensive Ch–seq analysis of four NS members (,,,,, and ) throughout the D melanogaster genome. Strikingly, 85% of NS-bound genes are constitutively expressed across cell types. We find an abundance of H4ac, H3me, H3, and H9 in promoter regions characteristic of NS-target genes. Furthermore, these genes have well-defined nucleosome region and broad initiation patterns. By Ch– analyses of RNA polymerase II ( II ) in NS1 and NS3-depleted cells, we show that both are required for efficient II recruitment to NS promoters. II reduction coincides with binding of TBP and TIB to promoters, indicating the NS is required for optimal recruitment of the-initiation on genes Moreover, that undergo most loss upon NS tend to be enriched Replication Element ( ).
Facioscapulhumeral dystrophy (FD) is a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of DUX, a retrogene encoding a germline transcription factor encoded in repeat. Individuals generally have more than 10 repeats in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4, whereas the most common form of FD (FD1) is caused by contraction of array to fewer than 10, associated with decreased epigen repression and variegated DUX in muscle. We have generated transgenic mice carrying D4 arrays from FD allele and a control allele. These recapitulate epigen and DUX expression seen in patients and controls, respectively, high DUX levels in germline ( ), incomplete epigen repression somatic, and FD-specific varieg DUX in sporadic muscle associated D4 chromatin.
Malaria vaccine candidate Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1) induces protection, but only against parasite strains closely related to the vaccine. Overcoming AMA1 diversity will require understanding the basis of cross-strain inhibition. A vaccine containing diverse AMA1 proteins (AMA1adv) elicited polyclonal antibodies that inhibited invasion of vaccine and non-vaccine strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Comparing polyclonal AMA with strain-specific monoval AMA revealed AMAadv induced higher inhibitory antibodies associated with conserved domain-3 and reduced domain-2 responses. Inhibitory monoclonal (m) against AMA reacted with cross-reactive epitope at hydrophobic domain-1; this epit mapped conserved AMA and encompassed 1-loop. m binding 1-loop (10, 8 and 11) were ∼10 more potent than previously AMA-inhib m and mode of 1-loop m was inhibition AMA binding to ligand RON. Unlike epit of previously 7-specific m, the 1-loop was conserved across strains. Another m, which bound domain, was broadly inhib and blocked proteolytic processing AMA. By m was weakly inhibitory but synergized previously, strain-transending m, which close hydroobic on cons and inhib RON binding AMA. Novel susceptible and epitopes identified can improve antigen breadth and inhibitory of AMA vaccines. Vaccination diverse proteins provide universal by immune towards conserved.
Asymmetric spindle positioning of the mitotic spindle during cell division is important for many cells to divide unequally. Recent studies have begun to unveil the molecular mechanisms of mitotic spindle displacement, but little is known about how spindle displacement is precisely timed. A conserved mitotic mechanism is known to time events in dividing cells, but this has never been linked to spindle. Here we show that anaphase-promoting complex ( APC ), its activator C20/Fizzy, its target cyclin, and cycl-dependent kinase ( CD ) comprise a previously unrecognized timer for spindle. In Caenorhabditis zygote mitotic spindle displacement begins at precise time after chromosomes congress to metaphase. We found that reducing function of proteasome APC or C20/Fizzy delayed spindle. Conversely inactivating CD in metaphase caused spindle to displace early. Experimentally unlinking spindle from this mechanism caused displacement of incompletely assembled mitotic components. We conclude that in this system spindle is normally delayed until APC inactivates CD, ensuring spindle does not begin until fully assembled. This is first demonstration that mitotic times spindle in asymmetric division of animal.
Human populations living in high-altitude regions, such as the Andean Plateau and Tibetan Plateau, have evolved unique physiological adaptations to cope with low oxygen levels. However, the genetic basis of these adaptations remains unknown. We performed a genome-wide scan to identify genes showing evidence of adaptation to hypoxia. We looked at each chromosome to identify regions with unknown function with respect to high-altitude phenotypes. We also examined groups of genes involved in oxygen sensing to test the hypothesis that particular pathways have been involved in adaptation to altitude. We applied four genetic statistics to detect signatures of natural selection and identified candidate genes and regions in two populations ( Tibetans and Andeans ) separately. The patterns of genetic adaptation are largely distinct between the two populations, with evidence of selection in different genes or regions. Interestingly, EGLN ( PH2 ) shows evidence of selection in both Tibetans and Andans, but with different patterns of variation. Our results indicate key H-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for adaptation in Andans and Tibetans, and several chromosomal regions implicated in response to selection. These data suggest a role in high-altitude adaptation and provide basis for future studies to confirm candidate and regions in adaptation to altitude.
Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are a type of DNA damage that can be caused by environmental factors or errors during DNA replication. Repairing DSBs is essential for cell survival, but faulty repair can lead to genetic instability, making the choice of DSB repair pathway important. Here, we show that inverted repeats (IRs) near DSBs can channel repair into a pathway that leads to gene conversion instead of break-induced replication (BIR) that leads to instability. IRs ability to form unusual DNA structures when present in single-strand (ssDNA) formed by DSB resection explains their effect. We demonstrate that IRs can form two types of structures and the choice between these depends on the length of IRs. IRs separated by long spacer (1kb) are involved in intermolecular single-strand annealing (SSA) leading to formation of dimers; IRs by short spacer (12bp) participate intramolecular SSA leading to formation of fold (FB) structures. Both structures interfere with accurate DSB repair by gene conversion and channel DSB into BIR that promotes genomic destabilization. We report that different complexes participate in processing of FB containing short (12bp) versus long (kb) ssDNA. Specifically, FBs short are processed by MRX-Sae complex whereas Rad1-Rad10 is responsible for processing of long. Our studies uncover mechanisms of genomic destabil resulting from re-routing DSB into pathways by IRs.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing both acute and chronic infections in susceptible hosts. Chronic P. aerugin infections are thought to be caused by biofilms, which are highly structured, multicellular microbial communities encased in an extracellular matrix that enable long-term survival in the host. To study P aerugin biofilms in vivo, we developed an animal model using Drosila melanogaster. At 24 h post infection, P. aerugin biofilms localized and were visualized in dissectedrosila crops. These biofilms had a characteristic structure and extracellular matrix composed of DNA and exopolysacide. aerugin cells recovered in vivo biofilms had increased antibiotic resistance relative to planktonic cells. Biofilm formation was dependent on expression of exopolyside genes, as pel:: mutant failed to form biofilms. The:: mutant was more virulent than PA1, while hyperbio strain (Z3 ) demonstrated less virulence than PA1, indicated by survival of infected at 14 postinfection. Biofilm formation by PA1 andZ3 in crop was associated with induction diptericin,ecin A androsycin antimicrobial gene expression 24 postin. Infection with nonbio strain:: resulted in decreased gene expression.
Vasopressin 1 receptor 1 (Av1 ) is a gene involved in mediating vasopress-mediated social behaviors and exhibits remarkable differences in expression patterns between and within species. Previous studies have suggested that the proximal 5′ flanking region and polymorphic microsatellite element of the Av1 gene are associated with variation in V1 receptor (V1R ) distribution and behavior, but have not been causally linked. Here, we used homologous recombination in mice to reveal that the proximal 5′ flanking sequences contribute to species differences in V1R distribution and confirm that V1R impacts behavior in the forced swim test. We also show that the Av1 microsatellite contributes to Av1 expression in the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, mirroring a subset of inter- and intra-species differences in V1 patterns in voles. This is the first evidence that polymorphic microsat elements near behaviorally relevant genes contribute to diversity in brain expression, providing a mechanism for generating diversity at the individual and species level. However, our results suggest that many species-specific patterns are mediated by elements outside the 5′ flanking region of the gene.
Transcription of the switch (S) regions of immunoglobulin genes in B cells generates stable loops that are targeted by Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (A), triggering class switch recombination (CSR), as well as translocations with c-MYC responsible for Burkitt’s lymphomas. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, stable-loops are formed co-transcriptionally in mutants of TH, a conserved complex involved in mR biogenesis. Such-loops trigger genome instability and deamination by A. To understand the mechanisms that generate genome instability by mR biogenesis and A, we devised a chromosomal system based on segments of mammalian S and cYC for analysis of chromosomal rearrangements in wild-type and TH mutants. We demonstrate that A acts in heterologous and cYC transcribed leading to double-strand breaks (DSBs) which cause chromosomal translocations via Non-hologous Joining (NJ). A–induced translocations were enhanced in TH mutants, consistent with that A–mediated DS depend on-loop.
During cell division in E. coli, the coordination between cell division and chromosome segregation is essential for producing viable progeny. In the commonly accepted view, E. coli achieves this coordination by positioning its division apparatus relative to the nucleoids. However, E. coli can still propagate without proper positioning. Here, we describe how E. coli partitions its chromosomes during asymmetric divisions. Using time-lapse imaging, we show that translocase Fts can pump up to 80% ( 3. 7 Mb ) of the chromosome between daughters at 170±800 bp/s. DNA translocations are rare and we did not observe reversals at experimental scales of minutes. The majority of movement occurs at late division when Zip has dissociated from the septum and the septum has closed to a diameter smaller than 250 nm. Our data suggest the constriction is necessary for translocation by Fts.
The development of epitope-based vaccines (EVs) is based on the knowledge of specific antigens from immunogenic peptides, called epitopes, which are key components of EVs. Due to regulatory, economic, and practical concerns, the number of epitopes that can be included in an EV is limited. Furthermore, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding epitopes is highly polymorphic, every patient possesses a set of MHC I and II molecules differing specificities. A combination effective for one person can be completely ineffective for another. This renders optimal selection of epitopes important. We present a mathematical framework based on integer linear programming (ILP) that allows formulation of various EV design and identification of optimal sets of epitopes from a user-defined set of predicted or experimentally determined epitopes. The framework selects the set with maximum likelihood of eliciting a broad potent immune response. Our IL approach allows formulation of numerous EV design variants. We show how immunological requirements for good EV ( e. g., coverage of epitopes from antigen, coverage of M alleles in set, avoidance of epitopes with high rates ) can be translated into constraints or modifications within IL framework.
Sexual transmission of HIV-1 to the cervico-vaginal mucosa is the most common route of HIV infection in women. Semen is not only a carrier of HIV-1, but also contains biological factors, including cytokines that may affect HIV-1 transmission. We investigated the role of IL-7 in HIV-1 vaginal transmission in an ex vivo human cervico-vaginal tissue system. We simulated in vivo HIV-1 deposition on cervicoaginal tissue in combination with IL-7 concentrations measured in semen of HIV-1-infected individuals. IL-7 significantly enhanced HIV-1 replication in cervicoaginal tissue and lymphoid tissue explants. Analysis of infected cells showed IL-7 reduced CD4 T cell apoptosis, evidenced by decrease in apoptotic marker APO2.7 and increase in anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Also, IL-7 increased CD4 T cell cycling, evidenced by Ki-67 staining.
Zika virus (ZIK) infection in Aedes aegypt cells triggers the production of virus-specific small RNAs that are loaded into the exogenous small interfering RNA (exo-siRNA) pathway. The exo-si pathway is considered the key antiviral response in mosquitoes. In Aedes aegpt cells, ZIK-specific siRNAs are produced and loaded into the exo-si pathway effector protein Argonaute 2 (Ago2), but Ago2 knockdown does not enhance virus replication. Enhanced ZIK replication is observed in Ago2-knock cells, suggesting the exo pathway is involved in antiv response. ZIK-specific piRNAs are produced but lack the characteristic piRNA ping-pong motif and are bound to Ago3 but not Piwi or Piwi. Silencing of Pi proteins indicates Ago, Piwi, or Piwi knockdown does not enhance ZIK replication and only Pi displays antiv activity. We also report that ZIK capsid protein amplifies replication of a reporter virus; unlike yellow fever protein, it does not inhibit exo pathway. Our findings elucidate ZIK-mosquito RNA interactions important for its spread.
Sporotrichosis in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: Sporothrix brasiliensis Associated with Atypical Presentations  
Sporotrichosis is an infectious disease caused by the fungus Sporothrix schenii. In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil is one of the most endemic areas of sporrichosis in the world. Recently, there have been changes in the taxonomy of Sporoth schenii and new clinical aspects of sporrichosis have been observed. This study aimed to determine the Sporrix species associated with both classic and unusual sporrich manifestations in Rio de Janeiro. We performed a cross-sectional study in which Sporrix isolates from 50 patients with different manifestations were analyzed by phenotypic and genotyp methods. We found that Sporrix brasili was associated with disseminated cutaneous infection, mucosal infection, and hypersensitivity reactions, whereas Spor schii sensu stricto was associated with severe localized disease similar to previously described sporrich cases. Patients with brasili required shorter itracon treatment (16 weeks ) compared to those with schii (24 weeks ). These findings suggest that Sporrix species are linked to different sporrich manifestations and brasili is effectively treated with itracon.
Most of the mammalian genome is transcribed than can be accounted for by annotated genes, but the quantity and nature of the additional transcripts remains unclear. We used data from single and paired-end RNA-Seq and tiling to assess the quantity and composition of transcripts in Poly+ RNA from human and mouse tissues. Relative to tiling, RNASeq identifies many transcribed regions “seqags” outside known exons and ncRNAs. Most seqags are introns, raising the possibility they are fragments of preRNAs. The chromosomal locations of the majority of intergenic seqags in RNASeq data are near genes, consistent with alternative splicing and polyadenylation usage, promoter and terminator transcripts or new exons. Indeed, reads identified 544 new exons, affecting 554 genes. Most remaining seqags correspond to reads that display characteristics of random sampling from low background or several small transcripts ( median=111 bp ) present at higher levels, also display sequence conservation and originate from open chromatin. We conclude that while there are bonaide intergenic transcripts, their number is generally low compared to exons and the genome is not pervasively transcribed as previously.
The ability to engineer thermost proteins is a promising for the development of novel bioreagents. In this work, a combined computational and experimental method was developed to increase the thermostability of the flavin mononucleotide based protein Bacillus subtilis YA LO domain by 31°C, thus extending its applicability in thermophilic systems. The method includes five steps: (1) in silico screening to identify thermost mutant candidates, (2) experimental evaluation to confirm positive selections, (3) computational redesign around therable regions, (4) experimental reevaluation, and (5) multiple combination of mutations. The method is simple and effective, can be applied to other proteins where other methods have difficulties, and provides a new tool to improve thermost.
Leishmanias is a protozoan disease transmitted by sand flies of the genus Lutzia in the New World. Within the Panama Canal watershed, the cutaneous form of leishmanias is a health threat for residents and tourists. We report the results of a screening of sand fly species for Leish and Wolbachia in the understory of Barro Island, Republic of Panama. We used DNA sequences to determine the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of Phleominae in the area. The CO1 gene supported 18 species determinations and revealed two “cryptic” species, Lu. sp. vespilion and Lu. gzi. We detected Leish DNA in 43. 3% Lu. trapi, 26.3 Lu.zi and 0% other species using ITS-1 primers. The ITS-1 sequence was obtained from Leish Lu. trapi and.zi which was 93% similar to Leish. naiff in GenBank. Dist Wolia were detected in three species including Lu. trapi, which frequently co-occurred with Leish. Two species were found to carry Leish at high frequency and are likely vectors of leishias to humans or mammals. A single Leish species identified as. naiff was carried by both. naiff is known to cause cutaneous leish in South America but has not been reported in Panama. The occurrence of Leish and Wolia in. trapi identifies it as a target for Wolia sweeps.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation in dendritic cells (DCs) is associated with devastating clinical consequences. Here, we show that mitogen- and stress-activated kinases (MSK) act cooperatively with cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) to induce CMV immediate early gene expression from latency. CRE binding to the viral major early promoter (MP) provides a target for MS recruitment. MS-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 is required for histone demethylation and subsequent CMV exit from latency. Importantly, CRE binding to MP is necessary for MS recruitment of kinase activity to initiate chromatin remodeling at MP for reactivation.
Ribosome biogenesis is an essential for all living organisms. However, defects in ribosome production cause a group of diseases called ribosomies. We previously found that the protein NOL11 is important for ribosome production in human cells. Here we show that N11 is also important for ribosome production and craniofacial development in vertebrates. N11 is found in the developing cranial neural crest of amphibians and mammals. We knocked down N11 in Xenopus and found that ribosome production was impaired, cells died, and craniofacial cartilage was abnormal. Inhibiting p53 rescued the craniofacial defect but not the ribosome defect. This shows a conserved mechanism to remove ribosome-impaired craniofac cells. Excessive activation of this mechanism impairs craniofac development. Our findings show that N11 is important for craniofac development and provide insight into ribosome proteins and cranfac cell survival.
Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The lack of an adequate diagnostic test is a major barrier for diagnosis, especially during the early stages of illness, when therapy is most effective. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient test for this life-threatening disease. In order to identify new targets that could be used as markers for leptospi, we constructed a protein microarray comprising 61% of Leptira interrogans proteome and investigated IgG from 274 individuals, including 80 acute, 80 convalescent patients and 114 healthy subjects from regions with endemic, high, endemic and no transmission of leptpi. We found 16 antigens that discriminate between acute and healthy individuals from region with high transmission of leptpi, and 18 that distinguish convalescent cases. Some of the antigens identified, such as Lip32, non-identical domains of Lig, Gro, and Lo22 are known to be recognized by sera from patients, thus proof-of-concept for serodi antigen discovery. Several novel antigens were identified, including hypothetical LIC15 which showed good sensitivity and specificity for both acute and convalescent patients. Our study is the first large evaluation of immunodominant antigens associated with acquired leptiral infection, as well as known serodi leptiral antigens recognized by sera leptpi cases.
Mosquito immunity against entomopathogenic fungi, such as Beauveria bassiana, remains poorly understood. We used Anopheles gambia as a model to investigate the role of melanization, a potent effector of arthropod immunity, in defense against B. bassiana. We monitored fungal growth in mosquitoes injected with B. bass conidia and found that melan formed on all stages, including conidia, germ tubes, and hyphae. However, melan rarely aborted growth of these stages and mycelium continued despite melanization. Silencing T1 and CL8, key regulators of Plasmod and melanization in A. gambia, abolished melan on hypha but not germinating conidia or tubes. A layer of hemocytes surrounded germinating conidia but not hypha suggested melanization of early stages is cell-mediated, while late is humoral dependent on T1 and CL8. Microscopic analysis revealed association of T with hypha surfaces and requirement of both T and CL8 for phenoloxidase recruitment to these. Finally, proliferation was more in T and CL8 knockdown mosquitoes which exhibited increased sensitivity to B infections than controls.
Dengue virus factors (DENVFs) are essential for the completion of the infection in both mosquito and vertebrate hosts. Here, we investigated whether known mammalian DENV inhibitors could influence infection in the arthropod vector Aedes aegypt. We evaluated the potency of bafilomycin (BAF), myopholic acid (M), castanospermine (CAS), and deoxojirimycin (DN) in blocking DENV infection of the mosquito midgut using various methods. Injection of BAF (5µM) and M (25µM) prior to feeding on virus-infected blood inhibited DENV in the midut at 7 days post-infection by 56% and 60 and in the saliv gland at 14 post-in by 90 and 83, respectively. Ingestion of B and M through sugar or blood meal also resulted in virus inhibition. RNA-mediated silencing of vPase subunit and IMP gene resulted in reduced DENV, indicating B and M-mediated inhibition likely occurred through inhibition of DENVFs. The route and timing of B and M administration was essential and after exposure diminished antiviral effect. We provide proof-principle that chemical or RNA-mediated depletion of DENV vPase and IMP can suppress D in adult.
Seizure spreading and depression and anoxic depolarization are two pathological states of the brain that are poorly understood. We know little about the role of cell volume in these states. Here, we studied the effects of cell volume on neuronal dynamics. We combined cell swelling with ion concentrations and oxygen into Hodgkin-Hux type spiking dynamics. We found that cell swells and contracts in response to changes in osm pressure. This leads to spontaneous transition between seizure and depression states. We used volume as a parameter to separate seizure from depression and depression, and depression from anoxic depolar. Our model highlights the role of glial buffering against seizures and depression, and provides insights into anoxic depolar and cell swelling during ischemia. We argue that seizures, depression, and anoxicolar lie along a continuum of the neuron that can be understood when ion, oxygen, homeostasis, and swelling are taken into consideration. Our results provide a framework for a range of behaviors that may be important in understanding and developing interventions for these states.
Paracococcidioides brasiliensis is the causative agent of paracoccidiomycosis (PCM), the most prevalent systemic mycosis confined to Latin America. In this study, we investigated the role of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in host defense against this opportunistic fungal pathogen. We found that murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells responded to P. brasiliensis yeast infection by releasing IL-1β in a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), caspase-1 and NOD receptor (NLR) member NLR3 dependent manner. P brasiliensis-induced NLR3 inflamome activation was dependent on potassium (K+) efflux, reactive oxygen species production, phagolysosomal acidification and cathepsin release. Using mice lacking IL-1 receptor, we demonstrated that IL-1 signaling has an important role in killing P brasili by murine macrophages.
Toxoplas gondii is a brain-tropic parasite capable of infecting nucleated cells, including astrocytes and neurons in vitro. However, in vivo, Toxoplas is primarily found in neurons. In vitro studies have shown that interferon-γ-stimulated astrocytes, but not neurons, clear intracellular parasites, suggesting that neurons are persistently infected in vivo because they lack the ability to clear intracellular parasites. To test this theory, we used a novel Toxoplas-mouse model capable of marking and tracking cells that interact with parasites, even if interaction is transient. We found that Tooplas shows a strong predilection for interacting with neurons throughout CNS infection. This predction remains in the setting of IF-γ depletion; infection with parasites resistant to the mechanism by which murine astrocytes clear parasites or when directly injected into the brain. These findings, in combination with prior work, suggest that neurons are not incidentally infected but rather Tooplas’s primary in vivo target.
To understand the behavior of cells undergoing lamellipodial motility, we explore a free-boundary model of actin-myosin contractility. The model consists of force-balance and myosin transport equations that account for isotropic contraction proportional to myin density, viscous stresses in the actin network, and constant-strength viscous adhesion. This generates a spatially graded centripetal actin flow, which reinforces contraction via myin redistribution and causes retraction of the lamipodial boundary. Actin protrusion at the boundary counters retraction, and the balance of protrusion and retraction shapes the lamipodium. The model shows that initiation of motility depends on three dimensionless parameters: myosin-dependent contractility, characteristic adhesion length, and rate of actin protrusion. When contractility is sufficiently strong, cells break symmetry and move steadily along straight or circular trajectories, and motility is sensitive to boundary conditions.
Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are a key to understanding biological processes, but experimental methods such as yeast-2-hybrid (YH), tandem affinity purification (T) and high-throughput protein-protein (PI) detection produce large amounts of data with high levels of noise and incompleteness. For example, Y screens have a false positive rate of up to 64% and false negative rate of 43–71%. T experiments have comparable levels of noise. We present a novel method to assess confidence in PI networks from experimental studies. We use it to predict new interactions and guide future experiments. This is the first to use the best model for PI networks, geometric graphs. Our method achieves 85% specificity and 90% sensitivity. We assign confidence to protein-protein interactions in the human PI network from BioGRID. Using our method, we predict 251 interactions in human PI, a significant of which correspond to pairs sharing GO. Moreover, we validate a of our interactions in HPRD and BioGRID.
Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of non-coding CTG repeats in the DMPK1K gene. Recent studies have shown that many genes have antiense transcripts, raising the possibility that human trinucle expansion diseases may be pathogenic due to both sense and anti-sense expanded transcripts. We established a Drosila model for DM1 and tested the role of interactions between expanded CTG and CAG transcripts. These studies revealed dramatically enhanced toxicity in flies co-expressing CT and CAG repeats. Expression of the transcripts led to pathogenesis with generation of dcr-2 and ago-dependent 21-nt repeat-derived siRNAs. These small RNAs targeted expression of C-containing genes such as Ataxin-2 and TATA protein (TBP), which bear C repeats in fly and man. These findings indicate that generation of repeat-derived siRNAs may enhance toxicity in repeat diseases with anti-s transcription.
Soft rot is one of the most devastating bacterial diseases affecting plants worldwide. We present insights into the phylogeny and virulence of the soft rot pathogen Pectobacterium sp. SCC3, which was isolated from a diseased potato in Finland in the 1980s. Genomic approaches, proteome and genome comparisons of sequenced soft bacteria revealed that SCC3, previously classified as Pectacterium carov, can be accurately classified as Pobacter wasiae. The revised phylog of P. carov and increasing studies on.ab indicate that.ab has been present in potato fields worldwide. A combination of genomic and in planta experiments identified features that SCC3 and other.ab strains differ from other soft bacteria, such as the absence of type III secretion contributing to virulence of other soft species. Experimentally established virulence determinants include the putative regulator Sir, two redundant type VI systems and horizontally acquired clusters Vic1 and Vic, containing vir genes. Genome also revealed traits related to life in planta or specific conditions, such as a benzoic/sicylic acid carbox methylase of eukary origin. Our findings indicate that soft bacteria have unknown traits that may be utilized in poorly understood in planta. The genomic comparison of SCC3 to sequenced Pacter strains, including.ab, provides a basis for further investigation of virulence and phy of soft bacteria, and potentially other bacteria.
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of a wide range of human diseases. Mitochondrial proteins are encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). However, little is known about how nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (mtome) change when mtDNA is depleted. This study used network analysis of gene expression data to investigate mtDNA-depleted (ρ) mitochondria. We quantified proteomics data into functional networks and analyzed systemic properties of mt dysfunction. We found that upregulated and downregulated proteins were organized into two subnetworks with distinct biological processes. Downregulated modules were involved in typical mt functions, while upregulated proteins were responsible for mtDNA repair and protein expression transport. Furthermore, proteome and transcriptome comparisons revealed that ρ cells attempted to compensate for mtDNA depletion by modulating protein expression and transport. Our results show that protein composition remodels mt networks in response to dysfunctional states.
Proteins are the building blocks of life and their synthesis is a complex process that involves numerous steps such as association and dissociation, chemical reactions, and mechanical movements. The rates of these steps can be measured in vitro, but not in vivo. Here, we develop a method to deduce in vivo rates from in vitro values. The method has two components. First, we introduce the kinetic distance, a concept to compare kinetics in different environments. The distance depends on rates and can be interpreted in terms of energy. Second, we minimize the distance between in vitro and in vivo, imposing that deduced rates reproduce a global property such as in vivo speed. We apply to protein synthesis by ribosomes, a process of expression. We describe by a cod-specific model with three pathways corresponding to binding cognate, near-cognate and nonognate tRNA. We determine individual rates in vitro and predict in vivo by minimization. We validate rates by independent in vivo data for speeds, dynamics and frequencies.
Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that infects the stomach lining of the human host and causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. The evolution of Helicobacter pylori during infection in a single host and within families is not well understood. In this study, we estimated the short-term mutation and recombination rates of Helicacter pylori by sequencing 39,300 bp in 78 gene fragments from 97 isolates. The isolates included 34 pairs of sequential samples taken at intervals of 0.25 to 10.2 years and 29 single isolates from 10 families. We found that the accumulation of sequence diversity increased with time in a clock-like manner in sequential isolates. We used Approximate Bayesian computation to estimate the rates of mutation, recombination, length of recombination tracts and diversity in tr. The results indicate that the short-term mutation rate is 1.4×10−6 ( isolates ) 4.5×10−6 ( isol ) per nucleotide per year and three times more substitutions are introduced by recombination than by mutation. The long-term rate over millennia is 5–17-fold lower due to removal of non-synonymous mutations by purifying selection.
Melanopsin contributes to irradiance coding in the thalamocortical visual system. Photoreception in the mammalian retina is not restricted to rods and cones but extends to a subset of retinal ganglion cells expressing the photopigment melanin (RGCs). These RGCs are known to drive light responses such as circadian photoentrainment and pupillom movements. We show that RGC projections are more extensive than previously thought and extend to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), origin of thalamortical neurons. This input supports physiological responses in the GN and cortex in mice lacking rods+cones, a model of retinal degeneration. Using chromatic stimuli to isolate melanin-derived responses in mice with an intact system, we reveal melanin to ∼40% of GN neurons show activation to light. Melanin input supports irradiance increases in firing of these neurons. Melanin is required to encode irradiance using melanin knockout mice. Our data establish melanin-based photoreception as a source of input to thalamortical visual, providing irradiance and allowing responses to be retained in absence rods+con.
HIV-1 infection is associated with a profound depletion of mucosal CD4+ T cells, a population that plays a crucial role in regulating the transport of antibodies across the epithelial barrier. We investigated whether this depletion results in altered humoral responses to antigens at mucosal surfaces in HIV-1-infected individuals. A comprehensive analysis of systemic humoral responses to intestinal microbiota revealed reduced IgG responses to antigens from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes but not Bacteroidetes. Importantly, antiretroviral therapy-treated HIV-1-infected individuals exhibited elevated IgM and decreased Ig/Ig and Ig/Ig ratios to a variety of microbial and food antigens. These findings indicate reduced mucosal B cell competence to switch from IgM to other isotypes, limiting their capacity to react to gut antigens. Decreased microbiota-specific Ig and Ig may be an important factor in microbial translocation across the mucosal barrier and systemic dissemination that drives chronic inflammation in HIV-1-infected individuals.
Species populations in ecosystems are often limited by the availability of resources in their environment. This means that the growth of one population needs to be balanced by a comparable reduction in populations of others. In traditional models of biodiversity, all populations are assumed to change incrementally due to births and deaths of individuals. Here, we propose a new mechanism of redistribution driven by a severe reduction in size of the population of a single species freeing resources for others. This mechanism may be relevant for communities of bacteria with strain collapses caused by bacteriophages or other ecosystems where diseases play an important role. The emergent dynamics of the system is characterized by cyclic ‘diversity’ waves triggered by collapses of globally dominating populations. The diversity peaks at the beginning of each wave and decreases exponentially afterwards. Species abundances have bimodal time-aggregated distribution with the peak formed by recently collapsed or newly introduced species and the peak that has not collapsed in the current wave. In waves both peaks are composed of smaller peaks. This self-organized peak has long memory transmitted across waves.
Chemotaxis of Escherichia coli is one of the most thoroughly studied paradigms of simple behavior. Chemaxis confers a significant competitive advantage to bacteria and is expected to be strongly optimized. Bacteria follow gradients by performing temporal comparisons of chemector concentrations along their runs. Concentration differences are detected by a sensory system and transmitted to modulate rotation of flagellar motors, decreasing the probability of tumble and reorientation if the concentration during a run is positive. Such regulation of tumble probability is sufficient to explain chemactic drift of a population up the gradient and is commonly assumed to be only mechanism of chemactic E coli. coli.
Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEs) play a crucial role in establishing tolerance by presenting self-peptides to autoreactive thymocytes and/or thymocytes, diverting them into the regulatory T cell lineage. The NFκB signaling pathway is essential for TE maturation and proliferation in the medullary region. Here, we show that the Stat3 pathway also plays a role in TE development and homeostasis. Expression of a constitutive Stat3 in the TE compartment increases TE cellularity and bypasses the requirement for positively selected thymocytes to drive medull formation. Conversely, deletion of Stat disrupts medull architecture and reduces TE. Stat does not affect TE proliferation, but promotes survival of immature MHCloCDlo TE precursors. In contrast, alterations in TE do not affect cortical cellularity or organization.
Clostridium difficile is an emergent pathogen and the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhea. In an effort to understand the role of noncoding RNAs (RNAs) in C difficile physiology and pathogenesis, we used an in silico approach to identify 511RNA candidates in intergenic and coding regions. In parallel, RNA–seq and 5′- RNA–seq were used to identify C difficileRNAs and their transcription start sites at three growth conditions: exponential phase, stationary, and starvation. This approach identified 251 putative RNAs including 94 transregulators in intergenic, 91antisense RNAs, and riboswitches. Expression of RN was confirmed by gene-specific approaches. Some RN, including antisense may be involved in C autolytic activity showed growth-dependent profiles. Expression of 16 c-diMP riboswitches was observed, and evidence for their role in motility and biofilm formation was obtained. Finally, RN encoded by C difficile CRPR loci were detected. These RN may be important C survival in bacteri-rich gut. Altogether, this identification provides a basis for future characterization and identification of mechanisms regulation in this emergent enterogen.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease and liver cancer worldwide. HCV is known to hijack the host cellular machinery to promote its replication and survival. Here, we show that the HCV core protein downregulates the abundance of miR-122, a liver-specific microRNA essential for liver development and metabolism, by promoting its destabilization via inhibition of GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly ( ) polymerase. The decrease in mi-122 results in dysregulation of its functions, including its proviral activity for HCV. We found that mi-122 is modified at its 3′ end by 3′-terminal nontemplated and templated nucleotide additions. The proportion of mi- bearing a single nucleotide tail decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV. We found that singleucle-tailed mi- display increased mi activity and stability over prototype mi- and the 3-terminal extension is catalyzed by unique nucleotyl transfer activity of GL-2, capable of adding any ribonucle without preference to mi- end. The H core inhibited GL-2 and interaction with GL in cytoplasm was responsible for mi downregulation.
Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans and trypanosomiasis in livestock throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Although various species show evidence of clinical tolerance to trypanosomiasis, there has been no evidence of acquired immunity to natural infections until now. We discovered a distinct decrease in prevalence of T. brucei. infection in wild lions that is consistent with being driven by exposure-dependent increase in cross-immunity following infections with more genetically diverse T. congolense species. The causative agent of human sleeping sickness T. bruce rhodesi disappears by 6 years of age in response to cross-immunity from other trypanosomes including non-pathogenic species T brucei bruce.
The role of mechanistic mathematical modeling and systems in drug development remains uncertain. In this study, mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the hypothesis that mechanistic models of human cascades, despite uncertainty, can be computationally screened for points of fragility and these mechanisms could serve as therapeutic targets. We tested this hypothesis by screening a model of the well-stud coagulation cascade, developed from literature. The model, composed of 92 proteins and 148–protein interactions, was validated using 21 datasets from different in vitro coagulation models. Simulated plate activation and thrombin generation in the presence and absence of anticoagulants were consistent with measured values, with mean 0.87 correlation across trials. Overall sensitivity, which measure robustness fragility a mechanism, were calculated using Monte strategy. In absence anticoagul, and surface factor Xactivated factor (X ) thrombin platelet activation were fragile while IXIX andVIII activation activity robust. Both antiXa and thrombin inhibitors important anticoag classes; example antiX inhibitors have approval for prevention venous thromboemb following surgical and treatment deep venous thromosis pulmonary embol. In vitro and vivo evidence support prediction IXIX activity robust.
Bacteriophage therapy is the use of bacteriophages as antimicrobial agents for the control of pathogenic and other bacteria. Successful application of phage therapy requires a good understanding of the non-linear kinetics ofage–bacteria interactions. Here, we combine experimental and modelling to make a detailed examination of such kinetics for the food-borne pathogen Campylobacteruni and a virulent phage in vitro. We find that ph-insensitive populations C. jej arise, as far as we are aware this is the first phage study to test, in vitro, models ph–bacteria incorporating ph-insensitive bacteria. We find that an apparently simplistic model fits the data well and confirm that so-called inundation and proliferation thresholds are likely of considerable importance to ph therapy. We fit the model to time series to estimate thresholds and rate directly. A comparison of the for each reveals density-dependent features of infectivity worthy of further investigation.
Schistosomias is a devastating disease caused by parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistos that affects over 260 million people worldwide, especially in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Schosomes must undergo larval development within specific snail intermediate hosts, a trait shared among all digenatrematodes. Here, we report the first functional characterization of a snail Toll-like receptor, BTLR, which plays an important role in the immune response of snail Biomphalaria glata following Schistoma mansoni challenge. BTL was identified as part of a screen of snail immune surface proteins that differed in abundance between B. glata sn that differ in compatibility to S. mans. The S mansoni-resistant strain of B. glata ( BS-90 ) displayed higher levels of BTL compared to the susceptible ( M ) strain. Transcript of BTL was very responsive in BS sn when challenged with S, increasing 27 fold relative to β-actin ( non-immune control ) ; expression in susceptible sn was not increased. Knock of BTL in BS via siRNA oligonucleotides resulted in alteration of resistant phenotype, yielding infections in 43% of normally resistant sn, which shed S mansoni cercaria 1-week before susceptible.
Mosquitoes of the species Aedes aegypti and Aedes polensis are major vectors of infectious diseases in French Polynesia. Aedes aegypt transmits dengue chikunya and Zika, while Aedes polensis is the primary vector of Bancroftian filariasis and a secondary vector of arboviruses. However, there is a lack of tools to assess the risk of disease transmission and measure the efficacy of vector control programmes. A promising approach to quantify human-vector contact is through the detection and quantification of antibodies against mosquito saliva proteins. We developed an ELISA test to detect and quantify IgG against salivary gland extracts ( SGE ) of Ae.egypt and Ae.ynensis in human populations exposed to either species. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Tahiti and Moorea where Aeegpt and Aeensis are present, and found that 98% and 68% of individuals had IgG against Aeegpt and AeensisGE, respectively. In contrast, EL tests on a cohort from metropolitan France not exposed to these mosquitoes showed 97% had no Ig against S of either species. Analysis of cohorts from different entomological contexts showed no Ig cross-reactivity between Aeeg and AeGE. The Ig response to saliv gland extracts is a valid biomarker of human exposure to bites of Aeeg and Aeensis. This immuno-epidological tool will enhance understanding of exposure to bites, identify areas of high disease risk and evaluate novel control strategies in Pacific and tropical settings.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a successful pathogen because of its ability to adapt to the intracellular environment of human macrophages. We investigated whether this adaptation requires interference with the host cell’s metabolic machinery. Temporal profiling of metabolic flux in macrophages infected with virulent mycobacterial strains confirmed that this is the case. Subsequent analysis identified a subset of host reactions targeted by mycobacteria. We found that the goal of regulation is to integrate macrophage survival pathways with mycobacterial sustenance. Interestingly, this provided an axis where host and pathogen factors converge to determine pathogenicity.
Crossover recombination and chiasma formation are essential for the proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division in Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that ZHP-3, the C. elegans ortholog of the budding yeast ZIP3 gene, is required for crossover recombination. During meiotic prophase, ZHP-3 protein is highly dynamic, shifting from the length of the synaptonemal complex ( SC ) to an asymmetric localization on the SC and eventually becoming restricted to foci that mark crossover events. A zhp-3::fp transgene complements a null mutation and reveals a separation of function; although the fusion can promote wild-type levels of recombination, aneuploidy among progeny is high, indicating defects in meiotic segregation. The structure of bivalents is perturbed in this mutant, suggesting that the segregation defect results from an inability to properly remodel chromosomes in response to crossovers.
Aedes albopictus is an invasive mosquito species that has colonized temperate regions of Europe and the US in the last few decades and has become a public health concern due to its ability to transmit arboviruses and its aggressive daytime biting behavior. This study investigated the effects of eco-climatic factors on Ae. albictus abundance in metropolitan and sub-urban areas in Rome, Italy, which is one of the most infested metropolitan areas in Southern Europe. Adult mosquitoes were monitored along a 70 km transect across the metropolitan area and two fine spatiotemporal datasets were used to analyze the effect of climatic and socio-environmental variables on Ae. albict abundance. Results showed that Ae. albict is highly associated with anthropized habitats in both metropolitan and sub-urban areas, with “green” islands” corresponding to hot spots of abundance in metropolitan areas and bimodal dynamics with a peak in autumn due to heavy rains and permissive temperatures.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a major virulent pathogen that invades host macrophages early in the course of infection. Phthiocol dimoceros (DIM) are major virulence factors of Mtb that are involved in this process, but their cellular and molecular mechanisms of action are unknown. Here, we show that DIM are required for receptor-mediated phagocytosis of Mtb and prevention of phagosomal acidification. Using Mtb mutants deleted for genes involved in DIM biosynthesis, we demonstrate that DIM are necessary for efficient phagocytosis and prevention of phagos acidification. The effects of DIM require changes in membrane fluidity, as demonstrated by experiments with cholesterol-depleting drugs that abolished differences in phagocyt efficiency and phagos acidification between wild-type and mutant strains. Insertion of a cholesterol probe in living cells shows that the hydrophobic core of the membrane changes upon contact with Mtb, whereas lateral diffusion of cholesterol is unaffected. This effect is dependent on DIM and consistent with observed in model. We propose that DIM control invasion of macroph by M by targeting lipid organisation in host membrane, thereby modifying biophysical properties. The DIM-induced changes in lipid favour efficiency of receptor-mediated phocytosis of M and contribute to control of phagos pH driving bacilli in protective niche.
Neural circuits composed of a small number of neurons are difficult to study with mean-field approximations. These approximations are powerful for large networks, but do not describe small networks well. Many problems in neuroscience involve mesoscopic networks of tens of neurons. However, methods for small networks are rare, preventing progress in understanding dynamics at these scales. We develop a systematic analysis of small networks of homogeneous excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We study bifurcations of activity with an analytically tractable approach and numerically determine global bifurcations. For strong inhibition, networks give complex dynamics through spontaneous symmetry-breaking of neural equations. This is a finite effect of the network, revealing differences between mesoscopic and mean-field. The most important consequence of symmetry is the ability to regulate heterogeneity. This is thought to reduce detrimental effects of noise on cortical processing.
Leishmanias is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania protozoa transmitted by sandflies. The clinical and epidemiological significance of Leish in extralesional sites is obscured by the uncertainty of whether the DNA derives from viable parasites. To examine the dissemination of Leish during disease and the potential of human infection, Leish 7RNA was exploited to estimate viability and parasite burden in extraional sites of dermal leishiasis patients. In this study, the feasibility of discriminating parasite viability by Leish 7RNA was evaluated in relation with luciferase activity of transfected intracellular amastigotes in dose-response cytotoxicity assays. Monocytes, tonsil swabs, and skin aspirates of 28 cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishias patients were screened by DNA amplification/Southern blot. Positive samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR of Leish 7RNA genes and transcripts. Le 7RNA amplification coincided with lucifer activity, confirming parasite viability. Of 22 patients presenting DNA in extraional samples, Leish 7RNA genes or transcripts were detected in one or more DNA samples 100% and 73%, respectively. Gene transcript number from extraional tissues were comparable to lesions. 7RNA were detected in 13/19 ( 68 ) monocytes, 5/12 ( 42 ) tonsil sw, 4/11 ( 36 ) skin aspir, and 22/25 ( 88 ) lesions were quantifiable 15/19 ( 79 ) monocytes 12 ( 92 ) tons sw 8 (73 ) skin.
Chromatin modifications (HMs) and chromatin binding proteins (CBs) are fundamental for the faithful progression of DNA replication in metazoan cells. However, no single HM is strictly indispensable for origin, suggesting that HMs may act combinatorially in analogy to the histone code for transcriptional regulation. Here, we investigated the combinatorial potential of 95 CBs and HMs for predicting DNA replication timing in Drosila using statistical models. We found that combinations of CB exhibit moderate predictive power for replication, while pairwise between HMs lead to accurate genome-wide predictions that can be further improved by CB. Independent importance analyses led to a biologically interpretable model of the relationship between chromatin and replication reaching 80% of full accuracy using six terms. Finally, pairwise HMs predict differential replication across cell types.
Dengue virus is a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions, infecting 390 million people and causing at least 25,000 deaths annually. In Brazil, we investigated the spread of three dengue virus serotypes ( DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 ) by analyzing their complete genome sequences. We found that new lineages of all three serotypes were introduced within 7-10 year intervals. These lineages were most likely introduced from the Caribbean to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, and then dispersed at a rate of approximately 0.5 km/day. Our analysis of evolutionary, epidemiological and ecological data indicates that human and/or mosquito transportation, rather than Aedes aegypti infestation rates or geographical distances, determine dengue spread in Brazil.
Neurons in the brain are not independent of each other but are correlated with each other. These correlations are ubiquitous and have a strong impact on neural coding. We investigated how differences in the antagonistic center-surround receptive field (RF) organization across three sensory maps influence correlations between electrosensory pyramidal neurons. We used a model based on anatomical differences in RF center size and overlap to predict large differences in correlations. However, in vivo electrophysiological recordings showed that electrosensoryram neurons in all three segments displayed nearly identical correlations. To explain this result, we incorporated the effects of RF in our model. By varying the RF surround size relative to the center, we found multiple structures gave similar correlations. Incorporating physiological differences in RF between maps in our model gave similar correlations. Our results show that center alone does not determine correlations, which is important for understanding how structure influences correlated activity.
In this work, we investigate the impact of noise correlations between neurons on the ability of a population of neurons to encode a stimulus. We consider a general setting for population coding, in which allows us to investigate how information varies as a function of noise, while keeping other aspects of the problem, such as tuning curves and heterogeneity, fixed. Our results are summarized in the form of theorems and illustrated with numerical examples involving neurons with diverse tuning curves. We show that if correlations between pairs of neurons have opposite signs to their signal correlations, then coding will improve compared to the independent case. This holds for different metrics of performance and arbitrary levels of heterogeneity. We also show that the sign rule does not provide a necessary condition for good coding, and that a set of correlation structures can improve coding, many of which violate the rule. These correlations are experimentally observed. We prove that optimal correlations must lie on the boundary of the set of possible correlations. Finally, we provide a set of necessary and sufficient conditions under which performance in the presence of noise will be as good as if there were no noise at all.
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus ) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ) co-infections frequently fail to respond to antibiotic treatment, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. The impact of interspecies interactions on S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility is poorly understood. This study demonstrates that P.ugin alters S.us susceptibility to bactericidal antibiotics in a strain-dependent manner and identifies 3 interactions responsible for antagonizing or potentiating antibiotic activity against. aure.ugin Las endopeptase potentiates vancomycin activity by facilitating proton-motive-independent uptake and 2-hepty-4-hydroquinoline Noxide ( HQ ) induces multidrug tolerance through respiratory inhibition and ATP reduction. Production of these factors varies between isolates and corresponds to capacity to alter S.us susceptibility. We demonstrate that vancom treatment of S. aure mouse infection is potentiated by Las-producing Pugin population. These findings demonstrate that susceptibility is complex and dependent on genotype of pathogen and interactions with other microorganisms in environment.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection is associated with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and platelet dysfunction, contributing to complications such as bleeding and plasma leakage. The etiology of deng thrombocytopenia is multifactorial and includes increased platelet clearance. Here, we show that binding of the coagulation protein von Wille factor (VWF) to the platelet membrane and removal of sialic (desialylation) are novel mechanisms of platelet clearance in deng infection. In two cohort studies in Bandung and Jep, Indonesia, patients with deng had higher plasma VWF antigen and active VWF, and platelets bound more V to their membrane. Platelet-VWF correlated with plate count. Sial in deng patients was reduced as assessed by Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA) and Maack amureis lectin II (MAL). Sial on platelet membrane is neuraminid-labile, but deng virus has no neuraminase activity. No neuraminase was present in deng plasma and desial was not found in plasma transferr. Platelet sial was not altered by exposure to DENV nonstructural 1 or cultured DENV. In contrast, VWF binding to glycoprotein 1 on plate using V-activ protein resulted in removal of plate sial by translocation of neuraminase to plate. Neuramin inhibitor oseltiv reduced V-induced platelet desial. Our data show that V binding to plate ineng results in neuramin-mediated plate desial and clearance.
Many genes in the human genome are regulated by bidirectional promoters, which are located between two genes that are transcribed in opposite directions. These promoters are often associated with genes involved in DNA repair and have the potential to contribute to cancer development. We identified the most complete set of human genes regulated by bidirectional promoters using spliced expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) and found that many function as alternative promoters or novel transcripts. We show that bidirectional promoters are highly enriched in genes implicated in cancer, including many in breast and ovarian cancer. This promoter structure is repeated in the genome and could regulate co-expression among groups of genes. We verified regulatory networks among genes controlled by bidirectional promoters using microarray data from 79 human tissues. Some promoters have similar transcription factor binding sites, including conserved ETS sites in ERBB, FCD, and BRCA.
Sex determination in Diptera (flies, including Drosophila melanogaster, is determined by heteromorphic sex chromosomes. However, the karyotypes of Diptera are superficially similar, concealing the extent of sex chromosome variation. We used whole-genome analysis of 37 Dipt species from 22 families to uncover hidden sex kary diversity. We identified over a dozen sex configurations, with the small dot chromosome used as the sex chromosome, presumably the ancestral kary of Dipt. However, we found species with undifferentiated chromosomes, others with the dot replaced as sex or up to three elements incorporated into sex, and others with female heterog ( Z sex ) chromosomes. Transcriptome analysis shows dosage compensation evolved through upregulation of single X in males. X chromosomes show deficiency of genes with male-based expression, possibly sex-specific pressures.
Zika virus (ZIK ) is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen that has been linked to the development of severe fetal abnormalities, including spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, hydranenceph, and microaly. In the United States, ZIK outbreaks have been recorded. Recently, the first congenital ZIK infection in the United States was demonstrated. This study investigated blood samples from mothers who gave birth to babies with microaly and mothers who gave birth to healthy babies in Hawaii between 2009 and 2012. We tested maternal blood for the presence of ZIK IgM and IgG antibodies using commercially available ZIK IgM and IgG ELISA kits. Blood from mothers who delivered babies with microaly tested positive for ZV IgM (16. 6% ) and from mothers tested positive for ZV IgG (50% ). ZV showed a trend with microaly.V IgG positive mothers were more likely to deliver babies with micro than mothers who were negative for IgG (OR = 11., CI =0.–147.9, p.083 ). Similarly, IgM positive mothers were also more likely to deliver babies with micro than mothers who were negative for IgM (OR =.8, CI =.–.195. ).
Mycobacterium ulcer (MU) infection, the causative agent of Buruli ulcer (BU), has been associated with slow-moving water bodies. However, the mode of transmission is still unknown. Ecological studies suggest Variable Number and Repeat (VN) typing as a useful tool to differentiate MU from other Mycobacteria. To determine the genetic relatedness of clinical and environmental isolates, we attempted to source MU infections to specific water bodies by matching VN profiles of MU in human samples to those in the environment. Environmental samples were collected from 10 water bodies in four BU endemic communities in Ashanti, Ghana. Four VN loci in MU99 genome were used to genotype MU environmental isolates and those from 14 confirmed BU patients in the same area. Length polymorphism was confirmed by sequencing. MU was present in three types of water, significantly higher in biofilm. Four genotypes W, X, Y, and Z were typed in both human and environmental samples. Other genotypes were only found in water. An animal was identified with characteristic BU lesion, confirmed MU infection. Our findings suggest patients may have been infected from community water bodies. Further, evidence that small mammals within communities could be susceptible to MU.
Alien species are a major component of human-induced environmental change and their numbers in different areas depend on a combination of anthropogenic and environmental factors. We explore the global drivers of alien bird species richness using an extensive database of alien birds. We demonstrate that the origin and identity of alien birds were largely driven by European (mainly British ) colonialism, but recent introductions are wider, involving more species and countries, driven by economic activity. Globally, alien species richness is highest at mid-latitudes and determined by anthropogenic effects, notably the number of species introduced (colonisation pressure ). Environmental drivers are also important, with native and alien richness strongly positively associated. Our results show colonisation is key to alien richness, areas of high native species are resistant to alien at global, and highlight ongoing threats from species introductions.
Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) is a multi-ZF-box protein that acts as a co-factor for RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription. However, its poor DNA sequence selectivity and ability to form nucleosome-like complexes suggest a more generalized role in chromatin structure. We previously showed that UBF depletion reduced the number of actively transcribed ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, but had little effect on rRNA synthesis or cell proliferation. Here, we show that UBF is essential for embryonic development beyond morula. Conditional deletion in cells reveals that UBF is also essential for rRNA transcription and defines chromatin conformation of both gene and enhancer sequences. Loss of UBF prevents SL/TIFB initiation and recruitment of Rrn/TIF complex. It is accompanied by H3K9me3, histone H1 and HPα, but not de novo methylation. Further, genes retain p-acetyl4 and H2Z, suggesting rRNA can maintain potentially active state. In contrast histone H1 binding is dependent U, suggesting it plays positive role. Unexpected, rRNA arrest does not suppress 5,RNA or snRNA, nor several mRNA implicated ribosome. rRNA activity does not coordinate expression ribogenesis. Loss U also induces formation of large nuclear structure resembling nucleolar body (NPB) of oocytes and embryos. These somatic NPB contain synthesis factors but not with rRNA loci.
Wnt signaling plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and fate specification in metazoans, and its dysregulation underlies the development of the majority of colorectal cancers. The conventional model of Wnt signaling suggests that the secretion and movement of Wnt ligands from their source are essential for long-range patterning in tissues. However, this model was recently challenged by the finding that replacement of wild-type Drosophila Wingless with a membrane-tether form produced viable adults with normal morphology, suggesting that Wnt secretion and movement are dispensable for patter. Here, we tested this principle in the adult intestine, where Wnt gradients coincide with major compartment boundaries. We find that Wingless is required for intestinal development, including regulation of target gene expression, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, epithelial cell specification, muscle differentiation, gut folding, and signaling with the Decapentapic pathway.
Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The ability of GAS to accumulate plas at the cell surface is central to its pathogenesis. However, the role of host plasogen activators in this process is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that ukinase plasogen activator (uPA) contributes to plmin recruitment and invasive disease initiation in vivo. In the absence of host plasogen activators, streokinase (S) was required to facilitate surface plmin acquisition by GAS. However, in the absence of S, host activators were sufficient to promote surface plmin acquisition by GAS during incubation with plasogen or human plasma. GAS also mediated a significant increase in activation of zym pro-uPA in human plasma. To assess the contribution of PA to invasive disease, a transgenic mouse model of infection was employed. C57/BL/6 and AlbG mice expressing human plasogen were more susceptible to invasive disease than PA−/− mice. The decrease in virulence in PA−− mice was found to correlate with decrease in dissemination and reduced surface plmin by GAS.
Helicobacter pylori Exploits a Unique Repertoire of Type IV Secretion System Components for Pilus Assembly at the Bacteria-Host Interface.
Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis group of bacteria. Vaccination of cattle offers a long-term solution for controlling the disease, and development of a vaccine against bTB is a priority. We hypothesized that global gene expression analysis could identify in vitro predictors of protection to facilitate vaccine development. Cattle were vaccinated with BCG or a heterologous BCG adenovirus vectored subunit boosting. Protective efficacy was determined after M bovis challenge. RNA was prepared from P-stimulated PBMC from vaccinated-protected, vaccinated-unprotected and unaccinated control prior to bo challenge. Gene expression was determined by RNAseq. We identified 668 genes differentially expressed in vaccinated-protected compared to vaccinated-unacc and unacc control. Cytokine-cytokine interaction was the most related to this dataset with IL22 identified as dominant besides INFγ. Expression of these genes by RNAseq was evaluated by RTPCR in independent PB samples from BCG vaccinated and unacc. This confirmed importance of IL as predictor of vaccine.
Centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) are found in most differentiated cells, but their role in microtubule organization is largely unknown. We developed a tissue-specific degradation system to test the role of the centrosomal microtub nucleators γ-tulin ring complex (γuRC) and AIR-1/Aurora at the apical MOC, where both localize in Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic intestinal epithelial cells. We found that the core γu component GIP-1/G3 is required to recruit other γu components to the apical MOC, including MT-1/MT1, characterized for the first time in animal. In contrast, AIR-1 and MT were required to recruit γu to centrosome but not centrioles or apical MOC. Surprisingly, microtules remain organized at apical MOC upon γu and AIR-1 depletion and other micro regulators TP-1/2, ZG-9/TO, PTR-1/CAP, NO-1ine. However, loss of G-1 removed a subset E-1 microtules and remaining grew faster.
Many human genomes are diploid, inheriting one set of chromosomes from the father and one homologous set from the mother. However, most sequencing initiatives ignore this fact and do not delineate the nucleotide content of the maternal and paternal copies of the 23 chromosomes ( i. e., do not phase the genome ) because of costs and complexities. We compared 11 approaches to phase human genomes using the GIAB version of the NA78 genome as a standard. The strategies included laboratory assays that prepare DNA to phase and computational approaches that reconstruct from sequencing reads or population haplotype information. We used metrics such as switch rates, haplotype lengths, proportion of phase-resolved genes, phasing accuracy and pairs of SNVs to assess the approaches. A hybrid approach that leverages population phasing, genome sequencing data and haplotype frequencies provides a fast way to produce highly phase-resolved genomes. We found that population phasing performance is enhanced with genome data; e. g. shotgun and RNA sequencing. Inclusion of parental data in phasing can reduce errors by ten-fold. A voting scheme combining multiple predictions enhanced performance and coverage. We identified signatures associated with phasing errors in regions of polymorphism or SNV.
Type-III secretion systems are utilized by Gram-negative pathogens to secrete virulence effectors and structural components of the flagellum from the cytoplasm into host cells. The flagellar type-III secretion system utilizes both the proton motive force and ATP hydrolysis to energize substrate unfolding and translocation. We report the formation of functional flagella in the absence of type-III ATPase activity by increasing the proton motive force and flagellar substrate levels. Additionally, we show that increased proton force bypasses the requirement of the Salmonella pathogenic island 1 vir-associated type-III ATPase for secretion. Our data support the role of type-III ATPases in enhancing secretion efficiency under limited substrate concentrations and reveal the dispensability of ATP activity in type-III export.
Bistability in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a key to many biological functions, including differentiation and cell cycle control. However, establishing GRNs that exhibit bistability is challenging due to the large number of GRNs that exist for a small number of components. We used chemical reaction theory in silico to survey the capacity for bistability of more than 40, 000 simple GRNs formed by transcription factors and their proteins. We find that ∼90% of GR models are bistable, including those without cooperativity commonly associated with bistable systems, and most of which could only be bistable through subnetwork analysis. We sorted GRNs based on presence or absence of reactions and found eleven minimal bistable networks, i. e. bistable without smaller subnetwork. The large number of bistable GRNs suggests bistability arises easily and is not lost through evolution. We integrated protein-protein, protein-DNA, and expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified GRNs predicted bistable.
Mutations in the HYAL2 gene, which encodes hyaluronidase 2, cause a syndrome of orofacial cleft and coratriatum sinister in humans and mice. Orofacial cleft is the most common birth defect, with both genetic and environmental components. Although numerous studies have been undertaken to investigate the complexities of the etiology of this condition, it remains incompletely understood. Here we describe mutations in HY2 as cause of orofacial syndrome. HY2 encodes hyaluronidase, degrading extracellular hyaluron, a component of developing heart and palatal matrix. Transfections demonstrated that mutations destabilize the molecule, dramatically reducing HY2 levels. Consistent with clinical presentation in affected, investigations of2/- mice revealed craniofac abnormalities including subucal cleft. In addition coratri sinister and hearing identified in proportion2 mice were incompletely penetrant features affected.
Inner hair cells in the inner ear are responsible for detecting sound. They have stereocilia that convert sound-induced forces into electrical signals. The tip of the stereocilia is connected to a link that conveys force to transduction channels. Current models suggest the link is composed of protocadherin 15 (PH15 ) at the lower end and cadherin 23 (CD23 ) at the upper end. However, links are subjected to forces throughout life and can be disrupted. Although hair cells can regenerate links and restore hearing, the molecular details of this process are unknown. We developed a method to visualize links and stereocilia using electron microscopy. We show that mechanotransducing links have at least two compositions, either PH/CD or PHPCD. During regeneration, links with equal amounts of PH at both ends appear first. Whole-cell recordings show these links mediate normal mechanotransduction currents but abnormal Ca+-dependent adaptation. The PH/CD link composition is established later, concomitant with adaptation recovery. Our findings provide a mechanism for regeneration and maintenance of mechanensory function in auditory hair cells and could help identify components of mechanotrans machinery.
Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent arbovirus leading to an estimated 100 million symptomatic deng infections every year. It causes a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild deng fever (DF) to more threatening forms such as deng hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The symptoms of DH become evident at the critical phase of infection (5–7 days after onset of fever), yet the mechanisms that trigger transition from DF to DH are not well understood. We performed mass spectrometry metabolomic profiling of sera from adult DF and DH patients at critical and recovery phases of infection. We identified 29 differentially expressed metabolites between DF and DH at the critical phase. These include bile acids, purines, acylcarnines phospholipids and amino acids. Bile acids were up to 5 fold higher among DH compared to DF patients and correlated with higher levels of aspart transamin (AST) and alan transamin (ALT), suggestive of liver injury among DH. Uric acid, most abundant in blood, was 1.5 fold lower among DH compared to DF. This results in decreased capacity of endogenous defense and elevated stress among DH patients. In recovery, eight metabolites were still higher or lower among DH, including chenodeoxycocholic acid, one of bile acids at critical. This indicates prolonged impact on liver due DENV in DH patients.
Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, has a distinct guanosine 5’monophosphate reductase ( GMP ) compared to its mammalian and bacterial counterparts. GMP catalyzes the conversion of guanosine 5’monophosphate ( G ) to inosine 5’monophosphate ( IMP ), a key step in purine nucleotide metabolism. We identified GMP in T. bruce and found it localized to glycosomes in T. bri bloodstream forms. We characterized recombinant T. bruce GMP and found it to have an insertion of cystathion β synthase ( CBS ) domain absent in mammalian and bacterial GMPs. The recombinant T br GMP catalyzed conversion of G to IMP in the presence of NAD and showed affinities for G and NAD different from mammalian Gs. Addition of monovalent cations such as K and NH4 increased T br GMP activity, whereas none mammalian Gs were unaffected. Monophosphate purine analog ribavir inhibited T br GMP, whereas mammalian Gs showed little inhibition.
Voltage-gated sodium channels play a crucial role in controlling electrical excitability in cells and are targeted by drugs to treat conditions such as epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia. To develop next-generation drugs that selectively target one of nine sodium channel types expressed in the body, it is essential to understand how current blockers work. Here, we use the crystal structure of the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NavAb and molecular simulations to elucidate how drugs benzocaine and phenyin bind to the protein and enter the channel. We show that both drugs have two binding sites in the pore characterised by nonspecific hydrophobic interactions: one above the activation gate and at the entrance to the lipid fenestrations. Three independent methods find the same sites and suggest binding to the gate is slightly more favourable than the fenration. Both drugs can pass the fenestr into the lipid with small energy, suggesting this can be the posited hydroobic route for drugs.
MyD signaling in dendritic cells and the intestinal epithelium controls immunity against intestinal infection with Citrobacterium. MyD-mediated signaling downstream of Toll-like receptors and IL-1 receptor is involved in the induction of protective responses against infections. MyD-deficient mice are highly susceptible to a wide range of bacterial infections, but the cell-specific contribution of MyD in protecting against intestinal infection is poorly understood. We employed a novel murine knock-in model for MyD that enables cell-specific reactivation of MyD expression in My-deficient mice. We report that MyD signaling in CD11+ cells is sufficient to activate dendritic cells (DC) and induce group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC) response as well as colonic Th17/Th response to infection with intestinal pathogen Citrobacterium. In contrast, My signaling in other cell types, macrophages (MO), T or IL3 did not induce intestinal responses upon infection. We observed My expression in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) partially protected mice during infection, associated with epithelial integrity and expression of antimicrobial peptideRegγ and acute proteinS1 by epithelial. Together, our data suggest My signaling in DC and IE is essential to induce host responses upon infection with Citrobacter.
Onchocerciasis is targeted for elimination in Africa through annual or biannual iverectin mass drug administration (MDA). An immunodiagnostic test based on the detection of IgG antibodies in the blood to Oncherca volulus-specific antigen Ov16 is one of the tools for determining whether transmission is interrupted and treatment can stop. The relationship between post-M Ov16 antibody prevalence in children 1 year after the last MDA and duration of M, prevalence in the population, and probability onchercias is eventually eliminated is explored through mathematical modelling. The ONOS model was extended with new Ov antibody output. Seroconversion is assumed to be triggered by first worm in host, serconversion either before maturation after maturation or start of mf. We are interested in serconversion in children and ignore possibility serversion to simplify. Yearly M leads to strong reduction in parasite in humans. This reduces serconversion in newborns and children who serconverted before start remain positive. Both microfilaria prevalence in aged 5 and Ov antibody in under 10 declined with increasing M. The association between these indicators and model-predict probability was not influenced by assumed coverage but depend on endemic levels, regarding trigger serconversion and diagnostic ( sensitivity specificity ).
Prions are infectious proteins that can change their properties when propagated in different environments. For example, swainson-sensitive 22 prions became drug-resistant when propagated in PK1 cells in the presence of swain. We propose that prions are quasi-populations comprising a range of variants with different properties, and the fittest are selected in a particular environment. Prion populations are heterogeneous even after cloning, indicating that mutation-like processes occur at the conformation level. Brain-derived 22 prions are naturally swain-resistant, so it was not surprising that pr became swain-sensitive after propagation in cells could revert to resistance. RMLions, both propagated in brain or PK cells, are swain-sensitive, so we investigated whether it was possible to select swain-resistant by propagation in presence of drug. Interestingly, this was not possible with standard PK cells, but certain PK sublines selected swain-resistant, even swain-dependent ( i. e. propagated rapidly in presence drug ). Once established, could be passaged in PK, even absence drug, without swain dependence. Misfolded pr ( Pr ) associated with swain variant was rapidly cleared PK than drug-sensitive counterpart, indicating structural differences misfold Pr underlie prion properties.
Metabolic evolution takes place in a vast space of possible genotypes and phenotypes. The structure of this space defines the evolutionary potential and limitations of an evolving system. Metabolism is one of the most ancient and fundamental systems, sustaining life by extracting energy from extracellular nutrients. Here we study metabolism’s potential for innovation by analyzing an exhaustive genotype-phenotype map for a space of 101 metabolisms that encodes all possible subsets of 51 reactions in central metabolism. Using flux analysis, we predict the viability of these metabolisms on 10 different carbon sources which give 102 potential phenotypes.
Trypanosoma cruz, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is transmitted by triatomine bugs of the Triatoma dimata complex. The genetic diversity and phylogeography of T. dimata haplogroups were analyzed in Mexico and across the Neotropics. Two fragments of the ND4 gene were sequenced to determine haplog specificity. At landscape, regional, and biogeographic scales, T. dimata genetic diversity was lowest where there was greatest anthropic modification, and T cruz infection was highest. cruz prevalence was higher in haplog 1 and 3, lower in haplog 2. DT and DTI frequencies differed in hap 1 and 3, but not in 2. All Neotropical haplog had moderate to high haplotype diversity, greatest differentiation between 1 and 3 ( FST = 0.868, p <.000 ). Divergence from MRCA was 0.97 MY (0.55–1.53 ) and 0.85 MY (.42–1.5 ) for ND4 and concatenated, respectively, with 2 and 3 diverging from MRCA. Effective population size 1 and 2 increased 0.02–.03 MY.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rod-borne disease caused by hantaviruses in China: Hanta virus and Seoul. Environmental factors significantly affect the risk of contractingant infections, primarily through their effects on rodent dynamics and human-rod contact. We aimed to clarify the environmental factors favoring rod-to-human transmission to provide evidence for effective HFR prevention and control. We analyzed 10-year (2006–2015 ) field data on rod hosts for havirus, epidemiological and environmental data from satellite and meteorological stations, and rod-human rates to quantify relationships among environmental, rod species and FR occurrence. The study included 709 HFR cases. Rodent species in Chhou, havirus hotspot comprised Rattus norveicus, musculus, R flavius and others (lose and Microtus fortis calamorum ). Rod species played different roles across land types, all associated with transmission. Some were with FR occurrence in forest and water, norveicus and flavius in grassland, mus and flavi in built. Rod community was associated with environmental variability. Predictive models based on these factors were validated by good fit: cultivated land predicted highest FR incidence accords 201–201.
Activating mutations in codon 12 of the HRAS proto-oncogene are a common cause of Costello syndrome (CS). Mutations in codon 12 are frequent in cancers, but rare in CS, where they are associated with a severe, early lethal phenotype. We report an unusual germline mutation c.35_36GC>T in a 12-year-old boy with attenuated CS. Analysis of HRAS cDNA showed high levels of exon 2 skipping. Using wild and mutant HRAS minigenes, we confirmed c.35_36>T results in exon 2 skipping by disrupting a critical Exonic Splicing Enhancer (SE ) and Exonic Splicing Silencer (SS ). We show that HR exon 2 is vulnerable to splicing due to a weak 3’ splice site, making exon 2 dependent on splicing proteins like SRS. The majority of cancer- and CS causing mutations are located here and affect splicing differently. Our results show that CS and somatic cancers are not only determined by different mutant HRAS potentials but also by exon 2 inclusion efficiency from HR. We show a splice oligonucleotide (SO) that blocks criticalSE causes exon skipping and halts cancer proliferation. This unravels a potential for anti-cancer therapies based on SO-mediated HR exon 2 skipping.
Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) is a key factor in the formation of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation, the most abundant modification of mRNAs. In mammals, the function of MET3 and m6 modification in development is unclear. Here, we show that inactivation of MET3 in the nervous system causes severe developmental defects in the brain. MET3 knockout (KO) mice manifest cerebellar hypoplasia caused by enhanced apoptosis of cerebellar granule cells (CG) in the external granular layer (EGL). MET3 depletion-induced loss of mA causes extended RNA half-lives and aberrant splicing, leading to dysregulation of transcript-wide expression and CG death.
Transcription factors are proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to cis-regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers. In embryonic stem (ES) cells, the binding of transcription factors OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG is essential to maintain the capacity of cells to differentiate into any cell type of the embryo. In this study, we show that combinatorial binding is strongly associated with co-localization of the transcription coactivator Mediator H3Kac and increased expression of nearby genes in ES cells. We observe that loci bound by Oct, Nanog and Sox in ES frequently drive expression in embryonic development. Comparison of mouse and human ES cells shows that less than 5% of individual binding events for OCT, SO2 and NANOG are shared between species. In contrast, about 15% of combinator binding events and 53–63% of combinator binding at enhancers active in early development are conserved.
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is initiated by the AML/ETO oncogenic transcription factor, which is generated by a reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 8 and 21. AML/ETO recruits co-repressor complexes to DNA and interferes with the function of its wild-type counterpart, AML, by targeting AML binding sites. However, A/ETO’s transcriptional regulation probably relies on a more complex network since it interacts with other transcription factors, such as E-proteins, and targets other DNA sites. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling were used to identify A/dependent transcriptional regulation. A/ was found to co-localize with, demonstrating the fusion follows the binding pattern of the wild protein but does not primarily displace it. The binding of E-protein H was grossly rearranged upon A/ expression, and was found to co-local with both and H on many regulated targets. Furthermore, the level of H was increased in primary and cell lines expressing.
In Leishmania donovani is a protozoan parasite that causes leishmaniasis, a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. In this study, we investigated the role of histone acetyltransferase H2 (H2) in cell cycle regulation. We found that H2 is constitutively acetylates histone H4 on lysine10 (H4K10) in vitro and in vivo, and is essential for cell growth and survival. H2-depleted cells displayed cell cycle defects and poor survival in host cells. We found that downregulation of cyclins CY4 and CY9 were responsible for S and G/M phase defects in H2-depleted cells. CY4 and CY9 are coordinately transcribed in polyc units with other genes, but their expression was reduced in H2-de cells without downregulation of other genes in the unit. We found that CY4 and CY9 have their own promoters and are activated in cell cycle-dependent manner. CY4 and CY were transcriptionally activated from their promoters at specific cell stages. This suggests two tiers of regulation: transcription of polyc units initiates at divergent switch regions (dSRs), likely constitutively, and a subset of genes have own promoters, some of which are activated cell cycle-dependent. This second tier is sensitive to H10 acetylation, resulting in downregulation in H-de cells.
Inferring the intentions of others is a fundamental problem in many social transactions. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we applied computational modeling to behavioral data from an economic game in which 16 pairs of volunteers were randomly assigned to “player” or “adviser” roles interacted. The player performed a probabilistic learning task, receiving information about a binary lottery from a visual chart. The adviser, who received more information, issued a recommendation. Critically, the game was structured such that adviser's incentives to provide helpful or misleading information varied in time. Using a meta-Bay modeling, we found that players' behavior was best explained by deployment of hierarchical learning: they inferred adviser's intentions to optimize predictions about advice validity. Volatility also affected trial-by-trial variability: participants were more likely to rely on estimates for choices when believed adviser's intentions were stable. Our model predicted players' interpersonal reactivity ( IRI ) scores, advisers' helpfulness ratings and advisers' self-reports strategy.
Scrub typhus is an endemic in Asia and has traditionally been considered a rural disease. However, indigenous urban cases have been reported in Seoul, the largest city in South Korea. Scrub tyus may have a significant impact because of large population. Scrub tyus was epidemiologically identified in Seoul using national notifiable disease data from 2010 to 201. Patients from one hospital were selected and compared to a control group. Chigger mites were collected in the city and identified using phenic and 18 rDNA analyses. Infection with Orientia tsugushi was confirmed by 56-kDa antigen. Eighty cases of scrub tyus were in Seoul. Sites of infection were mountainous (56.8%), parks (20.5%), vicinity of own residence (17.%) and rivers (5.7%). Eighty chiggerites were collected in Gwan mountain, one of suspected sites in Seoul and seventy-six (87.4%) were identified as Helenula miagawa and eight (9.2%) as Leotridium scell. Pooled DNA from miagites yielded O tsugushi Bong. Twenty-six patients showed low APACHE score (3.4±2.7), low rate (3.%) and no hypalemia.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the HEN1 homolog HENN-1 is involved in the methylation of 3′ ends of small RNAs. This process is part of the RNA interference (RNAi ) pathway, which affects gene activity by recruiting Ago proteins to target mRNAs. Here, we describe the effects of HENN-1 on two RNAi pathways that employ methylated RNAs: the 26 and 21 pathways. We find that in the germline, 21 RNAs are only mildly affected by loss of methylation and introduction of artificial 21 target does not destabilize non-methylated 21 RN. In contrast, most 26 RN display reduced stability and respond to loss of H-1 by increased 3′uridylation. Within 26, we find that ERGO-1-bound 26 are modified by H-, while ALG/AL4-bound 26 are not. Global expression analysis of h- mutants reveals mild effects, including downregulation of gerine-expressed genes. Our data suggest that apart from direct effects on 26 levels, most effects on expression are indirect.
Genomics Meets Glycomics: The First GWAS Study Identifies HNF1α as a Master Regulator of Protein Glycosylation  
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and high-throughput glycomics analysis of 2,705 individuals in three cohorts identified common variants in the Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1α (HNF1α) and fucosyltransferase genes FUT6 and F8 that influence N-glycan levels in human plasma. We show that NFα and its downstream NF4 regulate the expression of fucyltransfer and fucose biosynthesis genes. Moreover, we show NFα is both necessary and sufficient to drive expression of these genes in hepatic cells. These results reveal a new role for NFα as a transcriptional regulator of multiple stages in theucylation.
Centromeres are the points of attachment between the genome and the cytoskeleton, where kinetochores bind to spindles and move chromosomes. Paradoxically, the DNA sequence of centeres has little role in perpetuating kinetocho. We show that RNA transcribed from centeres remains within the kinetoch region and is part of the epigenetic marking system. We carried out a genetic and biochemical study of maize CEN, a key kinetoch protein. We show that DNA binding is conferred by a region of 122 amino acids and is exquisitely sensitive to single-stranded RNA. Long single-stranded nucleic acids promote binding of CEN to DNA, and types of RN that stabilize match size and character of RN present in kineto in vivo. Removal of the module with HIVase domain causes partial delocalization ofEN in vivo.
Genetic variants associated with birth weight (BW), childhood obesity (CO), and body mass index (CBMI) have been identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The placenta plays a critical role in fetal development and postnatal health. We investigated the role of the placental transcriptome and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in mediating the genetic causes of BW, CO, and CBMI, and applied integrative analysis of colocalization and MetaX. GW loci associated with BW, CO, and CBMI were substantially enriched for placental eQTL (6.76, 4.83, and 2.26, respectively). Importantly, compared to eQTL of adult tissues, placental eQ contribute significantly to anthropometric outcomes at birth (BW) and childhood phenotypes (CO/CBMI). Eight and six transcripts colocalized with BW, and CBMI risk loci, respectively. Our study reveals that placental transcription in utero likely plays a role in determining postnatal size, and may hold new possibilities for interventions to prevent childhood obesity.
Kala-azar is a chronic disease caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani and transmitted by the bite of infected sandflies. Kala-azar visceral ( VL ) is the most severe form of the disease, but Kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis ( PKDL ) is a chronic form of the disease that generally does not require much attention. PKDL is relevant in the context of VL elimination. There is no standard guideline for diagnosis and treatment of PKDL. A study was conducted in Malda district, West Bengal, India to determine the disease burden, compare diagnostic tools for PKDL detection and pattern of lesion regression after treatment. PKDL was determined by active surveillance and confirmed by PCR diagnosis. Patients were treated with sodium stibogluconate ( SSG ) or miltefosine and followed for two years to observe lesion regression. Twenty PK cases were detected with a prevalence of 27.5% among leishmanial antibody positive cases. PCR was highly sensitive 88.46% for confirmation. Majority of skin lesions persisted after treatment and disappeared 6–12 months post treatment. Reappearance noted in two cases after 1.5 years milteine treatment. A number of PK patients remained undiagnosed without active surveys. Such surveys are required in other areas to attain VL elimination.
Competence is an inducible program in Streptococcus pneumoniae that enables genetic transformation and horizontal gene transfer. Competence development in liquid cultures is synchronized within the whole population and depends on exported Competence Stimulating Peptide ( CSP ), which generates a positive feedback loop. However, it is unclear how this CSP-dependent population switch is coordinated. We monitored competence in real time during growth of four distinct pneumocococcal lineages and found that competence relies on a self-activated fraction that arises via growth-dependent mechanism. CSP remains bound to cells during this event and competence rate corresponds to propagation between activated and quiescent cells. We validated two-step contact mechanism by measuring development during co-cult of strains altered to produce or respond CSP. Finally, membrane protein Com retains CSP, limiting diffusion in medium.
Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV) is a DNA virus that infects epithelial cells. The L2 protein of HPV acts as a chaper to transport the viral genome (vDNA) from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and eventually to the nucleus, where replication occurs. To reach the nucleus, the L2/DNA complex must cross intracellular membranes. We developed a system based on subcellular compartmentalization of BirA and its substrate to detect translocation of L2 from incoming virions. We find that L translocation requires transport to TGN and is strictly dependent on entry into mitosis, coinciding with mitotic entry in synchronized cells. Cell cycle arrest causes retention of L/DNA at TGN; only release and progression G/M enables translocation across limiting membrane and infection. Microscopy of Ed-labeled vDNA reveals a rapid and dramatic in vDNA localization during mitosis. At G2/earlyphase vgress from TGN to pericent location, accumulating prometaph where it begins to associate with condensed. By metaphase and anaphase v is bound to mitotic, ensuring distribution into daughter. Mutations in defined chromatin binding of L block trans, suggesting trans dependent on chromatin promet. This represents first virus to functionally couple penetration limiting membranes to mitosis, explaining part tropism for mitotic keratinocytes.
Influenza transmission is a major public health problem worldwide. The relative transmissibility of one strain of influenza compared to another is important in three contexts: (1) emergence of antigenically novel strains, (2) pandemic, and (3) emergence of drug-resistant strains due to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs). We present a mathematical framework to estimate the relative transmiss of one strain compared to another using data from competitive experiments in which animals are co-infected with a mixture of two strains. We observe the mixture in each animal over time and multiple generations of transmission. We use data from ferret experiments to demonstrate the approach. The framework also estimates the size of the transmitted inoculum. The transibility of two strains is critical in determining the epidemiology of an outbreak or the impact of an intervention such as NAI. The method has applicability beyond influenza to other viral and bacterial pathogens.
Plants integrate light and abscisic acid ( ABA ) signals to adapt to their environment and survive. We show that BBX21, a B-box protein that regulates seedling photomorphogenesis, is also involved in ABA signaling. BB21 acts upstream of ABA INSENSITIVE ( ABI ) and ELONG HYCOTYL 5 (HY ) in seed germination. HY acts as a direct activator of ABI5 and BB21 interacts with HY. BB21 negatively regulates ABI expression by interfering with HY binding to the ABI promoter. In addition, ABI activates its own expression and BB21 negatively regulates this activity by interacting with ABI. Our study shows that BB21 coordinates with HY and ABI on the ABI promoter and these regulators work together to integrate light and A signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana.
The Mediator is an essential co-regulator of RNA polymerase II that is conserved throughout eukaryotes. In the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans (C. albicans ), we investigated the functions of the Mediator subunits Med31, Med20, and Srb/Med13. We found that C. alb Med shares some roles with the model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( S. cerevisiae ) and Schoscharomyces pombe ( S. pombe ), such as functions in response to certain stresses and the role of Med31 in expression of genes regulated by the activator Ace2. However, C. alb Med also has additional roles in transcription of genes associated with virulence, for example genes related to morphogenesis and families enriched in pathogens, such as adhesins. Consistently, Med31,20, and S9/M13 contribute to virulence attributes of C. alb, filamentation, biofilm formation, and ALS1 is biologically relevant of Med for biofilm development. Furthermore, Med affects virulence of. alb in the infection model. We found that Med and S9/M13 in expression of genes encoding wall adhes are different between S cere and C : are repressors of F genes in S cere are activators of ALS in C. This suggests Med subunits regulate adhesion in a manner between two distantly fungal species.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms are known to be more tolerant to antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts. To understand the degree to which the biofilm state and its genetic determinants contribute to this tolerance, we used genome-wide profiling of a complex Pseudomonas aeruginosa MPA1 biofilm and plankic population with tobramycin to quantify the contribution of each locus to tolerance under these conditions. We identified sets of mutations that contribute to tolerance predominantly in the biofilm or plankic setting, providing insights into the differences and similarities between biofilm and plankic antibiotic tolerance. Our mixed experimental design recapitulated the complexity of natural biofilms and revealed the emergence of quorum-deficient mutants. We found a substantial contribution of the biofilm state to antibiotic tolerance, providing a foundation for novel therapeutics against P. aerugin biofilm infections.
Most biological systems are difficult to analyze due to the multitude of interacting components and concomitant lack of information about the dynamics. Model selection algorithms that evaluate the performance of a multitude of models against experimental data provide a useful tool to identify model structures. However, algorithms addressing complex systems are often compare preselected models or rely on exhaustive searches that might be unfeasible. We developed an algorithm that performs selection on complex systems and searches large spaces in a dynamical way. Our algorithm includes local and non-local methods that prevent ending in local minima by accounting similar processes. We tested and validated on simulated data and showed flexibility handling different structures. We used to analyze experimental data on CD+ and CD+ cells cultured under different conditions. indicated changes within proliferation was reduced in 3D cultures compared to suspension.
In Bolivia, the National Program for Chagas was implemented in 2006 and led to a decrease in the number of Trypanosoma cruzi infections through vector control. Subsequently, treatment with benznidazole ( BN ) was initiated in seropositive school children living in vector control areas. We conducted a 12-month follow-up study with seven blood samples taken before and after treatment. Serology, conventional PCR, and quantitative PCR were performed. Plasma Th1/2/17 cytokines were also determined. Approximately 73% of seropitive children completed BN with three due to side effects. To evaluate treatment efficacy, PCR and PCR values during the final 6 months of follow-up were observed. Among 57 who completed follow, 6 (11% ) showed both PCR and PCR ( ), 24 (42 ) PCR but PCR ( ) and 27 (47 ) PCR and PCR. Within Th1/2/17 cytokines, IL-17 was higher in seritive before treatment compared to age-matched serative and decreased to normal one-year after. Moreover, IL-17 was positively related to parasite counts by PCR. At 12 months, IL-17 of non-reactive were higher than reactive or ambiguous suggesting IL-17 useful to determine BN reactivity.
Neisseria meningitidis, the causative agent of bacterial meningitis, has a genome that is rich in repetitive DNA. Almost 2% of the genome is occupied by a small transposon called Coria. Here we report a bioinformatic analysis of eight subtypes of Coria with four types of ends. Transcriptional analysis using PCR and lacZ reporter revealed that two ends encode strong promoters. The strongest promoter is dictated by polymorphism Y128 at the right end of the element. We highlight examples of elements that drive transcription of adjacent genes and others that express non-coding RNAs. Pairwise comparisons of three meningoccal genomes revealed that more than two-thirds of Coria maintain subtype at any locus. This is due to recombinational switching between elements in a strain. Upon switching, a new subtype is available to spread through population by natural transformation. This may represent a hitherto mechanism for variation in meningococcus. We conclude that strain-to-strain variability of Coria and number of strong promoters by them allows for widespread effects in population. By defining strength of promoters by subtypes Coria, we provide resource for transcription of subtype at locus to be predicted.
Chae and Vel regulate toxin production, virulence, oxidative stress, and development in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostus. Chae and Vel are orthologs of Lae and Ve, which coordinate secondary metabolism and differentiation in response to light in Aspergillus spp. In Cochliobus heterus produces a wealth of secondary metabolites, including the selective toxin Txin, which promotes virulence in maize carrying Texas sterile cytoplasm Tms. Txin production is increased in the dark in wild type ( WT ), whereas Ch1 and Vel mutants are reduced in the dark compared to WT. Correspondingly, expression of Txin biosynthetic To1 is upregulated in the dark in WT, while dark-induced expression is reduced in Ch1 and mutants.xin and To expression are increased in Vel overexpression ( OE ) strains in the dark and in Ch1 strains in light compared to WT. These observations establish Chae and Vel as the first factors to regulate selective toxin production. Virulence of mutants and OE strains is altered on Tms and normal cytoplasm maize, indicating Txin mediated virulence and pathogenicity affected. Deletion Ch or Vel reduces tolerance H2O. Expression CAT, one of three catalase genes, is reduced in Vel mutant. and mutants show decreased hyal growth, asexual sporulation and sterility. Vel OE are sterile while OE are more fertile than WT. Ch and Vel repress expression 8ihydroxynthalene ( DH ) biosynthesis, accordingly, melanization is in mutants and in OE. Thus Ch and Vel positively regulatexin biosynthesis pathogenic virulence, oxidative stress, development, hyal growth and negatively melan biosynthesis asexual.
Bacterial Nav channels have been characterized as functionally asymmetric, but the mechanism of this asymmetry has not been clearly understood. To address this question, we combined non-equilibrium simulation with two-dimensional unperturbed landscapes generated by umbrella sampling and Weighted Histogram Methods for ions traversing the selectivity of bacterial Nav channel. This provided new insight into the mechanism of selective permeation in bacterial channels. Non-equilibrium simulations indicate that two or three extracellular K ions can block the entrance of Nav in the presence of applied forces in inward, but not outward. The block occurs in an unstable minimum of the unpurbed free-energy of K that can be ‘locked in by modest forces. In contrast, Na move favor through as a unit in a “knock” mechanism in both inward and outward, and there is no minimum in two-dimensional free of Na for block.
Rabies is a fatal viral disease that affects the nervous system of mammals. It has two forms: furious and paralytic. In the furious form, the virus spreads rapidly to the brain. In the paralytic form, the virus spreads more slowly. This study compared the two forms in dogs. We measured the amount of rabies virus in the brain, spinal cord, and cerebrum of 5 dogs with furious rabies and 5 with paralytic rabies. We compared the amount of virus in cell bodies and processes. We found that the amount of virus in processes was less than in the paraly form. This was true at all levels of the brain and spinal cord. We also found that the virus spread more slowly in the paraly form. This might be because of differences in how the virus is transported inside cells. This could be because of inflammation, which is greater in the paraly form.
In Drosophila, CTC is a zinc-finger protein that has been studied as an enhancer-blocking factor in vertebrates, but has only recently been characterised in Dophila. To date, only one endogenous CTC binding site has been identified in the Doph genome, the Fab-8 insulator in the Bithax complex ( BX ). We used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis to identify CTC binding sites in representative regions of the D genome, including the 3-M Adh, BX, and Antennedia. CTC binding in vivo enabled us to construct a CTC binding consensus sequence. CTC sites in BX map to known insulators Mc, Fab-6, and Fab8. Other CTC sites correlate with boundaries of regulatory domains, allowing us to locate additional presumptive insulators “-, “, and “. With exception Fab7, our data indicate CTC is associated with all or predicted ins in BX, suggesting functioning involves common C-dependent mechanism.
The binding of a substrate to an enzyme is a fundamental process in biochemistry that often involves conformational changes in the active site to align reactive groups for catalysis and the transition state. The concept of adaptive recognition is well known, but has been poorly characterized at the structural level because of its dynamic nature. Here, we provide a detailed mechanism for the induced process at atomic resolution. We take advantage of a slow, tight inhibitor-enzyme system, actin-peptide deformylase. Crystal structures of the initial and final states were solved, as well as several intermediates captured during the process. Lig-induced reshaping of the hydrophobic pocket drives closure of the site, which is finally “zipped” by additional interactions. Together with biochemical analyses, these allow a reconstruction of the sequence from the complex to the state of the enzyme. The entire process can be extrapolated to catalysis.
Although the thalamus is the primary gateway that relays sensory information to the cerebral cortex, the influence of cortical feedback on thal relay remains largely ignored during sensory processing. Using dynamic-clamp techniques in thal slices, we combined theoretical and experimental approaches to implement a hybrid retinothalocort pathway. Cortical input was mimicked through injection of a stochastic mixture of excitatory and inhibitory conductances, resulting in a gradable level of afferent activity in thal cells. We studied the impact of cortical input on retocort signal efficiency and found a novel mechanism resulting from thal relay resonance. Transfer of sensory input depends on three features: i ) number of thalamocort cells, ii ) corticothal synaptic statistics and iii ) correlation between thal relay cells. Counterintuitively, retort efficiency increases when correlation between thal cells decreases. This suggests relay efficiency could be amplified when cells are desynchronized by cortical feedback.
Demethylase NMAD-1 plays a critical role in regulating DNA replication and repair during meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans. Mutations in the nmad-1 gene result in reduced fertility and defects in prophase I of meiosis, leading to reduced embryo production and increased incidence of males due to defective chromosomal segregation. In nmad-1 mutant worms show disorganization of chromatin at the leptotene and zygot stages, mislocalization of the cohesin complex at diplot and diakinesis, and improper chromosome condensation or loss by diakinesis. RNA sequencing of nmad-1 germline reveals induction of DNA damage and repair genes during meiosis, coupled with delayed replication, impaired repair, and apoptosis of maturing oocytes.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that can cause serious diseases in newborns and immunocompromised patients. The virus has a large genome with enormous coding potential and is equipped with complex glycoproteins that can infect a wide range of human cells. Despite multiple cellular interactions with viral glycoproteins, the mechanism of CMV infection remains a mystery. Here, we report the identification of adipocyte plasma-associated protein (AAP) as a novel modulator in the early stage of CMV infection. AAP is necessary for CMV infection in epithelial cells and fibroblasts; knockdown of AAP expression significantly reduced CMV infection in these cells. Interestingly, ectopic expression of AAP in cells refractory to CMV infection, such as MDCK and NIH/3T3, promoted CMV infection. Furthermore, reduction in viral early (IE) gene transcription at 6 post infection and delayed translocation of tegument pp65 at 4 post were detected in AAP-deficient but not wildtype cells. These results suggest AAP plays a role in early CMV infection. Biochemical studies of AAP and CM proteins suggest AAP could participate CM infection through interaction with g/g containing glycoprotein at pH and mediate translocation tegument pp.
Lineage commitment of hematopoietic progenitors is a complex process that involves both instructive and stochastic events. We propose a model that combines cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic elements to understand how these events inform commitment decisions. Our model suggests that cytokine-mediated receptor upregulation can induce a switch-like response to external stimuli during multilineage differentiation, providing robustness to bipotent and committed states while protecting progenitors from noise-induced decommitment. The model supports both instructive and stochastic theories of commitment: cell fates are driven by lineage-specific transcription factors, but cytokine signaling can bias commitment by regulating inherently noisy cellate decisions with complex behaviors such as ligand ultrasensitivity and multistability. Simulations show that differentiation kinetics to a mature state depend on progenitor as well as commitment route chosen. Our model agrees with lineage receptor kinetics from microarray experiments and provides a framework for both classical and alternative commitment in hematies observed.
Orthobunavirus is a genus of emerging viruses within the Bunyaviridae family that poses a threat to human and animal health. Despite its importance, little is known about its structure, which is essential for understanding virus assembly and entry. Here, we report the ultrastructure of Bunyamwera virus, the prototype member of this genus, using cryo-electron microscopy. Bunamwavirus virions are pleomorphic in shape but display a locally ordered lattice of glycoprotein spikes. Each spike protrudes 18 nm from the membrane and becomes disordered upon introduction to an acidic environment. Using subtomography, we derived a three-dimensional model of the trimeric glycoprotein spike at 3 nm resolution. The glycoprotein consists of putative class-II fusion glycop and exhibits a tripod-like arrangement. Protein-protein contacts occur at membrane-proximal and intra-spike at membrane-dist regions. This trimer deviates from previously observed glyprotein arrangements suggesting a greater repertoire of viral glyprotein oligomerization.
Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide. The anterior chamber depth (ACD) is a key anatomical risk factor for PG. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 5,308 individuals of Asian descent to discover genes associated with PG. We found a genome-wide significant association with a variant in the ABCC5 gene (rs199). This variant was associated with an increased risk of PG in a separate case-control study of 4,276 PG cases and 18,801 controls (OR=1.13, 95%CI:1.06–1.22, P=0.00046). The association was strengthened when a subgroup of controls with open angles were included in the analysis (OR=1.30, P=7.45×10−3, 3,458 vs.3,831). Our findings suggest that increased PG risk could be mediated by genetic variants influencing anterior dimensions.
Although deuterostomes and protomes are two distinct animal clades, they share a common developmental toolkit of conserved transcription factors and signaling pathways. Previous studies have shown that patterning genes show similar expression and genetic interactions, suggesting a conserved regulatory apparatus. However, previous studies have found no sequence conservation between deuteromes and protomes. Here we describe the first enhancers conserved between deuteromes and protomes, which we call bilater conserved regulatory elements ( Bico ). Bico show conservation of sequence and gene synteny and conservation of Bico reflects conserved patterns of transcription factor binding. We predict that Bico act as response elements to signaling and show thatico are developmental enhancers that drive expression of transcription repressors in vertebrate nervous system.
Influenza virus diversity and antigenic drift have been well characterized on a global scale, but the factors that influence the virus’ rapid evolution within hosts are less clear. We used next generation sequencing of patient-derived viruses from a randomized, placebo-controlled vaccine trial to characterize the diversity of influenza A virus and define the impact of vaccine-induced immunity within populations. We used pre-hemagglutination and neuraminid inhibition titers to quantify vaccine immunity and assess its impact on intrah populations. We identified 166 cases of H3N influenza over 3 seasons and 511 person-years. We obtained genome data for 119 samples and used a stringent empirically validated pipeline to identify intrah single nucleotide variants ≥1%. Phylogen analysis of hemaglut and neuramin sequences showed no stratification by pre-HAI and Niter, respectively. We found that most intrah nucleotide variants were rare and few were found more than one individual. Most samples had fewer than 15 nucleotide across the genome and diversity did not vary by sampling day, vaccination status, or pre titer.
Leishmanias (VL) is a severe disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. There is no effective vaccine against VL for any age group. Previously, we showed that genetically modified live attenuated L. donani (LC- ) induced a strong protective immune response in young mice. In this study, we analyzed LC- mediated immune response in aged (18 months ) and young (2 months ) mice. LC- infected bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDC) from young and aged mice showed enhanced innate effector responses and CD4+ Th cell function compared to LWT BMDC in vitro. Parasitized splenic dendritic cells from LC- infected young and aged mice induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-, IL-6, IF-γ and TN ) and down-regulated anti-inflammatory IL-10 compared LWT mice. LC- immunized young and aged mice displayed higher IgG2 antibodies, lymphoproliferative response, pro-inflammatory cytokines and splenocytes leishicidal activity with nitric production. Upon virulent. donani challenge, LC- immunized mice from both groups displayed multifunctional Th-type CD and cytotoxic CD T cells correlating reduced parasite burden in spleen and liver compared naïve. Interestingly, LC- induced response in dendritic cells was similar between aged and young; however, adaptive T and B cell activation in aged was reduced compared young correlating less protection in old compared young.
Enteroviruses (EVs) are a diverse group of viruses that cause a wide range of human pathologies. Despite their genetic similarities, EVs have different biophysical properties, such as acid sensitivity, optimal growth temperature, and tissue tropism, which determine their ability to replicate in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract and are key to their virulence. To understand the cause of these differences, we generated chimeras at the capsid level between EV-D68, a respiratory EV and EV-D94, an enteric EV. Some chimeras were nonfunctional, but constructs with the capsid 2 protease of EV94 and caps of EV68 were viable. Using the latter, we performed several assays which indicated that caps proteins determine acid sensitivity and tropism in cell lines in respiratory, intestinal and neural tissues. Additionally, caps genes were shown to participate in determining optimal growth since EV94 adapted to temperature with mutations in VP1 while constructs with EV68 caps could not adapt to higher temperatures. Finally, we show that EV68 retains binding capacity after acid treatment despite loss of infectivity. In contrast, nonstructural proteins modulate the immune response in tissues.
Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein gEI is a transmembrane receptor found on the surface of infected cells and virions that binds human immunoglobulin G (Ig). gI can also participate in antibody bridging (ABB), a process by which antigen-binding fragments (Fab) of Ig bind viral antigen while Fc binds to gI.IgFc binds gI at basic, not acidic pH, suggesting Ig bound extracellular by surface gI would dissociate and degraded in acidic endosomes/lysosomes ifocytosed. We developed an in vitro system for ABB and investigated trafficking of ABB using 4-D confocal imaging of complexes with transferrin epidermal growth factor, characterized intracellular markers. Our data showed cells expressing gI and viral HSV-1 endocyted antiIg and in gI-dependent, resulting lysosomal localization.
Cysticercosis (CH) is a parasitic disease caused by the larval stages of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus that affects humans and domestic animals worldwide. The protoscoleces (Ps) are a component of the larval stages that interact with both definitive and intermediate hosts. Previous genomic and transcriptomic studies have provided an overall view of the parasite’s genome and development. However, how Ps subvert the host immune response and maintain metabolic adaptation remains unclear. This study used Roche 454 sequencing and in silico analysis to explore the transcriptome of Ps from E. granus and elucidate the functions of excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs) released by the parasite. A large number of non-redundant sequences were generated (26, 514), of which 22,910 (86. 4%) were mapped to the published E. granus genome and 17,705 (66.8%) were within coding sequence (CDS) regions. Of 2,280Ps predicted from the transcript, 138 were involved in carbohydrate metabolism and 124 in protein metabolism. Eleven were intracellular enzymes regulating glycolysis/glucone (GL) pathways and 44 antigenic proteins, molecular chaperones and proteases were highly represented. Many were also enriched in development-related pathways such as TGFβ and insulin. This study provides valuable information on parasite adaptation to hosts that can be used to develop novel targets for hydat treatment and control.
In Aspergillus nidulans, the transcription of nitrate assimilatory genes is regulated by the pathway-specific transcription factor NirA. In the absence of nitrate, NirA is predominantly cytosolic and inactive. However, in the presence of nitrate, NirA accumulates in the nucleus and is transcriptionally active. We found that in the absence of nit, NirA is oxidized at methion 169 in the nuclear export sequence ( NES ) to methion sulfoxide ( Metox ). This oxidation is dependent on Fmo, a flav-containing monooxygenase that uses methion and cystine as substrates, but not glutathione. The function of Fmo cannot be replaced by alternative F proteins present in A. nidans. In the presence of nitrate, Nir-Metox is rapidly reduced to Met169. This reduction is independent of thiorexin and classical methion sulfox reductases. Replacement of Met169 byoleucine, a sterically similar but not oxidizable residue, leads to partial loss of Nir activity and insensitivity to Fmo-mediated export. In contrast, replacement by alanine transforms Nir into a permanently nuclear active factor. Co-immoprecipitation and subcellular studies show that Met oxidation leads to Nir conformational change.
Voltage-gated sodium channels are essential for the propagation of action potentials in excitable cells. Since the 1950s, mathematical models by Hodgkin and Hux have suggested that sodium channel properties need to be tightly constrained for an action potential to propagate. However, there are nine mammalian genes encoding voltage-gated sodium channels, many of which are more than 90% identical in sequence. This similarity presumably corresponds to similarity of function, consistent with the idea that these properties are tightly constrained. However, the multiplicity of genes encoding channels raises the question: why there are so many? We demonstrate that the simplest constraints on sodium channel diversity—requirements of excitability and uniqueness of resting potential—directly constrain sodium properties. We compare these constraints with data on mammalian channel properties collected from the literature, including 172 sets of measurements from 40 publications, wild-type and mutant, under a variety of conditions. The data from all channels, including mutants, obeys the excitability constraint; on the other hand, channels in muscle tend to obey the constraint of resting, while in neuronal do not. Excitability alone distinguishes channels into four groups consistent with phylogen analysis.
Influenza virus polymerase is an attractive target for antiviral drugs as it can stop viral replication at an early stage. Recent studies on the heterotrimeric polymer, comprising subunits PA, PB1 and PB2, allow for a structure-based approach to optimise inhibitors of replication. The unique cap-snatching mechanism of transcription can be inhibited by targeting the PB cap-binding or endonuc domains. Here we describe high resolution X-ray coystal structures of the 2009 H1N1 PA enduc domain with a series of specific inhibitors, including diketo compounds and green tea catechin, which chelate two manganese ions in the active site.
Snakes are estimated to cause 1.8 million envenomings and 94,000 deaths annually, mostly in tropical countries. Specific antivenoms are the only effective therapy for these cases. Efforts are made to produce effective, affordable antiven for victims. The immunization process, rarely described in detail, is a step to be rigorously studied, especially regarding production of polyspecific antisera. The aim of this study was to produce polyspecific antisera against medically important Thai and neighboring snakes, namely Cryptelytrops alabris “White lipped viper”, Caloselasma rhodoma “Malayan viper”, and Dabo siensis “Russ’s viper”. Four horses were immunized with mixture of 3 venoms using “low dose, low multi-site” immunization protocol. Antisera showed rapid rise in ELISA titers against 3 venoms and plateau at 8 week post-immun. In vivo neutralization potency of antis against CA, CR, DS ven was 10.40, 2.42 0.76 mg/ml, higher than minimal limits by Queen Savab Memorial ( QI ). Corresponding values for QI monospecific antis against CA, DS ven were 7.28 3.12 1.50/ml. Polyspecific antis also neutralized procoagulant, hemorrh, necrotoxic activities of venoms.
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium causes systemic infections that can persist for long periods of time despite a strong immune response. The bacteria can be transmitted to naïve hosts via the feces of chronically infected animals. We show that the effector protein Sse, translocated into host cells by the Salmonella Pathogenic Island 2 ( SPI ) type III secretion system, is required for Salmonella to maintain long-term systemic infection in mice. In vitro, S inhibits normal migration of primary macrophages and dendritic cells ( DC ) and requires the IQ motif containing GTPase protein 1 ( IQAP ), a regulator of cell migration. S binds IQAP and co-localizes with this factor at the cell periphery. The C-terminal of S is similar to PM/ToxA, a toxin with a cysteine residue critical for activity. Mutation of the corresponding in S eliminates S function in vitro and in vivo but not IQAP binding. Infection with wild-type S suppressed DC migration to spleen in S-dependent. Correspondingly, examination of spleens from infected with S revealed fewer DC and CD+ lymphocytes compared to infected Δ S.
Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is a highly virulent pathogen that causes severe disease in healthy individuals and is more virulent than hospital-associated methicillin-resistant Staphlococcus aureus (HA-MRSA). The molecular basis for the high virulence of CA-MRSA is not known. Here we report that the product of the psmec gene, located in the mobile genetic element SCCmec of HA-MRSA but not CA-MRSA, suppresses the expression of phenol-sol-soluble modulin α (PSMα), a cytolytic toxin of S. aureus. We show that psmec RNA inhibits translation of the agr gene encoding a transcription factor for PSα via specific binding to agr mRNA. Furthermore, 25% of 325 clinical MRSA isolates had a mutation in psmec that attenuated transcription and 9% had no psmec. Most of these psm-mutated or psmec-deleted HA-MRSA had increased PSα expression compared to strains carrying psmec and some produced high amounts of PSα comparable to CA-MRSA. Deletion of psm from HA-MRSA carrying psmec increased expression of Agr and PSα and virulence in mice. Thus p RNA suppresses MRSA virulence via inhibition of Agr translation and absence of p in CARSA causes high virulence.
Severe deng is a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. Epidemiological studies have shown that babies born to deng immune mothers are at risk of developing severe disease upon primary infection with heterolog or homolog deng virus (DENV) serotype. This has been explained by the antibody-mediated disease (ADE) phenomenon, whereby heterolog antibodies bind to but fail to neutralize homolog DENV, allowing F-receptor mediated entry of virus-antibody complexes into cells. This results in enhanced replication and inflammatory responses. Here, we report a mouse model of ADE in type I interferon (IFN)-deficient mice. We show that 5-week-old IFN-deficient mice born to DENV-immune mothers succumbed to D2 infection within 4 days that was lethal in mice born naïve mothers. Clinical manifestations included extensive hepatocyte vacuolation, moderate vascular leakage, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Anti-TNF therapy protected mice and correlated with healthy hepatocytes. In contrast, IL-6 did not impact titers or outcome. This model may help dissect ADE mechanisms and evaluate vaccine/therapeutic candidates.
Visceral Leishias in the Americas: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  
   Visceraliasis is a disease caused by Leishmania parasites transmitted by sandflies. Despite more than 30 years of urbanization, little is known about the factors associated with its occurrence. This study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of factors associated with Leishmanias in humans in the Americas. Fifty-one studies were reviewed after searching databases, reference lists, and expert consultations. Meta-analysis was used to pool information about each variable. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed with Q and I2 statistic. Male sex was associated with visceral leishias in studies using leishman skin test and clinical outcome, but opposite with serological diagnosis. Young were less frequently infected than adults but more prone to illness. Presence of dogs at home, higher seropositivity nearby, lower socioeconomic status, and vegetated areas were associated with Leish. This was not for presence of chickens and nutritional status.
Inhalation of Francisella tularensis (Ft) causes acute and fatal pneumonia. The lung environment favors Ft replication, but the mechanisms of acute pathogenesis and lethality remain unknown. In contrast to overwhelming bacterial burden or cytokine production, an innate cellular response to Ft drives pathology and host mortality. Leth infection with Ft elicits medullary and extra-medullary myopoiesis supporting large numbers of immature myeloid and MDSCs to the lungs. These fail to mature and lead to necrotic lung damage, loss of function and death partially dependent on Ly6+ cells. Acceleration of this process may account for rapid lethality with FtS4. In contrast, sub-lethal infection Ft the cellular response is characterized by mature neutrophils and monocytes required for protection, suggesting a threshold for lethal infection. Further eliciting mature phagocyte provides transient but dramatic protection against Ft4. This study reveals the nature of myoid response may be primary determinant of mortality versus survival following Francis infection.
Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, is an invasive vector of medically important arboviruses such as chikungunya ( CHV ), deng ( DENV ) and Zika ( ZIK ). We reconstructed the colonization pattern of this species using classical genetics and Approximate Bayesian Computation ( ABC ) to infer the demographic history of populations in Southeast Asia and recently colonized areas. In Southeast Asia, we found low differentiation and high coancestry among China, Thailand and Japan, indicating high connectivity and a common origin. China is the oldest population. Outside Asia, invasion in Réunion, America and the Mediterranean is supported by chaotic propagule distribution, maintaining high diversity in adventive populations. Our data suggest independent transcontinental introductions of Ae. albictus may have established adventive populations through admixture of unrelated genomes. Intra-population variability has been detected, likely extending to mechanisms controlling vector competence. In the context of invasion, ancestry and admixture may create conditions for efficient arvirus transmission and outbreak.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes chronic and acute infections in humans. While much is known about acute pathogenesis, little is known about chronic infections. We sought to identify genes and functions that mediate fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic wounds. We found that clinical isolates from human chronic wounds were frequently defective in virulence functions and biofilm formation, and that virulence and biofilm genes were not required for fitness in experimental wounds. In contrast, genes involved in anaerobic growth, metabolic and energy, and membrane integrity were critical. These findings are consistent with fitness of some impaired mutants being represented by anaobic, oxidative, and membrane-stressed conditions ex vivo and comprehensively by high-density growth in the absence of a host.
Hydrocele is the most common manifestation of bancroftian filariasis, a disease endemic in 80 countries. In a prospective study, we evaluated the occurrence of intrascrot lymphangiectasia, appearance/consistency of test, and efficacy of complete excision hydrocele sac in patients living bancroian filasis endemic who underwent hydrolectomy at the Center for Teaching, Research Tertiary Referral for Bancroian Filasis ( NEF ). A total 968 patients with uni or bilateral hydrocele ( Group-1 ) and Comparison (CG ) of 218 patients from same area already undergone hydrocele-sparing hydrolect elsewhere were enrolled at NEF. Twenty patients from Comparison with hydrocele were reoperated at NEF constitute Group-2. In Group-1 total 128 hydrolectomies were performed ( mean age 30.3yr and follow 8.6yr [5–12] ). hydro recurrence in Group and Comparison ( age 31.5 ) were 0.3% and 19.% respectively (0.001 ) There was no recurrence Group ( age 25.1 and follow 6yr [–6.9 ]. surgically leaking or leakone dilated lymphatic vessels were in inner or outer hydro wall or surrounding tissue particularly retroicular in 30.9 and 46% patients Group and respectively (0.081. test were abnormal shape, volume in 203/128 (18% ) and 10/28 (35.7 ) patients Group and respectively (0.025.
Trichinella spiralis is a zoonotic nematode parasite that causes trichlosis, a disease found on all continents except Antarctica. During chronic infection, T. spir larvae infect skeletal muscle cells, severely disrupting their differentiation. To identify deubitinating enzymes ( DUBs ) in T. spir larvae, we used an activity-based probe, HA-Ub-V. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation identified a number of Ds. Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to LC/MS, yielding peptides with homology to conserved Ds: UCH5, U3, HAP, OT 6 and Atin-3. The gene encoding putative UCH5 homologue, Ts37, was cloned and recombinant protein expressed and purified. Deubitinating activity was verified by Ub-AM assay. Coipitation of recomant Ts37 showed association with putative T proteome components, including yeastpn hom ADR1. In addition, inhibitor LD-44 exhibited specific inhibition of recomant Ts37 and reduced viability of cultured larvae. This study reports the first TUB, a cystine protease orthologous to human UCH5.
Cysteine protease cruzain is a validated target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of Chagas disease, a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. In this study, we report the anti-tryosomal activity of a series of nitrile-based cystine protease inhibitors against the CLner strain of T. cruzi. The compounds were based on scaffolds known to be associated with cathepsin inhibition, a different from cruzain, the recombinant form of cruzain. The compounds showed anti-tryosomal activity in the 0. 1–1 μM range, with the two most potent compounds having EC50 values of 0.12 μM and 0.25M. These values were an order of magnitude lower than the Ki measured against cruzain in an enzyme assay, suggesting that anti-tryosomal activity may not be solely due to cruzain inhibition. This implies a putative polypharmac profile towards cystine proteases.
Maize (Zea mays) is one of the most important cereal crops and a model for the study of genetics and evolution. To better understand maize genome organization, we constructed a sequence-fingerprinted contig-based map that covers 93. 5% of the genome, of which 86.1% is aligned to genetic map. The fingerprint contig map contains 25,908 genic markers that enabled to align nearly 73% of maize genome to rice. The pattern of expressed sequence tags correlates to recombination in linear, 1 kb in rice corresponds to average 3.2 in maize, yet maize has 6-fold genome size. This can be explained by fact that most regions correspond two in maize as result of recent polyploid. Inversions account majority of chromosome variations during subsequent maize diploid. We find clear evidence of ancient duplication predating divergence of maize and rice progenitors.
Prions are infectious agents responsible for transmissible spong encephalopathies. They are composed of a misfolded version of the prion protein (PrPSc) that replicates in the body in the absence of nucleic acids by inducing misfolding of the cellular prion protein (Pr. The most common form of human prion disease is sporadic, which appears to originate from a low frequency of spontaneous misfolding to generate the first PrSc particle that propagates in the form of the disease. This study aimed to mimic the early etiology of sporadic disease by de novo generation of infectious PrSc in vitro. We analyzed the possibility of spontaneous generation of PrSc by protein misfolding amplification (PM) procedure. Under standard PM conditions, de novo generation of PrSc was not observed. However, we report that PM can generate PrSc in the absence of pre-existing PrSc in different species at a low rate. De novo PrSc was infectious when inoculated into hamsters, producing a new disease with clinical, neuropathological and biochemical features.
Bees are able to estimate their angular velocity (AV) during flight by using visual information from their compound eyes. We present a novel neural model for estimating AV in the bee brain that quantitatively reproduces experimental observations of visual odometry and corridor-centering in free-flying honeybees. The model is based on electrophysiological data and tested using behavioural data. We suggest that AV can be considered an extension of the optomotor response. The model is tested behaviourally in silico with the corridor-center paradigm, where bees navigate a corridor with gratings ( square or sinusoidal ) on the walls. When combined with an existing flight algorithm, the model reproduces the invariance of the flight path to the frequency and contrast of the gratings, including deviations from centering behaviour found in real bees. In addition, the response of the model to distance along the corridor is constant for a range of grating frequencies, demonstrating it can be used as visual odometer.
Trypanosoma brucei gambense, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), has long been considered invariably fatal. However, we report on a 15-year follow-up of 50 patients from the Ivory Coast who refused treatment after diagnosis. Among 11 who continued to refuse treatment, parasite clearance was observed using microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 10/11 subjects. These patients also displayed decreasing serological responses to trypanosome antigens (Li 1. 3, 1.5 and 1.6). In addition to the classic lethal outcome of African trypanosomiasis, we show two alternative progressions: (1) aparasitemic and asymptomatic infection with long-lasting serological responses and (2) spontaneous resolution with negative parasitological and PCR results and decreasing antibody titres.
Irradiation Selects for p53-Deficient Hematopoietic Progenitors: Identification and characterization of mutations that drive cancer evolution is a major focus of cancer research. The effects of irradiation are not limited to genetic loci that encode oncogenes and tumor suppressors, as irradiation induces a multitude of changes in cells and their microenvironment that could affect the effects of oncogenic mutations. p53 is a key tumor suppressor, loss of which provides resistance to multiple genotoxic stimuli, including irradiation. We hypothesized that increased p53-deficient cells contribute to the link between irradiation and induction of lymphoid malignancies. We sought to determine whether ion irradiation selects p-deficient hematopoietic progenitors in vivo using mouse models. We found that p53 disruption does not provide a selective advantage in unstressed hematopoietic or previously irradiated BM allowed to recover from irradi. In contrast, irradiation p53 confers a selective advantage, leading to long-term p-deficient clones and increased lymphoma. Selection for p-def cells is attributable to several factors: protection from irradi-induced ablation of progenitors, prevention of irradi-induced loss clonogenic capacity for progenitors, improved maintenance progenitor fitness, and elimination of p wild-type progenitors.
Schistosoma mansoni SmKI-1 serine protease inhibitor binds to elastase and impairs neutrophil function. Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic flatworm that causes schistosomiasis in humans. SchosmKI-1 is a serine protease inhibitor that plays a role in parasite development and inflammation. SchKI-1 inhibits trypsin and neutrophil elastase ( NE ), an enzyme involved in inflammation and tissue injury. The KIz domain of SmKI binds to NE active site and blocks its activity. SmKI-1 also inhibits the capacity of NE to kill schistosomes. We knocked down SmKI-1 in S. mansoni larvae and observed a robust impact on parasite development in vitro and in vivo. We tested SmKI-1 in murine models of inflammatory diseases. In acetaminophen ( AP )-mediated liver damage, SmKI reduced neutrophil recruitment and elastase activity. In gout arthritis, SmKI reduced neutil accumulation, IL-β secretion, hyperiception, and pathological score. Finally, SmKI inhibited neutil recruitment in response to carrageenan.
Transmembrane helical (TM) proteins are a diverse group of proteins that perform a wide range of critical functions in the cell, but their high-resolution structures are largely uncharacterized. This is due to the lack of close structural homologues. We present a novel method for modeling TM protein structures from distant homologues with distinct TM conformations. We applied this method to the adenosine A2A and chemokine CX4 receptors and ranked first in the GPCRDOCK prediction contest in the receptor category. In a benchmark of 50 TM protein pairs with diverse topology (5–12 helices ), size (183–420 residues ) and sequence identity (15–70% ), our method improves starting templates and achieves near-atomic accuracy in membrane-embedded regions. Unlike starting templates, our models are suitable for computer-based engineering: redesigned and X-ray structures exhibit similar native interactions.
Listeria monocytogenes causes listeriosis, a foodborne disease that poses serious risks to fetuses, newborns and immunocomised adults. This intracellular pathogen proliferates in the host cytos and exploits the actin polymerization machinery to spread cell-to-cell and disseminate the host. Here, we report that during several days of infection in human hepatocytes or trophlast cells, L monocogen switches from active lifestyle to stage of persistence in vacoles. Upon cell spread, bacteria stopped producing actin nucleating protein Act and became in lysosome vacoles termed Lister-Containing Vacoles (Lis ). Subpopulations bacteria resisted inLis and entered slow-replicative state. During subculture of cells harboringLis, bacteria showed capacity cycle between vacolar and act-based motility.
Perceptual alternations between integrated and segregated percepts of an ABA triplets are studied using a neuromechanistic modeling and psychoacoustic experiments. The model comprises neuronal units with sensory dependent inputs that mimic the pulsatile responses to tones in A-BA triplets and embodies a computation for percept competition in primary auditory cortex (A1). Mutual inhibition, adaptation, and noise are implemented. Slow NMDA recurrent excitation for temporal memory enables linkage across sound from one triplet to the next. Percepts are identified in the firing patterns of the units. We predict that manipulations of the frequency difference between A and B should affect the durations of the stronger percept, the dominant larger fraction of time, than the weaker—a property that has been established and generalized across visual paradigms. We confirm the prediction with psychoac experiments and use behavioral data to constrain and improve the model, achieving agreement between experimental and results.
Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic worm that causes schistosomiasis, a major public health problem in developing countries. Parasite-specific IgE is thought to correlate with protection against S. mansoni infection and re-infection. However, few molecular targets of the IgE response in S. mansoni infection have been characterised. To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of anti-parasite immunity, we need to characterise S. mans allergens. This has implications for our understanding of allergy and the development of safe and efficacious vaccines against helmin parasites. Here, we describe a medium- to high-throughput workflow to translate S. mans proteins using wheat germate and assess potential allergity with humanised Ratophil Leukemia (RSAT8) reporter cell line. The method is based on cell-free translation within 90 minutes, generating sufficient amounts of paras protein for rapid screening of allergity without purification. Antigen integrity is demonstrated using Western blot. After incubation with individuals' serum, the RS8 reporter line is challenged with wheat translation mixture and luciferase activity measured, reporting cellular activation by suspected allergen. This method is suitable for characterisation of novel S mans allergens using well characterised and paras allergens such as Par 2, SmAL-1 and IgE factorSE/alpha-1 expressed in germate or E coli. coli. SmAL-1, but not SmAL2 used as negative, was able to activate reporter line. This method is accessible for assessment of allergity of helmin vaccine candidates and suitable for medium to high-throughput studies using individual sera. It is also for study of basis of allergity helmin proteins.
Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements that proliferate during sexual reproduction, leading to rapid divergence between species. In hybrid dysgenic syndromes, a form of genomic incompatibility arises when TE abundance differs between parents. When TEs inherited from the father are absent in the mother’s genome, they become activated in progeny, causing germline damage and sterility. In Drosophila, dysgenesis occurs when paternal TEs are not matched with corresponding silencing PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) provided by the female germl. We used D. virilis hybrid dysgenesis as a model to characterize effects of TE divergence between parents on offspring. We show that TE divergence is associated with persisting germline expression in genetically identical females of reciprocal crosses, transmitted to the next generation. Chronic TE expression coincides with increased levels of genicpiRNAs associated with reduced expression. Gene expression is idiosratically influenced by differences in genicRNA of parents through polymorphic TE insertions.
Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXT) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5′UTR of the FMR1 gene. The CG repeat is thought to induce RNA toxicity and FXT patients have elevated F1 mRNA levels. Despite the critical role of F1 in disease pathogenesis, the basis for increased F1 expression is unknown. We show that overexpression of histone deacetylases (HD3, 6, or 11) suppresses CG repeat-induced neurodegeneration in a Drosophila FXT model. This is due to selective repression of the CG repeat-containing transgene. We found increased acetylation of histones at the F1 locus in patient lymphoblasts and fibrobls compared to control FX-derived lines. This correlates with elevated F1 expression in patient lines. Histone acetylase (H) inhibitors repress F1 to control levels in patient lines and extend CG repeat-expressing Dophila lifespan.
Host genetics play a critical role in controlling CD8 T cell function and immunopathology during chronic viral infection. CD8 T cells are essential for controlling chronic viral infections, but the host factors that contribute to the maintenance of effector CD8 T responses versus CD T cell exhaustion during chronic infection are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the impact of MHC heterogeneity versus non-MHC host genetics on the establishment of chronic viral infection. We infected F1 hybrids of B10. D2 x B6 ( DBF1 ) and BAL. B x BAL/c ( BCF ) mice with the clone-13 ( Cl-13 ) strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCV ). Following Cl-13 infection, both H-2xdB DB1 and BCF mice demonstrated increased viral control compared to homozygous mice. Strikingly, H-2xdB DB1 on C57 genetic background exhibited mortality following Cl-13 infection. CD T depletion prevented mortality in Cl-13-infected DB1 mice, indicating mortality was CD T-dependent. DB1 mice maintained CD T effector cytokine production and exhibited reduced expression of T exhaustion marker PD. In addition, DB mice induced larger T response than BCF and Cl-13 mortality in DB mice was dependent on T-mediated IF-γ production. Thus, following chronic infection, increased functionality of T response allowed rapid viral clearance at cost of immunology dependent on M diversity and host genetic background.
Anthrax is a re-emerging zoonotic disease endemic in China, especially in rural regions. This study describes the general characteristics of human anthrax outbreaks in northwestern China from 199 to 201 and the genetic characteristics of Bacillus anthracis isolated from 199 to 201. Using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and multilocus-number tandem repeat (MLVA) analysis with 15 markers, five sublineages/subgroups were detected: A. Br. 001, A. Br. Voll, A. Aust, A. Ames, and A. Br 009. All subgroups were found in Xinjiang, one in Shaanxi, two Gans, three Qinghai, and four Inner Mongolia. However, the distribution of B. anthrac populations exhibited different SNP characteristics from strains before 199 in China. In contrast, A. Ames was also observed in Inner Mongolia to other provinces. All strains were assigned 36 MLVA genotypes, 21 of which were first observed in this study. Anthrax in recent decade were classified subgroups A. Br.001 and A. Ames MLVA-, ML-, ML-, ML-, MLCH, MLCH and MLCH. By SNP and MLVA, MLVA genotypes and distribution of B anthrac populations is becoming balanced northwestern China.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a food and waterborne pathogen that causes severe diarrheal disease by attaching to the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and colonizing the intestinal luminal surface. The host relies on immune-mediated changes in IE, including goblet cells to defend against these pathogens. These changes include a CD+ T-dependent increase in IE proliferation to replace infected IE, as well as altered production of the goblet-derived mucin Muc and goblet mediator REist-Like Molecule (REL)β. REL- is strongly induced in gob cells during infection and detected in stool as well as serum, but its role in host defense is unclear. REL-deficient mice (Retl-/-) were orally infected with EC and showed modestly elevated EC burdens, but increased mortality and mucosal ulcer due to pathogen penetration of colonic crypts. Immunostaining for Ki67 and BrdU revealed Ret- mice were impaired in infection-induced IE proliferation. Interestingly, REL did not directly increase IE proliferation, rather acted as CD+ T chemoattract. Ret- mice showed impaired CD+ cell to infected colons, along with reduced interleukin (IL-), a multifunctional cytokine that increased IE. Enema of REL to Ret- restored CD+ cell, concurrently IL levels and IE, while mucosal pathology.
Noroviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that cause gastroenteritis in humans. Noriruses do not have a 5 mG cap nor an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), so they use an unusual mechanism to initiate protein synthesis that relies on interactions between the VP protein attached to the 5- end of the viral RNA and eukary initiation factors (IFs) in the host. In murine norirus (MNV), we previously showed that VP binds to the middle fragment of IF4G (residues 652–113). We used pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to show that a stretch of ~20 amino acids at the C terminus of MN VP mediates direct and specific binding to the HE-1 domain within the fragment of IFG. Our analysis reveals that the MN C termin binds IF-1 via a motif that is conserved in all noriruses. Mutagenic mapping suggests the MN VP C termin may interact IF in a helical conformation. NMR spectroscopy was used to define the VP binding site on IF-1, which was confirmed by mutagen and binding assays. We found this site is non-overlapping with the site IF on IF1 by demonstrating norirus VP can form ternary VP-IF-IF complexes. The significance of VP-IF was shown by the ability of proteins containing the C-terminal of MN VP to inhibit in vitro translation of norirus but not cap or I-dependent.
The evolution of gene clusters in bacterial genomes is a phenomenon where genes encoding proteins in a common pathway are found near each other on the chromosome. Several explanations have been proposed to account for this, including natural selection and the selfish operon model. The selfish operon model suggests that clustered genes are more likely to be transferred to other species, thus improving the cluster’s prospects for survival. The persistence model proposes that genes in close proximity are less likely to be disrupted by deletions. We develop computational models to study the conditions under which gene clusters can evolve. First, we re-implement the selfish operon model and run it under a wide range of conditions. Second, we introduce a Moran process with natural selection for clustering and rearrangement by inversion. Finally, we develop a model with selection and inversion, tracking rearrangements. Surprisingly, clusters fail to evolve under a wide range of conditions. Factors that promote evolution include a low number of genes in the pathway, high population size, and selfish model, high transfer rate.
Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for malaria, causes significant morbidity and mortality in tropical regions of the world. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to severe consequences of infection due to parasite-infected erythrocytes adhesion in the placenta. This adhesion is mediated by PfEMP1, a parasite-encoded, hyper-variable antigen on the surface of infected erythrocytes. VARCS, a variant of Pf1, binds to chondroit sulfate on syncyotrophoblasts in the intervillous space of placenta. VARCS is only expressed in the presence of placenta, suggesting its expression is repressed in men or non-pregnant women. However, the mechanism of repression is not understood. We show that the gene encoding VARCS contains a small open reading frame that represses translation of mRNA, revealing a novel form of regulation in malaria parasites. This mechanism is reversible, allowing high levels of protein upon selection, potentially enabling parasites to upregulate this antigen in appropriate host tissue.
Infection with deng virus (DENV) leads to a spectrum of disease outcomes, and the pathophysiology of severe versus non-severe manifestations of DENV may be driven by host responses. We conducted genome-wide microarray analysis of blood RNA from 34 DENV-infected children in Nicaragua on days 3–6 of illness with different disease manifestations. We identified genes that are differentially regulated between clinical subgroups. The most striking differences were between DENV patients with and without shock, especially in expression of mitochondrial proteins associated with biosynthesis. In DENV hemorrhagic patients, a subset differentially expressed genes encode neutrophil-derived anti-microbial peptides with innate immunity. By meta-analysis of our dataset with previously published, DENV in vivo is associated with changes to protein and nucleic metabolism. In vitro leads to increased interferon signature, not observed in patient samples, suggesting transient interferon in vivo by days 3– of illness.
Herpesviruses are a group of pathogens that cause a wide range of diseases and are difficult to clear from the host. Entry of herpesviruses into the host is an important target for control of infection. While herpesviruses have been extensively studied in vitro, how they cross mucous epithelia in vivo is unclear. Here, we studied entry of Murid Herpesvirus-4 ( MuHV-4 ), a lymphotropic herpesvirus related to Kaposi’s Sarcoma Herpesvirus. Mu-4 virions spontaneously targeted the olfactory epithelium. Like herpesviruses, Mu-4 binds heparan sulfate ( HS ), and virions unable to bind HS showed poor entry. The respiratory epithelium expressed only basolateral HS and bound poorly incoming virions, but the epithelium also displayed apical HS on neuronal cilia and bound strongly. Incoming vir tracked the neuronalilia and either infected neurons or reached the microvilli of adjacent glial ( sustacular ) cells and infected. Thus the olfactory epithelium provides an important site of HS-dependent herpesvirus entry.
Salmonella enterica invasion of epithelial cells requires the expression of genes in the pathogenicity island SPI-1 (SPI-1). SPI-1 expression is tightly regulated and only activated under specific conditions. Here, we describe a new regulatory circuit involving CRP, a metabolic regulator, silencing SPI-1 under non-permissive conditions. CRP-deficient strains show strong upregulation of SPI-1 in mid-logarithmic phase. Genetic analysis reveals CR modulates the level of Hil, master regulator of Salmonella invasion. This occurs post-transcriptionally and requires a newly identified motif within hil 3’UTR. CR also represses Hfq-dependent sRNA Spot42. When repression is relieved, Spot42 exerts positive effect on Hil. In vivo and in vitro assays indicate Spot42 targets hil 3’R hil transcript.
Huntington’s disease (HD) and myotonic dystrophy 1 are caused by the expansion of CAG/CT repeats. These expansions are unstable in somatic tissues, which accelerates disease progression. We investigated the relationship between CAG instability, chromatin structure and transcription at the HD locus using R/1 and R2 transgenic mice. These mice express a similar transgene, integrated at different sites and recapitulate HD-specific instability. We show that instability is increased in R2 tissues compared to R1 samples. High transgene expression and chromatin accessibility correlate with increased CAG instability in R2. transgene and H3K trimylation at HD were increased whereas H3 dimethylation in R2 tissues relative R1. However, transgene and histone levels were similar in striatum and cerebellum, showing different C instability irrespective of line. Interestingly, elongating RNA II at HD but not initiating RNA II were tissue-specific and correlated CAG levels. H3 trimylation associated with transcription was increased at HD in striatum not cerebellum. Our data support that transcription modulates somatic CAG in vivo. Transcription elongation is tissue-dependent and contributes to tissue-selective C instability.
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the most virulent enteroviruses, but the molecular features that enhance its ability to disseminate in humans remain unknown. We analyzed the genomic features of EV71 in immunocompromised patients with disseminated disease according to different sites of infection. We compared five full-length sequenced genomes from respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous, and blood specimens and found three nucleotide changes occurred within five days: a non-conservative amino change in VP1 within the BC loop (LR), considered an immunogenic and important in poliovirus host; a amino substitution in protein2 (38) ; and a silent in protein3 (175). Infectious clones were constructed using BrCr (A) and clinical (C) backgrounds containing one or both mutations. In vitro tropism and competition assays revealed the VP197Le to Arg substitution within BC conferred replicative advantage in SHY5Y neuroblast cells. Interestingly, this was associated in vitro with second nonervative (167 or167) in VP EF in neuroblast cells.
Streptococcus species are Gram-positive bacteria that can take up extracellular DNA through a process called natural transformation, which allows them to acquire new traits such as antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity. This process is regulated by quorum sensing ( QS ) mediated by peptide pherones. One such system, ComRS, consists of a peptide Com that is processed to XIP, secreted and imported into the cytoplasm where it binds ComR. Com then activates a positive feedback loop for Com and SigX expression. ComRS are present in most Streptoc species but ComS and XIP sequences diverge, suggesting species-specific communication. To study cross-talk between Streptoc species in competence, we undertook an interdisciplinary approach. We developed an assay to measure Com activity in response to cognate and heterologous XIP in vivo, revealing strict, intermediate, and promiscuous specificity among species. We solved the X-ray structure of Com from S suis to understand interaction with X and search for structural features in Com that explain X recognition. We probed the X-binding pocket by site-directed mutagenesis in test cultures and biochemically in vitro. Our results provide a model for X recognition and allow prediction of novel X peptides that induce Com activity.
In eukaryotes, centromes are maintained at specific chromosomal sites over many generations. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, centes are genetic elements defined by DNA that is both necessary and sufficient for function, whereas in most eukaryotes centes are maintained by epigenetic mechanisms in which DNA has less role. Here, we use the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans as model to study DNA properties of centric DNA. We determine the genome-wide replication program of C. alb genome and discover that each centere is associated with origin that fires first on respective chromosome. Importantly, epigen formation of new centere ( neocere ) is accompanied by shifts in timing such that neere becomes first and associated with origin complex (OR) components. Furthermore, changing level of centere-specific histone isoform leads to conitant change of OR with centere regions, supporting that centere determine origin activity. Finally, centere-associated DNA reveals replication pattern of constitutively active origins. This pattern is conserved with centere, among strains and species, in manner of DNA. Thus, inheritance centere is correlated with constitutively origin that fires early.
Back pain is the most common cause of years lived disability worldwide, yet little is known about the underlying biology. We conducted a genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) meta-analysis of back pain ( CB ) in adults of European ancestry from 15 cohorts in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE ) and the UK Biob interim release. CB cases were those reporting back pain for ≥3–6 months, non-cases included as “controls”. Each cohort genotyped using commercially available arrays followed by imputation. GW used logistic models with genetic, age, sex, study-specific covariates, and substructure. The genome-wide significance threshold was p<5×10−8. Suggest (p<10−7 ) and genome (p<10−8 ) were carried forward for replication in UKob participants not in the sample. The sample comprised 158,025, including 29, CB cases. Genome-wide association was found for intronic rs105 in SOX (1.08, =7×10−10 ). This was replicated in 283, UKob not in the sample,50, cases (1.06 =5×−11 ) and exceeded genome-wide meta (1.07 =4×−19 ). We found associations three loci in the sample, two genome-wide meta: intergenic rs between CC and GSD (1.05 =4−13 ) and intronic rs in D (0.97 =2−10 )
Taenia solium cysticosis is an important zoonosis in many developing countries. In Cameroon, neurocystercosis is an important cause of epilepsy. However, it is largely underreported and there is a lack of data on the disease. This study was undertaken to calculate the impact of this zoonosis. Both cost and Disability Adjusted Life Year ( DAL ) estimations were applied. Parameters were collected and imported in software. Based on a prevalence of 3. 6%, the number of people with neuroystercosis-associated epilepsy was estimated at 50, 326 ( 95% CR 37,299–65, 924 ), representing 1.0% of the population. The number of pigs with cysticosis was estimated at 15,961 ( 95 CR 12,320–20,044 ), corresponding to 5.6% of the pig population. The total costs of T. solium cystosis in Cameroon were estimated at 10,255,202 Euro (95 889,048–14,754,044 ), with 4.7% due to losses in pig husbandry and 95.3 to direct and indirect losses by cystosis. The burden per case was Euro (95 147–253 ). The number of DALs lost was 9.0 per thousand per year (95 2.–.8–20.4 ) This study provides an estimation of the costs of T. solium cystosis using country-specific parameters and the burden of the zoon disease.
Staphylococcus aureus is a human commensal pathogen that produces a number of noncoding RNAs with poorly understood functions. Here, we demonstrate that the noncoding RNA Rsa represses the synthesis of the global transcriptional regulator Mgr by forming an imperfect duplex with the Shine-Dalgarn sequence and loop interaction within the coding region of the target mRNA. These recognition sites are required for repression. Consequently, Rsa causes enhanced biofilm formation and decreased capsule synthesis in several backgrounds. These phenotypes lead to decreased susceptibility to opsonophagoc killing by polymonuclear leukocytes compared to mutant strains lacking Rsa. In animal models, Rsa attenuates the severity of acute infections and enhances chronic catheter infections. Rsa is part of a regulatory network that contributes to S. aureus interactions with the host to moderate invasiveness and chronic infections. This is the first example of a conserved RNA in S. aureus functioning as a virulence suppressor of acute infections. Because S aureus is a commensal, we propose Rsa has been positively selected through evolution to support commensal and saprophytic interactions with the host.
HIV-1 uncoating is a critical step in the life cycle of HIV-1 infection, where the viral capsid is disassembled in the host cells. Here we report a novel strategy to visualize HIV-1 unating using a fluorescently tagged form of the caps-binding protein cyclophilin A ( Cyp-DRed ). Cyp-D is packaged into virions through high-avid binding to the capsid ( CA ) and remains associated with cores after viral membrane permeabilization. In vitro and in cells, C-D and CA are lost conitantly from cores. The rate of loss is modulated by core stability and accelerated upon reverse transcription initiation. We show that most cores lose C-D shortly after fusion, while a small fraction remains intact for hours. Single particle tracking at late post-infection reveals gradual loss of-D dependent on reverse transcription. Unating occurs both in cytoplasm and nuclear.
Oligonucle usage in archaeal and bacterial genomes can be linked to a number of properties, including codon usage, DNA-stacking, and structural conformation. We assessed the statistical potential of DNAword-sizes and how oligonucle frequencies differ in coding and nonoding regions. Oligonucle frequencies were used to investigate DNA composition and sequence change within and between proary organisms. We found that proary chromosomes can be described by hexonucle frequencies, suggesting proary DNA is predominantly short correlated, i. e., information in pro genomes is encoded in oligonides. Oligon usage varied more in AT-rich and host-associated genomes than GC and freeiving genomes, and this was mainly in nonoding. Bias in tetranucle usage correlated with GC, and regions were more than nonoding. Nonoding were found to be 5. 5 more AT-rich than regions, on average, in chromosomes examined. Pron compositional differences were found within and between AT and GC genomes. GC genomes were more similar in terms tetranucle nonoding than AT genomes. Differences between AT and GC may be attributed, since tetranucle within host-associated was, on average more and less than freeiving.
Meiotic recombination is a process that ensures the correct segregation of homologous chromosomes during gamete formation and contributes to DNA diversity through both large reciprocal crossovers and localised gene events, also known as noncrosso. While considerable progress has been made in understanding factors such as PRDM and variants that influence the initiation of recombination at human hotspots, little is known about factors acting downstream. To address this, we simultaneously analysed both types of recombinant in sperm at six highly active hotspots and looked for disparity in transmission of allelic variants indicative of cis-acting influences. We identified a novel form of biased transmission that is exclusive to the noncrossover class of recombin, which arises through differences between crosso and nonrosso heterodup formation and biased repair. This form of biased conversion does not influence hotspot activity as noted for SNPs that recombination initiation, but constitutes a powerful previously undetected source of recombination meiotic drive that may affect thousands of hotspots throughout the genome.
Many environmental chemicals and drugs can have negative effects on human health. To better understand the mechanisms of action of these compounds, it is necessary to determine the risk. We present a high-confidence protein-protein association network that integrates toxicology and systems biology. This computational model reveals uncharacterized connections between compounds and diseases, predicting which may be risk factors for health. The network can also be used to identify unexpected associations between chemicals and proteins. Examples are shown for chemicals associated with breast cancer, lung cancer and necrosis, and potential targets for diethylhexylphthalate, 2, 3, 8-tetrachloribenzo-p-diox, pirix acid and permethrin. These associations are supported by recent studies.
In the primary auditory cortex, neurons can be characterized by their spectrotemporal receptive fields, the dependence of their response on the spectral and temporal features of a sound. However, these fields do not capture the fact that the response of a neuron results from the complex network in which it is embedded. By fitting a nonlinear feedforward network ( receptive field ) to cortical responses to natural sounds, we show that primary cortical neurons are sensitive to a larger spectrotemporal domain than seen in their standard fields. Furthermore, the receptive, a parsimonious network of 1–7 subfields that interact nonlinearly, better predicts responses to auditory stimuli than standard fields. The receptive reveals excitatory and inhibitory subfields with different properties and interaction of the sub gives rise to operations such as gain and conjunctive detection. The conjunct effects where respond if several features are present enable selectivity for complex structures and constitute an important in sound recognition.
Circadian rhythms in mammals are generated by transcription-translation feedback loops of clock genes that drive the rhythmic expression of the transcriptome and allow the organism to anticipate the day. We show that casein kinase 2 (CK)-mediated phosphorylation of BMAL1 at serine 90 (BM1-P) plays a pivotal role in central and peripheral clocks. Using a novel CK inhibitor, we show that CK-mediated phosphorylation of BM1 is inhibited by CRY. Co-immunoprecipitation and real-time monitoring of protein-protein interactions show that C-mediated binding of CKβ to BM1 inhibits CKα-mediated phosphorylation of BM1. The FAD domain of C1, C-terminal BM1 domains, and BM1 lysine 537 acetylation/deacetylation by CLOCK/SIRT are critical for C-mediated BM1–CKβ binding. Recipally, BM1 phosphorylation is prerequisite for BM1 lysine 537 acetylation. We propose a negative feedback model in which C-dependent CK-driven posttranslational BM1–BM loop is part of the core oscillator.
Salmonella enterica adapts to survive in the presence of bile by employing multiple mechanisms. Bile salts disrupt bacterial membranes, denature proteins, and damage DNA, but the bacterium adapts to lethal concentrations of sodium deoxycholate ( DOC ). Adaptation is associated with changes in gene expression, including upregulation of the Rpo-dependent stress response and other stress responses. The role of the stress response in adaptation to bile is supported by the observation that Rpo mutants are sensitive to bile. While adaptation involves a response by the population, individual cells can become resistant to bile without adaptation: plating a non-adapt Salmonella culture on medium containing lethal DOC yields resistant colonies at frequencies of 10−6 to 10−7 per cell generation. Fluctuation analysis indicates such colonies derive from resistant cells present in the culture. A fraction of isolates are stable, indicating resistance can be acquired by mutation. Full sequencing of resistant mutants shows alteration of lipopolysaccharide transport is a cause of mutational resistance. However, selection on DOC also provides resistant isolates that are not mutants. We propose such derive from cells whose physiological state permitted survival upon DOC. This is supported by single cell analysis of expression using a microscope: batch of Salmonella contain stress genes in absence DOC.
Prophage Mu is organized as a stable chromosomal domain in E. coli. coli. The E. coli chromosome is compacted into 400–500 supercoiled domains by both active and passive mechanisms, such as transcription and DNA-protein association. We find that prophage Mu is organized as a stable domain bounded by the proximal location of Mu termini L and R, which are 37 kbp apart on the genome. The formation/maintenance of the Mu domain is dependent on strong gyrase site ( S ) at the center of Mu, Mu end MuB protein, and E coli proteins IH, F and H. The domain was observed at two different chromosomal locations. By contrast, prophage does not form an independent domain. The establishment/maintenance of Mu was promoted by low-level transcription from phage promoters, one of which was domain dependent. We propose that domain confers transposition to Mu by topological requirements of reaction and proximity of ends.
Primaquine (PQ) is the only licensed antimalarial that prevents Plasmodium vivax (Pv) relapses and also clears Plasium falciparum (Pf) gamocytes, thereby reducing postreatment transmission. This study investigated the effect of PQ on Pv and Pf gamocyte carriage after radical cure in a randomized treatment-reinfection cohort in Papua New Guan children. Children received radical cure with Chloroquine, Artemether-Lumeftrine plus PQ or placebo. Blood samples were collected 2-4 weekly over 8 months. Pv and Pf gamocytes were detected by reverse transcriptionPCR targeting pvs and pfs. PQ reduced Pv gamocyte incidence by 73%, comparable to PQ effect on blood-stage infections. 92% Pv and 79% Pf gamocyte infections were asymptomatic. Pv gamocyte positivity and density were associated with high-stage parasite densities. Multivariate analysis revealed Pv and Pf gamocytes were reduced in mixed-species compared single-species infections (ORv 0.39 [0.25–0.62]ORf 0.33 [0–.18.60]p<0.001). No difference between PQ and placebo was observed in Pv gamocyte density or Pv infections that carried gamocytes. First-stage infections after placebo likely caused reling hypnoite were equally gamet than first PQ infections likely by infective bite. Pv and rel new infections had similar gametaemia. Relapses contribute to Pv reservoir highlighting importance of anti-hypnoite for Pv control.
The Rho GTPases are a family of proteins that play a central role in cellular processes such as cell migration, cytokinesis, and endocytosis by regulating actin organization. Although Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 have different effects on actin remodeling, they share a common mechanism of targeting the plasma membrane and activation by GTP binding. We developed a computational framework to analyze experimental data for these systems, revealing details of GTP cycling between the membrane and cytosol. This analysis distinguishes between GDI-dependent and -independent mechanisms, including vesicle trafficking and association/dissociation of Gase with membrane molecules. We found that Rac has a lower affinity for RacGTP than RacDP due to faster dissociation from the membrane. Non-steady-state solutions for membrane Gase are presented in multidimensional charts. This methodology is used to analyze Rac cycling in pancreatic β-cells, illustrating the effects of Gs/Gs and affinities between Gases and membrane/GDI on membranease.
Schistosomiasis monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programmes are used to collect data to assess the impact of interventions and progress towards the World Health Organization (WHO) goals of morbidity control and elimination as a public health problem for schosomiasis. Prevalence and intensity of infection are typically collected from school-aged children (SAC) as they are easy to sample and likely to be infected by schosome parasites. However, adults are also likely to be infected. We used three age-intensity profiles of infection for Schos mansoni with low, moderate and high burdens of infection in adults to investigate how age of infection impacts mathematical model recommendations of preventive chemotherapy levels to achieve WHO. We find that moderate prevalence, regardless of burden in adults, SAC may achieve WHO goals. However, high prevalence with high burden in adults, is required to meet WHO. We show that optimal strategy for region requires consideration of burden in adults cannot be solely on prevalence in SAC.
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. In drug-resistant cases, surgery is often considered. However, success rates are unpredictable, with many patients continuing to have seizures after surgery. This study applies a computational model of epilepsy to patient-specific connectivity derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 22 individuals with TLE and 39 healthy controls. We validate the model by examining patient-control differences in simulated seizure onset and location. We investigate the model’s potential for surgery prediction by performing in silico resections, removing nodes from patient networks and comparing seizure likelihood post-surgery to pre-surgery. We find that patients tend to transition from non-epileptic to epileptic states more often than controls in the model. Regions in the left hemisphere, particularly temporal and subcortical, are the most frequent starting points for seizures in patients. Our analysis also implicates contralateral and frontal regions in seizure spreading or surgery resistance. Finally, the model predicts patient-specific resection areas chosen on individual, not predefined, may lead to better outcomes than current clinical procedure.
Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is a virus that interferes with the host cell’s innate antiviral defenses by interfering with interferon and apoptotic signaling. HHV-8 encodes four viral interferon regulatory factors (vIRFs) that function in a dominant negative fashion to block cellular IR activities and target IR-induced proteins such as p53 and TGFβ receptor-activated Smad transcription factors. Here, we show that vIR-1, one of the HHV-8 IRFs, targets the pro-apopt Bcl-2 family member Bim, a negative regulator of HH-8 replication, to inactivate it via nuclear translocation. v-mediated localization of B was detected in infected cells by immunofluorescence and western analysis of fractionated extracts, as well as in nuclei of lytically infected endothelial cells. In vitro co-precitation using purified v- and B revealed a direct interaction between the proteins, and B-binding residues of were mapped by deletion and mutagenesis. Generation of B-refactory v- variants revealed the importance of v:B interaction, specifically in prolication and anti-apopt activity of. Blocking the interaction with a cell-per peptide corresponding to the B-binding of v confirmed the relevance v:B association to v prolication. This is the first report of an IR protein interacting with acl-2 family member and sequestration of B or any member as a means of inactivation. The data reveal a novel mechanism by which HH-8 controls replication-induced apoptosis and suggest inhibiting v:B interaction may provide an antiral strategy.
The epithelial integrin αVβ6 plays a crucial role in maintaining the lung's steady state of immune readiness to respond to injury. It is upregulated during injury and modulates acute lung injury (ALI) through undefined mechanisms. We show that upregulation of αV6 during influenza infection is involved in disease pathogenesis. β6-deficient mice (βKO) have increased survival during infection due to limited viral spread into alveolar spaces leading to reduced ALI. Although βKO have normal lungs, they harbor constitutively activated CD11+ alveolar macrophages (AM) and elevated type IFN activity. This is due to loss of β-activated growth factor (TGFβ). Administration of exogenous TGFβ to βKO mice reduces CD11+ AM, type IF activity and protective phenotype during infection. Protection extends to other respiratory pathogens such as Sendai virus and bacterial pneumonia. Our studies show that loss of epithelial protein αV6 alters lung microenvironment during homeostasis and infection leading to reduced injury and improved survival.
Leishmanias is the most frequently implicated species of cutaneous and mucosal leishiasis in the Americas. Diagnosis is based on the identification of amastigotes in lesions, which is limited by low parasite burden. Leishin Skin Test (ST) is a tool for diagnosis based on delayed hypersensitivity to Leish antigens injected intradermally, used in endemic areas as complement to diagnosis. A retrospective analysis of individuals with first episode tegument leishiasis at reference center in Argentina during 2006–201 was performed to assess usefulness of ST as support in diagnosis of leishias. A total 733 cases met definition were included in analysis; 93% cutaneous, 7% mucosal and <1% disseminated. Diagnostic was reached in 65% cases through smears skin or muc, with 6 among this group negative ST. Among negative, were also negative ST, but 69 ST positive. Across age, ratios between smear and ST were similar. Lesions than 21-old found to correlate positive both smear and ST significantly than younger. These support use ST as complement for Cutaneous leishias across age in endemic. In this, correlation smear was high.
Lipid-induced epigenetic changes in macrophages identify a coronary artery disease-associated variant that regulates PP2B expression through altered C/EB-beta binding. Genome-wide association studies have identified over 40 loci that affect coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, but the majority of the causal mechanisms are unknown. Recent studies have suggested that many GW variants influence disease through altered transcription regulation in disease-relevant cell types. We explored changes in transcription regulation during a key pathophysiological event in CAD, the lipid-induced transformation of macrophages to lipid-laden foam cells. We used a combination of chromatin mapping with formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FA-seq) and enhancer transcription mapping using chromatin immuno-precipitation (IP) in human macrophages before and after exposure totherogenic oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLD), with foam formation.LD-induced cell was associated with changes in a subset of chromatin and enhancers that correlated with expression of nearby genes.LD-regulated enhancers were enriched for transcription factors including CEB-beta, which has no documented role in foam formation.LD exposure upregulated CEB expression and increased binding, most around genes in inflammatory pathways. Variants CAD loci were significantly enriched in subset chrom altered byLD, including rs643 in LD-induced at PP2 locus.LD increased CEB binding to site and CEB binding were stronger with protective allele rs643. In addition, PP2 product L3 was present in foam human atherosclerotic plaques andLD upregulated L3 in macrophages in degradation pro-inflammatory mediators.
Trachoma is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus. It is a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that districts with trach prevalence ≥10% in 1–9-year-olds (TF-9) receive at least three rounds of azithromycin mass drug administration (MDA). However, given the large number of endemic districts and human resources required for surveys, this may not be practical. In Malawi, the Ministry of Health conducted one round of azithycin MDA in 8 districts with baseline TF prevalence of 5.0–9.9%, achieving ~80% coverage. We report the impact of this intervention. We conducted population-based trach surveys in 18 evaluation units of the treated districts at least 6 months after MDA. Each of the 18 evaluation units had TF-9 prevalence <5.0%. Our study demonstrates that in Malawi districts with TF 5.0–.9%, one round azithycin MDA with ~80% coverage reduces TF prevalence to <5.
Nucleotide-binding leucine repeat ( NLR ) protein complexes are key components of plant innate immunity that sense pathogen infections and trigger robust immune responses. In Arabidopsis thaliana, NLR proteins such as RPS and RPM are activated by pathogen effectors to launch immune responses, including programmed cell death (PCD), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and transcriptional reprogramming. We identified six closely related Arabidopsis Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPs) that mediate bifurcate immune responses activated by NLR proteins. The dynamics of CP1/2 activation by pathogen effectors controls the onset of cell death. Sustained CP4/5/6/11 activation phosphorylates WRKY transcription factors to regulate transcriptional reprogramming for N-dependent pathogen restriction, whereas CP1/2/4 phosphorylate plasma-resident NAD oxidases for ROS production.
Schistosoma infections are a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the developing world, infecting more than 500 million people in 77 countries. In Mali, the incidence of Schistos haobium is rising due to irrigation projects, shifts from nomadic to sedentary existence, and ineffective control programs. Despite the scope of these parasitic infections, less than 0. 5% of Schos sp investigations have attempted to predict their spatial and temporal distributions. In this study, we developed a parsimonious forecasting system for Schos haob in the district of Nion, Mali, using general exponential smoothing methods within a state-space framework. This method accommodates seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in the time-series. We used data from 1996–2004 to generate contemporaneous on-line forecasts. Mean absolute error was circa 25% for 1 to 5-month forecasts. The exponential state-space framework produced accurate forecasts for S haob-induced hematuria incidence, capturing non-linear interactions between disease and exogenous covariates ( e. g. climate, irrigation, health interventions ). This framework could assist managing and assessing S haob transmission and intervention impact in Nion, and potentially elsewhere in the Sahel.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus that has evolved a mechanism of self-imposed restriction by the tegument protein pp150. This protein binds to cyclin A and prevents viral gene expression in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle in fully permissive cells. Here, we investigate the physiological relevance of this restriction during productive CMV infection by employing a cyclin-binding deficient pp150 mutant. The consequence of viral expression in S2 was the induction of G2/M arrest. G-arrest but not mitotic cells supported viral replication. Cyclin destabilization by the viral product p21 was required to maintain virus-permissive G2rest. An HCM double mutant where both pp and p21 are disabled in cyclin interaction forced mitotic entry the majority of infected, with severe impact on cell and virus growth.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that results in progressive degeneration of motor neurons, leading to paralysis and death. Approximately 10% of ALS cases are familial, with the remaining 90% being sporadic. Genetic studies in familial cases of ALS have been informative in determining causative mutations behind ALS, as same mutations in familial ALS also cause sporadic. However, cause of ALS in approximately 30% familial and majority sporadic remains unknown. We undertook targeted sequencing of 169 candidate ALS genes in 242 sporadic cases and 129 controls to identify novel variants linked ALS. We found significant enrichment of novel and rare variants in cases versus controls, indicating likely disease mutations.
Interleukin-6 Is Critical for Influenza-Specific CD4+ T Cell Memory Recall  
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has recently emerged as an important regulator of T cell proliferation and survival. Since IL-6 is abundant following influenza virus infection, we analyzed virus-specific T cell activity in both wild type and IL-6 deficient mice. Our studies highlight a novel role for IL-6 in the development of T memory to influenza. Specifically, we find that CD4+ but not CD8 T memory is critically dependent on IL-6. This effect of IL-6 includes its ability to suppress CD4CD25+ regulatory cells (Tregs). We demonstrate that influenza-induced IL-6 limits the activity of virus-specific Tregs, thereby facilitating virus-specific CD4 T. These experiments reveal a critical role for IL-6 in ensuring, within the timeframe of acute infection with cyathic virus that antigen-specific Tregs have no opportunity to down-modulate the response, thereby favoring pathogen clearance and host survival.
Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite that causes amoebic dysentery, an intestinal infection that can be fatal in immunocompromised individuals. In this report, we describe a new function of enolase, a glycolytic enzyme known to catalyze the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenpyruvate. We show that enase acts as an inhibitor of Dmt2, a cytosine methyltransferase involved in DNA and RNA methylation. Enase is localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus of Enteba histolytica and its inhibitory activity is antagonized by 2-phosphoglycer, suggesting that glucose metabolism controls enolytic function. In glucose starvation, enase accumulates in nucleus and forms a complex with enol-E histolytic DNMT homolog ( Ehm ), reducing tRNA methylation in the parasite. We also show that enase inhibits D2 activity in E histoly expressing nuclear localization signal (LS)-enase. These results establish enase as the first Dmt interacting protein and highlight an unexpected role of glycolytic enzyme in modulating Dmt activity.
Mosquito saliva is a complex concoction of secretory factors that modulates the feeding process to enhance pathogen infection establishment. Multiple salivary factors have been identified that enhance pathogen infection. Here, we describe the first identification of exogenous microRNAs from mosquito saliva. MicroRNAs are short,18–24 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are generally intracellular. However, circulating miRN have been described from serum and saliva of humans. Exogenous miRN have not been reported from hematophagous arthropod saliva. We sought to identify miRN in mosquito saliva and their role in Chikunya virus (CHV) infection. Next generation sequencing was utilized to identify 103 exogenous miRN in saliva of which 31 miRN were previously unidentified and designated. Several miRN were expressed only in CHV infected mosquitoes. Five miRN were tested for their potential to regulate CHV infection. Our results demonstrate their role in transmission and establishment during feeding on host.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is an independently maintained genome that encodes proteins required for cellular respiration. Deletions in mtDNA have been identified as causes of maternally inherited diseases and associated with cancers and neurological disorders. These deletions are often flanked by short repetitive sequences, suggesting they may result from recombination events. Our understanding of mtDNA maintenance and repair is limited compared to that of the nucleus. Many nuclear repair proteins localize to mitochond, but their function and mechanism remain unknown. This study investigated the contribution of double-strand break (DS) repair proteins Rad51, Rad52 and Rad59 to mtDNA repair. We found that both Rad51 and Rad59 localize to mitochondria and Rad51 binds mtDNA. A mitochondally-targeted restriction endonuclease (mt-KI) was used to produce a double-strand break (DSB) in mtDNA, allowing analysis of DS repair in vivo in Saccharomy cerevisiae. We found that loss of these proteins decreases spontaneous deletions and loss of Rad51 and Rad59 impairs repair of mtDSBs.
Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are major health problems among disadvantaged populations worldwide. These conditions are complications of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection and are acknowledged as diseases of poverty. However, the role of specific social and environmental factors in GAS infection progression to ARF/RHD is not well understood. This systematic review aimed to determine the association between social determinants of health and GAS, ARF, and RHD, and the effect of interventions targeting these. We conducted a systematic review using PubMed, Cochrane and Embase. Observational and experimental studies measuring crowding, dwelling, education, employment, income, nutrition, and socioeconomic status with GAS, AR or RHD were included. Findings were assessed against the Bradford criteria for evidence of causation. Study quality was assessed using a standard tool. We identified 1,164 publications, 90 met criteria, comprising 91 studies. The majority (50.5%) were poor in relation to the question. The proportion of studies reporting associations between socioeconomic determinants and GAS was 57.1% and AR/RHD was 50. Crow was most assessed (14 with GAS, 36 AR/RHD ) followed by socioeconomic (6, 36). Most studies assessing crow, dwelling, education, employment, and nutrition reported a positive association with GAS, AR/RHD. Crow and socioeconomic satisfied the criteria of association.
Bistability in the Pho/Pho Signaling Network Emerges from a Single Point Mutation in Phosphatase Activity. The Phosphatase activity of the sensor kinase Pho is abolished by a single point mutation. The mutant responds to stimulus in a bistable manner, as opposed to the wild-type, which has a graded response. Mutant cells are in on and off states have different morphologies and their state is inherited over many generations. External conditions that repress signaling in wild-type drive mutant to on state. Mathematical modeling suggests bistability depends on positive autoregulation of Pho and Pho.
Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare but devastating infection caused by the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri. The disease is characterized by a high mortality rate and a lack of established treatment options. In the absence of economic incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop anti-AM drugs, antiAM drug discovery relies on drug repurposing. Similar to fungi, N. fleri has an essential requirement for ergosterol, a building block of plasma membranes. Disruption of sterol biosynthesis by small-molecule inhibitors is a validated strategy against fungal pathogens. N. fleri encodes the ster 14-demethylase CYP51, sharing 35% sequence identity with fungal orthologues. This similarity raises the possibility of repurposing anti-fungal drugs for AM. We assessed the impact of anti-fungal drugs triazoles on sterol biosynthesis and viability of N fleri trophotes. We identified the endogenous C51 substrate by mass spectrometry of fleri lipids. We analyzed interactions between recombinant C51 and trioles by UV spectroscopy and x-raylography. Collectively, these studies validated C51 as a potentially druggable target in fleri and trioles as candidates for assessment in AM.
Nematodes are parasitic worms that trigger a protective type 2 immune response in the host via the interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4α). However, the role of IL-4α in maintaining type 2 responses after polarization is unknown. We used a mouse model where IL-4α can be deleted at any time to determine IL-α’s role after polarization. We show that IL-α is required to maintain type 2 responses and protective immunity against Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection. We also show that deleting ILα before secondary infection with N. brasiliensis drives more efficient type 2 responses and parasite clearance.
Bartonella is a genus of bacteria that infects mammals and causes numerous human diseases. We analyzed the largest collection of Bartonella glA genotypes, including 67 new genotypes, to understand how this genus evolved and switched hosts in the past. Our results show that Bartonella likely originated as an environmental bacterium that infected insects before infecting mammals. Rodents and domestic animals serve as reservoirs or key hosts for most Bartonella genotypes in humans. We also found evidence of Bartonella exchange between phylogenetically distant domestic and wildlife animals, likely due to increased contact.
MALAT is a long noncoding RNA that is upregulated in cancer tissues and is associated with hyperproliferation. We show that MALAT levels are regulated during normal cell cycle progression. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses in human diploid fibroblasts reveal that MALAT modulates expression of cell cycle genes and is required for G1 and mitotic progression. Depletion of MALAT leads to activation of p53 and its target genes. The cell cycle defects in MALAT-depleted cells are sensitive to p53 levels, indicating that p53 is a major mediator of MALAT activity. Furthermore, MALAT-depleted cells display reduced expression of MYB, an oncogenic transcription factor involved in G/M, due to altered splicing of MY preRNA and aberrant splicing. In cells, MALAT promotes proliferation by modulating expression and splicing of cell–regulated transcription factors.
Juvenile hormone (JH) is a sesquiterpenoid produced by the corpora all that coordinates insect growth, metamorphosis and reproduction. While J action on the repression of larval metamosis has been well studied, the molecular basis of J in promoting reproduction has not been fully elucidated. Methop-toler (Met), the J receptor, has recently been shown to mediate J action during metamosis as well as vitelogenesis. We have now demonstrated that J stimulates DNA replication and increases ploidy in preparation for vitelogenesis in migratory locusts. Mc4 and Mc7, genes in the replication pathway were expressed in the presence of J. Depletion of Mc or Mc7 inhibited de novo synthesis and polloidy, and resulted in reduction of vitelogen mRNA as well as impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian.
Lepromatous leprosy is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae that can cause nerve impairment (NFI). The optimal duration of prednisone treatment for NFI has not been established. The “Treatment of Early Neuropathy in Lepros” (TENL) trial evaluated whether a 32-week predone course is more effective than a 20-week course in restoring nerve function. In this multi-centre, triple-blind, randomized trial, lepro patients with recent NFI (<6 months ) were allocated to predolone treatment of either 20 or 32 weeks. Predolone was started at 45 or 60 mg/day, then tapered. NFI was assessed by muscle testing and monofilament testing. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with improved or restored function at week 78. Secondary outcomes were improvements between baseline and week 78 on the Reaction Scale, SAL Scale and Participation. Serious Events and additional predone treatment were monitored. We included 868 patients, 429 in the 20 arm and 439 in the 32 arm. At 78, the proportion with improved or restored function did not differ: 78.1% in 20 and 77.5 in 32 ( p 0.821 ). Secondary outcomes did not differ, except a higher Serious Events in the longer arm.
Male Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elus nelsoni) and European Red Deer (Cervus elus elaphus) produce different types of vocalizations during the mating season. Elk produce high-frequency bugles, while Red Deer produce low-frequency roars. To relate sound production to anatomy and physiology, we developed a finite element model of the larynx and a wave model of the vocal tract based on elk morphology and biomechanics. The model can produce a wide range of fundamental frequencies. Low frequencies require low vocal fold strain, high lung pressure, and large glottal flow. High-frequency bugles require large vocal fold strain, high pressure, and least 10 dB more intensity. Glottal efficiency, the ratio of radiated power to aerodynamic power at glott, is higher in elk. This suggests an advantage in high-pitched signaling. The advantage is based on two aspects: lower aerodynamic power and acoustic radiation at higher frequencies. Both types are used by males during mating and serve as honest signals.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) has become the preferred approach for mapping transcription-factor binding and chromatin modifications. Current analysis of ChIP-seq data relies on reads that map uniquely to the reference genome (uni-reads). However, this can lead to omission of up to 30% of alignable reads. We describe a method for utilizing reads that map to multiple locations on the genome (multi-reads). Our approach allocates multi-reads as fractional counts using a weighted scheme. Using STAT and GATA ChIP-seq datasets, we show that incorporation of multi-reads increases sequencing depth and leads to detection of novel peaks not identifiable with uni-read, and improves peaks in mappable regions. We investigate genome-wide characteristics of peaks detected by multi-read via computational experiments. Peaks from multi-read have similar characteristics to uni-read except majority reside in segmental duplications. We validate GATA multi-read peaks by quantitative ChIP and identify novel GATA target genes.
Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) have been targeted for elimination by 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). We estimated the economic impact of meeting these targets for African trypanosomiasis, lepro, visceral leishmanis, and Chagas, NTDs controlled by innovative and intensified management (IDM). We combined information on productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments (OPPs) related to these NTDs with projections of the number of people suffering each NTD, country and year 2010–2010 and 2020–203. We compared an ideal scenario where WHO targets are met with a counterfactual scenario assuming no change from 1990. Economic benefit was the difference between the two scenarios. Values are in 2005 US, purchasing power-adjusted, discounted 3% annum from 0. Probabilistic analyses were used to quantify uncertainty around the estimate. The global productivity for IDM-NT was 23. 1 (15.9–34. ) billion 201–0 and 35.9 (25.–51. ) billion 203 (2.5–97.5 percent brackets ), corresponding 10.7 (7.–15. ) and 16.6 (11–.24 ) in OPP was 14 (6.7 ) and 18 (10.4 ) for the same periods.
Neurons in the auditory cortex have traditionally been thought to be more informative if they respond to a narrower range of sensory inputs. However, we found that the amount of information encoded by a population of neurons about a sound is determined by the total number of spikes in a read window, not the selectivity of individual neurons. Neurons are less selective immediately after a sound onset and become more selective in the sustained epoch, but the population conveys similar information in both epochs. This is contrary to the prevailing theory that the first epoch encodes the presence and the second the content of a sound. We found that inhomogeneous Poisson spiking is sufficient to account for this property.
Viral infections can be divided into two categories: acute and chronic. During acute infections, the immune system is able to clear the pathogen and the anti-viral T cell compartment contracts. In contrast, during chronic infections, the anti-viral T compartment needs to be maintained over a longer period of time to control viral replication and prevent spreading. Little is known about the stimulatory signals that allow the maintenance of antiiral T cells, but inhibitory signals such as PD-1 are known to limit T cell activity. Here, we show that the co-stimulatory molecule O40 (CD134) is required in the context of persistent LCMV 13 infection. Antiiral T cells express high levels of O40 in the presence of their cognate antigen and cells lacking O40 fail to accumulate. Moreover, the emergence of T dependent germinal responses and LCM-specific antibodies are impaired. Consequently, O-deficient mice fail to control LCM 13 infection over time.
Convergent Evolution of Mechanically Optimal Locomotion in Aquatic Invertebrates Vertebrates.
During the development of the cerebral cortex, neural stem cells (NS) divide to proliferate symmetrically and asymmetrically to generate neurons. Although faithful segregation of mitotic chromosomes is critical for NS divisions, the mechanism remains unclear. Condensins, a class of evolutionarily conserved protein complexes, are thought to be central to chromosome assembly and segregation in eukaryotes. We report the first genetic study of mammalian condins, demonstrating that two types of condin complexes, condins I and II, are essential for NS divisions and survival in mice. Simultaneous depletion of both condins leads to defects in chromosome assembly and segregation, causing DNA damage and p53-induced apoptosis. Individual depletions of condins I and II lead to loss of NS compared to simultaneous, but display distinct mitotic defects: chromosome missegregation is prominent in NS depleted condin II, whereas mitotic delays detectable in condin-depleted NS. NS depleted condin display hyperclustering pericentric heterochatin and nucleoli, indicating condin II, not condin, establishes interphase architecture. Intriguingly, defects persist in postmit neurons.
Schistosoma mansoni, a species of hermaphroditic trematode, is unusual since it has evolved gonochorism. In this species, sex is determined by a female heterogamic system, but phenotyp sexual dimorphism appears only after infection of the vertebrate host. To study the molecular basis of sex determination and sexual differentiation, we investigated the transcriptome of S. mansoni in a stage and sex-comparative manner. We performed RNA-seq on males and females for five developmental stages: cercaria, larvae, in vivo schosulum stages and adults. We detected 7, 168 differentially expressed genes between sexes in at least one stage, and 4,065 were functionally annotated. Transcript data were completed with H3K27me histone modification analysis using ChIP-Seq before in cercaria and after adults. We present candidate determinants of sexual differentiation, sex-based players of interaction with vertebrate host and dynamic of H3me histone mark between sexes as illustration of sex-based epigenetic landscapes.
Many large-scale annotation efforts involve multiple experts who may disagree with each other. We propose a method for modeling disagreements among experts that allows each annotation to have a confidence value, i. e., the posterior probability that it is correct. Our method computes certainty for individual annotations given annotator-specific parameters estimated from data. We developed two probabilistic models for this analysis and compared them using simulation. We tested each model’s performance on a large data set generated by human annotators for this study. We show that even when all annotators disagree, our method increases the probability of choosing correct annotation. We make available a corpus of 10, 000 sentences annotated according to dimensions from earlier work. The 10, 000 were 3-fold annotated by eight experts and 1, 000 further 5-fold by five.
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a severe and often lethal disease in South America caused by viruses such as Andes virus (AND) and AND-like viruses. Passive transfer of convalescent human plasma has shown promise as a possible treatment for HPS, but availability of convalescent plasma from survivors is very limited. Here, we explore the concept of using DNA technology to produce antiviral biologics, including polyclonal antibodies for use in humans. Geese produce IgY and an alternatively spliced form, IgΔ, that can be purified at high concentrations from egg yolks. Ig lacks the properties of mammalian Fc that make antibodies in horses, sheep, and rabbits reactogenic in humans. We vaccinated geese with an AND DNA vaccine encoding the envelope glycoproteins. Ge developed high neutralizing antibodies after the second vaccination and maintained high levels of neutral antibodies over 1 year. A booster resulted in high levels of neutral antibodies. Analysis of Ig and IgΔ by epitope mapping show highly reactive to amino sequences of AND envelope glyrote. We examined the efficacy of goose-derived antibody in hamster lethal model of HPS. α-AND immune sera or Ig/IgΔ purified from eggs were passively transferred to hamsters subcutaneously 5 days after challenge with AND (25LD50). Both immune and egg-derived Ig/IgΔ protected 8/8 and 7/8, respectively. In contrast, hamsters Ig/IgΔ from normal ge (8) or no-treatment (8) developed HPS.
Mutations in the Dnmta gene have been associated with leukemias and deletion of Dmta has been shown to promote tumor progression in a K-r–dependent lung cancer model. We used whole-genome bisulf sequencing to comprehensively characterize the methylomes of Dmta wildtype and Dmt-deficient lung tumors. Our results show profound methylation changes in K–induced lung cancer. Dmt wildtype tumors were characterized by large hypomethyl domains corresponding to lamina-associated domains. In contrast,mt-deficient tumors showed uniformly hypomethyl genome. Further analysis revealed thatmta is required for efficient methylation of active domains andmt-deficient tumors show moderate deregulation in these domains.
Songbird premotor cortex is a brain region that supports the generation of learned song sequences in songbirds. Here, we describe the spatial and temporal organization of the premotor cortical microcircuit that supports the generation of these sequences. We used multi-channel electrophysiology and calcium imaging to record neural activity in the premotor cortex of zebra finches. We found that neural activity in the premotor cortex is correlated over a length of 100 µm. Within this length, basal ganglia-projecting excitatory neurons fire at a specific phase of a 30 Hz network rhythm. These results show that premotor activity is inhomogeneous in time and space, and that a mesoscopic pattern underlies the generation of the sequences controlling song.
Evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that control aging are predicted to have prereproductive functions in order to be subject to natural selection. Genes that are essential for growth and development are highly conserved in evolution, but their role in longevity has not been previously assessed. We screened 2, 700 genes for Caenorhabditis elegans development and identified 64 that extend lifespan when inactivated postdevelopment. These candidate regulators are conserved from yeast to humans. Classification the regulators into functional groups identified the insulin and metabolic pathways but also enrichment translation, RNA, and chromatin.
During zebraf fin regeneration, the first step is the formation of a specialized epidermis from the underlying stump tissue. We performed a forward genetic screen for mutations that impair this process in zebraf fins and identified a temperature-sensitive allele of laminin beta 1 ( lamba ) that blocks regeneration. Lamb1, but not its paralog lambb, is induced in a subset of epithelial cells after amputation where it is required to establish and maintain a polarized epithelial layer. These events include expression of morphogenic factors shha and lef, basolateral positioning of phosphorylated Igf1, patterning of osteoblasts, and regeneration of bone. Lamb1 function is dispensable for juvenile growth, homeostatic adult maintenance, repair of split fins or renewal of geneticallylated osteoblast.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are used to identify genetic variants associated with diseases. GWAS can be affected by population substructure and relatedness. Recently, linear mixed models (LMM) have been used to account for relatedness in GWAS. Several LMM software packages have been developed, but it is unclear how they differ from each other. Here, we compare several LMM approaches and implementations, including EMM, GenABEL, FaSTMM, Mendel, GEM, and MMM, via a GWAS of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 families ( 362 individuals, 197 genotyped ). LMM differ in methodology and user options, such as method and number of SNPs to estimate kinship matrix. We investigate sensitivity to these choices and success in controlling genome-wide error for both real and simulated phenotypes. We compare LMM to traditional family-based tests and alternative approaches in MQL, ROADIPS and MAST. We find strong concordance between LMM, all controlling genome error except when applied to longitudinal data with repeated measures. We find correlation between LMM and alternative approaches apart from transmission-based when SNPs small or non-existent. We conclude LMM perform well compared to competing approaches.
Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease, a major public health problem in Latin America. Current treatments are toxic, have partial efficacy, and target only the acute phase of the disease. In this study, we developed a whole-cell assay for high-throughput screening of compounds that inhibit Trypanosoma cruzi infection of mammalian cells. A chemical library of 200 compounds was screened using recombinant T. cruzi ( Tulah strain ) expressing β-galactosidase. Three compounds were selected for high activity against T cruz and low toxicity to host cells in vitro: P1, NT1 and CX ( IC50: 54,190 and 23 nM, respectively ). Each compound has a different mechanism of action on intracellular T cruzi proliferation. CX shows trypanocidal activity, essential for chronic Chagas treatment where parasites are intracellular quiescent. NT has tryostatic effect, while P1 affects parasite division. These compounds also inhibit intracellular T cruz from Y and related species Leishmania major and amazonensis.
Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by filarial parasites transmitted by mosquitoes. Molecular monitoring of filariasis relies on PCR or real-time PCR detection of Brugia malayi, Brug timori and Wuchereria bancrofti in vectors. However, DNA extraction from mosquitoes is typically performed using silica-based technologies, which are time-consuming and costly, and testing requires expensive cyclers or real-time instruments. This presents challenges for laboratories in endemic areas. We present a novel molecular monitoring approach for filarial parasites in mosquitoes using a rapid NaOH DNA extraction coupled with a battery-powered PCR platform and strip-based detection. We evaluated the performance of rapid NaOH extraction for DNA from parasite-spiked mosquito pools and compared it to silica-based extraction. We also compared our strip detection to real-time PCR and conventional PCR with gel electrophoresis, demonstrating sensitive and specific detection of parasite DNA from mosquito pools. Finally, we compared laboratory thermal cycling with field miniaturized PCR, demonstrating potential for point-of-collection use. This platform is compact enough to fit into a backpack and eliminates reliance on expensive instrumentation without compromising detection sensitivity or specificity. It provides an alternative to column-dependent extractions coupled to methodologies requiring advanced infrastructure. This system should increase feasibility of molecular monitoring in B. malayi-endemic locations.
Elastomeric proteins are a class of proteins that have evolved independently multiple times through evolution. They are produced as monomers that self-assemble into polymeric structures with properties of stretch and recoil. These proteins are composed of an alternating architecture of elastomeric domains interspersed with cross-linking elements. The elastom domains provide elasticity and drive the assembly process, while the cross-link elements serve to stabilise the polymer. The number and arrangement of elastom and cross-link domains have been shown to significantly impact assembly and mechanical properties. Here we present a theoretical study that examines the impact of domain architecture on polymer assembly and integrity. We use a novel simulation model of diffusion limited aggregation to simulate the self-assembly of rod-like particles with alternating architectures. We apply the model to different architectures and generate a variety of aggregates that are subsequently analysed by graph-theoretic metrics to predict structural integrity. Our results show that the relative length and number of elastom and cross-link domains significantly impact the morphology and structural integrity of the polymeric structure. For example, the most connected polymers are constructed from rods with large cross-link elements interspersed with smaller elastom domains.
Ebola virus (EBOV) is a highly lethal zoonotic pathogen with a genome larger size than most non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses due to the presence of long 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) in its seven transcriptional units. To date, the functions of these UTRs have not been assigned. Using reporter assays, we show that the EBO 5′-UTR lacks internal ribosomal entry function, but differentially regulates cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of a GFP gene. Most notably, the 5′-UT derived from the polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppresses GFP translation compared to β-actin 5-UT. The 5-UT is one of four viral genes to possess upstream AUGs (uAUGs), and ablation of each uUG enhances translation of the primary open reading frame (ORF), most dramatically in the case of 5-UT. The uUG is sufficient to initiate translation, surrounded by a weak Koz sequence and suppresses OR translation in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions where eIFα is phosphorylated, the presence of uOR maintains translation of LOR, indicating uOR modulates translation in response to cellular stress. To address the role of uUG in replication, a recombinant EBO was generated in which uUG was mutated to UCG. Strikingly, mutating two nucleotides outside previously-defined protein and cis-regulatory sequences attenuates virus titers 10–100 lower than wild-type in Vero A549 cells.
Genome instability plays a key role in many biological processes and diseases, including cancer. Genome-wide mapping of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) is important for understanding chromosomal architecture and specific chromosomal regions DSB. We developed a method for precise genome-wide mapping of blunt-ended DSBs in human chromosomes, and observed non-random and DSB hot spots. These hot spots are scattered along chromosomes and limit 50–250 kb domains. We found that about 30% of domains ( denoted domains ) possess coordinately expressed genes that PAR1 and HNPA2B1 bind DNA at domain termini. Thus, our data suggest a novel type of regulation: coordinated transcription silencing of gene clusters by D hot spots as well as PAR1 and HN2B1 binding sites.
Trypanosomat diversity was studied in bats from two areas with different levels of degradation in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: Reserva Biológica Guapia (REG) and Estação Florestal Atlântica (EFMA). A total of 181 bat specimens were analyzed, 24 (13% ) were infected with trypanosomatids. Molecular characterization using PCR targeting the 18S rRNA gene showed similar infection rates in both areas: 15% in REG and 11% in EF (p=0.46). Trypanosomaionii was the most frequently detected (54% ) followed by T. cruzi DTI and TIV and Tryosoma sp. Mixed infections were observed in Neotropical phlost bats. T cruz DTI and TIV are involved in acute cases of Chagas disease in Brazil and Tionii was recently found in heart tissue of an infected child. Crithia mellae, a putative monoxen parasite infecting vertebrate in Americas, was also described.
Ticks are the most common arthropod vectors of human and animal diseases in Europe, and Ixodes ricinus is able to transmit a large number of bacteria, viruses, and parasites. They may be coinfected with several pathogens, with a high likelihood of transmission to humans or animals. However, few data exist on coinfection rates and studies focus on well-known pathogens. In addition to pathogens, ticks carry symbionts that may play roles in tick biology and interfere with pathogen transmission. This study evaluated the prevalence of 38 pathogens and symbion coinfections as well as possible interactions between pathogens and symbion. A total 267 Ix ricinus female specimens were collected in the Ardennes and analyzed by high-throughput real-time PCR for presence of 37 bacteria and parasites, rRT-PCR for Tick-borne encephalitis virus, and nested PCR for symbion. Possible interactions between pathogens and symbion were statistically evaluated.
Hematopoietic eryth-myeloid lineage commitment is determined by a genetic switch involving the transcription factors PU.1 and GATA-1. Prior to lineage commitment, these genes are primed at low levels of expression. We develop a computational model for the hematopoietic eryth-myeloid decision, which is based on known interactions between these master genes, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation. The system is bistable, a feature for robust lineage determination. We suggest a mechanism involving a cofactor regulated by one of the master genes to bind the antagonistic partner necessary for bistability and switch-like behavior. Suppression of cofactor through external means leads to loss of cooperativity and primed PU.1 GATA. The PU1–GATA switch also interacts with mutually antagonistic pair –G. The latter inherits state of upstream genes and reinforces decision through feedback, leading to irreversible commitment. The eryth-myoid lineage switch is an example of network that implements prim and committed by cooperativity through cofactor recruitment. Perturbing feedback between regulators and targets suggests reprogramming strategies.
Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen that is intrinsically resistant to lysozym, a key effector of the innate immune system. This high level of resistance requires a complex network of transcriptional regulators and several genes ( oat, pgA, dlt, and sigV ) acting synergistically to inhibit the enzym and cationic antimicrobial activities of lysozym. We sought to identify novel genes modulating E. faalis resistance to lyso. Random transposon mutagenesis in the quadruple oat/pgA/dlt/sig mutant led to the identification of several insertions in the chromosome. These were located in a locus referred to as the enteroccal polysacchar antigen (EPA) region downstream of conserved epAepaR genes proposed to encode a core machinery. The ep region was previously proposed to be responsible for EPA decoration, but the role remains largely unknown. We show that EPA contributes to resistance to antimicrobials and virulence in zebraf infection by conferring resistance phagocytosis. Our results indicate that production of the rhamopolysacchar backbone is not sufficient to promote E faalis infections and reveal an essential role of modification of this polymer for enteroc pathogenesis.
In this study, we developed RER (Regression of Combined Expression ), an integrative model that combines data from ENCODE and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCG ) to predict gene expression in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). RER infers sample-specific regulatory activities of transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs, which are then used to infer TF/miRNA interactions. This two-stage framework circumvents difficulties in integrating ENCODE data with sample-specific TCG measurements. We applied RER to AML data from TCG and ENCODE TF binding data in K562. We first verified RER by 10-fold cross-validation predicting gene expression. Next, we evaluated RER recovering known regulatory interactions and demonstrated superior statistical power over existing methods detecting miRNA/TF targets. We developed a feature selection procedure that identified 18 regulators whose activities clustered with cytogenetic risk. One selected regulator, miR-548, inferred targets were enriched for leukemia-related, implicating its role in AML pathogenesis. We used inferred activities as a potential AML prognostic marker. Our framework successfully integrated TCG and EN data revealing AML regulatory program at the global level.
Small RNA-based antiviral defense in the phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum higginsum. Although little is known about the biological roles of RNA silencing in fungi, the Colletum genus comprises species that are pathogenic for a wide range of crops worldwide. To investigate the role of RNA silencing in the ascomyc fungus Colotrichum higginsum, we generated knock-out mutants for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DR), Dicer (DCL), and Argonaute (AGO) proteins by targeted gene replacement. No effects were observed on vegetative growth for any mutant when grown on complex or minimal media. However, ΔCL, ΔCLΔCL, and ΔAGO strains showed defects in conidiation and conidia morphology. Total RNA and small RNA populations were analyzed in parental and mutant strains. The greatest effects on both populations were observed in ΔCL, ΔCL, andAGO, in which derepressed a previously uncharacterized dsRNA mycovirus Colotrich higginsum non-segment dsRNA 1 (ChV1). Phylogen analyses showed a close relationship between ChV and members of the Partitiviridae family. Immunoprecipitation of small RNAs with AGO showed abundant 5’-containing siRNA. higginsum and ΔCL strains cured ofV revealed conid and spore defects were primarily caused byV.
Histone acetyltransferase MOF is involved in all three waves of H2AX phosphorylation during meiotic prophase I in male mice. The first wave of HAX phosphorylation is ATM-dependent and occurs at leptotene, while the second and third are ATR-dependent and occur at zygotene and pachene stages, respectively. The third wave of HAX phosphorylation marks unsynapsed chromosomes. In this study, we report that MO is involved in all three waves of HAX phosphorylation. Germ cell-specific deletion of MO in spermatocytes caused loss of H4acetylation. In leptene and zgot spermatocytes of MO-deficient mice, HAX signals were only along chromosomal axes and chromatin-wide HAX phosphorylation was lost. In almost 40% of early-mid pachene spermatocytes from MO-deficient mice HAX and M1 were along unsyn axes of sex chromosomes but failed to expand, causing meiotic chromosome inactivation failure. Furthermore, though RAD51 was proficiently recruited to double-strand break sites, defects in repair and crossover were observed in MO-deficient spermatocytes, indicating MO facilitates meiotic repair after RAD51 recruitment.
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection has the potential to interfere with thymic T-cell development. We investigated the effects of HTLV-1 infection on human T-cell development in “Immune System” Rag-2/-γ- mice. These mice were infected with HT-1 at a time when three subpopulations of thymocytes have been detected. In all inoculated mice, HT-1 was found in thymocytes; proviral load increased with length of infection. In HT- mice, T development was altered, extent correlated with proviral load. In thym of HT- mice, single-positive (SP) CD4 and CD8 cells were most, at expense of immature double-positive (DP) thymocytes. These cells accumulated in spleen. Lymphocytes thym and spleen were activated, shown by expression of CD25. This was correlated with presence of mRNA and increased of NF-κB dependent genes such as bfl-1, anti-apopt gene in thym. Finally, lymphadenopathy and lymphoma/thymoma were observed in HT- mice months after infection.
Schistosomiasis remains a major public health concern in Sudan, particularly Schistosoma haematium infection. This study presents the disease reduction outcomes of an integrated control program for schosomiasis in Jabal locality of White State, Sudan from 2009 through 2011. The total population of the project was 482, 902, and the major group for intervention among them was 78, 615 primary school students. The prevalence of S. haematium and S. mansoni at baseline was 28.5% and 0.4, respectively. After 6–9 months post-treatment, the prevalence of S.ematium was reduced to 13.5 ( 95 CI=0.3310.462 ). A higher reduction was observed among girls, those moderately infected (20% ) and residents in rural, than boys, those high (40% ) and in urban. After education, awareness about schosias was increased. Also, a water facility was constructed at Hida village where infection was reduced compared to a neighboring village. However, no change was found in S mans infection between baseline and follow-up ( CI.9336.891 ). At the end, S haemat infection was reduced more than 50% with baseline. Approximately, subjects received prazantel therapy, education, or water.
Paramyxiruses are a family of viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm and bud from the plasma membrane. The matrix protein is the major structural protein in paramyxiruses that mediates viral assembly and budding. However, the matrix proteins of a few paramyxiruses have been found in the nucleus, and the biological function associated with this localization remains obscure. Here, we report that the nuclear-ctoplasmic trafficking of the Nip virus ( NiV ) matrix protein and post-translational modification play a critical role in matrix-mediated virus budding. NiV is a highly pathogenic paramyxirus that causes encephalitis in humans and is classified as a Biosafety Level ( BSL ) pathogen. During Ni infection, NiV was first detected in the nucleus at early stages before localization to the cytoplasm and plasma. Mutations in the putative bipart nuclear localization (LS ) and leuc-rich nuclear export (NES ) found in Ni impaired nuclear-ctoplasm trafficking and abolished Ni budding. A conserved lysine in LS served dual functions: positive for nuclear import and was also a site for monoubiquination regulating export. Overexpression of ubiquitin enhanced NiV budding whereas depletion in the cell via proteas inhibitors resulted in Ni retention and blocked budding.
Viruses are able to initiate infection by transferring their genetic material across the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm. However, the mechanisms by which non-enveloped viruses deliver their genomes are poorly understood. This is due to difficulties in visualizing viral delivery and distinguishing between productive and non-productive pathways caused by the high particle-to-plaque forming unit ratio of most viruses. Here, we combine an imaging assay that tracks viral capsid and genome in live cells with an infectivity assay for RNA release to characterize early events in poliovirus (PV) infection. Surprisingly, we observe that PV genome release is highly efficient and does not limit overall infectivity or infection rate. We define a pathway in which PV binds to cell surface receptors and enters by clathrin, caveolin, flotillin, and microtubule-independent, tyrosine-kinase and actin-dependent endocytic mechanism. Immediately after internalization of virus, genome release takes place from vesicles or sealed invaginations within 100–200 nm of plasma membrane.
Dengue continues to be a major public health problem in Cambodia with a significant impact on children. The National Dengue Control Program (NDC) delivers health education to communities and schools as a major means of prevention and control. Drawing on data collected in 2003–2004 as part of an ethnographic study in eastern Cambodia, we explore the approaches used in health education and their effectiveness to control dengue. Community education is provided through health outreach activities and campaigns of the DC, but is not systematically evaluated, under-funded and irregular; school education is restricted in terms of time and lacks follow-up in terms of practical activities for prevention and control. As a result, adherence is partial. We suggest the need for sustained education for deng prevention control and need approaches to ensure the translation of knowledge into practice.
Filarial nematodes are parasitic worms that cause chronic and debilitating diseases in humans and animals. In this study, we investigated the presence of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) released by filarial nematodes into the host bloodstream. We used miRNA sequencing combined with bioinformatics to reveal over 200 miRNA sequences of nematode origin in Dirofilaria imis-infected dog plasma and Onchocerca volulus-infected human serum. Total RNA from D. imis-infected dog plasma was subjected to stem-loop RT-PCR assays to detect two miRNA candidates, mi-71 and mi-34. Additionally, Brugia pangi-infected dog samples were included in the analysis, as these miRNAs were previously detected in extracts from this species. The presence of mi-71 and mi34 discriminated infected samples from uninfected samples, with no mi amplification in uninfected samples. However, miRNA numbers were not correlated with microfilaria for either. This may be due to imprecision of mf to estimate infection or mi from unknown number of worms. Nonetheless, parasite-derived miRNAs were found in plasma or serum for species that do not live in bloodstream.
Tyrosine kinases of the Src family are large allosteric enzymes that play a key role in cellular signaling. The conversion of the kinase from an inactive to an active state is accompanied by substantial structural changes. Here, we construct a coarse-grained model of the catalytic domain incorporating experimental structures of the two stable states and simulate the dynamics of conformation transitions in activation. We explore the transition landscapes by constructing a structural network among conformations from simulations. From the network, two major ensembles of pathways for activation are identified. The first pathway involves a coordinated mechanism of interactions among the α helix, the-loop and β strands in the N-terminal of the catalytic domain. The second pathway conformation change is coupled to partial unfolding of the N-terminal region of the catalytic domain. We also characterize the mechanism of the helix and-loop in detail. Finally, we test a Markov model and its ability to account for structural in the context of conformation changes.
Lethality in interplo Crosses of Arabidopsis thaliana: The Role of the Maternally Expressed WRKY Transcription Factor TT2. In interplo crosses between diploid and tetraploid Arabidopsis thaliana can result in lethality in the F1 generation. We have identified the genetic basis of lethality in interplo crosses via QTL mapping. A large-effect QTL, DRANGEVE 1 ( DSL ) was identified, as well as two QTL with epistatic relationships to DSL. DSL affects the rate of postzyotic lethality via expression in the maternal sporophyte. Fine mapping placed DSL in an interval encoding the maternal transcription factor TT2. Maternal parents carrying loss-of-function mutations in TT2 suppressed F leth caused by paternal interplo crosses. The frequency of cellularization in the endosperm was similarly affected by natural and tt2 loss-function mutants.
Bats and rodents are natural reservoirs of many emerging zoonotic pathogens, including Bartonella and Leptira species. We conducted the first comparative host–pathogen coevolutionary analyses of these pathogens in bats and rodents. We used genetic data for 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella from 38 rodents, and 26 Leptira from 20 species. We generated maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies for hosts and bacteria, and tested coevolution congruence using ParaFit, PAC, and Jane. We found that Bartonella and their bat hosts had significant coevolution (ParaFit=1.970, P≤0.001; m value=7.332, P0.000 ) and Bartonella and rodent hosts had strong patterns of cospeciation (ParaFit=102.9, P.001; m value=86.532,.000 ). In contrast, we were unable to reject independence of speciation in Leptira and bats (Para=0.2 P=.84 m=4.631.562 ) Separate analyses of New and Old World data yielded congruent results. We also conducted event-based cophyeny analyses to reconstruct evolutionary histories for each group of pathogens and hosts. Leptira bats had the greatest number of switches (0.731 ) while Bartonella had few (0. ) In both bat and rodent hosts, Bartonella had significant coevolution with minimal switching, while Leptira lacked congruence with high number of switches.
Active and passive swimming in undulatory locomotion is a fundamental to understanding how animals move. In this work, we apply a forced damped oscillation framework to a chain model of undulatory swimming to understand how forcing leads to deformation and movement. We obtain a unified understanding of swimming, caused by muscle contractions (active swimming ) or forces imparted by the fluid (passive swimming ). We show that forcing triggers the first deformation modes of the body, which cause translational motion. We show that simple forcing can trigger complex kinematics that lead to movement. For muscle activation, the frequency of forcing relative to the natural frequency of the damped oscillator is important for emergent deformation of the body. The approach leads to a qualitative understanding of optimal kinematics for fast swimming. Our results, based on a chain model of swimming, are confirmed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.
Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan parasite responsible for sleeping sickness (African Trypanosomiasis, H ) in East Africa. We investigated whether genetic recombination between human and animal subspecies of Tbr can generate new strains of the human pathogen T.br. The human infectivity of Tbr is conferred by a single gene SRA, which can be transferred to the animal pathogen Tbb by sexual reproduction. We tracked the inheritance of S in crosses between Tbr and Tbb by co-transmitting genetically-engineered parental tryosome lines through tse flies. S was readily transferred into new backgrounds by sexual reproduction between Tbr and T, creating new strains of the path Tbr. There was no evidence of diminished growth or transmissibility of tryosomes carrying S. Expression of S is critical for survival of T in the human host. We show that S exists as a single copy in representative of T strains. S was found on homologue IV in majority of T isolates, but Ugandan T had S on both homologues. The mobility of S by genetic recombination explains observed variability of T in Africa. We conclude that new strains of path T are continuously generated by recombination with larger pool of animal-infect tryosomes. Such recombinants present risk for future outbreaks of H.
Diabetes is caused by dysfunction of β-cells in the islets of Langerhans, disrupting insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Gap-mediated electrical coupling between β-cells in the islet plays a major role in coordinating a pulsatile secretory response to elevated glucose and suppressing secretion at basal glucose. We previously demonstrated that a number of inexcitable cells can suppress the overall islet response as a result of gap coupling. This was in a murine model of Neon Diabetes Mellitus ( NDM ) involving expression of ATP-insensitive K channels and a multi-cellular model of islet activity. Here we examined how gap coupling contributes to dysfunction in NDM. We verified a computational model against [Ca+] and secretion inlets expressing-ins K channels under different levels of coupling. We applied this model to how K channel mutations in N suppress [+] and role coupling in suppression. We extended to account for noise and insulin dynamics. We found that reductions in coupling allow greater glucose-stimulated [+] and secretion following expression-ins K channels. The demonstrated correspondence between suppression [+] and presentation different N mutations. Significant recoveries [+] and secretion were predicted for many upon reductions coupling, where played a role in recover.
The ability to predict the behavior of a large network composed of modules is a central problem in systems and synthetic biology. However, this ability is largely missing because modules display context-dependent behavior. One cause of context-dependence is retroactivity, a phenomenon that influences the dynamic performance of a module upon connection to other modules. Here, we establish a framework for gene networks that accounts for retroactivity. Specifically, a module's properties are encoded by three matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing. All have a physical interpretation and can be computed from macroscopic parameters (dissociation constants and concentrations ) and the modules' topology. Internal quantifies the effect of intramod connections on an module's dynamics. and mixing establish how intermod connections the dynamics of modules. Based on these and the dynamics of modules in isolation, we can predict how will affect the behavior of an interconnection modules. We illustrate internal, mixing, and on the performance of recurrent motifs including autoregulation, combinatorial regulation two-gene clocks the switch and single motif. We provide a metric that determines the dynamic of a module to inter with modules. This can be employed to evaluate the of natural networks and establish guidelines to minimize between modules in synthetic.
Recombination in the Human Pseudoomal Region1 (PAR) is a region of homology between mammalian X and Y chromosomes that has undergone rapid evolution. Crossover in this region is essential for proper disjunction of X and Y chromosomes in meiosis, and deletion results in male sterility. The human PAR1 region has an exceptionally high crossover rate, 17-fold higher than the genome-wide average. To investigate recombination in this region, we constructed the most fine-scale genetic map containing observed crossovers to date using African-American pedigrees. Recombination rates were inferred from the breakdown of linkage disequilibrium in human populations and signatures of evolution due to recombination were investigated. Direct PRDM9 binding sites were identified using ChIP-seq in human cells. We show that in contrast to mouse, PRDM does not localise peaks of recombination in human1. Recombination is more rapid and intense in PAR1 than in autosomes. PAR hotspot activities differ significantly among human populations. Recomb hotspots have changed between human and chimpanzee with no sharing among hotspots.
Myogenesis is the process by which myoblasts fuse to form multinucleated myotubes. During myogenesis, muscle-specific genes are silenced by epigenetic modifications at their promoters, including histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation. Derepression of the promoter of the myogenic factor myogen ( Myog ) is key for the initiation of myogenesis. The mechanism of H9 demethylation at the Myog promoter is unclear. Here, we identify a new isoform of the histone demethylase JMJD2/KDM4 that lacks the N-terminal demethylase domain (Δ-JMJD2). The amount of Δ-JM2 increases during the differentiation of C2C12 myoblast into myotubes. Genome-wide expression profiling and exon-specific siRNA knockdown indicate that, in contrast to the full-length, ΔM2 is necessary for myotube formation and muscle-specific expression. Moreover, ΔM promotes MyD-induced conversion of NIH3T3 cells into muscle cells. ChIP-chip analysis indicates Δ binds mainly to genes involved in transcriptional control and this binding is linked to activation. Δ is recruited to the My promoter at the onset of differentiation. This binding is essential to promote demethylation of H3me and H3. We conclude that induction of the ΔM isoform is crucial for myogenesis by the removal of repressive chromatin marks at My, promoting transcriptional activation of My and contributing to muscle-specific expression.
The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) is a global effort to eradicate Guinea worm disease (GWD), one of the two Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) targeted by the World Health Organization (WHO). The programme is in its final stages, with only 25 cases reported in 2016. However, eradication requires certification by WHO of absence of transmission in all countries. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the GWEP in the end, when the number of cases is lower and the cost per case is higher than at any time. We estimate the cost of implementation, pre-certification, and certification stages using data from the GWEP and model cost-effectiveness in 1986–203. We compare the GWEP to two scenarios: doing nothing since 1986 and control only surveillance and response 201–203. We report cost per case averted, per disability adjusted life year (DAL) averted, and per risk year averted. We assess cost-effectiveness against one GDP per capita less than US$500 in low income countries. The GW cost US$11.95 (4.70–12.49 ) per caseverted in 198–203. The pre-cert and certification phases cost US.004 and.001 per capita per year. The DALverted by GW relative doing is US222 (118–372) in198–203. GW is more cost-effective control by 203. GW is cost control if willing to pay one life without risk GWD US. Even if costs are twice financial, GW still cost relative nothing. Whether GW most cost alternative depends on horizon.
Lyme disease is caused by spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, including Borrelia burgorferi sensu stricto, Boria afzelii, and Boria garinii. These spiroes evade the human immune system by inhibiting the classical complement pathway of the innate immune response. The classical pathway is initiated by C1, a serine protease that cleaves C4 and C2 to form C3 convertase. BB32 is a protein from Boria burgorferi sensu stricto that inhibits C1 by binding to its carbox-terminal domain, BB32-C. We investigated the function of BB32 orthologs from Boria afii and Bor garii, BAD16 and BGD, respectively. Our data show that BAD-C exhibits BB32-like activities in all tested assays, including high-affinity binding to C1 and C and inhibition of the classical pathway. Recombinant BGD also bound C and C with high-affinity but exhibited reduced in vitro inhibitory activities relative to BB32 or BAD. Interestingly, natively produced GD weakly recognized C relative to BB and BAD, unlike these proteins GD did not confer protection from serum killing. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to convert BB32 to resemble GD at three positions that are identical in BB and BAD but different in GD. The resulting chimera mimicked the properties of GD. We solved the structure of BB32 to 1. 7Å resolution. BB32 adopts an anti-parallel four-helix fold with a helix protruding from the core. The structure revealed the residues targeted in the chimera are surface-exposed, supporting their relevance in C binding. Additional assays showed BB only recognized C fragments containing the serine domain.
Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that undergoes morphological and transcriptional adaptation from commensalism to pathogenicity. Previous gene knockout studies have identified factors involved in this transformation, but it remains unclear how they are coordinated. We investigated morphogenetic control by post-translational phosphorylation, focusing on cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc. We identified Fkh2 as a target of Cdc and cell wall biosynthesis kinase Cbk, in a distinct role from conserved function in cell cycle. In stationary yeast cells, F2 has diverse phosphoisoforms. A window before hyph induction, phosphorylation is transformed before reverting to yeast profile. This does not occur in stationary cells reinoculated into fresh medium supporting growth. Mass spectrometry and mutational analyses identified residues phosphorylated by Cdc and Cbk. Substitution with nonosphory alanine altered phosphorylation and abrogated transformation to hyal profile. Transcript profiling revealed hyal phosphorylation required expression of genes in pathogenesis, host interaction and biofilm. These changes resulted in defects in pathogenic processes. We identified Fkh with chromatin modifier Pob in phosphorylation-dependent manner, providing a mechanism for phosphorylation to regulate specificity.
Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, possesses both de novo and salvage pathways for the biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. The enzyme thymidine kinase ( TK ) catalyzes the formation of thymidine monophosphate ( dTMP ) and uridine monophosphate ( dUMP ) and is one of several enzymes redundant to the de novo pathway. We show that TK is essential for growth and infectivity in a mouse model and that catalytic activity is required for function. Unlike humans and other kinetoplastids, T. brucei lacks dCMP deaminase ( DCT ) which provides an alternative route to dUMP formation. Ectopic expression of human DCT rescues the RNAi growth phenotype and allows for selection of viable TK null cells. Metabolite profiling by LC/MSMS reveals a buildup of deoxyrimidine nucleides in TK depleted cells. Knockout of cytidine deaminase (DA), which converts deoxycidine to deuridine leads to thym/deuridine auxotrophy. These results suggest T. bri encodes an unidentified 5’-ucleidase that converts deoxyrim nucleides to their corresponding nucleosides, leading to buildup in TK depleted cells at expense of dTP. Bioinformatics identifies several candidate genes that encode 5’idase activity including an HD protein that catalyzes dephosphorylation deoxyonucleotide 5-monosph. We conclude TK is essential for synthesis thym nucleides regardless of nucleide precursors from de novo or salvage.
The absence of a ribosome-binding site (Shine-Dalgarn sequence) is a common feature of many prokaryotic mRNAs. However, it is unknown how translation is initiated in these mRNAs lacking Shine-Darn sequences. We performed a genome-wide search of prokary mRNAs to identify elements or RNA structural motifs that could mediate translation initiation in Shine-Dalg–independent mRNAs. We found that Shinealg–independent mRNAs are generally less structured in their initiation region and show a minimum of mRNA folding at the start codon. Using reporter constructs in bacteria, we provide experimental support for local RNA unfolding determining start cod recognition in Shinealgindependent translation. We also show that AUG codons reside in single-stranded regions, whereas internal codons are usually in structured regions of mRNA. Our results suggest that absence of RNA secondary structure is necessary and sufficient to initiate Shinealg–dependent translation.
In Bihar, India, a region highly endemic for Leishmania donovani, 874 patients with laboratory-confirmed visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) were treated with 20 mg/kg intravenous liposomal amphotericin B ( Ambisome ) as first-line treatment between July 2007 and August 2012. This study describes the characteristics of patients who returned to the Méins Frontières ( MS ) supported treatment programme with post-kala Dermal leishiasis ( PKDL ), a skin disorder occurring in up to 10% of VL patients. Over a 5-year period, Ambome was administered in four doses of 5/kg to a total 20/kg with a high cure rate ( 99. 3% ) and low default rate ( 0.3% ). All patients received health education on PK symptoms and to return to MS if symptoms developed. This is an observational cohort study of programme outcomes. Of 831 patients completing first VL treatment, 24 (0.3% ) returned with symptoms confirmed PKDL from clinical history, appearance and slit-skin examination. Of 24, 89% had macular lesions with median (0.8–2.2 ) years to development following treatment. Comparison of VL patients treated Ambome who developed PKDL with remaining did not identify risk factors. However, time to PKDL was shorter with Ambome in patients presenting PK following sodiumstibogluconate VL treatment.
Chagas disease is a major public health problem in South America. It is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by the insect vector Triatoma infestans. Control of the disease depends on the control of the vector. Unfortunately, the vector has been resurgent in some areas. To understand the dynamics of reinfestation, we developed continuous and discrete models of patch-level infestation. These models can elucidate different aspects of re-establishment of T. infans, the main vector of Chagas, in three villages in northwest Argentina after community-wide insecticide spraying in October 1992. We compared different methods of estimating probabilities of establishment on each site. The results confirmed previous showing a 6-month lag between detection of new infestation and dispersal events. The analysis showed more bugs became established from May to November than from November to May. This increase in establishment coincides with increase in dispersal distance. In the models, probability of establishment increases with time since last infestation. These effects of season and previous inf on establishment challenge current understanding of T.ans ecology and highlight gaps in knowledge. Experiments are necessary to close these gaps.
Polyomavirus SV40 (SV40) is a small DNA virus that infects hamsters. We studied the effects of SV40 microRNA on pathogenesis in vivo. Syrian hamsters are a good model for studying SV40. We infected hamsters with different SV40 variants and measured viral DNA in tissues. All SV40 strains established persistent infections and cleared slowly. SV40 infected many tissues, including liver, kidney, spleen, and brain. Liver and kidney had more viral DNA than other tissues. Kidney was best for long-term infection. SV40RNA was expressed in wild-type SV-infected tissues. MicroRNA-negative viruses had more DNA than wild-type SV in liver and kidney. Viruses with complex regions had more DNA in kidney than simple regions. Early transcripts were higher than late in liver and kidney. Infectious was infrequently detected. Clearance of micro-deficient viruses was limited. Wild and micro-negative SV showed similar transformation and tumor rates in vitro and vivo.
Genome-wide scans for positively selected genes (PSGs) in mammals provide insight into the dynamics of genome evolution, the genetic basis of differences between species, and the functions of individual genes. We present the most comprehensive examination of mammalian PSGs to date, using six high-coverage genome assemblies available for eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset results in improved power and permits new lineage and clade tests to be applied. We identified ∼16, 500 genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two species, 400 showed significant evidence of positive selection (FDR<0.05), according to a standard ratio test. An additional 144 showed evidence of selection on lineages orades. PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception and reproduction, but also for specific functions such as complement immunity and perception. Several pathways were strongly for PSG, suggesting co-evolution of genes. A Bayesian analysis indicated PSG switched between selection and nonselection, suggesting positive is often episodic. PSGs were expressed at lower, in a manner than non-PSGs. Genes expressed in spleen, test, liver, and breast were for PSG, but no for PSG among brain genes.
Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the skin and mucosal surfaces of mammals. Persistent S. aureus infections often involve surface-associated communities called biofilms. We report the discovery of a novel extracellular fibril structure that promotes S. aureus biofilm integrity. Biochemical and genetic analysis revealed that these fibers have amyloid properties and consist of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins ( PSMs ). Mutants unable to produce PSM are susceptible to biofilm disassembly by matrix degrading enzymes and mechanical stress. Previous work associated PSM with bio disassembly and present data showing soluble PSM disperse biofilms while polymerized P do not. This suggests P aggregation into amyloid modulates biological role in biofilms.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, infects more than six million individuals in more than 20 countries. Monitoring parasite persistence in infected individuals is important to develop and evaluate treatments to control the disease. Routine screening for infected individuals is achieved by serological assays and PCR to monitor spontaneous or therapy-induced parasitological cure has limitations due to fluctuating parasitic load in blood. The aim of this study is to evaluate a newly developed antibody assay as indirect method to assess parasite persistence based on waning of antibodies following spontaneous or therapy clearance of infection. We designed multiplex serology assay of fifteen T cruzi antigens to evaluate antibody in 165 serum samples from chronic Chagas patients. One antibody (Ab3) showed strong correlation with T cruz parasite persistence determined by cruz PCR results. High Ab3 was strongly associated with PCR in untreated patients whereas decline in Ab was observed in B-treated who cleared parasia based blood results. Ab is new biomarker strongly correlates parasite in chronic and benidazole-treated Chagas. We hypothesize Ab is induced incessant stimulation of immune by tissue and shed parasites not detectable by PCR.
Chikungunya virus (CHV) is an arthrogenic alphavirus that causes fever and severe joint and muscle pain. In a fraction of patients, chronic musculoskeletal pain persists for months to years after infection. We have a poor understanding of what promotes chronic disease. While replicating virus has not been detected in joint tissues of patients with arthritis nor in animal models at convalescent points, viral RNA is detected after infection. We developed a recombinant CHV that expresses Cre recombinase (CHV-3-C). CH-C replicated in myoblast and fibroblasts and induced arthritis during phase in mice. Importantly, also induced chronic disease, persistent RNA and myitis synovitis similar to wild-type CHV. CH-C infection tdato mice resulted in tdato cells that persisted at least days. Immunofluorescence and cytometric profiling revealed tdato cells were predominantly myofib and dermal muscleblasts. Treatment with antibody against Mra, a defined receptor CHV, reduced td cells in phase and diminished levels, implicating tdato cells as reservoir of RNA. Finally, isolation and cytometry sorting tdato fibblasts from ankle and analysis revealed tdato cells most persistent CHV at points.
Recent studies have applied dimensionality reduction methods to understand how the multi-dimensional structure of neural activity in the brain gives rise to function. However, it is unclear how these results generalize to recordings with larger numbers of neurons and trials or relate to the underlying network structure. Here, we address these questions by applying factor analysis to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates and spiking network models that self-generate activity through excitation and inhibition. We compared the scaling of two outputs of dimension reduction—shared dimension and percent variance—with neuron count. We found that the properties of networks with clustered connectivity differed, and in vivo recordings were consistent with the network. Furthermore, recordings tens of neurons were sufficient to identify the modes of variability that generalize to larger of the network.
Quorum Sensing Volatile Molecule 2-aminoacetophen Modulates Host Immune Responses in a Manner that Promotes Life with Unwanted Pathogens. We show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa-regulated 2-aminoacetone (2-AA) modulates host immune responses in a manner that increases host ability to cope with pathogen. Mice treated with 2-AA prior to infection had 90% survival compared to 10% survival observed in non-pretreated infected mice. 2-AA activates innate immune pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPs), nuclear factor (NF)-κ, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but attenuates immune activation upon pretreatment by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines.2 host pretreatment is characterized by transcriptionally regulated c-J N-terminal (JNK) and NFκ activation with preserved extracellular regulated kinase (ER)1/2. These changes lead to CA/enhancer proteinβ (c/EBβ) activation and c/EBβ-p65 complex that prevents NFκ activation.2 dampens inflammatory processes while increasing survival and path persistence concurs with ability to signal bacteria switch to chronic mode.
Mammalian genomes are composed of many active and fossil retroelements, including LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons, which are mobile genetic elements that can jump from one location to another in the genome. LINE-1 elements can be domesticated by the host genome, leading to important innovations in genome defense and evolution. The L1D1 gene is the only known domesticated gene whose protein-coding sequence is entirely derived from a LINE-1 element. It has been shown to play a role in maintaining pluripotency, the ability of cells to differentiate into any cell type. We investigated the origin and evolution of L1 to understand its role in pluripotency. We found that L1 originated in the common ancestor of eutherian mammals, but was lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution. We also found that L1 evolved under positive selection in primate and mouse, and prosimian L1 acquired a recent L1 ORF from the prosian genome. These data suggest L1 has been selected for novelty, perhaps for a role in genome defense. L1 loss is associated with L extinction in several lineages, but not sigmodine rodents. We hypothesize L1 could have evolved for defense against L elements. Later, L1 may have become plurotency in some lineages. Our study highlights the role of retroelement domestication in mammalian biology and that domestic genes can adopt functions in lineages.
Bacterial ribonuclease Y (RNase Y) is a highly conserved protein that plays a role in processing the 3′ end of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 70 ribosome quality control in Escherichia coli (E. coli). Although Y is not essential in E. coli, loss of Y severely sensitizes it to multiple stresses. Here, we show that Y is an endoribuclease in Vibrio cholera (V. cholera) and is crucial for virulence, stress, RNA processing, and ribosome quality, and is part of a set of RNases in most pathogens. We analyzed RNA and ribosome profiles of V. cholera partially depleted for Y and other RN mutants with 16 rRNA; results show Y is also crucial for 16 r 3′ maturation in V. cholera and impedes subunit assembly into 70 ribosomes. Y's importance to V cholera was demonstrated by complete loss of colonization and biofilm formation, reduced cholera toxin, and altered levels of virulence RNAs of V cholera depleted Y. Notably, Y genes of distantly related can complement E coli ΔY under stress, showing conservation of Y's activity in stress.
Many developmental, physiological, and behavioral processes depend on the precise expression of genes in space and time. Such spatiotemporal gene phenotypes arise from the binding of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) to DNA, and the regulation of nearby genes that binding causes. These nearby genes may encode TFs, giving rise to a transcription network (TFN), wherein TFs represent nodes and edges denote regulatory interactions TF. Computational studies have linked topological properties of TFNs, such as degree, with robustness of TF’s expression to genetic and environmental perturbation. Another topological property is assortativity, which measures nodes with similar numbers of edges to connect. In networks, assortativity comprises four components that form an assortativity signature. We know little about how TF’s assortativity affects robustness of gene phenotype to perturbation. Recent results suggest increasing one component of TF’s assortativity leads increased phenotypic robust, but biological context is limited because signatures real-world TFNs have not been characterized. It is unclear these findings biologically relevant. Moreover, not known how other components contribute to phenic robust TFNs. We use publicly available DNase-seq data to measure genome-wide TFs in 41 human cell types. We find TFs share common assortativity signature that confers robust to TFNs. We determine extent each component contributes robustness.
In this study, we investigated how populations of inhibitory (IN) and excitatory (EX) neurons in the neocortex encode stimulus-related information. We recorded the activity of ensembles of up to 74 neurons along all layers 3–4 of the anesthetized rat somatosensory barrel cortex using 128-channel multi-electrode arrays. We found that individual IN neurons, classified by their extracellular waveforms, discriminated between 6 stimulus classes better than EX neurons in granular and infragran layers. We also found that ensembles of IN provided as much information about stimuli as ensembles of the 20 most informative EX neurons, but with less redundancy.
Synthetic biology aims to reprogram living cells to perform new functions for a variety of applications. Recent work has focused on transcription factors, but regulatory RNAs have gained attention due to their high programmability. However, functional circuits mainly implemented with RNAs are limited. Here we engineer a fundamental logic unit based on riboregulation to sum two bits of information encoded in molecular concentrations. Our circuit robustly performs intended computation in a cell encoding result as fluorescence amplitudes. The system exploits post-transcription control to tightly silence genes with small RNAs, together with allosteric transcription to sense molecular signals.
Cytolic 5′-ucleidase II (c-II) is an enzyme that regulates intracellular nucleotide pools by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of 6-hydroxypine nucleide 5′-ophosphates. High levels of c-II are correlated with poor outcome in cancer patients treated with cytotoxic nucleide analogues. To understand its role in resistance to therapy, we screened ribonucleide phosphates as potential c-II inhibitors. These compounds have a stable phosphorus-carbon linkage instead of a phosphoester bond. Among them, six were better ligands than natural c-II substrate inosine 5-ophosphate (IMP). We studied purine and pyrimide analogues and modified the phosphon chain to define affinity rules. The strength of these compounds was studied in silico and explained by van der Waals, highlighting three c-II residues Phe 157, His 209, and Tyr 210. Docking was confirmed by experimental measurements of nucleid activity in presence of best phosphon analogues. These induced total inhibition of-II at 2mM.
Prions have been detected in milk and colostrum from sheep incubating natural scrapie, a transmissible spong encephalopathy (TSE). This is the first evidence of prion infectivity in dairy products from SE-affected ruminants entering the animal and human food chain. PrP was detected in mammary secretions from scrap-affected ewes by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. PrSc accumulation was found in lactal ducts and mamary acini of ewes harbouring mammary ectopic lymphoid follicles due to Maedi lentivirus infection. However, prion infectivity was present in milk and colostrum from ewes with lympho-proiferative chronicitis and those with lesion-free mammary glands. In milk and colstrum, infectivity was recovered in cellular and casein-whey fractions. Bioassay revealed the highest infectious titre in milk was equivalent to 6g of brain from terminally scrap-affected ewe.
During the 2014–2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Liberia, a total of 16,370 laboratory samples were tested between April 4, 2014 and March 29, 2015. Of these, 10,536 individuals were traceable, of whom 3,897 were confirmed positive for Ebola virus RNA. There were significant differences in sex, age, and place of residence between confirmed and suspected cases that tested negative for Ebola RNA. Confirmed cases were more likely to be male and reside in urban areas, while suspected cases were more likely to be female and reside in rural areas. Confirmed cases were also more likely to be young and elderly. The case fatality rate of confirmed cases decreased from 80% to 63% during the study period.
Tyrosin (EC 1. 14. 18.1 ) is a copper monooxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of phenol to the corresponding orthoquinone. Tyrosin forms a complex with the cie protein, which facilitates the transport of copper ions into the active center. Previous studies have shown that the Tyr98 residue in cie, accommodated in the active center of tyin, is converted to a quinone through the formation of μ2:2-pero-dopper II and CuII-dasiquinone intermediates. However, the catalytic mechanism of tyin has not been clear at the atomic level. In this study, cryo-trapped crystal structures of tyin were determined at resolutions 1.16–1.70 Å. The structures suggest that hydroxylation is triggered by movement of Cu, inducing syn-anti rearrangement of copper ligands after formation of μ2:2-pero-dopper II core. This rearrangement places hydroxyl of substrate in equatorial position, allowing electrophil attack by CuO2 oxidant.
The assembly of the large ribosomal subunit is one of the least understood stages of eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis. The first precursor to the large ribosomal subunit, the pre-60S particle, contains 30 assembly factors (AFs), including the Dbp helicase, which is presumed to drive conformation rearrangements. However, the mechanisms by which Dbp helase is targeted to its substrate within pre-ribosomal particles and its precise role remain largely unknown. We show that Dbp helase associates with a complex of four AFs, namely Npa, N2, N8, and R3, prior to incorporation into the 90 preribosomal particles. Npa forms the backbone of the complex and directly binds Dbp helase. N is essential for insertion of Db helase into 90 preribosomal particles. By in vivo cross-link analysis, we map Npa binding sites on 25 rRNA adjacent to root helices of first and last secondary domains 25 r. This supports the notion that N and Dbp function in formation of root helices largeunit rRNAs which creates core of ribosomalunit structure. N also crosslinks snoRN involved decoding and peptid transfer center and in vicinity of binding sites on 25 r. Our data suggest Db helase and N complex play key in compaction of core 25 r and control sno-rRNA interactions.
Catecholaminergic Regulation of Learning in a Dynamic Environment: Adaptive behavior in a changing environment requires adapting one’s rate of learning to the rate of environmental change. Recent studies have examined the computational mechanisms by which various factors determine the impact of new outcomes on existing beliefs ( i. e., the learning rate ). However, the mechanisms and the brain, in the neuromodulators involved this are largely unknown. Here we report evidence from a study employing pharmacology, electrophysiology and modeling ( N = 32 ) that suggests an important role cateolamines in learning regulation. We found the P component of the electrophys index of outcome-evoked cateolamine release in cortex predicted learning, and mediated the effect of prediction-error on learning. P also mediated the effects of variables—capturing the of an outcome and the of preexisting—on learning. Furthermore, pharmac manipulation of cateamine affected learning following changes, in that depended participants’ learning.
Since 2010–2016, two Point-of-Care (POC) laboratories have been implemented in the rural Salm region of Senegal. In parallel, a homemade syndromic surveillance system called EPIC was implemented to monitor infectious diseases using data produced by the PO laboratory of Timone in Marseille, France. The aim of this study is to describe the steps for implementing EPIC using data produced by PO laboratories in rural Senegal. After implementing EPIC, we started to monitor 15 pathogens routinely in PO using the same methodology used in France. In 5 years, 2, 577 samples from 775 patients have been tested in Diel and Nop laboratories. 739 samples were found to be positive to at least one pathogen. Retrospective analysis of Diel andop data with EPIC allowed 443 alarms. Since January 2016, samples from 298 patients have been processed in Niak laboratory. samples were found to be positive at least one pathogen. Retrospective of Niak data with EPIC allowed alarms.
Vascular endothelial cells are a key component of multicellular systems that function in response to external stimuli. However, the mechanisms of intercellular signaling and their functional implications in vascular structures are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the roles of endothelial cell arrangement in collective signaling and contractility using a combination of computational modeling and lithography. We found that endothelial cells self-assembled in microengineered networks, but not individual monolayers, exhibit calcium oscillations under histamine stimulation. Pharmacological inhibition and modeling revealed that calcium oscillations depend on the number of neighboring cells coupled via gap junction intercellular communication, providing a mechanistic basis for architecture-dependent signaling. Furthermore, calcium oscillations attenuate histamine-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and contraction, resulting in architecture-dependent responses. Our results suggest that endothelial cells sense and respond to chemical stimuli according to vascular architecture via collective signaling.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory disease in infants. We previously elucidated the repertoire of antibodies following RSV infection in infants. In this study, we examined the contribution of antigenic regions outside the central conserved cystine domain (CCD) to RSV immunity. We evaluated the immunogenicity, neutralization and protective efficacy of RSV antigen sites following primary infection using recombinant E. coli expressed ectodomain (REG), CCD-deleted ectomain (REGΔD), N- and C-terminal subdomains and antigen peptides. REGΔD, N and C-terminal subdomains and peptides generated antibody titers in rabbits and mice that bound glycosylated recombinant mammalian ectomain (RM) and intact RSV particles, but minimal in vitro neutralization titers compared to intact ectomain. Vaccinated mice were challenged intranasally with RSV-A Line 19. Viral replication in nasal cavity and lungs was reduced in vaccinated compared to unimmun controls. Control viral loads post-R challenge correlated with serum binding to particles. In addition, low Th2/Th cytokines were found lungs REGΔ vaccinated after challenge. These data demonstrate multiple protective sites RSV protein outside CCD contribute to development bacterially unglyated protein safe vaccine against R disease.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the specification of the FMRFamide neuropeptide neurons in the ventral nerve cord (VNC)4 is controlled by a retrograde signal from their target cells. This signal acts as the final trigger to activate the FMRF gene. A genetic screen identified several genes involved in Tv4 specification, two of which encode components of the U5 subunit of the spliceosome: b2 ( 3 72 )Ab and Pr8. This study focuses on the role of RNA processing in target-derived signaling. We found that b2 and Pr8 play crucial roles in the expression of the FMa neuropeptide in Tv neurons of the VNC. Detailed analysis of b2 revealed that this is executed by two mechanisms, both required for activation of the retrograde signaling in Tv4: (1) axonal pathfinding to target tissue to receive BMP ligand (2) RNA splicing of genes in the pathway: thickve (tk) encoding BMP receptor subunit and Medea encoding co-S. These results reveal involvement of RNA in diversifying neuronal identity within the nervous system.
The abundance of substrate receptor subunits of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) is tightly controlled to maintain the repertoire of CRLs. However, unbalanced levels can lead to sequestration of CRL components by overabund substrate. We describe an additional pathway for regulation of F-box proteins on the example of Met30. This ubiqulation and degradation acts on Met30 is dissociated from Sk1. Unexpected, this pathway required the cull component Cdc/C1 but was independent of other SC component Sk1. This non-canonical pathway is critical for chromosome stability and defense against heavy stress.
Kinesin-3 motors are a family of proteins that drive the transport of synaptic vesicles and membrane-bound organelles in neuronal cells. In the absence of cargo, Kines motors are kept in an inactive state to prevent motility and ATP hydrolysis. Current models suggest that Kines-3 motor KIF1 is monomeric in the inactive state and that activation results from concentration-driven dimerization on the membrane. However, we have examined the activity and dimer state of KIF1 and found that both native and recombinant proteins are dimer in the inactive state. Thus, KIF1 motors are not activated by cargo-induced dimerization. Instead, we show that K1 motors are autoinhibited by two distinct inhibitory mechanisms, suggesting a model for activation of dimer K1 motors by cargo binding. Successive truncations result in monom and dimer motors that can undergo one-dimensional diffusion along microtubule lattice. However, only dimer motors undergo ATP-dependent processive motility.
Metabolic Profiling of a Population Reveals New Insights into the Regulation of Seed Metabolism and Its Relation to Fruit.
V. choleraeae is a pathogenic bacterium that colonizes both the chitinous exoskeleton of zooplankton and the human gastrointestinal tract. Colonization of these niches is mediated by the N-acetylucosamine binding protein Gbp, which has been shown to mediate bacterial attachment to both chitin and mammalian mucin. We report here that Gbp possesses an elongated, four-domain structure with domains 1 and 4 showing structural homology to chitin binding domains. A glycan screen revealed that Gbp binds GlcNA oligosacides. Structure-guided Gbp truncation studies show that domains 1 and 4 of Gbp interact with chitin in vitro, whereas in vivo complementation studies reveal that domain 1 is crucial for mucin binding and intestinal colonization. Bacterial studies show that domains 2 and 3 of Gbp bind V. cholera surface. Finally, mouse virulence studies show that only the first three domains of Gbp are required for colonization.
The immune response to pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is characterized by chronic T cell activation. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood and thought to rely on the control of effector T cells (Teff) by regulatory T cells (Treg). Our study shows that circulating Treg cells in adults with TB preserve their suppressive potential, but eff cells from subjects are resistant to Treg suppression. This is due to the expansion of an eff subset identified by Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DR expression. This subset is resistant to suppression, but depletion restores sensitivity to control levels. Comparative analysis of eff cells with HLA-DR+ versus the fraction of this population identified putative mechanisms linked to IFNG, IL-17, IL-22, PD-1 and chemokines CCL3, C4. Antibody experiments confirmed HLA+ eff cells, not the fraction of H-, to be resistant Treg mediated via C5 and PD1 pathways. In presence HLA eff, activation of downstream C5 and PD1 was perturbed. In addition, HLA eff expressed higher levels of Th1/17 cytokines that may Treg through a counter-balancing relationship.
Propagation of RML Prions in Mice Expressing Pr Devoid of GPI Leads to Formation of a Novel, Stable Prion Strain.
In Drosophila embryos, the BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) signaling pathway plays a conserved role in dorsal-ventral axis patterning during embryonic development. BMP signaling is transduced by the transcription factor Mad and opposed by the repressor Brinker. Using Drosila as a model, we combined RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) with Brinker Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify the BMP-responsive transcription network underlying differentiation of the dorsal ectoderm during dorsal-vent axis patterning. We identified multiple BMP target genes, including positive and negative regulators of the EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) signaling pathway. We found that EGF negatively regulates embryonic BMP transcription. The BMP network has a self-regulating property that balances its activity with that of the antagonistic EGF pathway to facilitate patterning. We identified key roles for the transcription factors Zelda and Zerküll in establishing the resulting domain and widespread binding of insulator proteins to Mad and Brinker-bound genomic regions.
Leishmaniasis is a zoonotic cutaneous disease caused by Leishmania major parasites. In Tunisia, the disease is spreading from the south to new areas in the center. To understand the evolution and population dynamics of L. major, we performed multi-locus microsatellite typing of human isolates from governorates where the disease is endemic ( Gaf, Kairan and Sidi Bouid ) collected during 1991–1992 and 200–2012. We analyzed the genotypes of isolates collected in Sidi Bouid 199–199 and 200–201 using F-statistics and Bayesian-based approach. The results show that over two decades, Leish parasites evolved by generating genetically differentiated populations. The genetic patterns of 200–201 isolates from three governorates indicate that L major populations did not spread from south to center Tunisia according to geographical gradient. This suggests human activities might be source of disease expansion. Bayesian model and F-stat analysis of genotypes between governor and districts suggest that human activities as well as reservoir and environmental changes explain disease progression. This study provides new insights into evolution and spread of major in Tunisia that might improve understanding of parasite between geographically and temporally distinct populations.
Helminth infections are a major cause of morbidity among HIV-infected adults. Current helth guidelines focus on deworming of targeted populations. However, the role of water, sanitation, and hygiene ( WASH ) interventions in reducing helth transmission is not well understood. We conducted a cohort study within a randomized trial of empiric dewing of HIV-infected adults in Kenya. Helmin infections were diagnosed using semi-quantitative real-time PCR. We evaluated the impact of different helth packages on infection, including treatment with albendazole and prazantel with and without W access. Approximately 22% of 701 stool samples were helmin-infected, mostly of low to moderate intensity. The odds of infection with any helmin species were lower for individuals treated with albend (OR:0.11, 95%CI:.05,.20, p<.001 ), adjusting for age and sex. Although W conditions demonstrated minimal benefit in reducing infection, access to safe flooring offered additional protection (OR:.34 95CI:.20.56, p<.001 ). For schistosomiasis, treatment with prantel was protective (OR.30CI.14.60 p.001 ). Among individuals not treated with albend or prant, the most protective package included flooring (OR.34CI.59 p.001 ) and latrine access (.59CI.99.05 ). There was no evidence of synergy or antagonism between anthelmic chemotherapy and W resources.
Bacterial lectin-like bacteriocins are proteins produced by plant-associated bacteria that are capable of killing closely related species, including phytopathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas. The mode of action of these bacteriocins remains unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of LlpW, a lectin-like bacteriocin from Pseudomon putida. LlpW has an architecture of two monocot mannose-binding lectin ( MBL ) domains and a C-terminal β-hair extension. The C-terminal MBL domain adopts a fold similar to MBL domains from plant lectins and contains a binding site for mannose oligosaccharides. Mutational analysis indicates that an intact sugar-binding site in this domain is crucial for bactericidal activity. The N-terminal MBL domain adopts the same fold but is structurally divergent and lacks mannose-binding site.
During the process of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis, the forespore resides within the mother cell and is regulated by the forespore transcription factor σ. However, the regulation of σ at this stage has remained enigmatic. We show that σ activity requires the mother-cell encoded SpoII proteins and foresore protein SpoQ. The SpoII proteins share similarity with components of specialized secretion systems, one of which is a secretion ATPase. We demonstrate that SpoII ATP motifs are required for σ activity. Furthermore, we show that SpoII and SpoQ reside in a multimeric complex spanning the foresore membranes. Finally, we show that these proteins are required to maintain foresore integrity. In their absence, the foresore develops invaginates and collapses. Importantly, maintenance of fores integrity does not require σ. These results support a model in which SpoII-SpoQ proteins form a novel secretion apparatus allowing the mother to nurture the foresore, thereby maintaining fores physiology and σ during spore maturation.
Although bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly heritable and disabling disease, it has been challenging to identify genetic variants associated with the disease. We present a genome-wide association study of 1, 190 cases and 401 controls, and additional samples for a total of 2,191 cases and 1,434 controls. We do not detect genome-wide significant associations for individual loci; however, across all SNPs we show an association between the power to detect effects from previous genome-wide association and evidence for replication (P =1.5×10−7 ). This result is not likely to be a false positive as it replicates in a large meta-analysis of height and shows a linear relationship between power and replication. Within BD, SNPs near exons exhibit a greater probability of replication, supporting an enrichment of reproducible associations near functional regions of genes. These results indicate that there is likely common variation associated with BD near exons (10 kb ) that could be identified in larger studies.
Genome-Wide Systematic Analysis Reveals Predictive Proliferation Signatures of Cancerous vs. Non-cancer Cells  
    Cell proliferation has been a long-standing goal of the scientific and cancer research communities. Previous genome-scale studies of proliferation determinants have mainly relied on knockdown screens to gauge effects on growth. This approach has limitations such as off-target effects, partial knockdown, and masking due to backups. Here, we assign each gene a Prolifer Index (PI ) that quantifies association between expression and growth measurements across 60 cell lines. We found genes essential in screens exhibit positive PI, while tumor suppressors exhibit negative PI. Cell cycle, replication, splicing, and production processes are positively associated with proliferation, while migration is negatively in accordance with the “go grow” dichotomy. Analysis of non-cancer proliferation (PI ) across lymphoblast lines reveals marked differences between cancerous and nonancer proliferation. These highlight translation and splice machineries as cancer-associated proliferation proteins. A comparison reveals proliferation that resembles while nonancer does not. Combining cancer and nonancer signatures leads to prediction of outcome and essentiality in cancer. These results point to difference between cancerous andancer proliferation determinants, contributing to novel anti-prolifer drugs.
Cysticercosis (CE) is a parasitic disease that can affect the heart and vena cava. A retrospective study of 11 patients with cardiac and/or vascular CE followed over 15 years (1995–2009) is reported. Clinical manifestations included thoracic pain and dyspnea, although 2 were asymptomatic. Cysts were mostly located in the right atrium and inferior vena cava. Nine were previously diagnosed with disseminated CE. Echocardiography was the diagnostic method of choice, although serology, electrocardiogram, chest-ray computed tomography/magnetic imaging and histology aided diagnosis and follow-up. Nine underwent cardiac surgery and received long-term antiparas treatment for median 25 months (4–93). One died intraoperatively due to cyst rupture and vascular dissemination. Two died 10 and 14 years after diagnosis due to pulmonary embolism and failure respectively. One was lost to follow. Patients with cardiac involvement did not have complications after surgery and were cured. There was one recurrence requiring second operation. Patients with vena involvement developed PE and presented complications.
Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes a wide range of diseases in humans and animals. Here, we describe a novel mechanism by which S. aureus modulates virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility through Tir, a Toll/interleukin receptor ( TIR ) mimic. Tir is part of a bacterial invasion mechanism that inhibits TLR signaling in eukaryotic cells by downregulating the NFkB pathway through TLR2, TLR, TLR, and TLR9. This results in reduced neutrophil and macrophage activity, confirming a role in virulence attenuation through inflammatory responses. Tir is associated with the staphlococcal chromosomal cassette (SCC ) containing fusidic acid resistance gene but not the mec gene. Fusidic acid subinhibits tir expression. Epidemiological studies show no link between this effector and clinical presentation but a selective advantage with SCC element carrying fus/tir.
In this study, we used whole-genome expression data from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the mosquito Anopheles gambia to search for changes in gene expression underlying differences in their respective embryonic morphologies. We found that many orthologous gene pairs could be clustered based on the presence of coincident discordances in their expression profiles. One cluster contained genes specifically expressed in the serosa of the mosquito. This cluster is redeployed later in development at the time of cuticle synthesis. We also found a striking difference in the expression of a subset of maternal genes. Specifically, transcripts that exhibit a sharp reduction at the time of maternal-zyotic transition in Dophila display sustained expression in Anophe embryo.
Haemophilus ducreyi and Treponema pallidum subsp. pertue are major causes of ulcers in children in Africa and the Pacific. We investigated the presence of H. duyi and T. pertue DNA in asymptomatic people, flies, and environmental surfaces in an endemic setting. We performed a cross-sectional study in rural villages of Lih Island, Papua New Guinea during a yaws elimination campaign. We recruited asymptomatic participants from households with cases of ulcers and without cases of ulcers. We rubbed swabs on the skin of leg of asymptomatic individuals and collected swabs of flies and surfaces. All specimens were tested by PCR for H. duyi and T. pertue DNA. Of 78 participants with adequate specimens, H duyi-PCR was identified in 16 ( 21% ) and pertuePCR in 1 ( 1 ). In subgroup analyses, du-PCR did not differ in exposed or not exposed to du ulcer in household (24% vs 18%; p 0. 76 ). Of cultures from asymptomatic, 2 (12 ) yielded du, proving skin colonization. Of flies tested 9 (90 ) had duyi and 5 (50 ) pertue. Of bed sampled 2 (33 ) had duyi and 1 (17 ) pertue. This is the first demonstration of duyi on asymptomatic skin and du and pertue in flies. The ubiquity du is a factor to the spread.
The International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Curriculum Task Force has developed a set of bioinformatics core competencies to provide a framework for training and curricula across diverse user groups and programs. These competencies were based on surveys of employers and training programs and refined through a multiyear community engagement process. The core competencies are intended to provide a common foundation for bioinformatics training across various career paths in biomedical research and healthcare.
Strongyloides stercoris is a parasitic nematode that infects over one billion people worldwide. It has a unique life cycle that includes both parasitic and free-living forms, which can be used to study the mechanisms of its developmentally arrested third-stage larva (L3). In contrast to other nematodes infecting humans, S. stercis has both parasitic and freeiving forms. The freeiving nemode Caenorhabditis elegans has a similar developmentally arrested larval form, the dauer, which is controlled by four pathways: cyclic GMP (cG) signaling, insulin/IG-1-like (IS) signaling, transforming factor β (TGF) signaling, and biosynthesis of dachronic acid (DA) ligands that regulate a nuclear receptor. We hypothesized that homologous pathways are present in S. stercis have similar regulation and are involved in L3 arrest and activation. We undertook a deep-sequencing study of the polyadenylated transcriptome generating 2. 3 billion paired-end reads from seven developmental stages. We constructed expression profiles for S. stis homologs of C elegans dauer genes by BLAST searches of S stis genome as well as de novo transcripts. Intriguing, genes encoding G pathway components were coordinately upregulated in L3. In contrast to C eleg, S stis has a paucity of genes encoding IS ligands, several of which have profiles suggesting involvement in L3 development. We identified Sis genes encoding homologs C eleg dauer TGF lig, three of which are expressed L3. Putative biosynthetic genes did not appear coordinately regulated L3. Our data suggest that dauer genes are in Sis and play a role L3, but there are differences between species.
Bacterial genotoxins, such as colibactin and Cytothal distending toxin ( CDT), secreted by pathogenic bacteria, can induce nuclear remodeling in cells. We investigated the effects of these genotoxins on nuclear remodeling in the context of cell survival using Helicobacter infected mice, coculture with CDT and colibact-secreting bacteria, hepatic and intestinal cells, and xenograft-derived mouse models. Our results show that CDT and colact induce nuclear remodeling associated with the formation of deep cytoplasmic invaginations in the nucleus of cells, corresponding to nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR). The NR core contains ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenylated RNA, and components of the complexCR involved in mRNA turnover. These structures are active sites of translation, correlated with high ploidy and involve MAP and calcium signaling. Additional data show that insulation of these ribonucleoparticles within the nucleus are dynamic and protect the cell until genotoxic stress is relieved. Bacterial genotoxin-induced NR would be a gateway for mRNA to be transported for local translation.
Lepromatous leprosy is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae that affects the skin, peripheral nerves, and mucous membranes. Facial deformity is a common sequela of lepromatous leprosy, caused not only by the nose but also by regression of the maxilla, as documented in paleopathological observations of excavated skeletal remains of patients with lepro. However, maxillary changes in living patients have been evaluated only by subjective grading. Here, we used three-dimensional computed tomography ( 3-CT ) to evaluate maxillary deformation in patients with lepro. Three-dimensional images of the maxilla were reconstructed using multiplan methods in former patients withlepro ( n = 10 ) and controls ( n = 5 ) ; the anterior-posterior length of maxilla ( MA ) was measured. The difference between MA of patients and controls was evaluated after compensating for skull size. These findings were compared with previous paleopathological studies. Three patients with lepromat leprosy showed marked maxillary atrophy atrophy (8.6, 11.1, and 17.9 mm ) consistent with visual maxillary deformity and paleopathological findings.
Identifying behaviorally relevant sounds in the presence of background noise is one of the most important challenges faced by the auditory system. An elegant solution to this problem would be for the system to represent sounds in a noise-invariant fashion. Since background noise alters the statistics of sounds reaching the ear, noise-invariant representations could be promoted by neurons adapting to statistics. Here, we investigated the extent of adaptation to mean and contrast of auditory as ascends the pathway. We measured forms of adaptation by presenting synthetic and natural sounds, responses in inferior collic and primary of cortex of anaesthetized ferrets, and these with a model of nerve. We find that both forms increases as asc the pathway. To whether adaptation contributes to construction of noisevariant sound, also presented natural sounds in noise, and a approach to assess the of the code. find that for in the periphery is affected by addition than the code. also that is correlated with adaptation, so that show the strongest to statistics also most-toler.
In this study, the yeast protein-protein interaction network (interactome) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was analyzed in response to heat shock, a well-characterized model of cellular stress. We calculated the changes in interaction weights of the interactome from changes in mRNA expression levels upon heat shock. The major finding is that heat induces a significant decrease in both the number of connections and overlaps of the interactome. The diameter of the interactome increased 4.9-fold in heat. Several proteins of the heat response became centers of heat-induced communities, as well as providing residual connections of modules after heat. The changes resemble a ‘stratus-culus’ transition of the interact structure, since the unstressed interact had a globally organization similar to stratus clouds, whereas the interact had a multifocal organization similar to cumulus. Our results show that heat induces partial disintegration of the organization of the interact. This may be occurring in many types of stresses. Other complex systems, such as proteins, social networks and ecosystems may also decrease intermodular links, develop compact modules and display partial disintegration of structure in initial crisis.
Chagas disease is a chronic condition caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi that affects millions of people in Latin America. Ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy, and amiodarone has been used to treat this condition. We conducted a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis to assess the effect of amiodone in patients with Chagas cardiomy. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and LACS up to January 2018 and included 9 studies ( 3 before studies, 5 case series and 1 randomized trial ) with a total of 38 patients allowing individual patient data analysis. Amiodone significantly reduced ventricular tachia in 99.9%, ventricular beats in 93.1% and ventricular couplets in 79%. Studies not included in individual data analysis showed similar reductions in ventricular beats, tachia and couplets. Amiodone was associated with corne microdepos in 61%, gastrointestinal events 16, bradycardia 12.7, dermatological 10.6 and drug discontinuation 7. Quality of evidence ranged from moderate to low.
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that is influenced by climatic and environmental factors, as well as human behavioral trends. In Ecuador, we analyzed 2009–2016 medical records of patients diagnosed with deng fever at two rural hospitals to determine short- and long-term seasonal patterns, as well as the effect of day of the week and public holidays. We used Poisson generalized modeling to determine the most important predictors of deng fever. The most important predictors were annual sinusoidal fluctuations in disease, long-term trends, day of the week, and hospital. Seasonal trends showed single peaks in diagnoses during mid-March. Compared to average days, cases were more likely to be diagnosed on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and less likely to be diagnosed on Saturdays and Sundays. Public holidays were not significant predictors of deng fever, except for an increase on the day after Christmas. School schedules did not impact deng diagnoses in school-aged children. We also examined the effect of climate on diagnosis and found that important variables included monthly precipitation, interaction between precipitation and minimum temperature, interaction between precipitation and days, and interaction between temperature, precipitation, and days.
Antiviral Protection via Rd-Mediated Stable Activation of Innate Immunity  
    We show that transgenic expression of picornavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), in the absence of other viral proteins, profoundly reconfigures mammalian antiral immunity by exposing normally membrane-sequestered Rd activity to innate detection. Rd-transgenic mice have life-long upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and show resistance to lethal viral challenge. The mechanism operates via MDA and MAV and is independent of the adaptive immune system. Multiple crosses with knockout mice (Rag1, Mavs, Ifnar, If1, Tlr3) established this. Human models recapitulated key features with fidelity, with Rd inducing analogous IS network and block to HIV-1 infection. Rd-mediated antiral does not depend on secondary structure within Rd mRNA but operates at protein level and requires Rd catalysis. Importantly, despite massive IS elevations, Rd mice are entirely healthy with normal longevity.
In this study, we tested the independent action hypothesis (IAH) for the plant virus Tobacco etch virus (TEV). IAH states that each virion has a probability of infection and virions act independently during the infection process. A corollary of IAH is that effective population size (Ne) must be dose-dependent. We tested IAH by infecting Nicotiana tabacum and Capsicum annuum plants with TE variants carrying GFP or mCherry fluorescent markers. We found that the number of primary infection foci increased linearly with dose and followed a Poisson distribution. At high doses, primary foci containing both genotypes were found at low frequency (<2% ). The probability that a genotype infected the inoculated leaf would systemically infect the plant was near 1, although few genotypes could be trapped in the inoculated leaf by other genotypes. The frequency of mixed-genotype infection could be predicted from the number of primary foci using the independent model. Our results suggest that IAH holds for TE and Ne is dose-dependent for this RNA virus. The number of virions causing systemic infection can be small and approaches 1 at low doses.
Most quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies have been carried out in single tissues or cell types using methods that ignore shared information across tissues. However, global analysis of RNA expression in multiple tissues is now feasible, but few statistical frameworks for joint analysis of expression across tissues with simultaneous analysis of multiple variants have been developed. We propose Bayesian models for eQTL within tissues and across tissues simultaneously. We tested on 2, 000 genes in four tissues and demonstrate our methods are more powerful than traditional in revealing eQ landscape at systems. We identified a cis/trans eQ model for the Hopx gene that was experimentally validated and not by conventional approaches. We showed common regulation of expression across tissues for ∼27% of transcripts, providing 5 fold increase in eQs compared with single analyses at 5% FDR.
Extrinsic apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that can be triggered by extracellular signals such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TN-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). When cells are exposed to these ligands, they enter a protracted period of variable duration during which only initiator caspases are active. This is followed by a sudden activation of downstream effector caspases that dismantle the cell. We constructed a mathematical model of extrinsic apoptosis based on a mass-action representation of known reaction pathways. The model was trained against experimental data obtained by live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblot of cells perturbed by depletion and overexpression. The model accurately reproduces the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, making it possible to study mechanisms in detail. We find that the duration of delay prior to effector caspase activation is determined by initiator casp-8 activity and rates of reactions immediately downstream of TR receptor. Sudden activation of effector casases is achieved by reactions involved in mitochondrial permeabilization and localization of proteins such as Smac.
Listeria monocytogenes secretes the virulence factor Internalin P (InP ) to breach the placental barrier during pregnancy. We show that InP binds to afadin, a protein associated with cell junctions, but not the similar L monocytogenin Lmo7. The structure of InP reveals an extended leucine-rich repeat ( LRR ) domain with a Ca2+-binding site. Despite af’s role in cell junction formation, MDCK cells expressing InP exhibit decreased traction on deformable substrates similar to AF-6 knock-out cells. L monocogenes ΔinP mutants are deficient in forming actin protrusions from polarized epithelial monolayers necessary for transcytosis. A similar phenotype is observed in bacteria expressing InP ΔRR, which disrupts InP’s interaction with af. However, af deletion in host cells does not rescue transcyt defect. We conclude that secreted In targets cytosolic af to promote L monocogen transcyosis across epithelial monolayers, contributing to crossing the basement during placental infection.
Syphilis is a chronic disease caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum ssp. pallumum. Little is known about the T. pallum proteome, the set of proteins expressed by the bacterium. To better understand the T. pallum proteome during infection, we studied T. pallum s. pallum DAL-1 bacteria isolated from rabbits using mass spectrometry techniques. We detected 603 peptides corresponding to 557 unique T. pallum proteins, representing 54% of the predicted proteome. This is the most comprehensive description of the T. pallum proteome to date.
Protein kinase A (PKA) is a key receptor for the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in eukaryotes. AMP binds to two tandem AMP-binding domains (CBD-A and -B) within the regulatory subunit of PKA (R), unleashing the activity of the catalytic subunit (C). CBD-A is required for PK inhibition and activation, while CBD functions as a “keeper” domain that modulates control exerted by CBD. CBD dynamics are critical for its gate function. Here, we investigate by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) the two-domain RIα (91–379) in apo, cAMP, and c-bound forms. Our NMR analyses lead to a double conformation selection model where each CBD samples active and inactive states independently of adjacent CBD within a degenerate free landscape. Such degener is critical for CBD sensitivity to weak interactions and high affinity for AMP. Binding AMP eliminates degener, stabilizing active conformation within CBD and inter-C contacts requiring AMP. The latter is contributed by CBD and mediates capping AMP to CBD-A. The inter-C interface is dispensable for intra-C conformation, but indispensable for PK activation as occludes Cunit sites within CBD.
Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is one of the most abundant proteins induced by interferon (IFN) and is associated with antiviral immunity. We compared the proteomes of IS15-/- and IS15+ bone marrow derived macrophages (BMD) after vaccinia (V) virus (VV) infection to identify components of IF and IS15 signaling. IS15/- BMD treated with IF showed altered mitochondrial and oxidative phosphorylation (OPHOS) pathways. Mitochondrial respiration, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive species (ROS) production was higher in IS+MD than IS/-MD following IF treatment. IS15 depletion changed macrophage polarization IS/-MD showed a proinflammatory cytokine pattern typical of M1 phenotype but blocked nitric oxide (NO) production and arginase-1 activation. Following IF treatment, NO was higher in IS+ than IS- macroages concomitant with decrease in viraliter. IS/- macroages were permissive for VV following IF treatment. Our results demonstrate IS15 governs mitochondrial functionality, specifically OPH and mitagy, broadening its role as antiral agent.
Viral protein (V) of HIV-1 is a multifunctional protein that plays a role in viral replication by degrading the cellular receptor CD4 and enhancing viral particle release. V binds to CD4 and recruits the βTr subunit of the SCβCP ubiquitin ligase complex through its constitutively phosphorylated DS52XX56 motif. In this process, V escapes degradation while inhibiting the degradation of βTr targets such as β-caten and Iκα. We show that V inhibitory function with respect to degradation of Em1 and Cdc25, twoTr substrates involved in cell-cycle. In these experiments, we underscore the importance of a novel phosphorylation in V. We show that in cells arrested in early mitosis, V undergoes phosphorylation of serine 61, which lies adjacent to βTr-binding. This event triggers V degradation by βTr-independent process. Mutation of V61 in HIV-1 provirus extends half-life and increases release of HIV-1 particles from HeLa. However, S61 determinant of V regulated turnover is conserved within HIV-1 isolates. Our results highlight a mechanism where phosphorylation of V determines fate as adaptor or substrate distinct ubiquitin ligases.
Tissue patterning is tightly coordinated with whole-body development to ensure robustness against environmental and physiological perturbations. We propose two hypotheses: pattering is coordinated with whole-body over time and patter aligns at developmental milestones. We developed a staging scheme for the wing imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae using canonical patter genes and linked to whole developmental events: moulting, larval and pupation. We used the scheme to explore how patter changes when developmental time is altered by temperature or hormone synthesis. We found patter in the disc always aligned at moul and pupation, indicating these events represent milestones. Between these, patter showed variability in response to temperature and physiological alterations. Our data showed discs from larvae greater variability in patter. Thus, does not appear to be a milestone. Our findings reveal patter remains robust against perturbations by aligning at milestones.
In fungal hyphae cells of Ustago maydis, the ESCRT regulator Did2 plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance between endocytic and long-distance transport functions of endosomes. Early endosomes in these cells are involved in both endocytosis and the transport of various cargoes, including mRNA and protein complexes. However, little is known about the interplay between these trafficking processes. We show that Did2 coordinates endosomal transport in Ustago may hyphae. Loss of Did2 results in defective vacuolar targeting, less processive long transport and abnormal endosome shuttling. Importantly, late endosomal Rab7 and vacuolar protease Pep1 exhibit increased shuttling on these aberrant endosomes, suggesting defects in endosomal maturation and identity. Consistently, motors fail to attach explaining disturbed processive movement. Furthermore, endosomal RNP linker Up1 is absent from endosomes, resulting in defects in long-distance mRNA transport.
Riboswitches are RNA elements that regulate gene expression in bacteria by binding to adenine. In Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio vulificus riboswitches differ in how they control gene expression. The ribwitch of B. subtilis controls transcription, while the ribwitch of V. vulnificus controls translation. We show that ribwitches differ in how they bind adenine and how they are regulated. The ribwitch of B. subis binds adenine during transcription, while the rib of V.nus can bind after transcription and still regulate translation. We also show that the rate of transcription is important for the ribwitch of B.is to function. This is consistent with transcriptional regulation. Our results suggest that the nature of regulation, transcription or translation, is important for ribwitch mechanisms.
Transcription initiation in bacteria involves the use of a 2- to 4 nucleotide oligonucleotide primer-dependent initiation (PDI), which has been shown to be prevalent at promoters of genes during the stationary phase of growth in Escheria coli. Here, we establish a physiological role for P in E. coli as a regulatory mechanism that modulates biofilm formation. We further demonstrate that P occurs in the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholera. A comparative analysis of P in V cholera and E coli reveals that the pattern of P is strikingly similar in the two. In particular, P is detected in stationary phase, not in exponential, and preferentially at promoters carrying the sequence T−1+1 or −1+ ( position corresponds to position novo ). Our findings demonstrate a physiological for P and suggest P may be among Gammaprote. We propose that in E and V occurs through a growth-dependent process that leads to preferential generation of dinucleotides 5-3 and 5-.
Parental Genome Imbalance Deregulates Imprinting in Arabidopsis. In this study, we investigated the effect of parental genome imbalance on the expression of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Imprinting is a process by which a single parental allele of a gene is expressed while the other allele is silenced. We tested the effect of genome imbalance on expression of four imprinted genes: FERTIZATION INDEPENDENT SE2 ( FIS ), FLOW WENINGEN ( F ), MEDE ( ME ) and PES (HE1 P ). We found that genome imbalance deregulated expression of F and P in an antagonistic manner. In addition, increased dosage of inactive alleles caused loss of imprint of F and ME. F controls histone methylation, which represses ME and P expression. However, changes of P and ME expression could not be fully accounted for by corresponding F expression. Our results show that genome imbalance deregulates imprinting mechanisms independent of known regulators.
Brain Rhythms Reveal a Hierarchical Network Organization of the Brain: A Novel Insights into Functional Connectivity  
Brain activity is characterized by oscillations of specific frequencies over a non-oscillatory background. These oscillations appear in the power spectrum as a collection of frequency bands evenly spaced on a logarithmic scale, preventing mutual entrainment and cross-talk. Rather than investigating how brain rhythms emerge or whether they are necessary for neural function, we focus on what they tell about brain connectivity. We hypothesize that networks whose dynamics are similar to EEG/ME recordings would share structural features among themselves and with brains. Applying techniques for inverse problems, we reverse-engineered networks that generate dynamics of brains including spindles and sharp waves. These networks display similar topological features ( e. g. structural ) and dynamics. We also reverse-engineered diseased brains (epileptic and schizophrenic ) with altered oscillatory activity. These networks show consistent alterations of connectivity and dynamics. Complexity, quantified by Tononi, Sporns and Edelman, is a good indicator of brain fitness since diseased brains display lower complexity than normal brains.
The United States is the largest Hispanic population in the United States is composed of individuals from many different countries of origin. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) is a study of 1, 374 Hispanic individuals from six countries: Central America, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and South America. We used 60, 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs ) to study the genetic structure of the MESA population. We found that the first two principal components ( PCs ) of ancestry were Caucasian and African, while the third and fourth PCs were Native American. The third PC also separated MESA Mexican and Central/South American samples. We used k-means clustering to define four subgroups of the MESA that agreed with self-identification: Dominican/Cuban, Mexican, Central/South, and Puerto Rican. We studied genetic association of triglycerides in the LPL and TR1 genes, previously associated with trigides in Caucasians but not in Hispanics. We found significant association in both genes and show the importance of considering population structure and genetic heterogeneity in studies of Hispanics.
The Elong Complex Interacts with PCNA and Modulates Transcriptional Silencing and Sensitivity to DNA Damage
Biomedical literature curation is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process that is necessary for building knowledge bases with precise and organized information. However, the process of retrieving relevant publications for curation, also known as document triage, is usually carried out by querying PubMed and often obtains unsatisfactory precision and recall. To address this, we propose a machine-assisted triage method. We collected curated publications from UniProt/SwissProt and NHRIEB GWAS Catalog and used them as a gold-standard for training deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks. We then used the models to classify and rank new publications foruration. We applied our method to the manualuration of UniProt/SissProt and GWAS. Our method outperforms current query-based triage, improves efficiency and enriches curated content. Our method achieves 1. 81 and 2.99 higher precision than current query-based triage UniProt/Siss and GWAS, respectively, without compromising recall. Our method retrieves additional publications query-based UniProt/Siss could not.
Short QT syndrome type 3 (SQT3), caused by gain-of-function mutations in the KCNJ2-encoded Kir2.1 channel, is associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). This study investigated the mechanistic link between QT3 mutations and atrial arrhythmogenesis using biophysically-detailed human atrial computer models. We modified the human atrial action potential (AP) model to recapitulate functional changes in IK due to heterozygous and homozygous forms of the D172 and E299 Kir2.1 mutations. Wild-type (WT) and mutant formulations were incorporated into multi-scale and heterogeneous tissue models. We quantified effects on AP duration (AP), conduction (CV), refractory period (ERP), tissue excitation threshold and rate-dependence, as well as wavelength re-entry (WL). The D and E Kir.1 mutations produced distinct effects on IK and AP shortening. Both decreased WL through reduction in ERP and CV. Stability of reentrant excitation in 2D and 3 tissue was mediated by changes in tissueability and AP in conditions. Combined block IK and IK was effective in terminating associated with heterozyous conditions, whereas IK alone may be safer for the mutation. Combined IK and produced a synergistic antiarrhythmic in both forms of QT. This study provides mechanistic into atrial prohythm with QT2.1 and highlights pharmacological for management of QT-linked AF.
Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASCs) have been shown to protect mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi from cardiac damage through modulation of anti-parasite immunity. Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a complex disease endemic in Central and South America and has gained interest due to increases in non-vector forms of transmission, especially in developed countries. The objective of this work was to investigate if ASC can alter the course of disease and attenuate pathology in a mouse model of chagasic cardiopathy. ASC were injected intraperitoneally at 3 days postinfection ( dpi ) and tracking by bioluminescence showed that remained in the abdominal cavity up to 9 days after injection and most migrated to abdominal subcutaneous fat, an early parasite reservoir. ASC resulted in significant reduction in parasitemia, followed by decrease in cardiac tissue parasism and fibrosis at 30 dpi. At same point, analyses cytokine release in cells from heart exposed to cruz antigens indicated anti-inflammatory response in ASC-treated. In parallel, splenocytes exposed same antigens produced pro-inflammatory response important control parasite, placebo and ASC-treated. However, splenocytes ASC released higher levels IL-10. dpi, magnetic resonance imaging revealed right ventricular ( RV ) dilation prevented ASC-treated. In, injection ASC after cruz infection prevents RV remodeling through modulation responses.
Leishmania parasites are obligate intracellular pathogens that reside within parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) in mammalian cells. We have previously shown that Retro-2, a retrograde trafficking inhibitor, reduces PV size and parasite numbers during Leishmania mexicana infections. This study aimed to determine if structural analogs of Retro-2 with superior potency in retrograde inhibition are also effective against Leish infections. In addition to PV effects, we show that two optimized analogs of Retro-2, DHZ36 and DHZ36, limit Leish infections in macrophages with EC50 of 13.63±2.58μM and 10.57±2.66M, respectively, which is lower than 40.15M EC of Retro-2. These analogs also reverse Leish suppression of IL-6 release by infected cells after LPS activation. In contrast to Retro-2, these analogs kill Leish parasites in axenic cultures.
The nucleosome is a fundamental component of chromatin that organizes the genome and regulates gene expression. We developed a computational method to predict nucleosome sensitivity for a transcription factors over a given genomic region. Sensitive factors are those with binding sites preferentially within nucleosome boundaries and lacking 10 bp periodicity. We applied this method to Acute Myeloid Leukemia-1 ( AML-1 ), a regulator of immune gene expression. AML-1 was predicted to be sensitive to nucleosomal regulation within the Ly49 gene family. This was confirmed using MNase-Seq to generate a nucleosome map of chromosome 6, where Ly49 is located. Analysis revealed depletion of nucleosomes at AML-1 binding sites in expressed LyA compared to silent Ly genes. Our data suggest nucleosome contributes to Ly expression. We propose this method to dissect the role of nucleosomes in general.
Cell cycle progression is orchestrated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDs), which are activated by phosphorylation of their T-loop by CD-activating kinases (CA). In animals, the only known CA for CD2 and CD1 is cyclin-CD7, which is constitutively active. The critical step is dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites by C25 phosphatases rather than T-loop phosphorylation. CD4 and CD6 bound cyclins are integrators of mitogenic signaling cascades by inactivating the oncosuppressor p and cell commitment at the restriction point. In contrast to CD1 and CD2 cyclins, CD4 has a highly regulated T-loop phosphorylation at T172 determining activity. CD4 and CD6 phosphorylations are catalyzed by CD7, but this is unclear. We took a chemical-genetics approach using analogue-sensitive CD7 (as) mutant H116 cells, which CD7 can be inhibited by bulky analogs. CD7 inhibition prevented phosphorylation of CD6, but CD4 was partly dependent on p21. In response to CD7 inhibition, p-binding CD increased conitantly with disappearance of most phosphorylated p, catalyzed by CD and CD2. S130 of p prevented CD4 phosphorylation and CD7 inhibition impaired phosphorylations of p and CD-bound CD4. CD7 revealed: crucial indirect CD7 involvement in CD4 phosphorylation and existence CD-activating other than CD7; and CD-dependent feedback by p phosphorylation CD4 and CD2 to sustain CD activation and restriction.
Meiosis is an essential for sexual reproduction, producing haploid cells. In multicellular eukaryotes, entry into meiosis is triggered by transcription factors that activate a cascade resulting in sequential expression of early, middle, and late meiotic genes. However, these factors are not conserved and the mechanisms that ensure proper meiotic expression in multicellular eukotes are poorly understood. Here, we report that DUET/M1, a PHD finger protein essential for Arabidopsis meiosis, functions as a transcriptional regulator in meiosis. We show that DUET binds H3K4me in vitro and that this interaction is critical for meiosis. We also show that DU is required for microtub organization during me II independently of me I. Remarkably, DU shows stage-specific expression confined diplot. We identify TDM and J as critical for cycle and spindle organization in me, DU targets with TDM being direct. Thus, is required to regulate microt organization and cycle during me, and as direct activator of the meiotic TDM. Expression shows reduced expression of about 12% of known me genes in the mutant. Our results reveal as a transcription regulator during me in plants, and that meiotic is under stagewise in plants as yeast.
Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. Previous studies have shown that CG repeats are sufficient to cause neurodegeneration and that CG-binding proteins α and hnRNP A/B can modulate CG-mediated neurotoxicity. To further explore the role of α in CG-mediated neurodegeneration, we took a proteomic approach and identified more than 100 proteins that interact with α. Of particular interest is R62, the Drosophila ortholog of p68 helicase, which modulates CG-mediated neurodegeneration. We show that CG repeats decrease R62 expression posttranslationally, leading to nuclear accumulation of Hsp transcript as well as additional mRNAs involved in stress and immune responses.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a paradigm organism for the study of biofilms. The extracellular polymeric substance of P. aerugin biofilms is an ill-defined mix of polyscharides, nucleic acids and proteins. Here, we directly visualize the product of the polyschar synthesis locus (slpolysacide ) at different stages of bio development. During attachment,sl is anchored on the surface in a helical pattern. This promotes cell–cell interactions and assembly of matrix, which holds bacteria in biofilm on surface. Chemicalation ofsl from the surface disrupted thesl matrix as well as bio structure. During maturation,sl accumulates on periphery 3-D microcolonies, resulting insl-free cavity in microcol center. At dispersion, cells appear in matrix. Dead and extracellular DNA are concentrated insl-free area. Deletion of genes control death affects formation matrix and microcol dispersion. These data provide mechanism how builds a matrix and subsequently cavity for portion cells seeding.
Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) serve as promising tools to identify new therapeutic strategies for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). To be effective, these preclinical models should recapitulate the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC and validate patient-specific sensitivities. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and PDX from PD and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 ‘trios’ of primary tum, PDX, and PDO. We developed a pipeline to score concordance between PD models and paired tumour for genomic events including mutations, structural variations, and copy variations. Tumour-model comparisons displayed single-gene concord across PD major driver genes but poor agreement across mutational load. Genome-wide chromosome analysis of structural (SV) events highlights concord across chromosomes that demonstrate SV events. We found ploidy presented a challenge when assessing copy changes; however, ploidy-correct copy suggest good agreement donor-model pairs.
Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Novel Susceptibility Loci for Breast Cancer in East Asians  
Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of both sporadic and familial breast cancer. We conducted a four-stage genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) in 19, 091 cases and 20, 606 controls of East-Asian descent including Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. We analyzed 690,947 SNPs in 2,918 cases and 2,324, and evaluated 5,365 SNPs in 3,972 and 3,852. We further evaluated 94 SNPs in 5,203 and 5,138, and finally 22 SNPs in 17,423 (7,489 and 9,934 ). We identified three SNPs associated with breast cancer risk: rs9482 near the TGF-activated kinase 2 gene in chromosome 6q25.1 (P=3.8×10−12 ), rs938 in intron 5 of the ESR gene (P=1.9×10−6 ), and rs710 at 11q24.3 (P=.6×10−7 ).
Cryptocococcal meningitis is a major cause of mortality in the developing world and little is known about the genetic factors underlying cryptococcal virulence and patient outcome. We studied a cohort of 230 Cryptococcus neoformans (C) isolates from HIV-positive South African patients with clinical follow-up using multi-locus sequence typing and in vitro virulence assays, correlating data with clinical and fungal markers of disease in patients. We found high levels of genetic diversity and variability in South African isolates compared to globally distributed types, and identified 50 sequence types within main types VNI, VNII and VNB, with 72% isolates in seven high frequency types. Spatial analysis of patients’ cryptoccal genotype was not geographically clustered, arguing against recent acquisition and in favour of latent infection. We found a relationship between genetic and clinical outcome, patients with VNB lineage having worse survival (HR 3. 35, CI 1.51-7.20, p0.003 ), maintained after adjustment for prognostic indicators and treatment. We compared genotype with in vitro (phagocysis lase activity and CSF survival ) on subset 89 isolates and found lineage-associated virulence, VN displaying increased lase activity (0.001 ) and ex vivo CS survival (0.000 ). These findings show Cryptoccus is phenotypically heterogeneous and lineage important in cryptocal virulence during infection.
Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that exists in two phenotypes: white and opaque. The white phenotype is associated with virulence, while the opaque is associated with commensalism. The white phenotype is regulated by the pheromone response, a signal transduction pathway that is poorly understood. Here we have identified the transcription factor Tec1 as the last component of the pherone response pathway in the white phenotype of C. alb. We constructed an overexpression library of 107 transcription factors and performed mutational analyses to identify Tec1. The elucidation of Tec1 establishes a comprehensive description of the pherone pathway in the white phenotype of C. alb, providing insights into how signalduction pathways evolve. The pherone pathway appears to be composed of three portions, each derived from different ancestral programs in C. alb. The upstream portion, including receptors, trimer G protein, and MAP kinase, was derived from the opaque mating pathway. Tec, the transcription factor targeted by the MAP pathway, was from filamentation, and white-specific genes from biofilm. The evolution of the pherone pathway provides a paradigm for how signalduction pathways evolve.
Bacteria exhibit a wide variation in genomic GC content, ranging from less than 20% to more than 70%. This variation is thought to be due to differences in mutation patterns between species. Here, we test this hypothesis by examining patterns of synonymous polymorphism in 149 bacterial species. We find a large excess of GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations segregating in all but the most AT-rich bacteria, across a range of phylogenetically diverse species. This excess of GC→AT mutations is inconsistent with mutation bias, as it would imply most GC-rich bacteria are declining in GC-content; such a pattern is unsustainable. We show that patterns are not due to translational selection or gene conversion because optimal codons are AT-rich, and excess GC→SNPs are observed in datasets with no recombination. We conclude there is selection to increase GC-content in many species. Since GC-content is highly correlated with genomic-content, we conclude there is selection on genomic composition many.
Soil-transmitted helminth infections (STHs), such as hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoid and Trichuris trichi, are major public health problems in developing countries. To control these infections, accurate maps are required that provide recommendations for intervention at policy-relevant spatial scales. Here, we present a new approach for mapping the prevalence of STs in Kenya, using observed data from 106,370 individuals from 945 cross-sectional surveys between 1974 and 2009. We used Bayesian space-time geostatistical models to interpolate the probability that prevalence exceeded 20% across the country for 198 and 2009. Maps for each species were integrated to estimate combined STH prevalence using the law of probability and a correction for associations between species. Population data were combined with models to estimate the population at risk and requiring treatment in 200. Our results show that in 200, most areas had low endemicity below 20%, with areas ≥20% located around the shores of Lake Victoria and the coast. Comparison of predicted distributions for 198 and 200 show that STH prevalence has decreased over time. We estimated that 2.8 million school-age children live in districts warranting mass treatment. Our models suggest that a quarter of Kenya's school children live in areas of high prevalence warranting mass treatment.
Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) requires a coordinated response between the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, resulting in a type 1 cytokine response, which is associated with control of infection. Innate lymphocytes contribute to immunity against Mtb, but their role remains controversial. We established an in vitro system to study this. We show that interferonγ is produced when splenocytes from uninfected mice are cultured with M-infected macrophages, and under these conditions, bacterial replication is suppressed. This control of bacterial replication is dependent on CD1-restricted NKT (iNKT) cells, and their activation requires CD1 expression by infected macrophages as well as IL-12 and IL-18. We show that NKT cells, even in limiting quantities, are sufficient to restrict M replication. To determine whether N cells contribute to defense against tuberculosis in vivo, we adoptively transferred N cells into mice. Primary splenic N cells from uninf mice significantly reduce the burden in the lungs of mice with virulent M by the aerosol route. Thus N cells have direct bactericidal effect even in the absence of synthetic ligands such as α-galactosceramide. Our finding N cells protect against aerosol M infection is first that CD-restricted N mediate against M in vivo.
In Bacillus subtilis spores are highly resilient because they are surrounded by a complex protein coat. The proteins in the coat are cross-linked by a transglutaminase (Tgl). Unlike other transglutases, Tgl is produced in an active form and efficiently catalyzes amine incorporation and cross-linking in vitro with no additional requirements. However, the absence of regulatory factors raises how Tgl activity is controlled during spore assembly. Here, we show that substrates assembled onto spore prior to Tgl production govern localization of T to the sp surface. We also show T residues important for substrate recognition are crucial for localization. We identified glutamyl (Q) and lys (K) docking sites and show residues on Q side of T are important for assembly than those on K. The first reaction step, interaction with substrates and formation acyl intermediate is determinant in localization of T. Consistent with T exerts “spoteld” activity, we show C is oblong hexamer in solution cross-linked into high molecular forms. Moreover, during reaction T becomes part of cross-products. We suggest dependency T on substrates is to control time, location and extent of activity directed coval fortification preassemblies at sp surface.
Opisthorchis viverrin is a foodborne trematode species that causes biliary disease and cholangiocarcinoma. In Laos, approximately 2. 5 million individuals are infected with O. vivini. However, epidemiological studies are scarce and the spatial distribution of infection remains to be determined. Our aim was to map the distribution of O. vivini in southern Laos, identify risk factors, and predict prevalence at non-survey locations. A cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire survey was carried out in 51 villages in Champas province in 2007. Data on demography, socioeconomic status, water, sanitation, and behavior were combined with remotely sensed environmental data into a geographical information system. Bayesian statistical models were employed to identify risk and investigate the pattern of O vivini. Bayesian krig was utilized to predict risk at nonsurvey locations. The prevalence of O viv among 3, 371 participants with complete records was 61.1. Statistical models identified age, Lao ethnic group, educational attainment ( farmer, fisherman, animal breeder ), and unsafe water source as risk factors. History prazant treatment, access sanitation, and distance to freshwater were found to be protective. Spatial O viv were mainly governed by environmental with modeling identifying two profiles: low viv in mountains and high in Mekong. We present the first map viv infection in Champas, important for targeting efforts.
Lymphatic filariasis and malaria are major public health concerns in Dar es Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania, with Anopheles and Cule mosquitoes being the primary vectors. In Dar Sala has an extensive network of drains, mostly with inadequate flow and blocked by waste, which causes flooding after rainfall. The presence of Anophe and Cule larvae is common and likely to impact the transmission of lymphatic filari and malaria by the adult mosquito populations. However, the importance of drains as larval habitats remains unknown. In Dar Sala, more than 70% of larval habitats are human-made, with aquatic habitats associated with agriculture having the highest proportion of Anophe larvae and second of Cule larvae. The majority of aquatic habitats are drains (42% ), and 43% ( 1, 364/ 3 149 ) of all culicine and 33% (320 976 ) of anopheline habitats are drains. Compared to drains with normal water flow, the odds of finding Anophe and Cule larvae are 8.8 and 6.3 (p<.001 ) times larger in drains with stagnant water. There is a positive association between vegetation and mosquito presence (p.001 ). The proportion of habitats with larvae is spatially correlated. Restoring and maintaining drains in Dar Sala has the potential to eliminate more than 40% of all larval habitats currently treated with laricides by the Urban Malaria Control Program.
Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease in humans. Previous studies have shown that changes in lipid metabolites in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of DENV infected cells are associated with replicative formation. Here, we show that DENV infection increases the activity of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) through the impairment of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. Using enzymatic assays, ELISA, and WB, we found a significant increase in MG activity in DENV infected cells associated with inactivation of AMPK. Metformin, an AMPK activator, declined MG activity suggesting that AMP inactivation mediates the increase in MG. MG and AMP co-localized with viral proteins NS3, NS4A, and E, suggesting a role in MG and AMP activity in replicative complexes. Metform and lovastatin, MG inhibitor, altered co-localization as well as replicative formation supporting active MG required for complexes. Metform prompted a dose-dependent antiviral effect in DENV cells while compound C, AMP inhibitor, augmented viral copies and percentage infected. PP2 activity, MG phosphatase, was not affected by D infection. These data show that elevated MG in DENV cells is through AMP inhibition not increase PP activity. Interestingly, inhibition showed antiv effect MG-independent.
The ribosome is a complex molecular machine responsible for protein synthesis. The process of tRNA translocation across the ribosome is a key step in this process. We used all-atom molecular simulation of the 70S ribosome (2. 1 million atoms; 1. 3 microseconds ) to study the kinetics of tRNA translocation. Starting from a prelocation configuration, we identified sets of residues that undergo conformational rearrangements implicated in ribosome function. We estimated diffusion coefficients along collective coordinates of translocation to convert between experimental and energy measures of the landscape. This analysis, in conjunction with previously reported rates of translocation, provides an upper estimate of free barriers with trans.
Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a malignancy of the thyroid gland that is not yet fully understood, although some oncogenic mutations have been identified. To explore the genetic profiles of MTC, we assayed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from M patients on the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel. Eighty-four sporadic M samples and 36 normal thyroid tissues were successfully sequenced. We discovered 101 mutations in 18 genes in the MTC samples. The most common mutation was in the RET proto-oncogene, occurring in 47 cases, followed by mutations in HRAS (14), STK11 (11), KIT (6), MLH1 (4), KIT (3) and MET (3). We also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and breakapart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Two of 98 cases were positive for ALK FISH. To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5 fusion partner of AL, customized sequencing was performed using DNA from samples of two patients. Glutaminefructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GF1)ALK and echodermicrotubule-associated protein 4 (4ALK) fusions were identified. Additional analysis by Sanger sequencing confirmed GF1ALK, indicating the fusion is result of intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion. Notably, a metastatic M case harboring 4ALK showed dramatic response to AL inhibitor crizotinib.
Asymptomatic Leishmanias in Kala Endemic Areas of Malda District, West Bengal, India: A Challenge to Visceral Leishias (VL) Elimination Initiative. Asymptomatic Leishias may drive the epidemic and important challenge to the goal of VL elimination taken by three Asian countries. The role of asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission, prognosis and rate of transformation to symptomatic Visc Leishias (VL) needs to be evaluated. Asympt cases were diagnosed by active survey in eight tribal villages detecting Leishial antibody using r39 based diagnostic kits followed for three years to observe pattern of seroconversion and disease. Out of 2890 population, 260 were screened. Leishial antibody detected in 185 of them 96 had VL/PK history and 89 without history. Seventy nine were classified as asymptomatic Leishias and 10 VL with ratio 7:1. Of 79 cases were lost to follow as moved other places. Amongstymptically infected, disease in 8 (10% ) and seroconversion 62 (80% ) were noted. Seven (9% ) remained serpositive after three. Progress to disease amongympt individuals took place up three years baseline. If no VL/PK cases two years, does not mean area free Leishias asympt may appear three.
Genome rearrangements (GCRs) and aneuploidy can lead to the development of diseases and cancer. In this study, we used Multiplex Ligation–dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to analyze Gs induced by the retrotranson Ty912 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that the distribution of translocations induced by Ty was nonrandom and the majority were mediated by six translocation targets on four chromosomes, even though there were 254 potential targets in S. cerevisiae. The majority of Ty-mediated trans resulted from RAD-dependent recombination, but we also observed nonrecipro trans mediated by RAD-independent between Ty elements. RAD-independent trans did not require Rad51 or Rad homologous proteins or Rad–endonuclease that process branched DNAs. We found that defects in ASF-dependent acetylation of histone lysine 56 resulted in increased Gs and whole-chromosome duplications and anup that tended to occur with Gs.
Protein docking is the process by which two proteins associate with each other is driven by a free energy funnel that is determined by favorable interactions in the neighborhood of the native state. We describe a docking method called semi-definite programming underestimation ( SD ) that minimizes funnel-shaped energy functions in the space of rigid body motions ( SE ( 3 ) while accounting for flexibility of the interface chains. SD employs a quadratic function to underestimate a set of local minima and uses the resulting underestimator to bias sampling. However, application to docking in rotational and translational space ( SE 3 ) is not straightforward due to the geometry of space. We introduce a strategy that uses independent variables for side-chain optimization, center-to-center distance of two proteins and five descriptors of relative orientations of molecules. The removal of center-center distance turns out to improve efficiency of search because five-dimensional space exhibits well-behaved energy suitable for underestimation. This explores energy surface spanned by complexes that correspond to local minima and shows model macromolecular association that proceeds series of collisions.
