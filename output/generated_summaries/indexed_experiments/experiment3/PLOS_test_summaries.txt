The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has made significant progress in reducing the number of reported cases of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) cases in the last two decades. However, pockets of infection remain and it is important to assess if different regions are on track for elimination and where efforts should be focused. We present a previously developed mathematical model for AT in DRC and show it is able to capture the dynamics of AT at the health district level (approximately 10,000 people). This is the first time any AT model has been fitted to data and allows us to quantify uncertainty in results. We use particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methodology to fit the model to data from 16 health areas in Mosango zone, Kivu province. The model reflects spatial heterogeneity in results and we predict that under current strategies, Kinamba health area, with one third of zone cases, will have latest year for elimination. We find that analogous deterministic AT model using MCM has faster computation times than stochastic using MCM but produces indistinguishable parameterisation.
Tumor microenvironments (TMEs) contain a vast amount of information about a patient’s cancer through their cellular composition and spatial distribution of tumor and immune cell populations. Exploring variations in MEs between patients, as well as determining the extent to which this information can predict outcomes such as patient survival or success with immunotherapies, is of interest. Moreover, in the face of a number of cell interactions to consider, we wish to identify interactions that are useful in making such predictions. We present an approach to achieve these goals based on summarizing spatial in ME using spatial functions, then applying data analysis and forest models to predict outcomes of interest and identify spatial. This approach is shown to be in experiments at identifying important while controlling the rate. We used the approach to interrogate two sets of ME in triple negative breast and lung cancer patients.
In this study, we computationally investigate how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure co-evolve during desynchronization and how they are affected by external perturbations. We combine a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with different plasticity mechanisms: ( i ) spike-timing plasticity ( STDP ), ii ) homeostatic plasticity (SP ), iii ) combination of ST and SP, iv ) combination of ST and SP with weight-dependent pruning. We introduce a stochastic model to accommodate diverse neuronal firing timescales. With tools from network theory, we show that structural reorganization remarkably enhances network synchrony. When contacts are preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning, synchrony is achieved with sparser connections than in STDP-only networks. Strengthening contacts from neurons with higher firing rates to those with lower rates and weakening in the opposite direction followed by removal of weak contacts allows strong synchrony with fewer connections. This reorganization results in emergence of degree-degree correlations and degree assortativity. We compare desynchronization of synchronized states in STDP with desynchronization models iii and iv. The latter require higher intensity to achieve long-term desynchronization.
Regeneration of large regions of the nervous system in animals is a complex process that requires the restoration of both the number and pattern of neurons, as well as the wiring of diverse neuron classes. Because injuries are unpredictable, regeneration must be accomplished from an unlimited number of starting points. In planarians, neurons and glia are regenerated from distinct progenitors. We found that planarians first regenerate neurons expressing delta-encoding delta-2 at key positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Planarians glia are later specified from Notch-1-expressing mesodermal phagocytic progenitors. Inhibition of delta-2 or Notch-1 severely reduced glia in planarians, but did not affect specification of other phagocytic types. Loss of delta-2-expressing neurons prevented differentiation of glia associated with them, whereas transplantation of delta-2-express photoreceptors was sufficient for glia at ectopic. Our results suggest a model in which delta-2-express neurons instruct phagoc progenitors to differentiate into glia, providing a mechanism for regeneration of numbers and pattern of cell types.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a major global health problem. New HIV vaccines are being developed to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. In addition to antibodies, γδ T cells play a role in the immune response to HIV. We studied γδ T cells in people who acquired HIV for the first time (pre-acquisition) and during the first few weeks of infection (acute infection, AHI). These people were previously characterized for their ability to neutralize HIV (neutral breadth). We found differences in γδ cell surface markers between people who developed neutral breadth and those who did not. γδ cells were activated early in the first weeks of HIV infection and associated with viral load. We found that γδ cells expressing CD16 and CD57 were higher in people who developed breadth during AHI and associated with breadth later. We also found that γ cells expressing CD16 were associated with early Env-specific IgM production. Thus, γδ cells may promote breadth, which is important for HIV vaccine development.
Metastasis is responsible for the majority of cancer-related deaths. Current anti-cancer drugs target tumor growth but not metastasis. Recently, tumor-secreted IL-6 and IL-8 synergize to enhance metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner. Blocking IL-6 and IL-8 receptors with a novel bispecific antibody, BS, significantly reduced metastatic burden in preclinical cancer models. Bispecific antibodies are promising due to enhanced avidity and dual targeting. However, elucidating BS mechanisms is critical for maximizing efficacy. Here, we describe a quantitative model of BS exhibiting how multivalent binding provides insights into affinity and avidity and guides design. We present simulations of monovalent and bivalent interactions between constructs and IL-8 to establish how properties and conditions impact formation of binary and ternary complexes. Results demonstrate how balance drives inhibition, providing predictions for design.
Although centrioles are essential for organizing spindles in most cell types, oocytes of most species lack these structures. In Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes, microtubule minus ends are sorted away from the chromosomes to form the poles, but outward forces must be balanced to form a stable bipolar spindle. Simultaneously, microtub dynamics must be precisely controlled to maintain spindle length and organization. We have gained insight into this question through studies of ZYG-8, a conserved doubleortin kinase; the mammalian homolog of microtub-associated is upregulated in many cancers and has been implicated in division. We found that ZYG depletion from oocytes resulted in elongated spindles with pole and midindle defects. Importantly, experiments with monopolar spindles revealed that Z depletion led to excess forces within the spindle. We also found that Z is required for microt dynamics within the spindle and activity is required during both meiosis and mitosis. Our findings reveal new roles for Z in oocytes and how spindles are stabilized to promote meiosis.
In this study, we investigated the interplay between genetics, metabolomics, and type 2 diabetes ( T2 ) in the UK Biob dataset using the Nightale panel of 249 metabolites, 92% of which correspond to lipids ( HD, ID, LDL, VLDL ) and lipoproteins. We found 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2, all spanning lipid-related classes except glucose and tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites are causally affected by T2, spanning all classes including branched amino acids. Using quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) analysis, we identified four metabolites replicated in an independent dataset from Estonianob, with genetic loci in different regions showing attenuated regulation in T2 cases compared to controls. The variants from QTL are significant for corresponding metabolites in the population but not associated with T risk, pointing towards consequences of T2 on metabolite regulation. Through differential analyses, we found 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macro, or both types of T complications, with few discriminating between classes. Of these, 40 are not causally linked to T in either direction, suggesting mechanisms specific to complications. This work provides a map of consequences T on metabolite levels and regulation, enabling better understanding of T trajectory to complications.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause a range of infections from mild to severe and life-threatening. Humans can survive infection by limiting the pathogen burden (resistance ) or the impact of a given pathogen burden (tolerance ). We previously established that mice from the CC line 061 are highly susceptible to MRSA USA300, while CC024 are tolerant. To identify genes involved in tolerance after S. aureus infection, we crossed CC061 and CC024 mice to generate F1 and F2 populations. After MRSA infection, survival in F1 and F2 was 65% and 55 and followed a complex inheritance pattern for CC increased survival. Colonization in F2 was more than parents, suggesting segregation of genetic factors. We identified a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) on chromosome 7 for survival and weight after infection. In this QTL, the WSBi allele in CC024 contributed to MR tolerant phenotype. Two genes, Car1 and Car2 have high-impact variants in this region. Car1 and Car are receptors for complement C5a, anaphylato that trigger a massive response by binding these. We hypothesize C5 may have altered variant in CC mice, reducing damage by cytokine storm resulting in ability to tolerate higher pathogen and longer.
The availability of beneficial alleles can influence the tempo and mode of adaptation. However, the extent to which genetic networks affect adaptation remains largely unknown. Current models of evolution consider additive genotype-phenotype relationships while ignoring the contribution of interactions to phenotypic variance. This study models a quantitative trait as the product of a simple regulatory network, the autoregulatory motif. Using forward genetic simulations, we measure adaptive walks towards a phenotyp optimum in both additive and network models. The distribution of fitness of new mutations is expected to be exponential. Instead, we found distributions with fewer large-effect alleles in both models. The network model had a complex bimodal distribution of fitness among mutations, with considerable at deleterious coefficients. This is reminiscent of the cost, where correlations constrain adaptation. Our results suggest that interactions from networks can generate complex distributions of fitness.
Bayesian integration of sensory information from different sources is a fundamental for reliable behavior in animals. However, the biological implementation of this integration remains unclear. We propose a novel view of conductance-based neurons and synapses that can optimally integrate information. In this view, apical dendrites represent prior expectations of somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parametrized by local quantities, effective potentials and conductances. Under these assumptions, the somatic compartment computes the posterior. We derive a gradient-based plasticity rule allowing neurons to learn desired distributions and weight inputs by their reliabilities. Our theory explains experimental findings on single-cell and multi-sensory integration. We illustrate with simulations and make experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian integration and plasticity.
Proteins are the building blocks of all living organisms. They are composed of long chains of amino acids that fold into three-dimensional structures that determine their function. Predicting the structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence is a long-standing problem in molecular biology. Recently, a method called AlphaFold has been developed to predict protein structure from sequence. Here, we use AlphaFold to predict the structure of all proteins in the Alpha Database, a collection of 226,424,000 amino acid sequences from 536,808 proteins. We use a method called Evolutionary Classification of Domains ( EC ) to classify the predicted structures into domains. A domain is a part of a protein that performs a specific function. We find that we can classify 90% of the amino acids in these proteins into domains or non-domain regions. We identify 746,349 domains from the proteins. We find that eukaryotes have more disordered regions and unassigned domains than bacteria. We also find that eukaryotes have more proteins with globular and small repeats. We find that some domains are shared between eukotes and bacteria, such as Rossm, TIM, and P-loop domains. We compare our predicted domains to a reference set of known domains and find that some are enriched. Finally, we discuss how these results can be used to classify proteins in the future.
Polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a major cause of kidney failure in transplant patients for whom there are no antivirals. The current model of BKV infection suggests that the virus expresses the large T antigen (TAg) early in the infection, promoting entry into the S phase of the cell cycle where the viral DNA can access the host replication machinery. We performed a single-cell analysis of TAg expression throughout the cell cycle and found that robust TAg expression is required for host DNA replication. Using inhibitors that only affect host and not viral replication, we show that TAg and viral production rely on S phase. BKV is known to promote cellular replication where the cell re-enters S from G2 phase without passing through G1 to prolong S for viral replication. Thus, BKV results in cells with more than 4N DNA. We found that subsequent rounds of host DNA replication rely on canonical cell cycle regulators despite BKV infection. Together, these findings suggest a model for polyomavirus replication where robust TAg depends on initial S and BKV primarily replicates during host-re.
Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as a powerful tool for identifying gene-trait associations by integrating gene expression studies with genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Most existing TWAS approaches focus on marginal analyses examining one gene at a time, but recent developments in TW fine-mapping methods enable joint modeling of multiple genes to refine identification of potentially causal ones. Here, we present FAB, a TW fine-mapping method designed for binary traits capable of modeling all genes on a chromosome. FAB employs a probit model to link genetically regulated (GRe) of genes to binary outcomes while accounting for Re among genes on a chromosome. As a result, FAB controls false discoveries while offering power over existing TW fineapping approaches.
Protein misfolding can be refolded to their functional conformations or degraded by quality control mechanisms. When misfolded proteins evade quality control, they can be sequestered to specific sites within cells to prevent potential dysfunction and toxicity that arises from protein aggregation. Btn2 and Hsp are compartment-specific sequestrases that play roles in assembly of these sites. We show that Btn and Hsp are required for tolerance to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide. Btn and H act to sequest oxidized proteins into PQC sites following exposure and absence leads to accumulation of aggregates. The toxicity of aggregate causes oxidant in mutants since Hsp sequease overexpression rescues oxid tolerance. We identified Sup35 termination factor as in vivo sequease substrate and show that Btn and H suppress oxid-induced formation of the [PS+] prion, which is amyloid form of35. [+] pr formation sease mutants does not require IPO localization which is site amyloids thought undergo fragmentation to propagate heritable pr form.
GBM (glioblastoma) invasion is a major cause of death in glioblastoma patients. While most studies have focused on coding genes, few have evaluated the role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in GB invasion. We used CRISPR-interference (CRPR) to evaluate the function of GB-associated ncRNAs in an unbiased screen and characterized the mechanism of identified candidates. We implemented a CRPR loss-of-function screen evaluating ncRNA knockdown (KD) with invasion in Matrig. Top candidates were validated using CRPR and oligonucleotide (AS)-mediated knockdown in three lines. Clinical relevance was assessed via The Cancer Atlas (TA) and Genotype Expression (GT) analysis. Forty ncRNAs were significantly associated with 33% decrease in invasion (p<0.01) upon knockdown. The candidate LINC45 demonstrated 82% decrease in tumor invasion upon knock, while LINC45 expression was associated with patient survival and grade (p<.0001). RNA analysis of LINC45 revealed WAS3, previously implicated in invasion, was highly correlated with ncRNA, while WAS KD was associated with decrease in invasion. Finally, WAS overexpression rescued invasive lost with LINC45 KD. CR screening identified LINC45, previously unannotated ncRNA, as critical to GB invasion. Expression is associated with grade and survival. RNAq and mechanistic studies suggest this nc may regulate via WAS3.
The brain has been hypothesized to use probabilistic models to represent sequences of stimuli. However, the classes of models used by the brain to perform this task are not well understood. We address this issue using a novel clustering procedure on electroencephalographic ( EEG ) data from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a Markov chain. This procedure indicates that the brain uses the recurrence of regular auditory stimuli to build a model.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for analyzing gene expression and cellular composition at the single-cell resolution. However, it has limitations: failure to account for cell-to-cell variations in transcriptome size (total number of transcripts per cell ) and cell dissociation-induced cryptic gene expression. This is particularly problematic when analyzing heterogeneous solid organs, which require dissociation for analysis. As a result, there is a discrepancy between bulk RNA-seq results and virtually reconstituted bulk-seq results using sc-se data. To address this problem, we propose a computationally calculated “cell-specific weighting factor (WF ”. We introduce a concept and method for computing WF and report WF for 76 cell-types across 10 organs. WF is validated by accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk-se data using sc data and WF of composite cells. We also show WF effectively predict aging, implicating diagnostic applications and association with aging.
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the effect of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVM) extends this to estimate the effect of multiple exposures simultaneously. However, MVM can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic variants in the used as instrumental variables, violating one of the core assumptions. Genetic variants that give outlying estimates are considered to be pleiotropic. Radial plots can be used in MR to identify these variants. Analogous plots for MVM have been unavailable due to the multidimensional nature of the analysis. We propose a formulation of MVM and an adapted radial plot which allows the effect of each exposure within MVM analysis to be visualised. RadialM includes option for removal of outlying SNPs which violate one or more of M assumptions. We present the R package for implementing the methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of M through simulations and analyses. We highlight how can be visualised and removed through Radial. We present that removal decreases bias in effects under forms of. We apply to the effect on coronary disease (CHD).
Drosophila melanogaster behavior was continuously recorded at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days in featureless arenas on sucroseagar media. We used the deep learning framework SLE to produce a full-body postural dataset for 47 individuals resulting in nearly 2 billion instances. We identified stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, probis extension and locomotion and used the resulting ethograms to explore how the flies’ behavior varies across time and days. We found distinct patterns in stereotyped behaviors, adding information about trends in grooming modalities, probis extension and locom speed to what is known about the D melanogaster circadian cycle. We found that the hour after dawn is a unique point in the flies’ daily pattern of behavior and that the composition of this hour tracks with other indicators of health such as locom speed and fraction of time spent resting.
Protein tyrosine phosphatases non-receptor (PTPs) have been studied extensively in the context of the adaptive immune system; however, their roles beyond immunoregulation are less explored. Here we identify novel functions for the conserved C. elegans phosphatase PTP-22, establishing its role in nemode molting, adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. We found that loss of PTP-22 phosphat activity suppressed mol defects caused by loss-function mutations in conserved NIMA kinases NE-2 ( humanNE8/NE9 ) and NE-3 ( humanNE6NE7 ), which act at the interface of trafficking and actin regulation. We carried out proximity studies to identify candidate interactors of P-22 during development and identified CDC guanine nucleotide exchange factor DN- ( humanMB ) as in vivo partner of P-22. Loss of also suppressed ne-associated mol defects. Genetic analysis, localization, and labeling revealed roles in several epidermal adhesion complexes, including C elegansomes, suggesting P-22 plays a role in maintaining structural integrity. Localization and labeling implicated in functions to nucleoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation, particularly in the germl, one-third proteins identified by labeling are gran components.
Malaria is a major public health problem in Southeast Asia and Africa, where artemisinin derivatives are the current gold standard treatment. However, artem resistance is spreading and if it expands to Africa and India, malaria cases and deaths are expected to increase. Therefore, it is important to know how artem resistance is changing in Southeast Asia. We used data from the WorldWide Antimal Resistance Network on mutations in the Kel 13 ( K ) gene, which is associated with artem resistance, and a geostatistical model to make maps of artem resistance. Our maps show that the K mutation spread across the Greater Mekong region from 200 to 202. The most change happened between 2010 and 2015. Our maps show how artem resistance is changing in space and time, which is not possible with data alone. This helps to make better decisions on a fine scale. Our study is the first to show how artem resistance is changing in space and time at the continent level, which is important for malaria goals in Southeast.
Inflammasome signaling is a critical for the innate immune response and is mediated by proteins including NLR1 and CARD8. These proteins exist in various forms due to autoproteolytic cleavage within the FI domain, resulting in full-length (FL), cleaved N-terminal (NT), and cleaved C-terminal (CT) peptides that form autoinhibitory complexes in the steady state. We found that NLR1 paralogs and CARD8 form conserved autohibitory complexes involving NT-CT and FL-CT interactions with distinct mechanisms. The linker region between LRR and FI in murine NLR1 (mLR1) plays a role in NT-CT autohibitory, while Z5 of ratLR1 and CARD8 mediate NT-CT. We also found that the protease dipeptidase 9 (DPP9) is involved in these complexes, interacting with NT of mLR1, rLR, and CARD through Z5, forming NT-PP-CT; however, PP cannot bind NT of hLR1. Our study enhanced understanding of FI-containing proteins in inflmas autohibition and underscored the complexity of their interactions in the immune response.
Defects in protein homeostasis can lead to proteotoxic stress, affecting cellular fitness and overall health. In various tissues, cell-based mechanisms facilitate the detection and elimination of compromised cells, referred to as “losers”, by healthier neighbors. However, the connection between proteotoxic stress and cell survival remains largely unknown. Here, we reveal the function of endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi localized protein Rer1 in regulating protein homeostasis in the Drosophila wing epithelium. Our results show that loss of R1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PER-mediated phosphorylation of eukary initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). We also show that R1 mutant cells are identified as losers and eliminated through cell competition. Interestingly, we find that R1 levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression that causes overgrowth, albeit under proteotoxic stress. Our results suggest that increased R1 levels provide cytoprotection to My-overexpressing cells by alleviating proteotoxic stress and supporting My-driven overgrowth.
Mutations in the CHEK2 gene are associated with an increased risk of breast and other cancers. Most of the 3,188 amino acid changes resulting from non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of CHE2 have not been tested for their impact on the function of the CHE2 protein. We tested all 4,887 possible SNVs in the CHE2 reading frame for their ability to complement RAD53 mutants using deep mutational scanning. Among the non-syn changes, 770 were damaging to protein while 2,417 were tolerated. Our results correlate with previous and provide a first functional assay for variants of uncertain identified in databases. This approach can be used to predict pathogenicity of CHE2 variants found in screening and applied to other cancer genes.
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen that forms multiple epigenetically and phenotypically distinct populations by inverting the DNA methyltransferase genes in the opacity determinant (cod locus. This is manifested by a switch between opaque and transparent colonies with different methylation patterns that confer pathogenesis traits. Here, we report that the Spx1-Ten toxin-antitoxin ( TA ) system regulates the orientations of these inversions and epigen and phenotypes by targeting pneumoc protein synthesis. Spx1 and Ten constitute a highly conserved type II TA system in S. pneumonia. Overexpression of Ten leads to growth arrest in E. coli and autolysis in S pneumonia, while antitox Spx1 represses the spxA-ten operon. Ten binds to ribosome factor Rim and reduces ComX, a sigma factor for natural transformation genes. Attenuation of ComX enhances psr transcription, favoring transparent colony-associated hS configurations. Phenotypically, Ten expression reshapes pneumoc epigen and colony. Spontaneous variations in the spxA-ten promoter generate subpopulations with epetic and phenic diversity.
High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences and it is often desirable to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques cannot accomplish this because they operate only on one dataset. To address this problem, contrastive principal component analysis ( cPCA ) has been proposed, but has seen little adoption because it requires a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions with no way of knowing which is correct. Moreover, c uses foreground and background that are treated differently making it unsuitable to compare experimental conditions symmetrically. Here, we describe the development of generalized contrastive PCA (gc ), a hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems. Unlike cPCA, gc does not require hyperparameter tuning and treats foreground and background symmetrically, making it suitable for comparing experimental conditions. We demonstrate the utility of gc in analyzing high-dimensional data, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II in single-cell RNA sequencing.
B cell receptor (BCR) signaling plays a crucial role in the survival and maturation of B cells and is often deregulated in B cell lymphomas. While proximal BCR signaling is well studied, little is known about the cros of downstream effector pathways and a comprehensive analysis of BCR signaling is missing. Here, we model BCR signaling in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells using perturbed phosphorylation data of BL-2 and BL-41. The model unveiled and cros structures in the BCR network, including negative cros from p38 to MEK/ERK. The relevance of cros was verified B and CD40 in BL cells and confirmed by phosphoproteomics ERK and ER target sites.
Notch signalling plays a crucial role in tissue growth and maintenance. It is regulated by two opposing mechanisms: intercellular activation and intracellular inhibition. Different Notch/ligand combinations determine the strength, duration and specificity of signalling. It has been assumed that these processes involve homomeric and heteromeric ligand complexes. This study explores the molecular basis of Notch ligands DLL4 and J1 in angiogenic sprouting. We provide evidence for two mechanisms: 1) DLL induces Not1 transactivation; 2) J1 blocks DLL-dependent cis-inhibition through a J1/DLL complex. We propose a new Not signalling model recapitulating tip and stalk cell formation necessary for sprouting.
Clustering is a widely used in bioinformatics and other fields for exploratory analysis and prediction. However, many types of data have associated uncertainty or error. We present Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty ( DPM ), an extension of Bayesian nonparametric clustering which uses uncertainty associated data. We show DPM outperforms existing methods on simulated data. We apply DPM to immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS statistics, which have uncertainty with sample size. DPM separates IMD from autoimmune and isolates other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. We consider DPM to cluster gene datasets summarised using gene signatures. We introduce procedure for summarising gene on dataset different where it was discovered, incorporating variability across genes within individual. We summarise three gene datasets patients with IMD using three signatures. We find association between DPM and clusters replicated across datasets.
Deep neural networks have been remarkably successful in modeling the primate visual system. However, they fail to account for the importance of shape in primate vision. In contrast to humans, who judge category membership to a large extent on shape, deep networks rely more strongly on features such as color and texture. This problem has been widely documented, but the underlying reasons remain unclear. We design simple artificial image datasets where shape, color, and texture can be used to predict class. By training networks from scratch to classify images with single features and combinations, we show that some architectures are unable to learn shape, whereas others can use shape but are biased towards other features.
Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the source of extracellular matrix (ECM) overproduction that leads to fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver functions in chronic liver diseases. We developed rule-based models to study HSC dynamics during fibrosis and reversion using the Kappa rewriting language. Hs are modeled as agents that present seven physiological states and interact with TGFβ molecules that regulate H activation and secretion of type I collagen, the main ECM component. Simulation revealed the role of H inactivation during fibrosis and reversion. Inactivation allows elimination of Hs during reversion, while reactivation of inactivated Hs are required to sustain fib. We demonstrated the model’s sensitivity to Tβ parameters, suggesting adaptability to a variety of pathophysiological conditions. Using experimental data from a mouse model of CCl-induced fibrosis, we validated predicted ECM dynamics. Our model also predicts accumulation of Hs during chronic disease. By analyzing RNA data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated fibrosis, we confirmed accumulation identifying Hs as markers of fibrosis. Our study provides the first model of H dynamics in chronic disease that can be used to explore the role of Hs in liverostasis. Moreover, our model can be generalized to fibroblasts during and fibrosis in other tissues.
Meta-analysis is a statistical method for aggregating the effects of interest across multiple studies, but its application in mediation analysis, particularly in estimating the total effect of high-dimensional omics mediators, is largely unexplored. Large-scale consortia, such as the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ( TOP ) program, comprise multiple cohorts with diverse technologies to elucidate the genetic and biological mechanisms underlying human complex traits and diseases. We have developed a novel meta-analysis framework requiring only summary statistics and accounting for inter-study heterogeneity, leveraging the established asymptotic standard of R-squared ( ) effect estimation for high omics mediators. This method can uniquely account for heterogeneity across studies due to, for example, genomic platforms. Extensive simulations showed the method was computationally efficient and yielded characteristics comparable to analysis of individual data when there was no interudy heterogeneity. We applied the method to TOP studies with 580 participants to estimate the effect of expression on age-related systolic blood pressure and sex-related high-density lipoprotein ( ).
Cancer is driven by the accumulation of a small number of genetic mutations that confer a selective growth advantage to the cell, while most mutations do not contribute to tumor progression. Identifying the genes responsible for tumorigenesis is crucial for designing effective treatments. Most existing methods provide a single driver gene list for the entire cohort, ignoring the heterogeneity of drivers across patients. We propose a novel method, PWH, which prioritizes mutated genes for a patient based on their impact on downstream gene expression across patients sharing co-mutations and similar profiles. We tested PWH on 16 cancer datasets from TCG and it excelled in identifying known drivers and tumor-specific drivers. In comparative testing across five cancer types, PWH outperformed individual and cohort methods. Our results demonstrated PWH could identify both common and rare drivers. Personalized profiles improved stratification provided insights into heterogeneity and a step toward personalized treatment. We validated one predicted driver on tumor proliferation by cell assays, promoting expression of low-density lipoprotein-related protein 1 (LRP1) on proliferation.
The Virtual Epileptic (VEP) is a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy that combines personalized anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities. It is capable of generating spatio-temporal seizure patterns that resemble those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG, allowing for evaluation of clinical hypotheses before surgery. This study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VE models using a global optimization approach. The approach utilizes SaSS, a cooperative metaheuristic algorithm capable of parallel computation to yield high-quality solutions without excessive computational time. Through benchmarking on synthetic data, our proposal successfully solved a set of different configurations of VE models, demonstrating scalability and superior performance against parallel solvers. These results were further enhanced using Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, with gains in both accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, we added scalable quantification of uncertainty after calibration, used to assess variability in estimated parameters across problems.
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb, remains a major global health problem with 10.6 million cases and 1.6 million deaths in 202. The disease is well understood to be due to Mtb growth in the lung, but the quantitative rates of Mtb replication and death in lungs of infected animals, such as monkeys or rabbits, remain largely unknown. We performed experiments with rabbits infected with a novel, virulent Mtb isolate of the Beijing lineage H878, carrying an unstable plasmid p10. In vitro, we found p10 is more stable in H878 than in the commonly used laboratory-adapted M strain H37R ( segregation coefficient = 0.10 in H878 vs. =0.18 in37R ). The kinetics of plasm-bearing bacteria in lungs of M-infected rabbits did not follow a monotonic decline; percent plasm-bearing cells increased between 28 and 56 post-infection and remained between 84 and112 postinfection despite a large increase in bacterial numbers in lung at late points. Mathematical modeling suggested a nonotonic change in percent plasm-bearing can be explained if Mtb population consists of at least 2 subpopulations with different replication/death kinetics: one expanding early being controlled/eliminated, another expanding at times causing counterintuitive increase percent plasm-bearing. Importantly, model with homogeneous M population could not explain data when run stochastically.
Carbohydrates and glycoproteins modulate key biological functions. However, experimental determination of carbohydrate structures is notoriously difficult. Computational approaches can aid in carbohydrate prediction, structure determination, and design. In this work, we developed GlycanModel, an algorithm that computationally builds glycans layer-by-layer using kernel density estimates ( KDE ) of glycan conformations derived from Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) and quantum (QM ) calculations. GlycanModel was benchmarked on glycan structures of varying lengths. Structures predicted by GlycanModel agreed with native structures at high accuracy for both de novo modeling and density-guided building.
Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification that regulates protein quality by coupling it with proteasomal degradation. The SCF (Skp-Cul1-F-box) complex is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that recognizes substrates via interaction between the F-box protein and the substrate. The F-box is determinant of substrate specificity. However, the number of identified ubiquitin ligase-substrate pairs is a major bottleneck in the field. In Penicillium oxalicum, transcription factors such as Brl, A, Cre, Xr, and Ace1 are conserved in filamentous fungi that regulate development and transcription of hemi cellulase genes. Ace1 is also positively correlated with growth and conidiation and negatively with expression of hemi cellulase genes. The ubiquitin ligase-substrate SCF23-Ace1 is identified in P. oxalic. Most F23 is present in free form within the nucleus. A small portion of F23 associates with Sk1 to form F23-Sk1 heterodimer assembles with three core components Sk1, Cul1 and R1 of SC to form SCF23. Under glucose, F23 absence results in decreased transcription of brA which encodes master for asexual development and spore pigmentation genes. Under cellulose, transcription of hemi cellulase in F23 are significantly upregulated. When F23 is present, Ace exists as full-length and low-molecular degraded. Ace has ubiquitin modification. Deleting F23 does not affect Ace transcription but results in accumulation of all Ace versions. Accumulated Ace is dysfunctional no longer binds to promoters of target including cellulase cb1 eg1, hemicellase x11, and pigmentation abB.
Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium relies on a basement membrane (BM) composed of oriented fibrils and a homogenous matrix. We found that Rab10 and Rab8 define two parallel routes for BM protein secretion. Both routes are required for BM production, but they compete with each other. Rab10 promotes lateral planar-polarized secretion, whereas Rab8 promotes basal secretion, leading to fibril and homogenous BM formation, respectively. The dystrophin-associated complex (DC) and Rab10 are present in a planar-polar tubular compartment containing BM proteins. DC is essential for fibril formation and sufficient to orient secretion towards the Rab10 route. The exocyst complex has a dual function in this context. Ex70 directly interacts with dystroph to limit planar polarization and is required for the Rab8 route.
The ability to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) will increase the benefits of bnAb therapy. Machine learning is a powerful approach for prediction. However, HIV-1 subtypes in available datasets are currently underrepresented, affecting models’ generalizability across subtypes. Additionally, combinations of bnAbs are required to avoid resistance to a single bnAb and computationally determining optimal combinations of bn is an unsolved. Recently, machine learning models using outcomes for multiple antibodies at once, called multi-task learning (MTL), have improved predictions. We develop a new model and show that, beyond improved performance MT also addresses previous challenges. Specifically, we demonstrate that MT can mitigate underrepresented subtypes and MT allows to learn patterns of co-resistance to combinations, providing tools to predict antibodies’ epitopes and select optimalAb combinations.
Myeloma (MM) is a hematological disease characterized by the aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow. The effects of treatments for MM vary between patients, highlighting the importance of developing prognostic models for therapeutic decision-making. Most previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the fact that dysfunction of the pathway is closely associated with disease progression. This study considered two strategies to construct models by pathway information: pathway score method and grouplasso using pathway information. The former converted gene expression to sample-wise pathway scores for fitting. We considered three methods for pathway calculation (ssSEA, GSVA, zcores ) and 14 sources providing information. We implemented methods in microarray data for MM (GSE324 ) and obtained candidate with best performance in validation. The candidate compared with gene model and previously published in external. We also investigated effects of missing on prediction. Results showed grouplasso incorporating pathway (Vax ) more than gene in both internal and external. Immune information including V pathways seemed more for MM.ax also outperformed previously published. Moreover, new more resistant to missing, presence <5% would not deteriorate accuracy using imputation.
Mitochondrial fission is the process by which a mitochondrion divides into two daughter mitochondria. When a cell is insulted, mitochondrial fission is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death. To understand this process, we need to know the molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial fission. We developed a nonlinear dynamical model of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp)-dependent mitochondrial fission and used it to identify parameters regulating the total fission rate (TFR) as a function of time. FR is a nondimensionalization of the model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ=kM, where M is the concentration of mitochondrial fission factor (M) and k+ and− are association and dissociation constants between oligomers on the mitochondrial outer membrane. μ can be thought of as the maximum rate of disassembling of oligomers. The nondimensional system results in four dimensionless parameters. FR and cumulative fission (TF) depend only on μ. Interestingly, TF does not monotonically increase with μ. Instead, it increases with μ to a point and then decreases as μ continues. This non-monotonic dependence on μ suggests that targeting k, k, or M may have non-intuitive impact on fission.
The development of CRISPR-based gene drives offers promising prospects for controlling disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests. However, a significant challenge for successful suppression is the rapid evolution of resistance. One approach to mitigate the development of resistance involves targeting functionally constrained regions using multiple gRNAs. In this study, we constructed a 3-gRNA homing gene system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyrosine decarboxylase 2 ( T2 ) in Drosoph suuk, a notorious pest. Our investigation revealed a low level of homing in the germline but octopamine restored egglaying defects in T2 mutant females, allowing easier maintenance than other suppression targets. We tested the effectiveness in Dros melanogaster and constructed additional split systems by introducing promoter-C9 transgenes to improve homing. Our findings show genetic polymorphisms in wild populations limit the spread of gene alleles and profoundly influence Cas9 activity.
The brain is not only constrained by the energy needed to fuel computation, but also by the energy required to form memories. Experiments have shown that even simple learning tasks, which require only a few synaptic updates, carry a significant metabolic cost. In contrast, learning tasks like MNIST to 95% accuracy require at least 108 synaptic updates. Therefore, it is likely that the brain has evolved to learn using as little energy as possible. We explore the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks. Based on a parsimonious energy model, we propose two plasticity algorithms that save energy: 1 ) only modify synapses with large updates and 2 ) restrict plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. In networks are often larger than required, yet vanilla backprop updates all synapses. In this case, savings can be achieved while incurring only slightly worse learning. Thus, competitively restricting plasticity saves energy associated with synaptic.
In this study, we investigated how laboratory evolution can compensate for fitness defects caused by genome streamlining in the bacterium Acinetobacter bayi AD1x. We created six variants of AD1x with deletions ranging from 22 to 42 kilobases and two with larger deletions of 70 and 293 kilobases and evolved them for ~300 generations in chemically defined and complex media. We sequenced the genomes of endpoint isolates and found that fitness increased in all cases except two that failed to improve in one of the two environments. Mutations in nine protein-coding genes and small RNAs were associated with fitness in one or both environments. The global transcription regulators ( ribonuclease ), csr ( RNA carbon storage regulator ) and hfq ( RNA protein chaper ) were frequently mutated across strains, though effects varied with deletion and environment. Mutations in this network likely compensate for earlier deletion in ADx ancestor and restored csr function in all strains. Our results show that fitness lost during streamlining can be regained through evolution and tends to occur through deletion-specific and global adjustments.
We have developed a self-cleaving ribozyme-based tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebraf. We show that inserting the T3 selfleaving ribyme in an intron enables rapid pre-mRNA cleavage with up to 20-fold reduction in expression. This ribyme displays superior activity compared to other ribymes. We then inserted T48 ribyme in the second intron of albino gene using CRISPR/C9 and observed pigmentation similar to that in mutant. Using base-editing to inactivate ribyme, we show this phenotype is reversible. We also generated a Flippase and Cre-activatable version of T48 ribyme, called Ribo, to control mRNA of albino. Ribo activation induced mRNA knockdown and recapitulated albino mutant. Furthermore, we show Cre and Dre-controllable Gal/UAS in Ribo cassette knocked-down independently of expression target. We introduce Ribo as flexible tool to control endogenous expression in vertebrate and alternative to existing knockdown strategies.
Segmentation of cellular structures in microscopic images typically requires fluorescent labeling. However, a new approach uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs ) to detect structures in transmitted light images. This eliminates the need for transgenic or fluorescent labeling, frees up imaging channels, reduces phototoxicity and speeds up imaging. However, this approach requires optimized conditions and computational specialists. Here, we introduce “aiSEG”, a user-friendly CNN-based software to segment nuclei and cells in bright field images. We evaluated it for nucleus segmentation in different cell types in 2D cultures from different imaging modalities in hand-curated and novel data. We provide curated ground-truth data with 1. 1 million in 20, 000 images. aiSEG accurately segments nuclei from bright images similar to manual. It retains biologically relevant information, e. g. for quantification of biosensors signaling pathway dynamics. aiSEG is adaptable to new cases with only images required retraining. SEG is accessible through command, and graphical interface. It is to environments and does not require user experience.
In this study, we investigated whether humans rely on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features to address the challenge of identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments. One such property is the rate of change of features, as behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. We hypothesised that humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast. We tested this idea by asking 295 participants to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when a feature of the band predicted reward changed either slowly or quickly. We found that participants accrued more reward when the band’s relevant feature changed slowly and its irrelevant quickly, compared to the opposite. We did not find a difference in ability to generalise to unseen values between conditions. We used a set of function approximation Kalman filter models to test how feature speed could affect learning and found that participants had higher learning rate for the slow feature and adjusted to both relevance and speed of feature. The larger improvement in participants’ performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more they adjusted their learning rates. These results provide evidence that human learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward.
Patients with estrogen receptor-negative (ER) breast cancer have the worst prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes and often experience rapid recurrence or progression to metastatic disease shortly after diagnosis. Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in most solid tumors, so understanding metastatic biology is crucial for effective intervention. We previously identified 12 genes associated with metastatic susceptibility using a mouse genetics approach. Here, we extend those studies to identify Res1, a poorly characterized gene, as a novel metastasis gene in ER breast cancer. Res1 is a large protein with conserved intron-exon structure but poor amino acid conservation. We used CRISPR or gene mouse models crossed with Polyoma-T antigen engineered mouse (MT-PMT ) to demonstrate that Res1 reduction resulted in increased tumor growth, shortened survival, and increased lung metastases consistent with patient data. Furthermore, analysis of matched primary and metastatic tissues revealed loss of wildtype Res1 in tumor, consistent with Res1 being a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis revealed Res1 role in transcriptional control through association with G-quadruplex in sequences, particularly ribosomal biogenesis. These results suggest Res1 loss enhances progression in ER breast cancer through alterations in transcriptional and translational control.
Meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are formed by the topoisomerase-like enzyme Spo11 and activate the DNA damage response (DDR) kinase Mec1 via the clamp loader Rad24. We investigated the roles of Mec1 and Rad24 in meiotic recombination by deleting the mismatch repair protein Msh2 and controlling meiotic prophase length via the Ndt transcription factor. Genome-wide mapping of meiotic progeny revealed that loss of Rad24 reduces spore viability and recombination frequency, consistent with previous studies. In contrast, loss of Mec increases recombination frequency and has less effect on spore viability. Despite these differences, multi-chromat events initiated by closely spaced DSBs occur more frequently in the absence of either Rad or Mec, suggesting loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation. Both Mec and Rad have roles in spatial regulation of crossovers (COs). Loss of either Rad or Mec results in more random CO distributions, suggesting reductions in global interference. These effects are similar to but less extreme than the phenotype of ‘MM’ mutants such as zip3, and may be driven by reductions in interfering CO. In addition to shared roles in CO regulation, our results highlight separable roles for Rad as a pro-CO factor and for Mec as regulator of recombination, loss of which helps suppress broader defects in CO caused by DDR abrogation.
Pneumocystis jirovecii is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients. Despite its major impact on human health, limited progress has been made in dissecting the pathobiology of this pathogen. This is largely due to the inability to culture the organism in vitro. We present a comprehensive in silico genome-scale model of Pneumyst growth and metabolism to identify metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder growth in vitro. The model was developed using recently published data and literature as well as bioinformatics tools and software. We employed Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement Learning approaches to make predictions regarding metabolic fluxes and identify critical components of Pneumyst growth. Our findings provide insights into the biology of Pneumyst and offer a novel strategy to overcome the longstanding challenge of culturing this pathogen in vitro.
YAP/TA is a transcriptional coactivator that induces cell proliferation by localizing to the nucleus at low cell density. However, at high cell density, the Hippo pathway is activated, leading to Y/TA translocation into the cytoplasm and cell cycle arrest. Cancer cells have more Y/TA than normal cells, but it is unclear if this increase is sufficient to overcome contact inhibition at high density. We constructed a 3D model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hipp-Y/TA pathway. We introduced a novel component that inputs cell density into the Hipp pathway, enabling simulation of cell proliferation as output. We solved the model using reaction and molecular dynamics equations with adhesion and repulsive forces between cells and friction. We set cell cycles of mitosis and growth under cell kinetics. We simulated YTA levels to investigate the extent required for sustained proliferation at high density. Results show a twofold increase in YTA was sufficient for cancer cells to evade cycle compared to normal, enabling proliferation at high density. This model may be applicable for evaluating malignancy based on YTA levels, developing drugs to suppress cancer proliferation and determining drug dosages.
Many eukaryotic proteins and RNAs contain low-complex domains (LCDs) with a strong propensity for binding and driving phase separation into molecular condensates. Mutations in LCDs frequently disrupt condens dynamics, resulting in pathological transitions to solid states. We present an energy framework that operates on a ‘stickiness’ energy scale rather than explicit sequence. Sequences are characterized by Wasserstein distance relative to random counterparts. Armed with energy framework, we map material and dynamical properties governed by energy features modulated by LCD complexity, including periodicity and disorder. Highly periodic patterns promote elasticity, while random exhibit viscosity. Our results show that minimum periodicity is crucial for condens fluidity, avoiding transitions to glass or solid states. We demonstrate that energy explains recent findings on prion domains and condens viscoelasticity.
The development of ectodermal organs begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that progressively invaginates into the underlying mesyme as the organ takes shape. Signaling by secreted molecules is critical for epithelial morphogenesis, but how this information leads to cell rearrangement and shape changes remains open. Using the mouse dentition as a model, we establish that nonmuscle myosin II is essential for dental epithelial invagination and functions by promoting cell adhesion and convergent cell movements in the suprabasal layer. Sh signaling controls these processes by inducing myosin activation via AK. Pharmacological induction of AK and myos II also rescues defects caused by inhibition of Sh. Together, our results support a model in which Sh signal is transmitted through myos II to power cellular rearrangement for proper epithelial invagination.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scATAC-seq) are powerful tools for understanding biological mechanisms at the single-cell level. However, current methods for transferring labels from RNA-seq to AT-seq are limited by their inability to preserve fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic/extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets. Here, we present scGC, a deep transfer learning model based on graph convolutional network, which achieves high performance in preserving biological variation while integrating hundreds of thousands of cells in minutes with low memory. We show that scGC is powerful in integrating mouse data from AT-seq and C-seq. Thus, scGC achieves high transfer accuracy and knowledge across modalities.
Proteins with nuclear localization signals (NLS) are directed into the nucleus through interactions between NLS and importin proteins. NLS are generally short and rich in basic amino acids; however, identifying NLS can be challenging due to the lack of a universally conserved sequence. In this study, we characterized the sequence of an essential and conserved NLS in Mc3, a subunit of the replicative helicase. Through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 (AF) modeling, we demonstrate that precise positioning of basic residues within N is critical for nuclear transport of Mc3 through interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs nuclear of Mc, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the complex and poor growth.
Ataxin-2 is a protein implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases including spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinsonism. The protein is a therapeutic target for ALS and related conditions. The protein is involved in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability and the assembly of mRNP-granules, a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Previous work has shown that the L (Sm-like) domain of At2 can stimulate translation and antagonize mNP-gran assembly. Here we advance these findings through a series of experiments on Drosophila and human Atin-2 proteins. Results of Targets of RNA Binding Proteins Identified by Editing (TRIBE), co-localization and immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that poly-binding protein (PAB) interacting motif of Atin-2 may be a determinant of mRNA and protein content of AtinR-granules. Experiments with transgenic Dophila indicate that At-LS domain may protect against neurodegeneration, while P2 and IDR interactions support At-induced cytotoxicity.
Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) in the extraocular muscles (OM) and limb muscles have distinct gene regulatory networks that determine their fate. We used mice to study the role of Pitx2, Myf5, and Pax7 in MuSC specification and maintenance. We found that Pit2 is dispensable for MuSC specification and maintenance in the OM, but not in the limb. In contrast, Pax7 is required for MuSC maintenance in the OM. We propose a relay between Pit2, My5, and Pax for MuSC maintenance in the OM. We also found that OM Mu adopt a quiescent state earlier than limb Mu and do not proliferate in the adult. However, OM have more Pax7+ MuSC per area pre- and postnat. In the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, limb Mu proliferate, but OM Mu are less and not proliferative. Our study provides a comprehensive characterisation of Mu heterogeneity along the body axis and insights into OM sparing during muscular dystrophy.
Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2020, several variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs) have been identified, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron lineage, and others. These variants exhibit distinct levels of virulence, antigenicity, and infectivity, necessitating specific control measures. In this study, we propose an infectious disease model to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV variants among the population. We combine the proposed model with reported data of variants and physical neural networks (PINs) to develop a novel mechanism called VOC-informed network (VOC-IN). Our results show that VOC-IN can accurately fit reported data of British Columbia (BC) province and internal health agencies in Canada. Furthermore, it can simulate unobserved dynamics, infer time-dependent parameters, and short-term predictions. Experimental results reveal variations in intensity of control implemented across regions. VOC-IN performs well in fitting and forecasting long-term multi-wave data.
Image-based cell profiling is a powerful tool for comparing perturbed cell populations by measuring thousands of single-cell features and summarizing them into profiles. However, this is typically done by averaging across cells, which fails to capture the heterogeneity within cell populations. We introduce CytoNet, a deep learning approach that improves mechanism prediction by 30–68% in average compared to profiling on a public dataset. CyNet uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple instance framework, providing an easier method for aggregating single-cell data than previously published. CyNet achieves this improvement by downweighting mitotic cells or those with debris and prioritizing large cells. The approach requires only perturbation labels for training, which are available in all profiling datasets. CyNet offers a post-processing step for single profiles that significantly boosts performance on image profiling datasets.
The brain’s ability to solve complex tasks depends on the adaptive changes in the spatio-temporal organization of brain activity under different conditions. Altered flexibility in these dynamics can lead to impaired performance, manifesting as difficulties in attention regulation, distraction, and behavioral adaptation. Such impairments result in decreased efficiency and increased effort in accomplishing goal-directed tasks. Therefore, developing measures that directly assess effort in these transitions using neural data is important. This study proposes a framework to associate effort during task performance with electroencephal ( EEG ) patterns. The framework relies on identification of dynamical states ( micro ) and optimal theory. We apply this framework to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stro task, a test where participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another often conflicting aspect. Our findings reveal increased linked to effort, confirming the framework’s effectiveness in quantifying transitions.
Malaria-exposed individuals develop atypical memory B cells (MBCs) that are capable of producing antibodies against Plasmodium vivax (P. viv) antigens. To date, little is known about the generation of P. viv-specific MBCs and their role in protective humoral immunity. Here, we generated P. viv Duffy Binding Protein II (PvDBPI) probes to study the development and durability of P. viv-specific MBC and their capacity to produce neutralizing antibodies following infection. PDBI-specific MBCs were elicited during illness and persisted through recovery phase of infection. To address the biology and function of P viv-specific MBC in producing antibodies, a single M was cultured and secreted Ig tested for binding and inhibition. The M-derived antibodies produced variable levels of anti-PDBIg in cultures and some produced high levels comparable to classical M clones. We focused on the function of M in producing antibodies. Among M clones, A12 and B11 produced broadly against PDBI variants. Notably, cell receptors (BCs) of PDBI M expressed unique IGH genes with usage comparable to classical M. The somatic hypermutation (SH) and CDR length of VH and V in these M subsets were not different. Our findings revealed P infections elicited the development and persistence of P viv M. The accumulation M during infections might play an important role in producing antibodies against malaria.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates from a reference panels can be used to model multiple phenotypes jointly and leverage sharing of effects across phenotypes to improve prediction accuracy. However, this requires individual-level data, which are often not publicly available. In this work, we introduce mr-mashss, an extension of the mrash model that requires only summary statistics from GWAS and LD estimates. By using summary data, we achieve the goal of increasing applicability of mrash to data that are not publicly available and making it scalable to biobank-size. Through simulations, we show that mrash is competitive, and often outperforms current methods for single and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in a variety of scenarios that differ in pattern of sharing across phenotypes, number of phenotypes, number of variants, and heritability. We also present real analysis of 16 blood phenotypes in UKobank that mrash achieves higher accuracy than competing methods for majority of traits, especially when data has smaller size.
Accurate prediction of epidemics is crucial for making well-informed decisions to control infectious diseases, but heterogeneity in the system poses a challenge. This study proposes a novel modelling framework that integrates spatio-temporal heterogeneity of individuals into homogeneous models by introducing a continuous recruitment process for susceptibles. A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations (DE) model. Simultaneously, we propose a specific form for the recruitment and develop a mechanistic model. We use data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai to train the DE model using deep learning and calibrate the mechanistic model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methods. Subsequently, we project the attack and peak of new infections for the first wave in China after the dynamic-COVID policy adjustment. Our results indicate an attack rate and peak of new infections of 80. 06% and 3.17% of the population, compared to the homogeneous model’s 99.97 and 32.78, providing 18.6% improvement in accuracy based on data. Simulations demonstrate that heterogeneity in susceptibles decreases herd immunity 37.36% of population and prolongs outbreak from 30 to 70 days.
Synapses in the brain are highly noisy, which leads to large trial-by-trial variability. Given that synapses are costly in terms of energy, these levels of noise are surprising. We propose that synapses use noise to represent uncertainty about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. To show this, we developed a mathematical framework in which the synapse interacts with the soma of the postsynaptic neuron similar to an agent in an uncertain environment. This framework suggests synapses use an internal model of somatic membrane that is updated by synaptic rule resembling LTP/LTD. In addition, this entails syn utilizes noisy release to encode uncertainty of somatic potential.
Cell lineage reconstruction is an important for understanding the development, differentiation, and progression of cells. Single-cell sequencing technologies allow for more detailed analysis with higher resolution. We present Scup, a distance-based cell tree reconstruction method using bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues. Single-cell sequencing challenges, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors, are included in Scup. Scup computes distances between cells and reconstructs the tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm. With an embarrassingly parallel design, Scup is faster than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining accuracy. We investigate Scup’s robustness using synthetic and biological datasets of 18 cells.
In many low-income settings, health systems have limited resources to improve population health outcomes. Health “benefit packages” (HBPs) are used to determine which services to include in the public health system. However, analytic approaches to weigh evidence and inform HBPs have limitations. We propose the “Thanzi Lae On” (LO) model to evaluate Malawi HBs, addressing these limitations. The LO model mechanistically simulates disease incidence, health-seeking behaviour, and healthcare capacity under realistic resource constraints. We simulated health gains under plausible HB strategies for Malawi. A linear optimisation (LA)-based HBP achieved the largest health gain—8% reduction in disability life years (DALs) between 2023 and 204 compared to the benchmark, concentrating on high-impact treatments. However, this HBP incurred excess DALs in the first years of implementation. Other approaches were assessed, including prioritisation based on patient characteristics rather than service. Unlike LA-based HBP, this approach achieved consistent gains relative to the benchmark year-by-year and 5% reduction DALs over the period, suggesting patient-based might prove beneficial.
Meiotic chromosome pairing and segregation are essential for reproductive success in many species. However, the mechanisms underlying these events are not fully understood in many species. Here, we investigate meiotic pairing and segregation in the holocentric moth Plodia interpunctella and compare to the silkworm Bomby mori, which diverged over 100 million years ago. We find that both species initiate pairing at gene-rich chromosome ends and form rod-shaped bivalents at metaphase I. However, unlike Bomby, Plodia can orient bival in multiple ways at metaph I. In both species, kinetochores assemble at non-telomeric loci toward chromosome centers regardless of bivalent position. Sister kincho are not paired, instead four kincho are observed at metaph I. We find microtubule attachments orienting kincho. These findings challenge the view that paired pole-facing kinchores are required for hom separation in I.
The median eminence (ME), located at the base of the hypothalamus, plays a crucial role in information exchange between the brain and pituitary gland. Previous studies have shown that mutations affecting the transcription factor SOX3/So3 result in hypopituitarism, likely of hypothalamic origin. Here, we show that absence of Sox3 predominantly affects ME phenotypes that occur in juvenile animals, despite embryonic onset of SOX3 expression. In the pituitary, hormone levels correlate with lack of endocrine maturation. In parallel, ME2-glia and oligodendrocy differentiation are affected. We further show that low-dose aspirin treatment, affecting NG2-glia, changes gut microbiota rescue proliferative and hypitism in Sox mutants. Our study highlights a role of NG-glia for ME during postnatal development and sensitivity to extrinsic signals.
In Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic epidermal morphogenesis, the GTPase CED-10/Rac is an essential activator of F-act. However, we need to identify the GEF that activates CED-10/R1 during embryonic migrations. The two-component GEF C-5/C-12 is known to activate C-10 to promote cell movements that result in engulfment of dying cells during embryogenesis and later migration of the larval Distal Tip. It is believed C-5/C-12 powers movements of corpse and migration by promoting F-act formation. We tested if C-5/C-12 was involved in embryonic migrations and got a contradictory result: C-5/C-12 supports embryonic migrations since loss leads to failed epidermal migrations. However, C-5/C12 inhibits F- in migrating epider, the opposite of what expected for C- GEF. To address how-12 could have two effects on- during corpse and migration, we investigated if- harbors GAP functions. A candidate region in- faces away the- catalytic region. Mutating candidate Arg in the GAP region (537 ) altered epider cell function and not corpse function. Interfered G function by with- ability to bind. Mutating SerineArg in predicted and resulted loss of ventral and corpse. Genetic studies support GAP likely acts on Gases. We propose-5/C-12 support cycling multiple Gases by distinct to promote and inhibit- nucleation.
Visual information processing in the brain is thought to be organized hierarchically across different timescales through intrinsic mechanisms such as coupling and adaptation. However, recent studies of the rodent visual system suggest that this may not be the case. Here, we used information-theoretic and autocorrelation analysis to show that information and timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the mouse visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. Moreover, intrinsic times for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy whereas predictability was stimulus-dependent. We reproduced these observations in a basic recurrent network with correlated input. Our findings suggest that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher areas while reducing predictability for an efficient code.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with a broad potential for new applications. However, the neural circuits engaged during TMS are poorly understood. This study used epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of the motor cortical macrocolumn. The goal was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the response to TMS, including direct and indirect waves. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify important pathways and machine learning was used to identify common features among these pathways. Sensitivity analysis identified neuron types that preferentially contributed to corticospinal waves. Single wave could be predicted using the average probability of possible paths between the neuron and L pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs). The conduction of the shortest path to PTNs determined the latency of corticinal wave. Moreover, multiple neuron activations could modulate corticinal waves. The results support that different pathways contribute to corticinal waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Activation of afferents to the cortex as well as neuron within the motor initiated different waves.
Cell-free placental DNA (cfDNA) is present in the maternal circulation during gestation and has the potential as a research and clinical tool to investigate the placental epigenome across gestation, which previously required invasive placental sampling. cfDNA has been implemented in clinical settings for non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). However, the biology of cfDNA remains poorly understood, limiting research and clinical utility of cfDNA. This review examines current knowledge of cfDNA, including origins and characteristics, highlights gaps in knowledge, and future directions. cfDNA originates from the placenta, fetus, and maternal tissues, and is present in maternal circulation from early gestation. cfDNA is highly fragmented and methylated and degraded. cfDNA can be isolated from maternal blood, urine, saliva, and other bodily fluids. cfDNA has been used in NIPT for aneuploidy screening, fetal sex determination, and RhD typing. However, the biology of cfDNA remains poorly understood, limiting research and clinical utility. cfDNA is influenced by maternal, fetal, and placental factors, including gestational age, maternal health, and disease. cfDNA is also influenced by cell-free DNA from other sources, including maternal, fetal, and placental tissues. Further research is needed to understand the biology of cfDNA and its clinical utility.
Hormone-dependent cancers (HDCs) such as breast, endometrial, and prostate cancer share several risk factors, suggesting a common aetiology. Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we show that risk variants cluster across these cancers, contrasting with genetically uncorrelated traits. We identify 44 multi-HDC risk regions across the genome, defined as overlapping regions of risk for at least two HDCs: two regions contain risk for all four HDC, 13 for three HDC and 28 for two HDC. Integrating GWAS, epigenomic profiling and promoter Hi-C maps from diverse cell models, we annotate 53 candidate genes at 22-HDC risk regions. These are enriched for established genes from the COSMIC Cancer Census but have no previously reported pleiotropic roles. We also identify lncRNAs as potential HDC targets and risk in regions that alter transcription motifs, suggesting mechanisms. Known targets are overrepresented among candidate-HDC genes, implying some may serve as targets for development or repurposing existing treatments for HDC. Our approach provides a framework for identifying genes driving complex traits and understanding HDC susceptibility.
Polymyomyositis is an inflammatory muscle disease of unknown cause in the Kooiiker dog breed. A genome-wide association study of 33 cases and 106 controls identified a region on chromosome 19 associated with the disease (p = 4.7×10−10 ). Haplotype analysis indicated that cases shared a 2.9 Mb region in homozygous or heterozygous state. Next-generation sequencing implicated a 39 kb deletion 10 kb upstream of interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. The deletion frequency was 0.81 in cases and 0.25 in random Koo dogs. Leukocytes from affected dogs homozy for the deletion overexpressed IL and IL upon mitogen stimulation. We suggest elements 10–49 upstream IL/IL play a role in regulation and deletion is a risk factor for polymyitis in Koo. Postulating penetrance was 10–20 for homozy and 0.5–2 for heterozygous.
Proteins play a crucial role in a variety of applications including food processing, therapeutics, and identification of pathogenic mutations. Protein engineering aims to improve stability and there is interest in streamlining processes to enable rapid optimization of stabilized proteins with fewer iterations. Here, we develop a large-scale protein model to predict stability. ESM is trained on folding of 528 natural and de novo sequences from 461 domains and can accommodate deletions, insertions, and multiple mutations. We show a protein model can be fine-tuned to predict folding. ESM performs reasonably on small domains and generalizes to sequences dist from the set. Lastly, we discuss our model’s compared to state-of-the-art in generalizing larger protein. Our results highlight the need for large stability on a dataset that mirrors sequence lengths in nature.
Inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are a family of inhibitory receptors expressed by natural killer (NK) cells and late-differentiated T cells. Recent studies suggest that KIR regulate T cell-mediated immunity. We hypothesized that in autoimmunity, where enhanced T cell response is detrimental, KIR would have an opposite effect. We studied Type 1 diabetes (T1) as an example of autoimmunity. In T1, variation in Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) genes explains up 50% of genetic risk, indicating T cells have major role in T1 etiology. We investigated if KIR affect T response by asking if HLA associations were modified by K genes. We conducted immunogenetic analysis of case-control T1 dataset (N=11,961) and found that KIR, in presence of encoding ligands, have consistent and significant effect on HLA II genetic associations. Our results were validated in independent set. We conclude that KIR significantly H II associations and suggest K regulate CD T responses in T1.
Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FE) is an age-related cause of vision loss and the most common expansion-mediated disease in humans characterised to date. Up to 80% of FE cases have been attributed to expansion of a non-coding CT repeat termed CT18.1 within the ubiquously expressed factor encoding gene T4. We comprehensively describe CT18.1-driven molecular components of disease within patient-derived corne endothelial cells (ECs) from a cohort of individuals with CT18.-expanded (Exp+) and CT18-independent (Exp) FE. We employ long-read, short, and transcriptomic techniques to interrogate expansion-specific biomarkers. Long-read sequencing and alternative splicing of short transcriptomic data reveal global altered splicing within Exp FE and transcripts associated with CT18-expansions. Differential expression highlights transcript consequences Exp FE within ECs. Exon usage, pathway, and transcriptomics reveal T4 isoform skewing in Exp with downstream consequences. Exome data from FE cases identified rare (minor <0.005 ) and potentially deleterious T4 variants in FE Exp, suggesting T4 independent of CT18 may increase FE risk. Our study supports hypothesis at least two pathogenic mechanisms RNA and T4 iso-specific dysregulation underpin FE pathophysiology.
Rice (Oryza sativa) direct seeding is an alternative to labor-intensive transplanting, but requires varieties with low-temperature germination (LT) when grown in cold climates. To investigate the genetic basis of LT, we identified the quantitative trait locus (QTL) qLT from variety Arroz da, which shows rapid germination at lower temperatures using QTL-seq. We delineated the candidate region to a 52-kb interval containing REGULATORY FACTOR14 (GFh) gene, which is expressed during germination. Arroz da GFh encodes functional GFh whereas Japanese variety Hitomeb harbors 4-b deletion in the region. Knocking out GFh in near-isogenic (NIL) carrying Ar da allele decreased LT whereas overexpressing GFh in Hitb increased LT, indicating GFh is causal behind qLT. Analysis of numerous rice accessions revealed functional GFh was lost in popular varieties during breeding. We generated NIL in Hitb background carrying 172-k genomic from da including GFh. The NIL showed LT compared Hitb otherwise agronomic traits. GFh from da represents valuable for seeding in cold.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major human pathogen that causes liver disease worldwide. HBV replicates by reverse transcription of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) into relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA), which contains an 8–9 nucleotide-long terminal redundancy (TR) on the negative DNA strand. It is unclear whether the TR forms a 5’ or 3’ flap on HBrcDNA or which is removed during covalently closed DNA (ccDNA) formation. To address these questions, we generated a HBV mutant cell line HepDES182G with a C182G mutation in the pgRNA sequence, altering the 3’ TR while the 5 TR remained wild-type. We found that HBrc and ccDNA production in HepDES182G cells was comparable to wild-type levels. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis revealed that the positive strand of rcDNA and both strands of ccDNA predominantly carried the wild-type 182 residue, indicating the 5 TR of DNA serves as template during rc replication forming a duplex with the positive DNA while the 3 TR forms a flap which is removed during cc formation. We found that the 3 flap endonuclease Mus81 plays a role in cc formation in wild-type HB replicating cells alongside the 5 flaponuclease EN1. We mapped Mus and EN cleavage sites within TR of nuclear rcDNA by Sanger sequencing. The function between Mus and EN in cc formation indicates the putative 5 and 3 flaps are dynamically on rc precursors.
Microbial communities in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) play a crucial role in industrial wastewater treatment, but can be disrupted by variable operations. Although some microbial guilds linked to MFC performance under specific conditions have been identified, comprehensive knowledge of the convergent community structure and pathways is lacking. We developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale model (mmEM) based on metabolic crossfeeding to study the adaptation of communities in MFC treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a cannedine factory. The model encompassed three microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SR), methogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SO). Our findings revealed a shift from SO-domin to METomin community as organic loading rates (LR) increased, along with decline in MFC performance. The mmEM accurately predicted microbial abundance at LR and adaptation to LR. Simulations revealed constraints on SO growth due to reduced-sulfide cycling and acetate crossfeeding with SR. More metabolites from SR were diverted to MET, facilitating dominance. Assessing crossfeeding under LR enabled scenario simulations to explore impact of elevated levels on SO growth and MFC. This work highlights metabolic in shaping community response to LR.
Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used to guide biological discovery in biomedicine, such as prioritizing small molecules in drug discovery. ML models are used to predict properties of biological systems and prioritize candidates for experimental validation. However, when applied to unseen situations, ML models can be overconfident and produce false positives. To address this, we propose CPEC, an ML framework for controlled discovery. We demonstrate its effectiveness using enzyme annotation as a case study, simulating discovery of less-characterized enzymes. CPEC integrates a deep model with conform prediction, providing FDR-controlled predictions for a protein. Conform provides statistical guarantees that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability.
Mutations in the TARDB gene, which encodes TDP-43, cause some cases of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( fALS ). TDP-43 is a protein that is hyperphosphorylated in most patients with ALS. T-43 aggregation may contribute to disease or be a cellular response to sequest toxic protein away from the rest of the cell. T-43 interacts with the heat shock chaperone HSP90, which stabilizes its normal conformation. However, it is not known whether this interaction contributes to neurotoxicity in vivo. Using a C. elegans model of ALS T-43opathy, we find that loss of HSP90 protects against T-43 neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration in adult animals. This is accompanied by a decrease in total and phosphorylated T-43. We also find that HSP90 upregulates key stress responsive heat shock gene expression, including HSP70 and HSP16. 1, and that normal levels of HSP16. 1 are required for H90 effects on T-43. The neuroprotective effect of H90 does not involve regulation of proteasome activity in C. elegans. Our data demonstrate that H90 chaper activity contributes to outcomes in T-43opathies in vivo using a model of ALS.
The female reproductive system of arthropods is poorly understood at the molecular level due to a lack of diversity in model systems. We used single-nucle RNA sequencing to produce a comprehensive atlas of the adult female reproductive system of Artemia franciscana. We mapped our data to the Cell Atlas of the Drosila melanogaster ovary, highlighting conserved programs between distantly related arthrop species. We identified major cell types in the Artemia ovary, including germ cells, follicle cells, and muscle cells. We used germ cells to explore gene regulation of the chromosome during meiosis, highlighting unique dynamics and the presence of meiotic chromosome silencing in this group.
Chronic pain is a debilitating and expensive condition that affects millions of people worldwide, costing the United States alone $600 billion in 2010. A common symptom of chronic pain is allodynia, where non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with variable presentations across individuals. While the mechanisms are unclear, allody is hypothesized to be caused by dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Here, we analyze biophysically-motcircuit structures that represent motifs in neural in laminae-II of the horn. These are hypothesized to be part of the pathways that mediate two types of allody: static and dynamic. We use neural rate models to describe activity of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in each circuit. By accounting experiment-observed responses under healthy, we specify parameters defining circuits that yield behavior under normal. Then, we implement sensitivity analysis to identify mechanisms likely cause allody-producing dysregulation of circuit’s E signaling. We find that disruption generally occurs due to downregulation inhibitory so excitatory are “released” from inhibitory, or upregulation excitatory so excit “escape their inhib. Which mechanism most likely, circuit components involved, proportion circuits can vary.
Eukary elongation factor 2 (EF2) is essential for the translation of proteins in eukaryotic cells. It is dependent on heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and cochaperones H1, C1, and C7 for its function. We investigated the role of Hsp and cochones in EF2 function and found that H and cochones have distinct roles in regulating EF2. Mutations in H or cochones reduced steady-state levels of EF2 and affected its accumulation. H mutants that affected EF2 were also negatively impacted by deletion of H1. Mutations in EF that mimic human disease-associated mutations were impacted by loss of H1 and one was partially rescued by H1 overexpression. In contrast, mutations in H or cochones affected sensitivity to diphtheria toxin, which is dependent on EF post-translational modification. Our results show that H contributes to proteostasis by enabling translation of newly synthesized proteins as well as protein folding. We also show that H mutants have distinct in vivo effects that correlate with defects in subsets of cochones.
Individuals with lesions in the insula or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, brain regions involved in risky decision-making, performed a gambling task where choices were made alone and after observing others’ choices. In both groups, standard utility computations about risky options were disrupted. However, for socially situated decisions, participants showed increased conformity with others’ choices, independent of utility-based computations.
Biologists have long used Richard Dawkins’ biomorphs to demonstrate the power of natural selection in generating order from random mutations. However, we show that biomorphs can also illustrate how developmental bias shapes evolutionary outcomes. We find that biomorphs exhibit phenotypic bias, where certain phenotypes are orders of magnitude more likely to appear than others through random mutations. This bias prefers simpler phenotypes with low description complexity. This bias is formalised by an information-theoretic principle that can be understood as evolution searching the space of algorithms. Using population simulations, we show that moderately adaptive phenotypic variation appears more frequently through mutations at the expense of highly biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent. This result, as well as other patterns in biom variation, such as mutational robustness and positive correlation between evolvability and robustness, resemble findings in genotype-phenotype maps. Many patterns can be explained by an analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained genome sections. We propose that bias towards simplicity and other biom patterns share with genotypephen maps may hold more widely for developmental systems.
Humans are able to intuitively tune into the dynamics of a system and excite motions that are preferred by the system intrinsically. This ability has been experimentally supported in simple linear systems, but remains a challenge to validate in complex nonlinear systems where dynamics cannot be predicted analytically. However, many nonlinear systems exhibit periodic motions similar to the eigenmodes of linear systems. These nonlinear modes are computable with a recently developed numerical tool. In this study, we compared the motions humans excite in nonlinear systems with the nonlinear modes of energy-conservative systems. In a study of three experiments, participants controlled a virtual double pendulum with a haptic joystick. The task was to hit two targets, either aligned with the nonlinear mode ( Experiments 1 and 2 ) or purposefully offset ( Experiment 3 ). In all experiments, participants applied a control strategy that excited resonance and stabilized an orbit close to the nonlinear mode of the system. Even with increased accuracy ( Experiment 2 ) and targets away from the nonlinear ( Experiment 3 ), participants accomplished the task by adjusting stiffness to align resonant motions to the task.
In Bacillus subtilis is a soil-dwelling bacterium that relies on transcriptional regulation to respond to its environment. The transition from exponential to stationary phase is controlled by a group of transcription factors called transition state regulators (TSRs), which influence developmental processes such as biofilm formation, motility, genetic competence, and sporulation. However, the extent of TSR influence on bacterial physiology is not fully understood. Here, we show that two TSRs, ScoC and Abr, along with Mar-family transcription factor PR, negatively regulate production of iron chelator pulcherrin in B. subtilis. Genetic analysis indicates that all three factors are necessary to limit pulerrin production during exponential phase and influence rate and amount of pulerr produced. Similarly, expression of pulerr biosynthesis gene yvm is under control of Sco, Abr, and PR and correlated with amount of pulerr produced in each background. Lastly, in vitro data indicate direct role for Sco in controlling pulerr production along with Abr and PR. The regulation by two distinct systems underscores important role of pulerr in B. subtil physiology.
Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) can result in either detrusor-sphinct dyssynergia (DSD) or urinary incontinence, depending on the level of injury. SD is characterized by loss of coordinated control between the detrusor muscle, which increases bladder pressure to facilitate urination, and urethral sphincter and pelvic floor muscles which control bladder outlet to restrict or permit emptying. Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the spinal cord after SCI reduced SD and inence. We developed a mathematical model of the minimum elements necessary to replicate neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder after SCI and incorporated additional neurophysiological features to replicate improvements in bladder function associated with lumbar TMS in patients with SCI. We created a computational model of the neural circuit of mictition based on Hodgkin-Hux equations that replicated normal bladder function. We added interneurons and increased complexity to reproduce dysfunctional mictition after SCI and increased density and complexity of interactions of both inhibitory and excitatory lumbar interneurons responsive to T to provide a diverse set of spinal responses to intrinsic and extrinsic activation of interneurons after SCI. The model reproduced re-emergence of spinal voiding after SCI. We investigated the effect of monophasic and biphasic T at two frequencies below 10 Hz and replicated improved coordination between detor and urethral sphinct activity observed clinically: low T (1 Hz ) normalized voiding after SCI whereas high T (30 Hz ) enhanced storage.
Aspergillus fumatus is a filamentous fungus that can cause severe infections in humans and animals. Current methods to quantify its growth are based on time-course morphology data, such as hyphal length. However, collecting such data is beyond the scope of most clinical microbiology laboratories. We propose a mathematical model to estimate morphology-specific growth rates from easy-to-collect, indirect optical density ( OD ) data. Our model accounts for OD being an indirect measure by including the relationship between OD and calibrating true growth. This method does not require de novo generation of calibration data. Our model outperforms reference models in fitting and predicting OD growth curves and overcomes discrepancies between morphology-specific rates inferred from OD versus directly measured data in reference models that did not calibrate.
Beetles are the most species-rich group of animals and harbor diverse karyotypes. Most species have XY sex chromosomes, but X0 sex determination is also common in some groups. We generated a whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confus, which has a neo-sex chromosome and utilized eleven additional beetle genomes to reconstruct kary evolution across Coleoptera. We identified ancestral groups, termed Stevens, that share a conserved set of genes across beet. The ancestral chromosome is maintained across beet while independent autosomes are added to the sex chromosomes. These neo chromosomes evolve stereotypical properties of sex, including dosage compensation and non-random distribution of genes with sex-bi expression.
Chromatin structure and DNA accessibility are modulated by the incorporation of histone variant H2 (H2), which is encoded by the non-essential HT1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. H2 is an evolutionarily conserved histone variant that is predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR-complex (SW-C). While H2 has been implicated in transcription regulation, ht1 mutants exhibit minimal changes in expression compared to wild-type. However, given that growth defects of ht1 mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SW-C subunits, previous work examining the role of H2 in expression may be confounded by deleterious activity of SW-C when missing H2 substrate (apoSW-C). Furthermore, H mutants display significant defects in genotoxic conditions. To explore this possibility, we generated mRNA profiles for wild-type ht1, ht, sw1, and ht1sw mutants before and after exposure to hydroxyurea (H), which induces DNA stress. Our data showed H played a more prominent role in activation than repression during H exposure and was important for upregulation of several H-induced genes. We also observed apoSW-C contributed to expression in ht mutants, particularly genes involved in homeostasis.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) is a powerful tool for advancing our understanding of developmental biology. However, classifying transcriptomic profiles obtained from scRNA experiments into cell types and identifying cell lineages is challenging due to the fast accumulation of datasets and high dimensionality of the data. To overcome this challenge, automated classification methods are needed. Classical approaches rely on supervised learning, but obtaining annotated single-cell data is difficult. We propose to take advantage of partial annotations instead. The partial learning framework assumes a set of candidate labels for each data point, simpler than fully supervised. We extend state-of-the-art multi-class methods, such as SVM, kNN, prototype, logistic regression, and ensemble to partial learning. We study the effect of incorporating label structure into methods, focusing on hierarchical labels in developmental processes. On simulated and real datasets, these enable learning from partially labeled data with high accuracy, particularly prototype-based. Our methods perform with partially annotated data reach fully supervised performance. Finally, we study uncertainty in partially annotated data and derive results on effect on accuracy. Overall, our findings show hierarchical and non-hierarchical label strategies solve single-cell transcriptomic classification, relying less annotated data than supervised.
Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is a phospholipid found in nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and lipidlets and is involved in RNA polymerase I/II transcription. In this study, we investigated whether PIP and RNA cooperate in the establishment of nuclear architecture. We unveiled the RNA-dependent PIP-associated (RD) proteome in human cells by mass spectrometry and found that intrinsically disordered regions (ID) with basic PIP-binding motifs are prevalent in RD proteins. Moreover, ID of RD proteins exhibit enrichment for phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination sites. We show that the RD protein Bromodomain-containing 4 (BRD4) associates with P2 in RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions and altered P2 levels affect number of BR4 foci. We propose that P orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RD proteins and their ability to form foci via phase separation.
Diversification and adaptation to environmental variation is thought to be driven by phenotypic plasticity, yet the mechanisms mediating trait development and evolution remain poorly understood. The Scarabae, or true dung beetles, are a species-rich clade with highly diversified nutrition-responsive development, including evolutionarily novel secondary sexual weapons. We investigated the evolutionary basis of horns and other key traits in dung beetles via comparative and developmental assays. We present chromosome-level assemblies of three Onthagini species ( >250 extant ) including Onophagus taurus, O. sagarius and Digitophagusella. These are compared to seven other Coleoptera to identify changes in coding sequence associated with plasticity and metamorphosis. We contrast chromatin in developing horn tissues of high- and low-nut Oaurus males and females and identify cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition compared to sex-responsive development. A large proportion of recently evolved elements are sensitive to horn determination. Binding of known and candidate factors are enriched in nutrition open chromatin regions. Our work highlights chromatin in mediating development and evolution of plastic, demonstrates networks are highly transducers of environmental and genetic, and provides reference genomes for three that will future studies of this group.
Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease caused by Lassa virus (LASV). The pathogenesis of the disease is not yet fully understood. We used a cynomolgus monkey model of LASV infection to study the dynamics of LASV infection and immune response in relation to disease outcome. Histological and transcriptomic studies were performed to investigate the dynamics of LASV infection and immune mechanisms associated with survival or death. We found that lymphoid organs are an early reservoir for LASV replication, with the virus entering the cortical sinus of lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, viral tropism varies with disease severity, with limited dissemination to lymphoid organs and immune cells during nonfatal Lassa fever. In contrast, systemic dissemination of LASV to all organs and diverse cell types, with infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils and excessive inflammatory response, is associated with fatal outcome.
Pathological disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobe degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the question of whether these alterations are primary or downstream of disease is unclear. Here, we report four key findings that shed light on the causal role of Importin-β nuclear defects in disease onset. Using two mouse models of neurodegeneration (Nemf86 and Nf487 ) that recapitulate cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative disease, we find Import-β-specific nuclear block. We observe cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of proteins implicated in pathogenesis of ALS/FT and AD/AD, including TDP, Importβ, Ran1, and Gap. These findings are supported by pathological interaction between Importβ and Nf86 protein in cytoplasmic accumulations. We identify transcriptional dysregulation in genes associated with neurodegener disease. Finally, we show transient inhibition of Importβ in mouse and human neuronal non-neuronal cells induces proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in mouse models of neurogeneration. Our results provide mechanistic evidence that many mislocalized and dysregulated events in neurode diseases may arise from primary defect in Importβ nuclear import.
Bacteriophages are promising tools for medical and biotechnological applications. However, a comprehensive understanding of phage infection mechanisms is essential. CRISPR-Cas offer a way to explore these mechanisms via site-specific phage mutagenesis. However, phages can resist Cas-mediated cleavage through extensive DNA modifications like cytosine glycosylation, hindering mutagen efficiency. Our study utilizes the eukary enzyme NgET to temporarily reduce phage modifications, facilitating nuclease cleavage and enhancing mutagen efficiency. This enables precise targeting and seamless integration, exemplified by deactivating AD-ribosyltransferases crucial for ph infection. Furthermore, temporally removing modifications elucidated the effects of these on T phage without necessitating deletions.
The genome is constantly challenged by DNA lesions that interfere with cellular processes such as transcription and replication. Multiple mechanisms act in concert to ensure DNA repair, gene expression, and genome stability. Bulky DNA lesions, such as those induced by UV or the DNA-damaging agent 4nitroquinoline, act as transcriptional and replicational roadblocks and represent a major threat to metabolism. When located on the transcribed strand of genes, these lesions are handled by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCER), a incompletely understood pathway. Here, we identified histone H2. Z as an important for transcription and DNA integrity following UV irradiation. In the absence of H2, repair by TCER is severely impaired and RNA polymerase II clearance is reduced, leading to an increase in double-strand breaks. Thus, H2 is needed for TCER and plays a role in the maintenance of genome upon UV irradiation.
Drosophila melanogaster is an important model organism for studying the evolution of gene expression and its contribution to phenotypic variation. We analyzed gene expression in the midgut, hindgut, and Malighian tub as well as microbiome in the gut in four Drosila melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids from two divergent populations: one from the European range and one from the African range. We detected extensive tissue and genetic-specific effects in both transcript and microbiome data. Tissue-specific effects were stronger than genetic effects, although the gut tissues were more similar to each other than Malighian tubules. Examination of allele expression revealed that both cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific in genes differentially expressed between populations than conserved genes, trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis. Despite highly variable regulatory architecture, this observation was robust across tissues and backgrounds.
While the exact date of the emergence of an infectious disease is often unknown, the timing of early cases can be used to estimate it. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, previous studies have used genomic data to estimate the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the Alpha variant. Here, we use a stochastic population dynamics approach to estimate the delay from the first case to the nth case. We first validate our model on simulated data and then apply it to Alpha infections in the UK, estimating the first infection at August 21, 2020 (95% CI: July 23–September 5, 202 ). We then apply our model to COVID-19 cases with symptom onset before January 202, estimating the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan at November 28,201 (95 CI: November 2–9,201 ). Our results fall within previously estimated ranges using genomic data.
Meiosis is the process by which homologous chromosomes (homologs) pair to form haploid gametes from diploid precursor cells, a prerequisite for sexual reproduction. During meiotic prophase I, homolog pairing facilitates recombination and segregation during the ensuing reduction division. However, the mechanisms that ensure homolog alignment in the presence of non-homologous chromosomes have remained elusive, but rapid chromosome movements appear to play a role in the process. In addition to hom attraction provided by hom recombination intermediates, dissociation of nonomous associations also appears to contribute to hom pairing. We have developed an agent-based model for homolog derived from the dynamics of naturally occurring chromosomes. The model simulates unidirectional movements as well as collision determined by attractive and repulsive forces from close-range interactions. Chromosome number and size as well as movement and repulsive forces are identified as factors in the kinetics of homolog pairing in addition to hom attraction. Dissociation interactions between nonom chromosomes contribute to pairing by crowding hom into a limited area creating conditions for close hom attraction.
MicroRNA-34 (miR-34) is a target of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene and plays a role in cancer development. Mice lacking miR-34 have normal p53 responses and do not develop cancer, but lack mi-34 promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds. mi-34 genes are conserved between zebrafish and humans. In zebraf, mi-34a and mi-34b have similar expression in development, but mi-34 is more abundant. DNA damage by camptecin leads to p53 induction of mi-34 genes, while mi-34 mutants are viable and have normal damage-induced apoptosis. Nevertheless, mi-34- mutants with gain-of-function tp53R or tp- mutants are more cancer-prone than tp mutants alone, confirming tumor-suppressive function of mi-34. Loss of mi-34 at 72 hours post-fertilization enhances erythrocyte levels and upregulates myeloid-positive hematopoietic stem cells. Overexpression of mi-34 suppresses reporter but not p53 induction and sensitizes embryos to camptecin but not γ-irradiation.
Sex determination in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is controlled by the master regulator XOL-1 during embryogenesis. Expression of xol-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, which differs between XX hermaphrodites and males. In hermrodites, xol-1 is highly expressed, while in malesol-1 is expressed at very low levels. X-1 activity is known to be critical for proper development of C. elegans males, but its low expression was considered to be minimal in development of hermrod embryos. Our study reveals that X-1 plays an important role as regulator of developmental timing in hermrod embryogenesis. Using a combination of imaging and bioinformatics, we found herrod embryos have accelerated rate of cell division as well as developmentally advanced transcriptional program whenol-1 is lost. Further analyses that X-1 is responsible for regulating initiation of dosage compensation on X chromosomes and expression of sex-based transcriptional programs in hermrod. We foundol-1 embryos overexpress H3 methyltransferase MET-2 and altered H3me. Some effects ofol-1 loss were reversed by loss of-2. These findings that X- plays important role as regulator in embryos of both sexes and-2 as downstream of X- in herrod.
Genetic surveillance of mosquito populations is becoming increasingly important as genetics-based mosquito control strategies move from the laboratory to the field. Gene drive projects, which have the potential to significantly reduce mosquito populations, require monitoring to detect unintended spread beyond field sites and emergence of alternative alleles such as drive-resistant or non-functional genes within sites. This entails efficient distribution of traps to detect an allele of interest as quickly as possible, ideally before remediation is no longer viable. Insecticide-based tools such as bednets are compromised by insect-resistance alleles, requiring detection as quickly as possible. To this end, we present MGSurv ( Mosquito Gene Surveillance ), a computational framework that optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations to minimize time to detection of an allele of interest. MGSurv accounts for important biological features of mosquitoes and their landscapes, namely: i ) resources ( e. g. food and breeding sites ) can be distributed through a landscape ii ) movement may depend on sex, current gonotrophic state ( female ) and resource iii ) may differ in attractiveness. We present analyses to demonstrate optimal placement for i ) Aedes aegypt in Queensland, Australia ii ) Anopheles gambia on São Tomé.
Symbiononas scillans is a small (1.4 μm) heterotrophic eukaryote that was named based on the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum. However, the identity of the endosymbion and its functional association with the host were unknown. We generated both amplification-free metagenomics and whole genome sequencing data from S. scillans strains RCC257 and RCC24, but were unable to detect any sequences from known endosymbiotic bacteria. The absence of endobacteria was further verified with FISH. Instead, numerous contigs from both RCC and RCC were closely related to prasiniruses infecting green algae Ostreoccus lucarin, Bathoccus prinos, and Micronasilla (Ol, BV, Mp, Mp, respectively. Using BV as reference, we assembled a near-complete 190bp genome encoding hallmark prirus genes, as well as two incomplete assemblies of closely related viruses from RCC, and three draft genomes from RCC, which we collectively call SVs. A multi-gene tree showed SVs branched highly with BV, OlVs and MpVs. Transmission microscopy revealed a 190 nm virus-like particle similar to the endosion originally in S. Overall, we conclude S does not harbour endosymb but is associated with viruses.
Leiomins are a family of actin-binding proteins that play a critical role in muscle function. Mutations in all three members of this family result in human myopathies. Mutations in the predominant isoform L2 lead to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most disease-causing mutations in the L gene are nonsense or frameshift, predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in all cases of disease, little to no L protein is expressed. We show that nonsense-mediated decay, a mechanism that eliminates mRNAs with premature codons, underlies loss of protein from two independent L2 disease-causing mutations. Furthermore, we generated antisense oligonucleotides that block deposition of the junction, preventing nonsense-mediated decay of mutant L2 transcripts, thereby restoring protein.
Apolipoprotein E (apo) polymorphisms are known to modify the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, with apoE4 increasing and apo2 modestly decreasing relative to apo3. To investigate how apo isoforms alter risk, we measured changes in proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing human apo gene isoforms 2, 3, or 4. We identified 484 proteins and tested apo isoform-dependent changes in homeostatic regulation of ~270 ontologies. In the brain, apo4 and apo2 lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial proteins relative to wild-type apo3. In apo4, lack of cohesion between membrane and matrix proteins suggests dysregulation of proteome and autophagy reducing quality. In apo2, matrix and membrane proteins including oxidative phosphorylation complexes had increased degradation suggesting replacement of entire organelle. In the liver we did not observe these changes suggesting apo-effect amplified in brain relative other tissues.
Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model organism for studying gene function in vivo. However, tissue-specific gene knockout by CRISPR/Cas has not been successfully applied to most Drosila tissues, including the neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ). Here, we present CRPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis ( CRPRTRM ) for knocking genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells. We validated CRTRM by knocking out genes in each tissue, demonstrated its use with the Gal/UAS expression system, and simultaneous knockout of multiple genes. We used CRTRM to discover an essential role for SNARE components in NMJ maintenance. Furthermore, we found that the ESC pathway suppresses NMJ growth by downregulating retrograde G signaling. Lastly, we found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESC-mediated intra-axonal trafficking of extracellular vesicles at NMJ.
During the larval stages of Drosophila development, the lymph gland progenitors accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the blood-forming organ, which is essential for their differentiation. ROS triggers the activation of the JNK (c-Jun Kinase) pathway, which upregulates fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to facilitate progenitor differentiation. However, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in late larval stages. Using expression analyses, genetic and pharmacological approaches, we found that the Drosila NF-κ transcription factor Rel shields the progenitor pool from the metabolic pathway that induces differentiation by curtailing JNK activation. Although ROS serves as a metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation, the input from ROS is monitored by developmental TAK, which is regulated by Rel. This developmental circuit ensures the stock of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted.
Tay-Linder syndrome (TALS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly with abnormal gyral pattern, severe growth retardation and bone abnormalities. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the RNUAT gene. Here we report a patient with TALS features but no pathogenic variants were found in RNUAT, instead the homozygous RTTN c.295G>A variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing. We deciphered the impact of the variant on RTTN function by centrosome engineered RT-depleted R1 cells and patient fibroblasts, and analysed neural stem cells (NS) derived from CRPR/C9-edited pluripotent cells revealed major cycle and mitotic abnormalities leading to aneuplo, cycle arrest and death. In corticaloids we discovered additional function of RTTN in self-organisation of NS into neural rotes by delayed apical polarization of NS. Altogether these defects contributed to marked roset formation in RT-mutated organoids, impeding their growth and shedding light on mechanisms to microcephaly.
Escherichia coli is able to survive prolonged periods of resource exhaustion by entering a state of growth called long-term stationary phase (LTSP). We initiated a set of experiments to characterize the dynamics of E. coli under LTSP. E. coli were allowed to grow on rich media but not provided with new resources. We obtained whole genome data for hundreds of clones at 12 time points spanning six years. We reveal several aspects of adaptation. E coli continuously adapts up to six years under exhaustion through highly convergent accumulation of mutations. Upon entry into LT, long-lasting lineages are established. This structure is convergent with lineages across evolving populations. High parallel adaptations occur under LT, combined with LT populations’ structure enable us to screen loci displaying significant association of mutations, suggestive of historical contingency. We find associations frequent and third converently mutated loci involved at least association. Our results demonstrate LT adaptation characterized by high parallel and frequent contingency.
Male-specific (MSA) RNA from Drosophila melanogaster is a non-coding RNA that has recently been shown to code for a micropeptide. This peptide plays a role in determining how mated females use sperm after mating. The MS transcript is a male-specific version of another transcript produced in both sexes within the central nervous system from an alternative promoter called iab-8ncRNA. However, while MS produces a peptide, iab does not. We show that absence of iab translation is due to a repressive mechanism. This mechanism relies on two 5’ exons of iabncRNA. Through cell culture and transgenic analysis, we show this mechanism relies on upstream reading frames present in these exons. These prevent production of proteins from downstream reading frames.
Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of diseases caused by mutations in glycosylation pathways, including N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and glycosylphosphatidylinosyl inositol (GPI) anchor synthesis. CD typically present with seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delay, but display large clinical variability affecting every system in the body. This variability suggests that modifier genes may influence phenotypes. Because of similar physiology and clinical symptoms, there are likely common genetic modifiers between CD. We used evolution as a tool to identify modifiers between CD and glycosylation genes. Protein glycosylation is conserved from yeast to mammals. Evolutionary covariation (ERC) identifies proteins with evolutionary rates that indicate shared functions and pathways. Using ERC, we identified evolutionary signatures between proteins in same and different glyylation pathways. Genome-wide analysis of proteins showing ERC with PI synthesis revealed signatures with ncRNA modification and repair proteins. We also identified patterns ERC based on localization of PI synthesis enzymes. Testing the highest candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel modifiers of CD genes.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein (HBc) is composed of two domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) for capsid assembly and arginine-rich C-terminal (CTD) for genomic RNA encapsidation. Phosphorylation of HBcCTD, especially at Ser162 and Ser170, is essential for nucleation with polymerase (Pol) to initiate RNA encapsation. As caps mature, HBCT undergoes deosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in late encapsation. Using a-S170 antibody for nonosphorylated HB-S170, we observed a transition from phosphorylated to deosphory state during RNA packaging. Pol-dependent deory of HB-S170 was confirmed by substitution of single amino acid Val782 in RNase domain which abolished deory of HB-S170. Immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and protein analyses showed recruitment of host phosphatase PP dependent on Pol-Val domain. This recruitment does not HB but require via RNA signal suggesting PolgRNA plays role in PP recruitment. PolgRNA-PP-mediated deory HB-S is essential for RNA encapsation and appears associated with late endosomesultivesicular (MVs). HB may play dual role by bringing RNA phosphorylated HB and recruiting PP for completion of packaging into caps.
Symbiotic bacteria play a key role in helping marine organisms cope with environmental change. The closure of the Isthmus of Panama created distinct conditions in the Tropical Pacific and Caribbean, allowing us to study how closely related animals evolve under environmental change. However, the role of symbionts in this process is often overlooked. We sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbivorous bivalves from the genera Codak and Ca collected on either side of the Isthmus to investigate how differing conditions have influenced the symbts and their metabolic capabilities. The lucid sister species hosted Candidatus Thiazropha and those from the Caribbean had the potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the Pacific did not. Interestingly, this ability did not correspond to symbt phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution of fixation under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing the history of the nifDK operon including lucid symbt genomes around the world revealed that the common ancestor of Thiazro lacked n genes and populations in oligotrophic later-acquired the oper through HGT from Sedimentola lineage. Our study suggests H of the oper has facilitated diversification of globally distributed Thiaz endolida clade.
Taste Receptors (TASRs) are a family of G-protein-coupled receptors that function as bitter taste receptors in vertebrates. Mammalian TASRs have historically garnered the most attention, leading to our understanding of their roles in taste perception relevant to human physiology and behaviors. However, the evolution and functional implications of TASRs in other vertebrate lineages remain less explored. Here, we identify 9,291 TASRs from 661 vertebrate genomes. Large phylogenomic analyses reveal that frogs and salamanders contain unusually high TASR content in contrast to other vertebrate lineages. Most TASRs are found in clusters compared to other vertebrates, amphibians have additional clusters and genes per cluster. We find that vertebrate TASRs have one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, although TASR count is stable in most line. TAS count is proportional to receptors expressed in extraoral tissues. In vitro activity assays uncover that amphibian TASRs function as tissue-specific chemosensors to detect ecologically important xeniotics.
Notch signaling plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the intestinal epithelium. The Notch intracellular domain ( NICD ) binds to the transcription factors RBP and MAML to form a trimeric complex that binds to DNA as a monomer or dimer to regulate transcription. Mice Notch-deficient ( NDD ) alleles of Notch1 and Notch are sensitive to environmental insults but develop normally otherwise. Transcriptomic analysis of intestinal spheroids revealed no evidence of dimer-dependent gene regulation, impaired stem cell maintenance in vitro, and an elevated epithelial immune response to symbionts, likely causing heightened sensitivity in NDD mice. In contrast, Notch-deficient Not2 ( NOT2DD ) spheroids showed an unbalanced interactome with reduced interaction with the transcription machinery but preserved with the HD2 interactome, suggesting modulation via cooperativity. To determine if HD2 activity contributes to Notch loss-of-function phenotypes, we used the inhibitor valpro acid ( VPA ) and found it could prevent intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma-secretase inhibitors (DB or DAPT ) treatment in spher, suggesting synergy between HD activity and differentiation in intestinal stem cells.
Background selection is a process by which deleterious alleles reduce diversity at linked neutral sites. It influences total diversity (π) and genetic differentiation (FST) in structured populations. Background selection can be split into two regimes: the background regime, where selection is strong and mutation is low such that deleterious alleles are at mutation-selection balance, and the interference regime where selection is weak and mutation is high such that deleter alleles accumulate and interfere. Previous work has quantified effects of background on π and F only for deleterious in background regime. However, there is evidence that migration reduces effects of background on F, but not fully explained. Here, we derive theory to predict effects of migration on background by subpopulation and extend previous from interference regime to island model. Using simulations, we show that theory predicts F and π. Moreover, we show that background may increase F under high migration because reduces effects on fitness within subpopulations. However, we show that background may reduce π, particularly metapopulations with larger size. Our work extends background into structured populations and suggests background confound locus-locus F scans.
Genetic and phenotypic data size is critical for understanding the genetic determinants of disease. However, practical means for collaboration and data sharing among institutions is a fundamental methodological barrier for performing high-powered studies. As sample sizes become more heterogeneous, statistical approaches such as generalized linear mixed models must be used to correct for confounders that may bias results. Due to privacy concerns around Protected Health Information (PHI), genetic information is restrictively protected by regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This limits sharing among institutions and hampers efforts around executing high-powered studies. Federated approaches are promising to alleviate issues around privacy and performance, since data never leaves local sites. We developed FedMM, a federated genetic testing tool that utilizes feder statistical testing for association that correct confounding and polygenic random effects among sites. Data never shared among sites, statistics protected by encryption.
Prostate cancer is a heritable disease with ancestry-based incidence and mortality. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) offer promising advancements in predicting disease risk, including prostate cancer. While accuracy continues to improve, research aimed at enhancing their effectiveness within African and Asian populations remains key for equitable use. Recent algorithmic developments for PRS derivation have resulted in pan-ancestral risk prediction for several diseases. This study benchmarks the predictive power of six widely used PRS algorithms, including four that adjust for ancestry against prostate cancer cases and controls from UK Biobank and All of Us cohorts.
DPAG1-CD is a congenital disorder of glycosylation caused by mutations in the DPAG1 gene, which encodes the first enzyme in N-linked glycosylation. We developed a Drosophila model of DP1CD with an improperly developed eye phenotype. We performed a drug repurposing screen on this model using 1, 520 FDA/EMA-approved drugs and identified 42 candidates that improved DP1CD. Notably, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the D2 receptor rescued DP1CD. Loss of dopamine synthesis and recycling partially rescued the model, suggesting that dopaminergic flux and binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DP1 deficiency. This links dopamine to N-glycosylation and represents a new therapeutic target for DP1CD.
Proprioception is one of the least understood senses, yet fundamental for the control of movement. Even basic questions of how limb is represented in somatosensory cortex are unclear. We developed a topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity ( topoVA ) to compute putative cortical map from large set of movement data. Our model reproduces two sets of observations from monkey centre reaching: 1. shape and velocity of proprioceptive fields in hand-centered despite having no knowledge of arm kinematics or coordinate. 2. distribution of preferred directions (PD) from multi-electrode arrays. Our model makes testable predictions:1. across cortex has blob-pinwheel geometry of PD.2 few neurons encode single.
Ethylene is a phytohormone involved in various aspects of plant growth and development, as well as responses to stress. The role of ethylene in plant-micro interactions has been explored from the perspective of plants. However, only a small number of studies have examined the role of ethylene in microbes. In this study, we demonstrated that Azospirillum brasilense contains a functional ethylene receptor called Azospirillum Ethylene1 ( AE1 ). AE1 binds ethylene with high affinity. Treating cells with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and colonization of root surfaces. Additionally, RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics showed that ethylene causes widespread changes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism. One result is accumulation of polyhydroxybutyrate.
The IN80 is the catalytic subunit of the IN80 chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a critical role in DNA repair and transcription in murine spermatogenesis. We investigated the role of IN80 in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in mice. Immunolocalization of IN80 at the XY body in pachene spermatocytes suggested a role in the meiotic body. Subsequent deletion of IN80 resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes. Furthermore, active RNA polymerase II at the sex chromosomes of IN80-null pachene spermatocytes indicates incomplete inactivation of sex genes.
Axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans is activated by SVH-1, a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plmin family. SV-1 is a dual-function factor that acts as an HGF-like factor to promote axon regeneration and a protease to regulate early development. In this study, we demonstrate that cytidine deaminase CDD plays a role in the conversion of SV-1 from protease to growth factor. We find that codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp–His– catalytic triad of SV-1 suppresses CDD defect in axon regeneration. Furthermore, the hairpin structure around His- site in sv-1 mRNA is required for activation of axon by SV-1.
Zebraf collective behaviour is widely used as a tool to assess physical and mental state, ageing, disease, and drug effects. The macroscopic phenomena can be represented by active matter models, where individuals are abstracted as self-propelling agents. The behaviour of agents depends on a set of parameters in a manner of physical systems. In some cases, the system may be controlled at the level of constituents, such as colloidal or enzym behaviour. However, collective behaviour is typically influenced by environmental factors and cannot be changed. Here, we challenge this scenario by genetically modifying zraf. We demonstrate the potential of genetic modification in controlling collective behaviour at the level of constituents rather than externally. In particular, we probe the effect of lack of col2a in zraf, causing early osteoarthritis. col2/-raf exhibited compromised vertebral properties, swam less, and took longer to change orientations. Surprisingly, a group of mutant exhibited more orderly motion than wild. We capture behaviour of wild and col/-raf with simple matter, modelling agents with higher orientational noise.
Capillary formation is a crucial in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, the mechanisms connecting mechanical and chemical stimuli and functions of Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in culture remained unclear. We developed a hybrid model to simulate short-term in vitro capillary formation. We used the Cellular Potts model to predict cell migration, morphology, and continuum mechanics to quantify biodeformation and VEG transport. By bridging mechanical and chemical in the model, we showed good agreement between predicted topology and experiments, elongated cells forming network and round cells creating cobblestone aggregates.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the TGF-β family consists of five secreted peptide factors that play roles in patterning, homeostasis, and repair. These ligands have the potential to diversify their functions through lig interactions that may enhance, repress or generate novel functions. Here we show that all five T-β ligands play a role in survival against bacterial pathogens. We demonstrate that multiple T- ligand pairs act nonredundantly as part of this response. The BMP-like ligands DB-1 and T-2 function independently in the immune response, while T-2/B and the T-Activin-like ligand T-3 function together. Structural supports the potential for T- and T- to form heterodimers. We identify T- and T as members of a rare T- ligands lacking the conserved cystine responsible for disulfide linking dimers. We show that DB-1/BMP receptor and Smad transduce in response to bacterial, while components of T-Activ signaling do not play a major role in survival.
Genome integrity is safeguarded by the DNA damage response (DDR), a cellular process that involves epigenetic modifications of chromatin. Here, we show that the epigenetic enzyme N-terminal acetylase 4 (Nat4), known to acetylate histones H4 and H2, is implicated in the response to DNA damage in S. cerevisiae. We demonstrate that cells lacking Nat have increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulate more breaks than wild-type cells. Upon DNA damage, Nat expression is elevated and the enzyme is recruited to double-strand breaks. Nat-deleted cells exhibit lower levels of damage-induced H2ph (H2) and diminished binding of the checkpoint protein Rad9 to double-strand breaks. Mec1 recruitment to double-strand breaks, critical for H2ph deposition and Rad retention, is impaired in Nat cells. Consequently, Mec-dependent phosphorylation of effector Rad53, indicative of damage activation, is reduced. Importantly, effects of Nat in the cascade are mediated by N-terminal acetylase activity towards histone4.
Cancer phylogenies are phylogenetic trees that depict the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cancer cells. They offer insights into cancer development and treatment strategies. However, current methods reconstructing phylogen using bulk DNA sequencing data become inaccurate with more than 30 mutations or fail to recover phylogen altogether. We introduce Orchard, a novel phylogeny reconstruction algorithm that is fast and accurate up to 1000 mutations. Orchard uses a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogen, where each factor corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a partially built phyeny. Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially, generating incrementally larger phylogenies culminating in a complete tree containing all mutations. We demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing phylogen across 90 cancers and 14 B-proitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias ( B-ALL ). Orchard accurately reconstructs phylogen up to 1, 000 mutations. We also show that large phylogen reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying somatic mutations and genetic variations among cancer subpopulations.
Neoantigenic immunogenicity prediction is a major challenge in the development of personalized medicines, as low reactivity rates in neoantigens result in a difficult scenario with limited datasets. Here, we describe Immugen, a modular language modelling approach to immunogenic prediction for CD+ reactive epitopes. Immugen comprises a pMHC encoding trained on pM prediction, an optional T encoding and a set of context immunogenic prediction modules. Compared to state-of-the-art models, Immugen performs comparably on pM affinity, el ligand prediction and stability. Immugen outperforms all models on immunogenic prediction ( AUROC 0.619, precision 0.514 ) with 7% increase in precision compared to best. Immugen shows improved immunogenic prediction with integration T context.
Meat color is a primary indicator of meat quality and is mainly characterized by lightness, redness, and yellowness. We used genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) and whole-genome sequencing of 230 fast-growing white-feather chickens to map genes related to lightness and redness to a 6.24 Mb QTL ( GGA: 629.34–630.58 Mb ). We found that protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit ( PPPCC ) was associated with color ( P = 8.65E-08 ). The relationship between PPPCC and lightness was further validated through Mendelian randomization ( P < 2.9E-12 ). We generated skeletal muscle-specific PPPCC knockout (PPCCSKO ) mice and found increased lightness and decreased myoglobin in muscles. In addition, myofibers shifted from slow-twitch to fastwitch. Through transcriptome and metabolome, we found that inhibition of PPPCC decreased slow-t myofiber and myof-type genes and enhanced glycolysis. We found that a SNP ( rs520, C > T ) in PPPCC intron regulated transcription. We detected differences in meat phenotypes myoglobin, rs520 variant expression and fastwitch marker between fast-growing and local chickens.
Retinal ganglion cells play a crucial role in the computations performed by the retina. They receive nonlinear signals from bipolar cells, which constitute subunits within a ganglion’s receptive field. Inferring these subunits from ganglion cell activity is a new avenue for studying the retina’s functional architecture. We introduce superresolved tomographic reconstruction ( STR ) as a technique to efficiently locate receptive subunits. STR combines concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography. Simulations demonstrate that STR can identify subunits across a range of model variations. We apply STR to primate ganglion cells and demonstrate its feasibility. STR can reveal subunit layouts in tens of minutes, making it ideal for analysis and investigations.
The CRISPR (CRISPR) technology is used to identify genes that interact with drugs and their mechanisms of action or resistance. The objective is to identify CRPR mutants whose abundance is suppressed or enriched in the presence of a drug when the protein is depleted, reflecting synergistic behavior. CRPRs for a given target induce a range of protein depletion and growth effects. The effect depends on the sensitivity of cells to depletion of the protein. For essential genes, CR efficiency is empirically measured by quantifying effects on growth. We observe that efficient CRs are not always optimal for detecting synergies with drugs. CR efficiency interacts non-linearly with drug, producing an effect where dependence is maximized for CRs of intermediate strength and less for CRs that induce too much or little target depletion. To capture this interaction, we propose a novel method called CRPR-DR (Dose-Response ) that incorporates CRs and drug concentrations in a dose-response equation. We use CRPRDR to analyze data from a recent CGI in Mycobacterium tuberculosis to identify genes that interact with antibiotics. This can be generalized to non-CGI datasets, we show via CRPR for E. coli on different carbon sources.
Most community detection algorithms for gene-expression networks assume that genes are organized into assortative modules, i. e., groups of genes that are more associated with each other than with genes in other groups. However, this assumption is risky as it ignores alternative organizations of gene interactions. Here, we use the weighted stochastic block model ( SBM ) that does not assume assortative modules exist. Instead, SBM attempts to use all information in co-expression to separate genes into hierarchically organized blocks. We show that SB is able to find ten times more groups than competing methods and that several are not modular. Functional enrichment of non-modular groups is as strong as modular communities.
The yeast cytoplasmic poly (A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) is a multifunctional protein involved in post-transcriptional regulation, including translation initiation, termination, and mRNA decay. To elucidate its direct and indirect roles, we used mass spectrometry, RNA-Seq, and RiboSeq to analyze the yeast proteome and transcriptome in cells lacking the P1 gene. We found that P1Δ cells exhibit drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, as well as defects in translation initiation and termination. Defects in initiation and stabilization of specific mRNAs in PΔ cells are partly due to reduced levels of initiation factors, decapping activators, and deadenylation complex components, in addition to P1’s direct role in these processes. PΔ cells also manifest a nonsense readthrough phenotype indicative of termination defect. Collectively, our results indicate that P1 loss is pleiotropic and disruptive to numerous post-transcription processes.
Slow oscillations in the brain, such as those occurring during slow-wave sleep or pathological conditions like seizures and spreading depolarization, are often accompanied by oscillations in extracellular potassium concentration. These slow oscillations have a lower frequency than action-potential firing and are assumed to arise from network mechanisms involving synaptic interactions, delays, or intrinsically bursting neurons. Here, we explore an alternative mechanism available to all neurons with class I excitability based on the interplay between fast-spiking voltage dynamics and slow extracellular potassium concentration, mediated by the Na+/K+-Pase. We use bifurcation of the complete as well as slow method to reveal that this suffices to generate hysteres loop around a bistable region emerging from saddle loop–common feature class I neurons. Depending on the strength of Na+/P, bursts are generated pump-induced shearing bifurcation, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolar block. We suggest that transitions between these can result from disturbances extracellular regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypox affecting Na+/P activity.
Recent studies on multi-view clustering algorithms for disease subtyping often overlook important aspects such as clustering stability and prognostic relevance. Furthermore, current frameworks do not allow for comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven clustering, highlighting a significant gap in methodology. We present COPS, a package for robust evaluation of single and multiomics clustering results. COPS features advanced methods including similarity, network-based, kernel approaches, dimension reduction, and pathway integration. Our framework was rigorously applied to multiomics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA and methylation. Unlike previous studies, our approach contrasts data and knowledge-driven multi-view methods and incorporates cross-validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using ARI, survival via Cox models including covariates, and stability of results.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the transcription factor SEM-2, a member of the SoxC group, is essential for embryonic development and specification of the sex myoblast ( SM ) fate in the postembry mesoderm lineage. We have identified a novel loss-of-function sem-2 allele with a proline to serine change in the C-terminal of the conserved DNA-binding domain. Detailed analyses of mutant animals harboring this mutation uncovered new functions of SEM-2 in the lineage. SEM-2 functions antagonistically with LET-381, the C. elegans Fox/Forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the lineage. In addition to specifying the SM fate, SEM-2 is essential for proliferation and diversification of the lineage. SEM- appears to regulate the expression of hl-8, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor and plays critical roles in pattering the lineage. Our data suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins.
