The article describes a novel role of the GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway in promoting the reprogramming of germ cells into somatic cells in Caenorhabditis elegans. The reprogramming of germ cells into somatic cells is a fundamental process in development, yet the molecular mechanisms promoting or inhibiting reprogramming in intact organisms are not well understood. The study reveals that GL-1/Not signaling facilitates reprogramming by activating genes silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC ). This is unexpected, as the GL-1/Not pathway is known for maintaining undifferentiated germ stem cells/progenitors. The study used a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes to uncover the role of GL-1/Not in reprogramming. They found that GL-1/Not promotes reprogramming by activating specific genes silenced by PRC and identified the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a GL-1/Not target facilitating reprogramming. The findings have implications for development and diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.
Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumonia) is a significant pathogen that causes respiratory, blood, and urinary tract infections. A recent study investigated the role of the adaptor protein SK2 (SK2) in defense against K. pneumonia infection in mice. The results showed that SK2 is required for protection against K. pneumonia (ATCC 438) pulmonary infection, as SK-/- mice had a 100-fold higher bacterial burden compared to wild-type mice, which was controlled by SK2 expression in innate immune cells. SK-/- neutrophils and monocytes were present in lungs, and neutrophils degranulated normally in response to K. pneumonia infection in mice, however, K pneumonia-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in vitro was abolished. K pneumonia-induced neutil ROS required activity of Src family kinases (SFK), Syk, B, PLC2, and PK. The loss of SK significantly hindered K pneumonia-induced phosphorylation of FK, Sy, and Py2, implicating SK as proximal to their activation in pathogen-signaling pathways. SK-dependent signaling in neutils is essential for pneumonia-activated ROS production and promoting clearance during infection.
The article presents a mathematical modeling study on the role of hypnozoites in the transmission of Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) malaria. P. vivax infections can relapse weeks to months after the initial infection due to the activation of latent liver-stage parasites, known as hypnoites. The authors develop a within-host model of hypnoites and validate it against data from tropical strains of P. viv. The within-host model is integrated into a P. viv transmission model to demonstrate the build-up of the hypnoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypite activation and death. The hypite reservoir is predicted to be highly dispersed, with many individuals having few or no hypites and some having heavily infected livers. Individuals with more hypites are predicted to experience relapses and contribute to P. viv transmission. Incorporating hypite killing drugs, such as primaquine, into first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in P. viv transmission as individuals with most hypites are likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment.
The article presents a study on the dynamics of carbon recovery in Amazonian forests following selective logging disturbances. Each year, approximately 2 million hectares of Amazonian forests are affected by selective logging, resulting in the release of over 90 million metric tons of carbon (C) into the atmosphere. However, this emission is offset by the regrowth of the forest. The study utilizes a novel approach based on a network of 133 permanent plots (175 hectares) across Amazonia to link regional differences in climate, soil, and initial biomass with survivors and recruits’ fluxes to provide Amazon-wide predictions of post-logging carbon recovery. The results show that aboveground carbon recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield in the west (21.3 Mg ha-1) than in the south (12.3 Mg ha-1) where environmental stress is high (low rainfall, high seasonality). The study highlights the role of survivors in forest regrowth and provides a comprehensive map of post-disturbance carbon recovery in Amazonia.
Title: Prospective Identification of Functionally Distinct Stem and Neurosphere-Initiating Cells in the Adult Mouse Forebrain
    Abstract
    Neurosphere formation has been used as a surrogate for neural stem cell (NS) function, but the relationship between neuro-initiating cells (NICs) and NS remains unclear. This study aimed to prospectively identify and isolate adult lateral ventricular subzone (SV) NICs by flow cytometry as GlastEGhighPlexBhighCD24/lowO/PSAAM/lowTer/45 (GEOT) cells. These cells were highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo based on fate-mapping with As1Cre2 and D1Cre2. In contrast, pre-OT cells were quiescent, expressed Glast and lower EGFR and PlexB. Pre- cells could not form neurospheres but expressed stem markers Sl1-Cre, GF-Cre2, Sox2re2, and G1re2 and were long-lived in vivo. GEOTs were ablated temozomide, pre- survived and repopulated SV. Conditional deletion Bmi protein depleted pre- and GEOT, though pre were more dependent Bmi for Cdk2 (Ink4) repression Our data distinguish quies NS from NIC and enable study in vivo.
The article discusses the role of Piezo1 ion channels as mechanotransducers in various cell types of tissues. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals that Pie1 has a bowl-shaped structure capable of inducing membrane curvature through its extended footprint. This suggests that Pie1 channels may influence each other’s spatial distribution and function. The study uses cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp to examine membrane patches from cells expressing Pie1 endogenously at low levels and overexpressing Pie1 at high. The results show that at endogenous densities (1-2 channels/μm2) and non-physiological densities (10-100/ channels/μ2) cause substantial overlap. Pie1 density has no effect on pressure sensitivity or open probability in the absence of membrane tension. The study proposes that Pie channels at physiologically relevant densities inherently behave as mechanotrans. This property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across entire membrane.
Title: The Influence of Volatility on Choice, Reaction Time, and Confidence in Perceptual Decision-Making: A Neurophysiological and Behavioral Evidence
    Abstract: 
    Perceptual decisions are thought to arise from the accumulation of noisy evidence to a threshold or bound. The bounded evidence accumulation model explains the effect of stimulus strength, characterized by signal-to-noise ratio, on decision speed, accuracy, and confidence. It also makes predictions about the nature of noise. An increase in noise should lead to faster decisions, reduced accuracy, and paradoxically higher confidence. To test these predictions, a novel manipulation was introduced that mimics the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of visual cortex, which was verified with recordings from macaque areas MT/MST. For both humans and monkeys, increasing noise induced faster decisions and greater confidence over a range of stimuli which was minimally impaired. The magnitude of effects agreed with predictions of bounded accumulation model.
The article discusses the role of CAMII and calcineurin in regulating the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans through the FOX transcription factor DAF-16. The insulin signaling pathway in C. elegans maintains a short lifespan by phosphorylating and inactivating DAF-16, the ortholog of mammalian FOXO transcription factors. Calcineurin (PP2B phosphatase) also limits C. elegans lifespan, but its mechanism is unknown. This study reveals that TAX-6/CN-1 and UNC-43, C. elegans calcinein and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CAMII) orthologs, respectively, also regulate lifespan through DAF-16. UNC-43 regulates DAF-16 in response to stress, including starvation, heat, and oxidative stress, and cooperates with insulin signaling to regulate lifespan. However, unlike insulin, UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16, promoting its nuclear localization. Phosphorylation of D-16 at S286 by UNC-43 is removed by TAX-6/CN-1, leading to D-16 inactivation. Mammalian FOXO is also regulated by CAMII and calcineur.
Biologists investigated how fruit flies groom their bodies using a series of movements. They found that the nervous system implements this process through a hierarchy of motor programs. Each program is responsible for cleaning a specific part of the body. To study this, they activated subsets of neurons that drive individual programs. This allowed them to reveal that programs are organized in a hierarchy. Programs that occur first suppress those that occur later. Cleaning one part of the body reduces the drive to its program, relieving suppression of the next, allowing the sequence to progress down the hierarchy. A model featuring evoked movements in parallel but selected serially through suppression successfully reproduced the grooming sequence. This is the first example of an innate sequence implemented by a model for generating human actions.
During meiosis I in mammalian oocytes, accurate chromosome segregation relies on the coordination of multiple processes, including cohesin resolution, kinetochore-microtubule ( K-fiber ) formation, and spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) regulation. However, how these processes are coordinated remains unclear. This study reveals that Shugoshin-like 2 ( Sg2 ), in addition to protecting cohes, plays a role in turning off the SAC, promoting congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis spind, facilitating Kiber formation and limiting bivalent stretching. S2’s ability to protect cohes is dependent on interaction with PP2A, while its ability to silence SAC is mediated by direct binding to Mad2. In contrast, its effect on bivalent and Kiber formation is independent of PP2 and mediated by recruitment of MCA and inhibition of Aurora kinase activity respectively. Through its multiple interactions, S2 links essential processes for faithful chromosome segregation.
**Summary: Neuron-Wide RNA Transport Combines with Netrin-Mediated Local Translation to Spatially Regulate the Synaptic Proteome**

   **Background:** Experience-dependent changes in brain connectivity require RNA localization and protein synthesis. Local translation has been shown to alter the structure and function of synapses during synapse formation and experience-dependent plasticity. This study investigates whether local stimulation also triggers trafficking of RNAs from the nucleus to synapses.

   **Methods:** Imaging of RNA localization and translation in cultured Aplyia sensory-motor neurons revealed that RNAs were distributed throughout the arbor of the neuron, but translation was enriched at sites of synaptic contact and stimulation. Investigation of the mechanisms that trigger local translation revealed a role for calcium-dependent netrin-1/DCC receptor signaling.

 **Results:** Spatial regulation of gene expression by local translation rather than delivery of RNAs from nucleus to synapses maximizes the readiness of the neuronal ar to respond to local cues. **Conclusion:** Neuron-wide RNA transport combines with netrin-mediated local translation to spatially regulate the synaptic proteome.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the mechanisms of morphogenesis, the process by which asymmetric cell interactions give rise to complex multicellular structures composed of distinct cell types. However, current methods for modeling morphogenic events lack control over cell-type emergence and offer limited ability to selectively perturb specific subpopulations. To address this, a novel in vitro system was developed to investigate cell-cell interactions and multicellular organization within human induced pluripotent stem ( hiPSC ) colonies. The study examined the effects of induced knockdown of molecular regulators of cortical tension ( ROCK1 ) and cell adhesion ( CD1 ) using CRISPR interference. The results showed that mosaic knockdown of ROCK1 or CD1 led to differential patterning within hiSC colonies due to cellular self-organization, while retaining epithelial pluripotency. Knockdown induced a transient wave of gene expression within the mixed populations that stabilized with observed self-organization. This patterning enabled interrogation of emergent multicellular properties, facilitating understanding of pathways that regulate symmetry-breaking during morphogenesis.
Title: Rational Theory of Set Effects in Human Visual Working Memory: Encoding Precision Decreases with Number of Encoded Items
    Abstract: A new theory is proposed to explain why encoding precision in visual working memory decreases as the number of items to be encoded increases. The theory suggests that the brain minimizes the sum of an error-based behavioral cost and neural cost. A model is constructed from this theory and it predicts set effects. Notably, these effects are mediated by probability, consistent with previous findings. The model accounts for effects of size and probability on precision in delayed estimation experiments. Moreover, it is found that the total resource invested can vary non-monotonically with size. It is also shown that it is optimal to encode a subset or none of items in a task. Findings suggest cognitive limitations arise from cost minimization rather than constraints.
The Irish potato pathogen Phytophthora infestans employs a protein called PRD54 to interfere with the autophagy process in its host plant host. Autophagy is a cellular process by which cells recycle and remove damaged or dysfunctional components to maintain cellular homeostasis. In plants, autagy also plays a key role in defense against infectious diseases by degrading invading pathogens. However, how pathogens interact with autagy is not well understood. This study reveals that PRD54 binds to the autagy protein ATG8 and stimulates the formation of autophagosomes, which are structures where autagy occurs. PRD54 also depletes the autagy receptor Joka from AT8 complexes, preventing Joka from activating autagy. Joka is a positive regulator of autagy and also plays a role in plant defense against pathogens. By depleting Joka from AT8 complexes, PRD54 interferes with Joka's ability to activate autagy, thereby countering host defenses. This is the first demonstration of a pathogen effector protein antagonizing a host autagy receptor to evade host defenses. The study provides new insights into how pathogens interact with host autagy to cause disease.
Human Cardiac fibroblasts (CF) play a crucial role in cardiac tissue adaptation and remodeling in response to pathological conditions such as ischemia. However, the mechanisms by which environmental changes trigger CF responses are not fully understood, partly due to the lack of studies involving simultaneous stimulation of multiple factors. This study used a multi-stimulus device to apply controlled mechanical strain and oxygen changes to primary human CF in vitro. The results show that CF respond differently to various combinations of stimuli, with individual stimuli causing proliferative effects such as increased mitotic activity, YAP translocation, and PDGF secretion, or collagen presence. Notably, the combination of hypoxia and reduced contractility ( 2% strain ) induced increased release of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalproteinases.
In Drosophila melanogaster, two isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, have been identified. These isoforms specify distinct multi-subunit complexes, DOM-A and DOM-B, which are necessary for transcriptional regulation through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A V, the fly ortholog of H2 Z, genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner similar to the yeast SWR complex. In contrast, the DOM-A complex functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase similar to yeast NuA, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. This work demonstrates how different evolutionary strategies can lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetylase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog. In contrast, Drosophila generates diversity through alternative splicing of a single gene. The DOM-A and DOM complexes have been shown to be necessary for transcriptional regulation, with DOM-B being involved in the deposition of H2 V and DOM-A in histone acetylation of H4. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in Dophila and highlight the importance of alternative splicing in generating functional diversity.
Biomedical research article summary: Role of Slit2 as a β-caten/Ctn1-dependent retrograde signal for presynaptic differentiation
    The formation of neuromuscular junctions requires a precise interaction between motoneurons and muscle cells. The β-caten (Ctn1) protein in muscle plays a critical role in moturon differentiation, but little is known about the retrograde signals involved. This study used an in vivo genetic approach to investigate the functions of Ctn in muscle. The results show that Ctn without the activation domain is unable to rescue presynaptic deficits caused by Ctn mutation, indicating that transcriptional regulation is involved. In contrast, the cell adhesion function of Ctn is dispensable. The study identified proteins that may serve as Ctn-directed retrograde signals and found Sl2. Expression of Sl2 in muscle specifically rescues presynaptic deficits caused by Ctn mutation in mice. Sl2 immobilized on beads induces synophysin puncta in axons of spinal cord explants. These findings suggest that Sl serves as a factor utilized by Ctn to direct presyn differentiation.
Biomedical researchers have developed a new approach to study the dynamics of force transmission at cell-cell junctions in epithelial clusters, which is crucial for tissue development and maintenance. They combined computational and experimental methods to measure force at both subcellular and multi-cellular scales. The study focused on spontaneously forming epithelial cell clusters and found that basal fluctuations in force are linked to E-cadherin localization at individual cell junctions. At the multi-cell scale, force exchange between cells depends on position within the cluster and changes due to cell divisions or rearrangements. Importantly, force transmission through cells requires coordinated modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomyosin contractility in the cell and its neighbors. These findings provide insights into mechanisms controlling mechanical homeostasis in epithelial tissues and highlight the method as a tool for studying mechanotransduction in cell adhesions.
The study investigated the structural and biochemical properties of the huntingtin protein and the effect of polyglutamine expansion on its structure and function. The researchers used various biophysical experiments, including circular dichroism, single-particle microscopy, and cross-link mass spectrometry to analyze the protein. The results showed that huntingtin is composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical α-helical soloid structure, with the amino-terminal and carbox-terminal regions forming a circumscribed central cavity. The polyglamine expansion was found to increase the α-hical properties of hunting and affect intramolecular interactions among the domains. The study provides insight into the structural characteristics of full-length huntingtin affected by polyamine expansion, resolving the conundrum of how the amino-terminal polyamine tract confers disease-causing property on hunting.
Ferritinophagy via NCO4 is a crucial for erythropoiesis and is regulated by iron-dependent HER2-mediated proteolysis.
    Ferritinophagy is the selective autophagic turnover of ferritin, a key regulator of intracellular iron bioavailability. However, the control of ferritophagy and the role of NCO4 in iron processes are poorly understood. The study of N4-F1 interaction reveals a direct association between a key arginine in F1 and C-terminal element N4 required for ferritin delivery to lysosomes via autophagosomes. N4 abundance is regulated by autophagy and ubiquitin proteasome. Ubiquitin-dependent N4 turnover is promoted by excess iron and involves iron-dependent N4 and HER2 ubiquitin ligase interaction. In zebraf and cultured cells, N4 plays a role in erythropo differentiation. This study reveals the N4-ferritin complex and how intracellular iron modulate N4 ferritophagy in an iron-dependent setting.
The organization of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LP) plays a crucial role in higher-level cognition, but its functional organization has remained unclear. A long-standing proposal is that the LP is organized hierarchically, with progressively rostral areas processing increasingly abstract information for efficient and flexible cognition. However, support for this theory has been limited. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed rostral-caudal gradients in the LP, indicating a hierarchical organization. Dynamic modeling showed asymmetrical interactions between LP areas indicative of hierarchical processing. Contrary to assumptions, the strength of efferent versus afferent connections positioned the mid LP as the apex of the hierarchy. Furthermore, cognitive demands modulated connectivity towards LP consistent with a role in integrating information control. The strengths of these dynamics were related to higher-level cognitive ability. These results suggest the LP is hierarchically organized with the LP synthesizing abstract and concrete to control behavior.
The article presents a study on the role of the hominoid-specific gene TBCD1 in the development of neural progenitor cells and cortical folding in mice. Cortical expansion and folding are linked to the evolution of higher intelligence, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cortical folding are not well understood. TBC1D undergoes segmental duplications during homin evolution, but its role in brain development has not been explored. The study found that expression of T1 in ventricular cortical progenitors of mice via in utero electroporation caused delamination of ventricular glial cells (RG) and promoted generation of self-renew basal progenitors with morphology of outer gl (RG), abundant in primates. Downregulation of T in human brain slices decreased generation RG. Localized RG resulting from in utero electrop or transgenic expression T was found underlie cortical regions folding. The study identified hom gene required for RG generation regulating cortical expansion and folding.
The article discusses the role of ubiquitination in the transcriptional activity of the plant immune activator NPR1 (Non-Expresser of Pathogen-Related Genes 1), a key regulator of systemic acquired resistance in plants. NPR1 is a transcriptional activator that induces the expression of pathogenesis-related genes in response to pathogen attack. However, its activity is tightly regulated by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The study investigated whether ubiquination of NPR plays a role in its transcriptional activity prior to proteasomal turnover. The results show that ubiquination of NPR is a progressive process initiated by Cullin-RING E3 ligase, which promotes chromatin association and expression of target genes. Polyubiquination by E4 ligase U4 targets NPR for proteasomal degradation. In contrast, ubiquitin ligase UBP7 and proteasomal deubiquitinases enhance NPR longevity. The study reveals that immune transcriptome reprogramming requires sequential actions of E3 and E4 ligases balanced by deubiquases that fine-tune NPR activity without sacrificial turnover. The findings suggest that NPR activity is regulated by a delicate balance of ubiquitination and deubiquination processes.
In Arabidopsis thalian, 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs (24 siRNAs) play a crucial role in guiding cytosine methylation and silencing of transposons and a subset of genes. The biogenesis of 24 siRNAs requires the involvement of RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2), and DICER-like 3 (DCL3). However, the precursors of 24 siRNAs have remained largely undefined. This study aimed to identify the Pol IV and R2-dependent precursors of 24 siRNAs (PR RNAs) that guide de novo methylation in Arabidopsis. The results showed that PR RNAs accumulate in DCL3 mutants and are diced into 24RN by D3 in vitro. The PR RNAs are mostly 26-45 nucleotides in length and initiate with a purine adjacent to pyrimidine, a characteristic of Pol IV transcripts generated in vitro. R2 terminal transferase activity was also demonstrated in vitro to account for occasional non-templated nucleotides at PR RNA 3 termini. The 24 siRN primarily correspond to the 5 or 3 ends of PR RN, suggesting a model whereby siRN are generated from either end PR duplexes by single dicing events. This study provides new insights into the biogenesis of 24 siRN in Arabidopsis and highlights the role of Pol and R2 in the process.
Title: Transient postnatal period precedes emergence of mature cortical dynamics: Mature networks synchronize and integrate spatiotemporal patterns to support cognition, but the postnatal course for networks to perform complex computations remains unknown. This study investigates the progression of large-scale and cellular activity across development using high spatiotemporal in vivo electrophysiology in immature mice. The results show that cortical mature processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. The transition is characterized by neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and organized activity occurs. A similar developmental trajectory is observed in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that facilitates transition in network operation. A transient quies period is hypothesized to be requisite for the emergence of coordinated networks.
The article discusses the population structuring of multi-copy antigen-encoding genes in Plasium falciparum, a parasite that causes malaria, and its implications for epidemiology and control. The parasite has multiple circulating strains that undergo sexual recombination, leading to genetic diversity. An agent-based model was developed to extend earlier strain theory, focusing on the var gene family of Plasium falcum. The model considers the extensive diversity of multi-copy genes that undergo antigen variation via sequential, mutually exclusive expression. It tracks the dynamics of unique repertoires in a population of hosts and shows that under high levels of sexual recombination, strain competition through cross-immunity structures the population into a subset of coexisting repires of genes whose degree of antigen overlap depends on transmission. Empirical comparison of genetic variation at antigen and neutral sites supports the role of selection in structuring parasite diversity.
Deamidation of a glutamine residue in the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC by the deamase OI from the enteric bacteria Shella flexneri disrupts the interaction between UBC and the R-finger ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. This disruption silences the polyubiquination activity of the UBC/TR6 complex and subsequently inhibits the NF-κ inflammatory response. The study aimed to elucidate the role of deamation in silencing the UBC/TR6 complex and found that deation inhibits both native and transient interactions between UBC and TR6. Deamation creates a new intramolecular saltbridge in UBC that competes with a critical intermolecular saltbridge at the native U/TR6 interface, preventing the formation of a stable U/TR complex. Additionally, repulsion between the negatively charged glutamate residue E100 and the positively charged surface of TR also prevents transient interactions between U and TR. These findings reveal a mechanism by which post-translational modification alters the conformation and stability of transient complexes to inhibit protein-protein association.
Bi-directional manipulations of activating and inactivating cortical interneurons have been widely used to elucidate the functions of specific interneuron types in the brain. However, this approach relies on the assumption that both activation and inactivation will yield consistent insights into interneurons’ computational roles. A study using single-unit recordings in the auditory cortex of awake mice found that this may not be true. Optogenetic manipulation of somatostatin-positive (S+) or parvalbum-positive (Pb+) interurons while recording tone-responses showed that S+ inactivation increased response while Pb inactivation weakened tuning and decreased information transfer, suggesting these neurons support different computational functions. In contrast, activating S+ and Pb interurons revealed no differences. A network model was used to understand this asymmetry and showed that small changes in parameters such as spontaneous activity or light strength of manipulation determined whether activation or inactivation would produce consistent or paradoxical conclusions about interneurons functions.
Title: Externally Induced Frontoparietal Synchronization Modulates Network Dynamics and Enhances Working Memory Performance: A Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation of the Right Frontopari Network Reveals a Link between Oscillatory Activity and Large-Scale Brain Synchrony and Working Memory Performance
    Abstract: 
    Working memory (WM) is an emergent property of large-scale network interactions and synchrony of oscillatory activity may contribute to WM by enabling coordination of long-range processes. However, evidence for oscillatory activity shaping network dynamics and behavior in humans is limited. This study applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to externally modulate oscillatory activity in the right frontopari network that supports WM. Externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high. Simultaneously collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed ACS effects dependent on the phase of stimulation and internal processing. Specifically, synchronous ACS during WM increased parietal activity which correlated with performance. Furthermore, functional connectivity results indicate the phase frontopetal influences information flow within WM. Overall, findings demonstrate a link between performance in demanding WM and large brain synchrony.
The article reports on the discovery of a transcription factor, Pitx, which plays a crucial role in determining the embryonic axis and regulating twinning in vertebrates. In contrast to invertebrates and amphibians, where embryonic polarity is largely specified by maternal determinants that fix cell fates early in development, vertebrate embryos remain plastic and can form multiple individuals until gastrulation. To understand how polarity is determined in vertebrates, the study focuses on the chick embryo, where the earliest known factor is cV1, a homolog to mammalian growth differentiation factor 1 (GDF1), a transforming growth factor beta (Tβ) expressed posteriorly before gastrulation. A molecular screen for upstream regulators of c1 in normal and manipulated embryos to form twins uncovers Pit2 as a candidate. The study shows Pit2 is essential for axis formation and acts as a direct regulator of c1 by binding to enhancers within neighboring genes. Pit2, c1/GDF, and Nodal are also key in left-right asymmetry, suggesting the same polarity mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution.
The study investigated how fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) process temporal variations in odor concentrations to guide their spatial orientation in an odor fields. Flies were exposed to precisely defined odor waveforms and the spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OS) and projection neurons (PN) were examined. A significant correlation was found between OS and PN spike patterns, with PNs strongly signaling OS rate and rate of change. A two-dimensional model using OS rate and rate of change as inputs predicted PN output. When combined with rate-change encoding by OS, PNs signaled acceleration and rate of dynamic stimuli to higher brain centers, enabling reliable response to odor onsets.
In flowering plants, seed development begins with the fusion of the maternal egg and central cells with paternal sperm cells, resulting in the formation of the embryo and endosperm, respectively. The fertilized products are enveloped by the maternally derived seed coat, whose development is regulated by epigenetically by the Polycomb (PcG) protein family prior to fertilization. This study reveals that fertilization of the central cell leads to the production of auxin, which is likely exported to maternal tissues, driving seed coat development by removing Pc function. Furthermore, mutants of the MADS transcription factor AGL62 exhibit impaired auxin transport from endosperm to integuments, resulting in seed abortion. It is proposed that AGL regulates auxin transport from endos to integuments, leading to removal of Pc block on seed development.
Bacteriophage T7, a virus that infects bacteria, relies on its receptor-binding protein (RBP) to interact with its host. Despite its crucial role in governing phage activity and host range, the molecular rules of RBP function remain unclear. To address this, researchers used a high-throughput, locus-specific phage engineering method to systematically dissect the functional role of every residue in the domain of T7 phage RBP, generating 166 variants. This dataset allowed them to compare functional profiles across hosts and identify regions of importance, many of which were previously unknown. Substitution patterns showed host-specific differences in position and physicochemical properties, revealing adaptation to individual hosts. Gain-of-function variants were discovered against hosts and host-restrict variants that eliminated certain hosts. To demonstrate utility, highly active T variants were engineered against a urinary tract pathogen. This approach presents a framework for characterizing sequence-function relationships in phage-bacterial systems.
Individuals with congenital amusia have a lifelong history of unreliable pitch processing, which leads them to a reliance on other dimensions such as duration during speech perception. This study investigated the neural basis of this strategy using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifteen individuals with amus and fifteen controls read sentences where a comma indicated a grammatical boundary. They then heard two sentences that differed in pitch and/or duration cues and selected the best match for the written sentence. Prominent reductions in functional connectivity were detected in the amus group between left frontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions, which reflected between-group differences in cue weights in the same listeners. Connectivity between these regions were not present during a control task. Our results indicate the reliability of perceptual dimensions linked functional between frontal and percept regions suggest a compensatory mechanism.
The Devil Facial Tum 2 (D2) is a newly discovered contagious cancer affecting the Tasman devil (Sarcus harrisii), a species that already harbors a widespread cancer, Devil Tum 1 (D1). In contrast to D1, D2 cells express major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecules, indicating that the loss of MHC is not necessary for the emergence of a contagious cancer. However, the highly expressed MHC I alleles in D2 cells are common to devils non-polymorphic, reducing immunogenic in a population sharing alleles. In parallel, MHC I loss in vivo, D2 may mimic the evolutionary trajectory of D1. Based on these results, contagious cancers may exploit histocompatibility between tumour and host, but loss allogenic antigens facilitate transmission D2.
The granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) plays a crucial role in both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, but the underlying neural mechanisms are not well understood. This study used optogenetic circuit mapping in mice to reveal a dissociation between parallel circuits in superficial RSG that process disparate inputs. The anterior thalamus and subiculum, sources of spatial information, selectively recruit low-threshold (LR) pyramidal cells in RSG. In contrast, regular-spiking (RS) cells are preferentially controlled by claustral and cingulate inputs, sources of non-spatial information. Precise subaminar and dendritic arbor within R layer 1, in particular, permits parallel processing. Observed thalamocortical synaptic dynamics enable LR neurons to compute speed of rotation, despite receiving direction inputs that do not encode speed. Thus, parallel streams identify a principal subtype positioned to support spatial computations in R.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant risk factor for the development of tauopathies, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The mechanisms underlying the prion-like spreading of Tau after TBI are not fully understood, partly due to the lack of tractable animal models. This study investigates the potential role of seizures in promoting the spread of tauopathy. Zebraf larvae expressing a genetically encoded Tau biosensor were used to report the accumulation of human Tau species seeded via intraventricular injections. Subjecting zraf to a novel TBI paradigm produced TBI features, including cell death, post-traumatic seizures, and Tau inclusions. The application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued TBI-induced tauopathy and cell death. These findings suggest a role for seizure activity in the prion seeding and spreading of tau following TBI.
The article investigates the relationship between the spatial configuration and functional connectivity of brain regions, focusing on how the arrangement of cortical regions affects measures of brain connectivity and behavior. Previous studies have examined the strength of coupling between neural populations in relation to behavior, using ‘functional fingerprints’ to characterize individual brain activity. However, this study delves into the spatial arrangement of cortical regions and its impact on connectivity. The results show that the shape and location of brain regions strongly interact with modeling brain connectivity, indicating that the spatial arrangement of functional regions is predictive of non-imaging measures of behavior and lifestyle. The findings suggest that cross-subject variations in spatial configuration of functional regions may be misinterpreted as changes in connectivity. This highlights the importance of understanding these effects when interpreting functional imaging data and cognitive traits.
The article discusses the role of TBP (TATA-binding protein) in the activation of MyoD target genes in skeletal muscle cells. The TBP is a component of the transcription initiation complex TFIID (Transcription Factor IID), which is involved in the regulation of cell-specific gene expression. A previous study suggested that replacement of TBP with TBP2 is required for the activation of muscle gene expression. However, the lack of a developmental phenotype in TBP null mice led to further investigation of whether TBP deficiency affects adult myogenesis. The results show that TBP null mice have intact regeneration potential upon injury and TBP is not expressed in C2C12 muscle or primary muscle stem cells. TFI subunits and TBP are downregulated during myoblast differentiation, but reduced amounts of these proteins form a complex detectable on muscle gene promoters, essential for their expression. This indicates that TBP does not replace TBP during differentiation, as previously proposed, with limited amounts of TFI-T being required for muscle-specific expression.
Title: Targeted Cortical Reorganization Using Optogenetics in Non-Human Primates: Modulation of Neural Excitability and Neuroplasticity in Large-Scale Networks

    Researchers have extensively investigated the effects of optogenetic stimulation on neural excitability and neuroplasticity in local circuits. However, the effects on large-scale networks remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to investigate stimulation-induced changes in network dynamics in macaques using a large-scale optogenetic interface. The interface enabled simultaneous stimulation of excitatory neurons and electrocortic recording across primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M) cortex. Two measures of network connectivity were tracked : the response to focal stimulation and baseline coherence between pairs of electrodes. These were strongly correlated before stimulation. Within minutes, stimulation in S1 or M significantly strengthened functional connectivity between areas. At a finer scale, stimulation led to heterogeneous changes across the network. These reflected correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity, consistent with Hebbian plasticity models. This work extends Hebbian plasticity to large circuits with implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation.
In a rare case study of a rhesus macaque monkey born without primary visual cortex (V1), researchers investigated the neural consequences of damage to this area and its impact on visual perception. The monkey’s behavior was unremarkable, but its performance on visual tasks was impaired. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that structures outside the lesion appeared normal. Visual stimulation with checkerboards activated the lateral geniculate nucleus, while full-field moving dots activated the pulvinar. Visual cortical activation was sparse but included face patches. Consistently across lesion and control monkeys, functional analysis showed an intact network of bilateral dorsal areas temporally correlated with V/MT activation, even without V. Despite subcortical responses to stimulation, little evidence was found for subortical input to VMT supporting residual function or blindsight phenomena.
The innate immune system’s ability to recognize foreign double-stranded (ds) DNA in the intracellular environment is crucial for defense against pathogenic threats. However, the distinction between foreign and host DNA within the nucleus is not well understood. This study used biochemical and single-molecule techniques to investigate how the innate sensor IF16 recognizes foreign DNA in the nucleus. The results show that IF16 one-dimensionally scans long stretches of exposed dsDNA to form supramolecular signaling platforms. Nucleosomes were found to prevent IF16 from targeting host DNA by interfering with this one-dimensional movement. This scanning-assisted assembly allows IF16 to distinguish between foreign and host DNA, forming oligomers on foreign DNA efficiently and selectively.
Title: Determining the Composition of Micron-Scale Protein Deposits in Neurodegenerative Disease by Spatially Targeted Microproteomics

    A novel proteomics technique called spatially targeted microproomics (ST) has been developed to investigate micron-scale regions of interest (ROIs) in mammalian tissue without the need for genetic manipulation. This method involves staining methanol or formalin-fixed specimens with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize ROIs, followed by soaking in a solution containing 4-benzylbenzylglyc-histidine. Confocal imaging with two-photon excitation is used to covalently couple photo-tags to proteins within each ROI, with a resolution of 0.67 µm in the xy-plane and 1.48 µm axially. After solubilization, photo-tagged proteins are isolated and identified by mass spectrometry.

    The technique was tested on amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mouse model and post-mortem AD case, confirming known constituents and discovering new ones. ST can be applied to various samples including cell lines, primary cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy, and post-mort tissue.
The Frizz3 gene plays a crucial role in controlling axonal development in distinct populations of cranial and spinal motor neurons. Disruption of the Frizz gene leads to defects in axonal growth in the VIIth and XIIth cranial motor nerves, phrenic nerve, and dorsal nerves of fore and hindlimbs. In Frizz−/− limbs, dorsal axons stall at a precise location in the plexus, whereas in contrast to phenotypes of other axon-guiding mutants, Fr−/− dorsal axons do not reroute to other trajectories. Affected motor neurons undergo cell death 2 days prior to normal developmental cell death coinciding innervation of muscle in vivo. This provides evidence that developing neurons with long axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at targets on schedule. The study implicates planar cell polarity (PC) signaling in axon growth and highlights how PC proteins, forming cell-cell complexes in epithelia, function in dynamic axonal context.
Title: Functional Evaluation of Transposable Elements as Enhancers in Mouse Embryonic Trophlast Stem Cells
    Abstract: Transposable elements (TEs) are thought to have contributed to the establishment of gene regulatory networks. The embryonic and extraembry lineages of the early mouse embryo have co-opted TEs as enhancers, but there is little evidence they play significant roles in regulation. This study tested a set of terminal repeat families as enhancers in mouse embryonic trophlast cells. Epigen and transcript data suggested a number T helped establish tissue-specific expression. Genetic of individual T confirmed subset relationships. However, survey via CRISPR interference of RL13 elements embry cells that only a play significant roles regulation. Results suggest subset T important gene early development and highlight importance experiments evaluating regulatory T roles.
Biologists have long sought to understand how C4 photosynthesis evolved from the ancestral C3 pathway in plants. C4 photosynthesis is a complex trait that has emerged independently in at least 60 plant lineages, but its evolutionary history remains unclear. A new study reveals that the polyphyletic appearance of C4 photosynthesis is associated with diverse and flexible evolutionary paths that group into four major trajectories. The research conducted a meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing species that use C3, C, or intermediate C–C forms of photosynthesis to parameter a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape. A novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model was developed and experimentally verified to predict the evolution of the C phenotype. The study found that the evolutionary histories underlying the appearance of C photosynthesis were influenced by ancestral and initial phenotypic alterations unrelated to photosynthesis. The order of C trait acquisition was found to be flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic factors. This flexibility facilitated the convergent evolution of the complex trait.
The article reports on the reengineering of the ATPase site of a bacterial protein SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity. SpoIVA is a cytoskeletal protein that hydrolyzes ATP to polymerize irreversibly during Bacillus subtilis sporulation. It evolved from a TRAC class P-loop GTPase, but the evolutionary pressure that drove the change in nucleotide specificity is unclear. To investigate this, the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA was reengineered to mimic its ancestral GTP activity. The reengineered protein, SpoAGTP, functioned as a GTPase but failed to polymerize because it did not form an NDP intermediate required for polymerization. However, incubation of SpoAG with ATP did not promote polymerization. This suggests that the nucleotide base, in addition to energy from hydrolysis, is critical for specific biological functions. The study also found that increased levels of ATP relative to GTP at the end of sporulation may have driven the change in nucleotide preference in Spo.
Title: Long-term Consequences of Absence of Leptin Signaling in Early Life
    Lept is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating energy balance and has neurotrophic effects during critical developmental periods. However, the role of lept in development is not fully understood. To investigate the importance of lept in early life, researchers restored lept signaling in mice lacking the lept receptor ( Lep gene at 4 or 10 weeks of age. The study found that some defects previously thought to be irreversible due to neonatal lept signaling, such as poor development of arcuate nucleus projections, were recovered by Lep reactivation in adulthood. However, Lep deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity through suppression of energy expenditure. Lep reactivation in adulthood also resulted in persistent reduction of hypothalamic Pomc, Cart, and Prlh mRNA and defects in reproductive and growth systems. Findings indicate that early lept signaling causes permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental problems.
Arabidopsis thaliana Heterotrimeric G Proteins Regulate Immunity by Directly Coupling to the FLS Receptor 
    Arabidopsis thaliana immune receptor FLS perceives bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate defenses through the cytoplasmic kinase BIK. Heterotrimeric proteins composed of non-canonical G protein XL2, G protein AGB, and G proteins AG1 and AG2 are required for FLS-mediated responses through an unknown mechanism. This study reveals that in preactivation, XL2 directly interacts with FLS and B1 and functions with A1 and AG1/2 to attenuate proteasome degradation of B1, allowing immune activation. Following fl22 activation, XL2 dissociates from A and is phosphorylated by B in N terminus. Phosphorylated XL enhances production of reactive species likely modulating NAD oxidase. The study demonstrates G proteins are directly coupled to F receptor and regulate signaling through preactivation and postactivation mechanisms.
The study investigated the Arabidopsis circadian clock at the single-cell level in Arabidopsis seedlings over several days under constant environmental conditions. The results show that individual cells exhibit robust oscillations, but are desynchronised. Two waves of clock activity were observed : one moving down and one up the root, with evidence of cell-to-cell coupling, particularly in the root tip. A model suggests that cell-to-cell coupling and period differences between cells generate the observed waves. The study reveals the spatial structure of the plant clock, differing from the centralised mammalian clock, with multiple coordination points.
In a study of over 100,000 adults with clinically normal hearing, approximately 10% reported difficulty with communication in social settings where speech from multiple speakers is mixed in the ear canal. Researchers found that multi-talker speech intelligibility varied widely among individuals with normal hearing, but could be predicted by neural locking to frequency modulation (FM) cues measured through ear EEG recordings. Combining temporal processing, pupil-indexed listening, and behavioral thresholds accounted for 78% of variability in multi-talker intelligibility. The study identified bottom-up and top-down markers of poor multi-talker perception could inform next-generation clinical tests for hearing disorders.
Biomedical researchers have long faced a significant challenge in visualizing the microvascular network within the retina, a critical part of the central nervous system, due to the scattering of light by the surrounding tissue. The mammalian eye’s transparency allows for a non-invasive view of the microvessels, but imperfections in the eye’s optics blur microscopic retinal capillaries and single blood cells flowing within. This limitation hinders early evaluation of microvascular diseases originating in capillaries. To overcome this barrier, scientists employed 15 kHz adaptive optics to noninvasively measure single-cell blood flow in the C57/6 mouse, a widely used research animal model. They measured flow across four orders of magnitude ( 0.2-1.55µL/min) in retinal vessel diameters (3.2-45.8µm without surgery or contrast agent. The study describes an ultrafast imaging pipeline and automated analysis of millions blood speeds.
Spontaneous symbiotic reprogramming of plant roots triggered by receptor-like kinases
    Symbiotic Receptor Kinase (SYK) is essential for the development of phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) as well as nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis. However, the mechanisms that discriminate between the two distinct symbiotic fates have remained enigmatic. This study reveals that ectopic expression of receptor-like genes Nod Receptor 1 (N1), N5, and SYK initiates spontaneous nodule organogenesis and nodulation gene expression in the absence of rhizobia. Furthermore, overexpression of N1 or N5 associated with endogenous SYK in roots of the legume Lotus japonicus Epasis tests that dominant SYK initiates signalling independently of N or N5 and upstream a set of genes required for generation of calcium-spiking in both symbes. Only SYK but not N overexpression triggers expression of AM-related genes, indicating the receptors play a key role in decision between AM or root symbiosis development.
Title: DeepPose: A Software Toolkit for Fast and Robust Animal Pose Estimation Using Deep Learning
 Abstract: Quantitative behavioral measurements are crucial for answering questions across scientific disciplines from neuroscience to ecology. State-of-the-art deep-learning methods offer advances in data quality and detail by allowing researchers to estimate an animal’s body parts directly from images or videos. However, available pose methods have limitations in speed and robustness. We introduce a new software, DeepPose, that addresses these using an efficient multi-scale deep model, StackedNet and a GPU-based peak-detection for keypoint locations with sub-precision. These improve speed >2 with no loss compared to available methods. We demonstrate versatility with challenging pose tasks laboratory and field settings including groups individuals. Our reduces barriers using tools measuring behavior has applicability across sciences.
When innate immune cells, such as macrophages, are challenged by environmental stresses or pathogens, they activate multi-protein complexes called inflamomes to initiate inflammatory responses and a form of cell death called pyroptosis. A study reveals that disruption of glycolytic flux is a trigger for NLRP-mediated signaling, IL-1 production, and pyptosis in murine bone-derived macrophages. This occurs due to a drop in NAD levels and induction of ROS, which can be rescued by adding products that restore NAD production. This signaling is also important for host response to intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimur, which disrupts host glucose metabolism by uptake. The results show an inflammatory network used by cells to sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens.
The PAL2 protein, a tumor suppressor linked to various malignancies including breast cancer and Fanconi anemia, plays a crucial role in coordinating BRCA1 and BRCA2 functions during homologous-directed repair (HDR) and interacts with chromatin proteins. In addition to its scaffold function, PAL2 binds DNA. This study identifies a major DNA-binding site of PAL2, mutations in which reduce RAD51 foci formation and overall HDR efficiency by 50%. The PAL2 N-terminal DNA-binding domain (NBD) stimulates RAD51 recombinase activity. Surprisingly, NBD possesses strand exchange activity without RAD51. Moreover, NBD stimulates inverse strand exchange and uses RNA substrates. The study reveals a versatile DNA interaction of PAL2 and a critical role of PAL2 DNA binding for chromosome repair in cells.
Bacterial Actin Mre Forms Antipar Double Helical Filaments: A New Insights into the Structure and Function of a Prokaryotic Actin Homologue
    Actin filaments, the building blocks of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells, are composed of pairs of protofilaments arranged in a parallel fashion. In contrast, the proaryotic actin homologue Mre forms antipar double helical filaments in vitro and in vivo. Using crystallography, we visualized the antipar protofilament structure of Caulobacterre M and found that a protoament doublet is essential for Mre's function in cell shape maintenance. In E. coli, site-specific cross-linking of antipar Mre protoaments showed that they are tightly bound to membranes. Cryo-EM revealed that pairs of protoaments of Caulobre interact with membranes. Crystal structures of different nucleotide polymer states of Caulre showed conformational changes accompanying antipar formation. The antimicrobial agent A22MP binds to the nucleotide ofre, preventing hydrolysis and destabilizing protoaments.
The article explores the role of the APETALA1 (AP1) gene in determining petal number robustness in Arabidopsis thaliana and its closely related species, Cardamine hirsuta. In Arabidopsis thalian, petal number is invariant, whereas in Cardamine huta, it varies. The study reveals that divergence in the pleiotropic floral regulator APET1 is responsible for the species-specific difference in petal robustness. The effect of AP1 is attributed to epistatic interactions, where Arabidopsis thalian AP1 masks the phenotypic expression of quantitative trait loci controlling pet number in Cardamine huta. In contrast, Cardamineuta AP1 fails to complement this function of Arabidopsis AP, resulting in variable pet number. Upstream regulatory regions of AP contribute to the divergence. Notably, pet number is maintained in Cardamineuta despite genetic variation in natural accessions producing four-pet flowers.
The article discusses the role of proinsulin misfolding in the progression to type 2 diabetes. Proinsulin is the precursor to insulin, a hormone critical for metabolic homeostasis. Its synthesis begins with the formation of three evolutionarily conserved intramolecular disulfide bonds. In normal pancreatic islets, a subset of proins molecules have at least one free cysteine residue. However, when the endoplasmic reticulum environment is perturbed, proins forms intermolecular disulfide complexes. In genetically obese mice with wild-type islets, disulf-linked proins complexes are more abundant. In leptin-deficient mice, these complexes further increase with onset of islet deficiency and diabetes. Proins-Cys 19 and Cys20 are necessary for proins disulfide complex formation. Pro-Cys 19-Cys19 homodimers resist reductive dissociation, providing a structural basis for aberrant proins complex. The study concludes that proins misolding via disulf complexes is an early event in prediabetes that worsens ß-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.
The article discusses the role of SUVH1, a histone lysine 9 (H3K9)-specific methyltransferase, in the assembly of heterochromatin. SUVH recognizes trimethylated H3K (H3me3) via its chromodomain (CD) and H3me3 allows SUVH to target specific chromosomal regions. However, the mechanisms of targeting heterochatin without pre-existing H3me are poorly understood. This study reveals that SUV1’s chromodomain (SUVH-CD) binds nucleic acids, which is crucial for its function in heterochatin assembly. SUV-CD has higher affinity for RNA than DNA and its nucleic binding is independent of H3me recognition. In vivo, SUV1 binds major satellite RNAs and knockdown of satellite RN lowers SUV retention on pericentrom. Mutational studies indicate that both nucleic-binding and Hme activities of SUV-CD are crucial for peric heterochatin assembly. These results suggest chrom-bound RN contribute to SUV’s target specificity.
The study investigated the role of spatial attention in modulating entorinal cortex receptive fields in the absence of physical movement. The entorinal cortex is a region of the brain involved in spatial processing and navigation, and contains grid cells that allow for precise decoding of position in space. Grid cells have been hypothesized to contribute to mental operations beyond navigation, but this requires that their activity does not depend on physical movement. To test this, the authors trained monkeys to maintain central fixation while covertly attending to a stimulus in the periphery and found that 20.14% of entorinal cells had spatially structured receptive fields at a false discovery rate of 5%. This is in contrast to the hippocampus, where grid-like representations were not observed. The results suggest that entinal cells in macaques do not rely on physical movement.
The article reports on the development of a standardized task for measuring decision-making in mice that produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories. The task, called the head-fixed task, assesses perceptual and value-based decision-making in mice. To ensure reproducibility, the authors standardized the training protocol, hardware, software, and procedures. The task was administered to 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries, collecting over 5 million choices into a publicly available database. The results show that learning speed varied across mice, but once training was complete, there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice from different laboratories relied similarly on visual stimuli, past successes, and failures, and estimates of stimulus probability to guide their choices. These findings demonstrate that complex behavior in mice can be reproduced across laboratories. The study establishes a standard for reproducible rodent behavior and provides an unprecedented dataset and open tools for studying decision-making in mice. The results indicate a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through open-science approaches.
The article presents a comprehensive analysis of the intestinal transcriptome of Schmidtea mediterrane, a planarian flatworm capable of regenerating its organs, including the gut. Using laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), the researchers identified hundreds of genes with intestinal expression previously undetected by other approaches. Systematic analyses revealed extensive conservation of digestive physiology and cell types with other animals, including humans. The study also uncovered regionalized gene expression in the planarian intestine along the medio-lateral axis, particularly in intestinal goblet cells. Two intestine-enrich transcription factors were identified: gli-1, a hedgehog signaling effector, and Rb2, goblet cell maintainer. These findings provide resources for further investigation of mechanisms in gastrointestinal function, repair, and regeneration.
The study investigated the relationship between evolutionary adaptations in sensory perception and physiological coding of stimuli in weakly electric fish, specifically mormyrids. These fish can detect subtle variations in electric signals by encoding waveform differences in spike timing between sensory receptors. In contrast, species insensitive to waveform variations produce spontaneously oscillating potentials. The study found that oscillating receptors respond to electric pulses by resetting their phase, resulting in synchrony among receptors that encodes signal timing, not waveform. These receptors were most sensitive to frequencies found in collective signals of conspecifics, correlated with increased behavioral responses. Different perceptual capabilities correspond to receptor physiologies. Divergent mechanisms are hypothesized to represent adaptations for different social environments. Findings provide evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony.
The article presents a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bacteriophage BPP-1 at 3.5 Å resolution, which infects and kills Bordetella species, the causative agent of whooping cough. The structure reveals two major protein folds: the jelly-roll fold of the capsid protein (CP) and the HK-like fold of the major capsid protein (MCP). Notably, the topology of MCP is non-circularly permuted from the fold previously seen in viral and cellular proteins. The new topology is proposed as the only feasible alternative to the original β-sheet augmentation. Electrostatic interactions contribute to the formation of non-covalent chain in BPP-1, unlike covalent-protein linkages in HK97. The termini of both CP and MCP are positioned for DGR-based phage engineering.
The study investigated how dengue virus (DENV) populations adapt to different host environments by serially passing the virus in human and mosquito cell lines and estimating the fitness effects of single nucleotide variants in these populations using ultra-deep sequencing. The results showed that a large burden of deleterious mutations counterbalances the effect of rare host-specific beneficial mutations, shaping the path of adaptation. Beneficial mutations preferentially map to intrinsically disordered domains in the viral proteome and cluster to defined regions in the genome. These phenotypically adaptive alleles may facilitate host-specific DENV adaptation. The evolutionary constraints observed in this system mirror trends across DENV and Zika strains, recapitulating key biophysical and biological constraints shaping long-term viral evolution.
Biomedical research article summary: High-throughput single-particle tracking reveals membrane nanodomains that dictate KRas12 diffusion and trafficking
    Recent studies have suggested that membrane nanodomains play a crucial role in Ras signaling, but the nature of these domains and how they interact with Ras remain unclear. This study used single particle tracking photoactivated localization microscopy ( sPALM ) and detailed analysis to investigate the diffusion and trafficking of KRas12, an active Ras mutant, in U2OS cells. The results show that distinct membrane nanodomains dictate KRas12 diffusion and trafficking. KR12 exhibits an immobile state in ~70 nanometer domains embedded in a larger ~200 nanometer domain that confers intermediate mobility, while the rest of the membrane supports fast diffusion. Moreover, KR12 is continuously removed from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to the fast, reminiscent of internalization and recycling. Importantly, the diffusion and trafficking of KR12 remain invariant over a broad range of protein expression levels. These findings reveal how membrane organization dictates diffusion and trafficking of Ras and provide new insight into the spatial regulation of Ras signaling.
Biologists have long understood that Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling plays a crucial role in patterning the dorsal-ventral axis of embryos in vertebrates and invertebrates. In vertebrates, the prevailing view is that BMP gradient formation occurs through a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists and ligand shuttling to generate peak signaling levels. To investigate this mechanism in zebraf, researchers precisely quantified BMP activity in wild-type and mutant embryos and combined these data with a mathematical model-based screen to test hypotheses for gradient formation. Their analysis ruled out BMP shuttling and transcriptional gradient mechanisms. Instead, surprisingly, their results support a source-sink model, where a restricted BMP antagonist acts as a sink to drive BMP dorsally and gradient formation. They measured Bmp diffusion and found it supports the sourceink model, suggesting a new mechanism to shape BMP gradients during development.
Lysosomes are essential organelles responsible for intracellular degradation of macromolecules through acidic hydrolase-mediated proteolysis. To facilitate the export of low-molecular catab end-products, polytopic transmembrane proteins mediate secondary or passive transport. However, many lysosomal transporters remain poorly understood. This study focuses on MF1, a previously uncharacterized lysosomal member of the major facilitator superfamily. MF1 is not glycosylated and contains a dileucine sorting motif necessary for its transport to lysosomes. Mice lacking MF1 exhibit splenomegaly and severe liver disease. Proteomics analysis of lysosomes from MF1 mice revealed GL as a critical accessory subunit for MF1. MF1 and GL physically interact. GL is essential for maintaining normal levels of MF1 in lysosomes and vice versa. GL mice mimic the phenotype of MF1 mice. These findings reveal a tightly linked MF1/GL lysosomal protein complex.
Biologists have made significant progress in understanding the mechanism of microtub-based transport powered by kines motors, which is crucial for various cellular processes in eukaryotes. To gain insight into this process, researchers developed atomic models of nucleotide and ATP states of the monomeric kines motor domain microtub from cryo-EM reconstructions at 5– Å resolution. These models were compared with existing X-ray structures of ADP-bound kines to propose a mechanistic scheme. Microtub attachment, mediated by a conserved ‘chpin’ residue kines (N255) triggers clam opening of the nucleotide cleft and release of AD. Binding of ATP closes the cleft in a manner tightly coupled to translocation of cargo via kines’s ‘neck’ element. These transitions are similar to nucle-exchange steps in myosin and F-ATase motors. The two heads of kines dimer gate each other to promote coordinated stepping along microtules.
The article describes the discovery of a novel quality control (QC) pathway for misfolded proteins at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The study identifies two temperature-sensitive (ts) OM proteins, Sen2-Hs and Sam2-Hs, as substrates of the ubiquitin-proteome system, which degrades them from the OM. The ubiquitination of Sen2-H is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Ubr1, while Sam-H is primarily ubiquinated by San1. Mitochondrial degradation (MAD) of both substrates requires the Hsp70 and HspS1 chaperones, providing evidence for their involvement in MAD. The study also implicates the C48-N4-U1 AAA-ATase Do1 and a mitochondrial pool of transmembrane C48 adaptor Ubx2 in degradation. This QC pathway is distinct from other cellular pathways due to its combination of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors.
Biomedical research article summary: Intercellular propagation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation revealed in vivo imaging mouse skin

   Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a key effector of many signaling pathways. This study used an ER FRET biosensor to visualize epidermal ER activity in living mice. Under steady-state conditions, the epidermis showed bursts of ER activation where ER activity propagated radially from cell to cell. The frequency of this spatial propagation of ER activity (SP) correlated with epidermal cell division rate. SPs were stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphol 13-acetate (PA) in a manner dependent on EGF receptors and their ligands. At wounded skin, ER activation propagated as wave parallel to wound edge, suggesting ER activation can be superimposed. Visualizing cell cycle found SP associated with G/M progression. Our results provide insights how proliferation and ER activity are synchronized in tissue.
Biologists have long sought to understand how living organisms synchronize their internal biological rhythms with external environmental cycles. The circadian clocks of cyanobacteria, a type of photosynthetic bacteria, have been studied extensively in this context. Unlike most organisms, circadian clocks in cyanobacteria do not rely on external cues to function, but instead free-run in constant conditions. However, in the natural world, circadian clocks are generally driven by daily cycles that vary with the seasons. The mechanisms that allow circadian clocks to align with these cycles are not well understood. To address this, researchers have developed platforms to study the cyanobacterial circadian clock both in vivo and in vitro. They found that the phase of the circadian rhythm follows a simple law in light-dark cycles, tracking midday conditions with variable length. The core oscillator of the circadian clock, comprised of Kai proteins, behaves similarly when driven by metabolic pulses in vitro, indicating that dynamics are intrinsic to these proteins. A mathematical framework was developed based on instantaneous transformation of the cycle by external cues, which predicts behavior under many environments. The study provides new insights into how circadian clocks align with external cycles and how they adapt to changing conditions.
The article reports on a study investigating the role of the transcription factor Meis in the regulation of sympathetic nervous system development and its impact on sudden cardiac death. Genome-wide association studies have identified Meis as a risk factor for sudden cardiac death. The study found that Meis inactivation in the neural crest leads to altered sympathetic regulation of heart rhythm in adults, characterized by chronotropic incompetence and conduction defects, increasing susceptibility to sudden death. Meis was found to be a major regulator of sympathetic target innervation, with Meis deficient neurons dying from embryonic to perinatal stages. The transcription of key molecules necessary for endosomal machinery was also regulated by Meis, with traffic of Rab+ endosomes severely altered in Me-inactivated neurons. This suggests Me interacts with trophic signaling pathways during postmitotic neurons.
The article presents a study on the morphogenesis of biofilms formed by surface-attached bacterial communities, specifically using Vibrio cholera as a model organism. Biofilms display a range of morphologies, but the mechanisms driving their formation are not fully understood. The study combines mechanical measurements, theory, simulation, image analysis, surface characterization, and mutagenesis to investigate the role of mechanical instabilities and interfacial energy in biofilm morphogenesis. Mechanical instabilities, such as wrinkling and delamination, are found to be essential for biofilm morphogenesis. Interfacial energy is identified as a key driver of mechanomorphogenesis, dictating the generation and annihilation of interfaces. A feedback loop between mechanorphogenesis and bio expansion is discovered, shaping the overall biofilm contour. The study reveals that mechanical instabilities and interfac energy are crucial for biofilm morphogenesis. These principles should be applicable to morphogenesis in higher organisms.
The study investigated the role of the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRS) in the development of epileptic networks following seizures. Previous research had shown that interfering with NRS function reduced the severity of the disorder. This study found that severe seizures increased NRS levels in the hippocampus by several fold. However, surprisingly, only a subset of NRS target genes were repressed. The repressed gene set was rescued when NRS binding to chromatin was blocked. Genes selectively repressed by NRS had mid-range binding to the repressor, making them sensitive to fluctuations in NRS levels. These genes coded for ion channels and receptors crucial to neuronal function. The study suggests that dynamic regulation of NRS target genes may influence neuronal properties in pathological and physiological contexts.
The study investigated the parallel processing of sensory information in the mammalian olfactory system by examining the lateral inhibitory circuits between mitral and tuft cells in the olfactory bulb of mice. Mitral and tuft cells are two types of interneurons in the olfactory system that process and transmit sensory information from the olfactory receptors to higher brain regions. The study found that mitral and tuft cells have distinct lateral inhibitory circuits that allow them to process and encode specific features of odors differently. This is due to differences in the activation of deep and superficial granule cells, a type of inhibitory interneuron in the olfactory bulb. Simulations showed that these circuit-level differences enable mitral and tuft cells to discriminate odors in different concentration ranges, suggesting that segregating information about stimulus intensity may be a function of these parallel pathways.
The article discusses the allosteric properties of monomers and oligomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor, a prototypic model of allosteric G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The study aimed to identify the molecular and supramolecular determinants of alloster effects by comparing monomers and oligomers of the M2 musinic receptor. Alloster interactions were monitored using a FRET-based sensor at the alloster site and pharmacological assays involving mutants to exclude intramolecular effects. Electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of alloster at the atomic level were examined in molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that alloster effects in monomers are exclusively negative and primarily due to intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between alloster and orthosteric ligands. In contrast, alloster effects in oligomers can be positive or negative depending on the alloster-ortheric pair and arise from interactions between constituent protomers. The behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations.
The study investigated the role of SET2, an enzyme responsible for trimethylating histone H3 lysine 36 (H3me36), in the response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in cells. The results show that SET2 is required for the activation of the ATM kinase, a key player in the DNA damage response, and for homologous recombination repair of DSBs by promoting the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments. Cells deficient in SET2 displayed impaired DNA signaling, but failed to activate p53, a tumor suppressor of the genome, despite persistent DNA damage. The study proposes that SET2-dependent histone modifications facilitate signaling and repair of DSBs. In clear cell carcinoma cells, loss of SET2 may provide an alternative mechanism for inactivation of the p53 checkpoint without additional TP53 mutations.
The study investigated the effects of a missense mutation in the Rasgrp gene, which encodes a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, in mice. The mutation, RasgrpAna, resulted in the substitution of an amino acid in the Rasgrp protein and was associated with the production of autoantibodies and the accumulation of a CD44+ Helios+ PD-1+ CD4+ T cell population. These cells were dependent on B cells for their development. Despite reduced Rasgrp-Ras-ER activation in vitro, thymocyte selection in RasgrpAna mice was normal, although CD44 was overexpressed on naïve thymocytes and T cells in a T-autonomous manner. CD44 expression was identified as a reporter of mTOR kinase signaling through a novel strain, chino, with a reduction-of-function mutation in m. Elevated mTOR signaling in Rasgrp naïve CD+ T cells was associated with CD44 expression, CD+ T subset and serumantibodies. These effects were reversed in Ras1AnaMtorchino double-mut mice, demonstrating that increased m activity was essential for RasAna T dysregulation.
The study investigated the role of Arid, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) initiation and its interaction with the oncogenic KrasG12 mutation. Arid was suppressed in the mouse pancreas using a shRNA and inducible system in the presence of KrasG12. The results showed that Arid cooperates with Kras to induce rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous PDAC lesions. However, when Arid was silenced during embryogenesis with Kras12 activation, acinar cell fate was retained. These findings indicate Arid as a critical modulator of Kras-dependent changes in acinar cell identity and highlight the influence of timing and genetic context on SWI/S complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis.
The study investigated the effects of social isolation on the neuroendocrine properties of paraventricular nucleus (PV) corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in mice. PV CRH neurons play a crucial role in stress response. The study found that isolating pre-adolescent female mice from their littermates for 24 hours altered the intrinsic properties of these neurons in a sexually dimorphic manner. Specifically, female mice showed increased first spike latency ( FSL ) and decreased excitability of CRH neurons. In contrast, age-matched males did not exhibit these changes. However, subjecting either male or female mice to acute physical stress increased FSL. The increase in FSL following social or physical stress was blocked by the glucocortic synthesis inhibitor metrapone and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone. The increase in FSL resulted in a decrease in excitability of CR neurons. The study demonstrates that social but not physical stress has sex-specific effects on PV CR neurons.
Title: Evolutionary and Functional Insights into the Mechanism of Body-Size-Related Adaptation of Mammalian Hemoglobin

Hemoglobin (H) is a model protein that has been extensively studied in the context of molecular adaptation in vertebrates. Although the affinity and cooperativity of oxygen binding to H affect oxygen delivery to tissues, only the former was thought to determine adaptations of H. However, this study suggests that H affinity and cooperativity reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptations that optimize oxygen delivery to tissues. To test this hypothesis, the relationship between the Hill coefficient and conformation parameters of the Monod-Wann-Change alloster model was derived and graphed the ‘biophysical landscape’ describing this relation. It was found that mammalian H cooperativity values reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity along this landscape that allows fine-tuning of oxygen unloading to meet distinct requirements of mammalian tissues for oxygen. The findings reveal the mechanism of body-related adaptation of mammalian H.
Title: Longitudinal Analysis of Plasmodium Sporozoite Motility in the Dermis Reveals Component of Blood Vessel Recognition
    Malaria infection begins with the injection of Plasmodium sporozoites by Anopheles mosquitoes into the skin of mammalian hosts. The process of sporozoites locating and entering blood vessels is a critical, yet poorly understood process. This study examines sporozoite motility and interaction with dermal blood vessels using intravital microscopy in mice. The results show that sporozoites exhibit two types of motility: far from blood vessels, they exhibit avascular motility, characterized by high speed and less confinement, while near vessels, motility is more constrained. Curvature of sporite tracks with vasculature optimizes contact with dermal capillaries.
Title: Evolutionary Adaptation after Cell Polarization Crippling: Reproducible Trajectories
    Abstract: Cells are organized into functional modules, comprising components whose removal severely compromises the module’s function. Despite their importance, these components are not universally conserved across the tree of life, suggesting cells can perform the same biological functions with different proteins. We evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae for 100 generations without the polarity gene BEM1. Initially, bem1 lineages increased in fitness, then reached >90% of BEM ancestors’ fitness at the end. Sequencing their genomes and monitoring polarization revealed a common evolutionary trajectory with a sequence of adaptive mutations, each improving polarization by inactivating proteins. Our results show organisms can be evolutionarily robust to physiological perturbations and suggest recovery by inactivation can lead to divergence in cellologically important functions.
Neuroscience research has investigated the neural mechanisms of commitment in the human prefrontal cortex by examining decision-making processes involving successive choices between goods or gambles with lasting consequences, such as investing in a house or choosing a partner. Participants were asked to decide whether to accept or reject prospects with sustained financial returns. Brain activity in the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmFC) encoded value only when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, suggesting a role in integrating value over time. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) encoded value only when participants rejected or accepted a prospect. ACC activity reflected two biases : deferring commitments to later and weighting potential losses more heavily than gains, paradoxically maximising reward in the task. These findings provide new insights into the pressures shaping economic decisions and value computation in the prefrontal cortex.
The study investigated the role of paraspeckles, nuclear bodies that form around long non-coding RNAs and RNA-binding proteins, in controlling gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through the retention of mRNA containing 3’-UTR inverted repeats of Al sequences (IRu). In pituitary cells, the components of parasck, including major proteins and Neat, displayed a circadian expression pattern. The insertion of IRu at the 3’-UT of EGFP cDNA led to rhythmic circadian retention of egfp mRNA, which was lost when parasck were disrupted, whereas insertion of antisense IRu had a weak effect. Using real-time microscopy, IRu were shown to drive circadian expression of EGFP. This study demonstrates that parasck, due to their circadian expression, control gene expression at postcription level.
The article discusses the role of the protein Munc13 in controlling the function of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) at the synapse. M13 is an active protein essential for exocytosis, the process by which vesicles containing neurotransmitters are released from the presynaptic terminal. The study shows that M13 interacts with VGCC via a pair of basic residues in its C2 domain and that this interaction is necessary for VGCC function. When M13 is removed or replaced with a mutant M13 lacking the C2 domain, VGCC response to high-frequency bursts of action potentials is altered and calcium influx from single action potentials is reduced. This suggests that M13 plays a critical role in controlling VGCC behavior during various forms of activity.
The article explores the relationship between the shape and function of plant cells, specifically the puzzle-shaped cells found in the epidermis of various plant species. These cells have a complex shape that has puzzled scientists for a long time, but their functional significance has remained unclear. The authors propose that the intricate shape of these cells is an effective strategy to reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall of the epidermis. When tissue growth is isotropic, they hypothesize that lobes emerge at the cellular level to prevent the formation of isodiametric cells that would bulge under stress produced by turg pressure. Data from various plant species supports the relationship between lobes and isotropy, which is tested with mutants where growth direction is perturbed. Simulation models show that a mechanism regulating cellular stress reproduces the development of epidermal cell shape. The results suggest that mechanical stress is a key driver of cell shape morphogenesis.
Title: Synergistic Assembly of Human Pre-spliceosomes: Introns and Exons 
    Summary: The assembly of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for removing introns from pre-mRNA to form exons, is a crucial step in gene expression. Most human genes contain multiple introns, requiring mechanisms to define exons and connect them properly. The process of spliceosome assembly involves interactions between introns and exons, but how these interactions work together is unclear. This study investigated the dynamic interactions of single pre-mRNA molecules with fluorescently tagged spliceosomal subcomplexes in human nuclear extracts to understand how intron-exon and exon processes jointly promote pre-splice assembly. The U1 subunit bound to the 5’ splice site of an intron interacted with U1 bound to the 5 splice site of the next intron, increasing the rate and efficiency of U2 sub recruitment to the 3 splice site of the upstream intron. The flanking 5 splice sites had greater than additive effects, implying distinct mechanisms facilitating U2 recruitment. This synergy of 5 splice sites across introns and exons likely promotes correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron preRNAs.
The article describes a novel ubiquitin-dependent folding system that assists in the proper folding of membrane proteins from the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This system involves the ubiquitination of a specific lysine residue on the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6, which promotes its folding while preventing degradation. The ubiquitin is then removed by the deubiquinating enzyme USP19, allowing LRP6 to exit the ER. This process is conceptually similar to glucosylation-deglucylation in the lumen during the calnexinreticulin folding cycle. To prevent futile cycles, LRP6 undergoes palmitoylation and export, while misfolded proteins are polyubiquinated and targeted for degradation. This system also regulates proteostasis of other membrane proteins CFTR and anthrax receptor 2, which are involved in human diseases.
The study investigated sex differences in learning and decision-making processes in mice using a two-armed bandit task, a classic value-based decision-making paradigm. While male and female mice showed similar accuracy in the task, their performance was achieved through distinct patterns of exploration. Male mice made more exploratory choices overall, often persisting in exploration once initiated. In contrast, female mice explored less but learned more efficiently during exploration. These findings suggest that sex influences decision-making during learning and exploration phases, but not during stable choices. The results have implications for understanding sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders, such as addiction, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities, where exploration is altered.
Doa is a membrane protein that plays a crucial role in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. During ERAD, proteins are ubiquitinated and extracted from the ER membrane and degraded by the proteasome. The cytosolic ATPase Cdc48 drives extraction by pulling polyubiquitinated substrates. However, the mechanism of how hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments are moved from the phospholip bilayer into the cytos is not fully understood. This study used a reconstituted system with purified proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate this process. The results show that the ubiquitin ligase Doa ( Te-4/MARCH in animals ) is a retrolocase that facilitates protein extraction. The TM segment of the substrate interacts with the membraneembedded domain of Doa and passively moves into the aqueous phase. The luminal segments of the substrate cross the membrane in an unfolded state. Unfolding occurs on the luminal side of the membrane by cytoplasm C48 action. The study reveals how a membrane retroase cooperates with C48 in protein extraction.
The article discusses the role of Drosophila Hedgehog (H) in morphogenesis in the absence of regulated Ci processing. H proteins induce transcriptional changes in target cells by inhibiting the proteolytic processing of full-length Dophila Ci or mammalian Gli proteins to nuclear repressors and activating full Ci Gli proteins. To investigate the contributions of these mechanisms to dose-dependent H signaling in Dophila wing imaginal discs, Ci variants were expressed at physiological levels. The results show that Ci variants that cannot be processed support a normal pattern of graded gene activation and development of adults with normal morphology when supplemented with constitutive Ci repressor, indicating that H can signal in the absence of regulated processing. Processing-resistant Ci variants were also activated in the absence of H by elimination of Cos2, likely through binding the CORD of Ci or PKA, revealing inhibitory roles of these components in addition to their established roles in promoting processing.
**Summary of the Article: Calinin Positive Neurons Form an Excitatory Network in the Spinal Cord Dorsal Horn**

   The spinal dorsal horn of the spinal cord plays a crucial role in relaying sensory information from the body to the brain. To better understand how dysfunction in this region can lead to pain, it is essential to clarify the neuronal circuits involved in sensory processing. This study used an optogenetic approach to selectively activate interneurons in the spinal cord that express the calcium-binding protein calretinin (CR). The results show that these interneurons form a network that can initiate and sustain excitatory signaling and relay signals to lamina projection neurons. Activation of CR interneurons in vivo resulted in significant nocifensive behavior that was morphine sensitive, caused conditioned aversion, and enhanced by spared nerve injury. Furthermore, halorhodin-mediated inhibition of interneurons elevated sensory thresholds. These findings suggest that dorsal horn circuits involving excitatory CR neurons are important for the generation and amplification of pain and identify interneurons as a potential analgesic target.
The article discusses the role of Ras-associated protein 23 (RAB23) in the regulation of osteogenesis and skull development, particularly in the context of Carpenter Syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by multiple developmental abnormalities including polydactyly and skull morphogenesis defects. To investigate this, researchers generated mice deficient in R23 that survive to an age where skeletal development can be studied. These mice exhibit polyactly and premature fusion of sutures due to aberrant osteoprogen proliferation and osteogenesis in the suture. Further, FGF-driven FGFR1 signaling is elevated in R23-sutures, leading to an imbalance in MAPK, Hedgehog, and RUN2 expression. Inhibition of pER1/2 signaling normalizes osteoprogen proliferation and reduces osteogenic expression, preventing craniosynosis. The study reveals a novel role for R23 as an upstream regulator of FGFR and canonical H-GL1 signaling, and non-canonical GL1 through p1/2.
The article presents a study on the epigenetic inheritance of gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana, specifically focusing on the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and its target gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). PR2 maintains epigenetic repression of many genes in animals and plants by modifying chromatin at its targets. However, it is unclear whether this inheritance is due to long-term memory of gene states (cis) or local chromatin states dictated by diffusible factors (trans). To investigate this, the authors monitored expression of two copies of the Arabidopsis Polycomb target FLC in the same plants. One copy was repressed while the other was active, and this mixed state was inherited through many cell divisions as plants developed. These results demonstrate epigen memory of FLC expression is stored in cis, not trans. This suggests that the local chromatin environment of the Poly target gene instructs its epigen inheritance.
The article discusses the physiological modulation of BiP activity by trans-protomer engagement of the interdomain linker in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone Hsp70. Using site-specific proteolysis and cross-linking, the authors probed the architecture of oligomers formed by ER Hsp70 and found that they consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate site of another, attenuating chaperone function of oligomeric Bi. Native gel electrophoresis revealed a rapidly modulated reciprocal relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and Bi oligomers and slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive, covalently-modified Bi.
The article presents a 3.9 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of Pepino virus (PepMV), a representative of the Potexvirus genus in the Alphlexiviridae family, which includes economically important plant pathogens. The virus particles consist of hundreds of helically arrayed coat proteins (CP) protecting a single-stranded RNA. The study reveals the structure of CP and its interactions with viral RNA. The overall fold of PepMV CP resembles that of nucleoproteins (NPs) from the Phlebovirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family, a group of enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses. The main difference between Potvirus CP and Phlevis NP lies in their C-terminal extensions, which determine distinct multimer assemblies: flexuous helical rod or loose nucleoprotein. This homology suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic and single-stranded RNA viruses.
The article presents a novel method called SiteLoc for estimating the nanoscale binding site localization of antibodies on native cell surfaces using topological image averaging. This technique aims to address the limitations of current methods for epitope identification, which are costly, time-consuming, and unsuitable for high-throughput analysis. SiteLoc enables fast and efficient screening of epitope location, crucial for the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. The method achieves nanometer resolution in one dimension, the distance between a bound ligand and a reference point on the cell surface. This is achieved through topological averaging of images. Results show that Site is well-suited for antibody binding measurements on native cell morphology and can be applied to other molecular estimations as well.
Systemic vascular pressure in vertebrates is regulated by a complex interplay of factors, with peripheral resistance in capillary beds being a key element of control. The relationship between central control of flow and peripheral resistance is not fully understood, particularly in the context of hypoxic response in tissues and its effect on systemic adaptation to oxygen deprivation. This study investigates the role of hypoxic response via HIF transcription factors in the large vascular bed of the skin and its influence on cardiovascular response to hypoxia in mice. The results show that hypoxic response in the skin feeds back to a range of cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate, arterial pressure, and body temperature. This is the first demonstration of a direct role for oxygen sensing in peripheral tissue modifying response to hypoxia.
**Summary of Article: Cellular Circuit Mapping with Temporally-Focused Excitation of Soma-Targeted Channelrhodopsin**

   Researchers have developed an improved optogenetic method for mapping functional circuit connectivity at the single-neuron resolution. This technique utilizes a two-photon beam expansion in the imaging plane and channelrhodin targeting to the soma and proximal dendrites to evoke action potentials in individual neurons, verify spike generation with GCa6, and determine synaptic connections with patch-clamp electrophys recording. 
   The method allows for precise temporal control of channelrhodin delivery to the soma and proximal dendrites of neurons, enabling the generation of action potentials in individual neurons. This is achieved by expanding the two-photon beam in the imaging plane, allowing for precise targeting of channelrhodin to the soma and proximal dendrites. 
   The generated action potentials are verified with GCa6, a calcium indicator that responds to neuronal activity. The presence or absence of synaptic connections between neurons is determined with patch-clamp electrophys recording. This method provides a tool for mapping circuit connectivity at single-neuron resolution.
The interaction between transcription factors (TFs) and eukaryotic genomes has been a topic of ongoing debate. Recent single-molecule studies on TFs Sox2 and Oct4 suggested an ordered assembly on DNA. However, the calculated quantity did not determine binding order, but rather energy away from thermodynamic equilibrium. This study undertakes a rigorous biophysical analysis leading to the concept of reciprocity. Single-molecule data show that Sox and Oct exhibit negative reciprocity, with Sox increasing Oct’s genomic binding but decreasing Oct Sox’s. Models suggest negative reciprocity can arise from energy or a mixture of positive and negative cooperativity at distinct loci. Both possibilities imply complexity in TFs interact DNA, which single-molecule provide detection capabilities.
Drosophila melanogaster, a common fruit fly species, has the ability to detect and respond to bacterial lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) before infection. LPS are molecules produced by bacteria and trigger immune responses in animals. However, these responses require energy and can be costly. The study investigated whether Dophila can detect LPS before infection and found that they exhibit strong aversive responses to L. The responses were mediated by gustatory neurons that express the Gr66 receptor, a bitter taste receptor. The researchers found that the chemosensory channel TRPA1 is necessary and sufficient for L avoidance in these neurons. LPS activates Doph neurons through TR1 and also activates exogenous TR1 channels in human cells. This suggests that Dila detect LPS via a gustatory pathway through TR1 activation, a conserved mechanism.
The article describes the role of the zinc finger protein Zfp335 in the formation of naïve T cells, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in the body’s response to infection. Naïve T cells are generated in the thymus, an organ where immune cells develop and mature, and then migrate to the periphery, the area of the body outside the thym, to perform their function. However, the process of generating naïve T cells is not fully understood. The study found that mice with a mutation in the Zfp gene, called Zfpbl, have a lack of naïve T cells due to a developmental problem that starts in the thym and continues in the periphery. This problem is not caused by changes in how T cells are selected, grow, or survive in the thym, but is intrinsic to the cells themselves. Zfp binds to specific regions of DNA and its target genes are involved in metabolism, mitochondrial function, and regulation of gene expression. Restoring one of these genes, Ankle, partially fixes the problem with naïve T cells. The study shows that Zfp is a factor that regulates late-stage development of naïve cells in thym and after they leave thym.
Biologists have long assumed that the amount of messenger RNA (mRNA) in a cell directly correlates with the amount of protein produced. However, this is not always the case. Discrepancies between mRNA and protein levels can be attributed to two factors: codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. A new factor called mRNA:RNA avoidance has been identified, which increases translational efficiency. It has been found that mRNA:RNA avoidance is selected for across prokaryotes and has a greater impact on protein levels than mRNA structure or cod usage. To test this, variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs were created with different potential for mRNA:RNA interactions. The results show that GFP levels correlate with mRNA:RNA avoidance. By considering mRNA:RNA interactions, protein abundance can be precisely controlled.
In a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), neuromuscular junction (NM) denervation occurs early in the disease progression. However, it is unclear whether NMJ denervation is a direct result of motor neuron degeneration or a separate process. To investigate this, researchers used in vivo imaging to track single axons and NMJs over three months in SOD1G37 mice, a model of ALS. They found that motor units are dismantled in an asynchronous manner, with axonal branches being dismantled before complete degeneration. Notably, this is accompanied by contemporaneous axonal sprouting and new synapse formation onto nearby NMJs. Denervation tends to propagate from the first NMJ, suggesting a role of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible. These findings indicate NM denervation in ALS is a dynamic process of continuous denervation and innervation rather than sudden motor neuron degeneration.
Title: Estrogen receptor alpha in the brain mediates tamoxifen-induced changes in physiology in mice
    Abstract
    Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy improves survival in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, long-term treatment comes with side effects that impact health and quality of life, including hot flashes, changes bone, and fatigue. Part due to a lack of animal models, tissues and cells that mediate these side effects unclear. Here, we show mice undergoing tamoxifen treatment changes in temperature, bone, and movement. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals tamox treatment induces gene changes in the hypothalamus and optic ( hypothalam-PO ). These changes dependent estrogen receptor ( ER ), as knockout ER in the hypoth-PO ablates or tamoxifen gene. Accordingly ER-deficient do not tamox-induced in temperature, bone, or movement. These findings mechanistic into effects tamox on hypoth-PO and that ER mediates physiological of tamox treatment mice. 
    The study investigated the effects of tamoxifen on physiology in mice and the role of estrogen receptor alpha (ER) in mediating these effects. Tamoxifen is a widely used to treat breast cancer, but long-term treatment can cause side effects such as hot flashes, changes in bone density, and fatigue. To understand these effects, the researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze gene expression in the hypothalamus and preoptic area (hypothalam-PO) of mice treated with tamox. The results showed widespread changes in gene expression in the hypoth-PO, which were dependent on ER. Conditional knockout of ER in the hypoth-PO reversed tamox-induced gene expression. Mice lacking ER did not exhibit tamox-induced changes in temperature, bone, or movement. These findings provide insight into the effects of tamox on the hypoth- and indicate that ER mediates several physiological effects of tam treatment in mice.
ISG15, an interferon-stimulated protein with deubiquitin-like activity, has been shown to possess antiviral properties, but its role in bacterial infections remains unclear. This study reveals that IS15 expression in non-phagocytic cells is dramatically induced upon Listeria monocytogenes infection. Notably, this induction is independent of type I interferon and relies on the cytosolic surveillance pathway, which senses bacterial DNA signals through STING, TBK, IRF3, and IR7. Furthermore, IS15 restricts Listeria infection in vitro and in vivo. Stable isotope labeling in culture (SILC) was used to identify ISylated proteins responsible for the protective effect. Strikingly, overexpression of IS15 leads to ISylation of ER and Golgi proteins, correlating with increased secretion of cytokines counteracting infection.
Title: DeepRET: A Software for Rapid Automated Single-Molecule FRET Data Classification using Deep Learning
    Abstract: Single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smRET) is a technique used to study the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. The development of high-throughput methodologies and commercial instrumentation has outpaced the development of standardized and automated methods to analyze the produced data. Here, we present DeepRET, an open-source software based on deep learning, where only human intervention from raw images to biomolecule behavior is user-adjustable threshold. Integrating smRET features, DeepRET outputs common metrics. Its accuracy on truth data reached 95%, outperforming operators and commonly used, requiring ~1% time. Its rapid operation on data demonstrates DeepRET’s capacity to biomolecular dynamics and contribute to smRET for structural biology.
    Summary: 
    Single-molecule Förster Reson Energy Transfer (smRET) is a powerful technique for studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. However, the rapid growth of high-throughput methodologies and commercial instrumentation has outpaced the development of standardized and automated methods to analyze the generated data. To address this issue, researchers have developed DeepRET, an open-source software based on deep learning. This software automates the process from raw microscope images to histograms of biomolecule behavior, requiring only user-adjustable threshold. DeepRET integrates standard features of smRET and outputs common metrics, including kinetic information. The accuracy of DeepRET on ground truth data reached 95%, outperforming human operators and commonly used methods, requiring ~1% of the time. The software’s rapid operation on real data demonstrates its capacity to quantify biomolecular dynamics and contribute to benchmarking smRET for structural biology.
The study investigated the role of SCML2, a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila Polycomb protein SCM, in the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1)-mediated epigenetic regulation of gene expression. SCMLA, an isoform of SC2 tightly associated with chromatin, was found to contribute to PR1 localization and repression of certain Polycomb target genes. SC2 binds to PR1 via its SPM domain and interacts with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) through a novel RNA-binding region (RBR). The targeting of SC2 to chromatin involves the coordinated action of MB domains, RNA binding, and interaction with PR1 through the S domain. Deletion of BR reduced occupancy of SC2 at target genes and overexpression of mutant SC2 lacking BR caused defects in PR1 recruitment. These findings suggest a role for ncRN in regulating SC2 function and that SC participates in epigenetic control directly with PR1.
The article discusses the mechanisms of ribosome stalling by SecM at multiple elongation steps in Escherichia coli. Ribosome stalling by the C-terminal sequence of SecM regulates the Sec-dependent secretion pathway. Previous studies have identified residues of SecM and ribosome exit as critical for stalling, but the underlying mechanism was unclear at the atomic level. This study presents cryo-EM structures of Sec-stalled ribosomes at 3.3-3.7 Å resolution, revealing two stalling mechanisms at distinct elongation steps of the translation cycle. The first mechanism involves inactivation of the ribosomal peptid-transfer center, inhibiting peptide formation with incoming proly-tRNA. The second mechanism is prolonged peptid-RNA residence at the A site, inhibiting full tRNA translocation. These results demonstrate control of the translation cycle by regulatory peptides through dynamic reshaping of the ribosomal center.
**Summary of Article: Human Foveal Cone Photoreceptor Topography and its Dependence on Eye Length**

   **Introduction:**
   This study presents the first measurements of foveal cone density as a function of axial length in living eyes and discusses the physical and visual implications of the findings. A new Adaptive Optics Scanning Ophthalmoscope was used to image cones at the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects. Cone density and metrics were computed in units of visual angle and linear retinal.

   **Results:**
   The foveal cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fove, but not in proportion to eye length. Despite retinal stretching, myopes have higher angular density in the fove compared to emmetropes, offering potential for better acuity. Reports of deficits in best-correct fove vision in myopes cannot be explained by increased spacing caused by retinal stretching during my progression.

   **Methods:**
   The Adaptive Optics Scanning Ophthalmoscope was used to image cones at the fove in 28 eyes of 16 subjects. Cone density and metrics were computed in units of angle and retinal units.

   **Discussion:**
 The fove cone density was measured as a function of axial length in living eyes. The fove cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fove, but not in proportion eye length. Despite retinal stretching, myopes have higher angular density the fove compared emmetes, offering potential better acuity. Reports deficits in best-correct fove myopes cannot be explained by spacing caused retinal during my progression.
Title: Genome-wide Identification of Lineage and Locus Variation Associated with Pneumocococcal Carriage Duration

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive disease in infants, particularly in low-income settings. Asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for disease, but variability in its duration is currently understood at the serotype level. This study developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage from longitudinal swab data and combined with whole genome data. The results showed that pneumoccal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype, whereas host traits (age and previous carriage) accounted for less than 5%. The heritability was partitioned into lineage and locus, with the largest sources being serotype (17%), drug-resistance (9%), and other locus (7%). A genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences associated with decreased carriage independent of serotype, potentially disrupting the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumoccal competition and resistance.
The study investigated the stoichiometry between the α and β-subunits of the slow rectifier (IK) channel, which plays a crucial role in cardiac repolarization. The stoichi has been controversial, with some studies suggesting a fixed 2:1 ratio and others a variable up to 4:1. To address this, the researchers created fusion proteins linking one, two, or four KCQ subunits to a single KC subunit. Whole-cell and single-channel recordings showed that the two- and four-subunit fusions had hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter latency compared to the one-subunit fusion, which was abolished by addition of. Furthermore, using unnatural amino acid photo-crosslinking, the researchers found that the two- and four-sub fusions had slower crosslink rates compared to the one-subunit, indicating that there is no intrinsic limit to the association of four β-subunits within the IK complex. The results suggest a 4: stoichiometry for the IK channel.
The article discusses the role of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) in the regeneration of zebraf fin tissue after injury. The study reveals that IL-1β is required for proper regeneration and that its dysregulation leads to apoptosis of regenerative cells. Myoid cells are the primary source of IL-1, but epithelial cells also express IL-1 in response to injury and initiate the inflammatory response. Macrophages are necessary for survival of regenerative cells and IL-1 regulates expression of regeneration-induced genes. The study shows that IL-1 plays an essential role in fin regeneration by regulating expression of regeneration-induced genes and that proper levels of IL-1 and inflammation, tuned by macrophages, are crucial for tissue regeneration.
The article explores the relationship between ribosome surface properties and the nature of the cytoplasmic proteome in Escherichia coli, Lactoccus lactis, and Haloaxii. The researchers used surface-modified fluorescent proteins ( FPs ) to study the translational diffusion of proteins in the cytoplasm. The results show that in E. coli, the mobility of proteins depends on their net charge and distribution, with positively charged proteins diffusing up to 100 times slower than negatively charged ones. This effect is less pronounced in L. lactis and H.ii due to electrostatic screening. The decrease in mobility is attributed to interactions between positively charged FPs and ribosomes, confirmed by in vivo measurements and in vitro with purified ribosomes. The findings suggest that ribosome surface properties may limit the composition of the cytoplasm proteome. The study reveals a paradox in the functioning of prokary ( eukaryotic endosymbionts.
Biologists have long been fascinated by the ability of certain animals, such as planarians, to regenerate lost body parts. While regeneration is widespread, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Planarians, a type of flatworm, can regenerate entire body parts and respond differently to wounds that result in tissue loss versus those that do not. A key question is how these distinct responses are activated. Researchers have identified a protein called S-follatin, a homolog of follatin, required for planarian regeneration. Sollatin inhibits responses to tissue loss but does not prevent normal tissue turnover. Two activin homologs, S-activ-1 and Sactiv-2, are necessary for Soll phenotype. Soll is induced and expressed at higher levels following injuries that cause tissue loss. These findings suggest that Soll inhibits activin proteins to trigger regeneration specifically following injuries involving tissue loss and reveal a mechanism for initiation of regeneration across the animal kingdom.
Biomedical research article summary: Mismatch repair endows tumors with unique signature and sensitivity to DNA-strand breaks
    Mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient tumors exhibit a distinct molecular signature characterized by persistent DNA replication errors that manifest as mutations. Using whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, this study confirms an MMR-deficient signature is distinct from other tumor genomes but surprisingly similar to germline, indicating a substantial fraction of human variation arises from escaping MMR. A set of recurrent indels is identified that may detect microsatellite instability (MSI). In endometrial tumors with immunohistochemically proven MMR deficiency, a novel marker is optimized to detect MSI with greater specificity and selectivity than standard MSI tests. Recurrent indels are enriched in the DNA-strand break homologous recombination pathway. Consequently, DSB is reduced in M-deficient tumors triggering dose-dependent sensitivity of M-def cultures to D inducers.
Title: Optimized Vivid-derived Magnets for Spatiotemporal Control of Cellular Processes in Mammalian Cells
    Abstract: Light-inducible dimerization modules enable precise and spatial control of biological processes in a non-invasive manner. Among them, Magnets are modules engineered from Neurospora crassa photoreceptor Viv by orthogonalizing homodimer interface into heteromers. Both Magn components are well-tolerated protein partners, photoreceptors requiring photoactivation to interact, enabling spatiempotemp confinement dimer with single excitation. However, Magn require concatemer for efficient responses and preinc at 28 to be functional. We engineered an optimized Magn pair requiring neither concatemer nor preinc. We validated these ‘enhanced Magn ( eags ) using to rapidly and reversibly recruit to subcell organelles, induce organel contacts and reconstitute OS-V ER-G tether implicated phosphatidylin-4-transport metabolism.
**Summary of Article: Activation of GCN2 Kinase by Ribosome Stalling Links Translation Elongation with Translation Initiation**

   Recent studies have shown that ribosome stalling during translation can lead to neurodegeneration, but the underlying signaling pathways triggered by stalled elongation complexes are not fully understood. To investigate these pathways, researchers analyzed the brains of C57/BL/6-Gbp2tm2f-/- mice, which have elongation complexes stalled at AG codons due to deficiencies in tRNA and GTP2, a mammalian ribosome factor. The results showed increased phosphorylation of eIFα (Ser51) prior to neurodegeneration and transcript analysis revealed activation of ATF, a key transcription factor in the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Genetic experiments demonstrated that this pathway was activated by e2 kinase, GC2 in a deacylated tRNA-independent manner. Furthermore, the ISR was found to attenuate neurodegeneration in C57/BL/6-G2tmf-/- mice, highlighting the importance of cellular context on the outcome of this pathway activation. These findings demonstrate the interplay between elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during stress.
The article presents a comprehensive analysis of trends in adult human height over the past century, based on data from 147 population-based studies involving over 18.6 million participants. The results show that being taller is associated with increased longevity and higher earnings. The largest gains in adult height occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (95% CI 17.5-22.7) and 16.5 cm (13.3-19.7) taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia over the century. The tallest individuals were men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, averaging 182.5 cm, while the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896, 140.3 (135.8-144.8). The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations 100 years ago remained the same for women and increased for men despite changes in country rankings.
The opioid epidemic in the United States has seen a significant increase in overdose rates between 1999 and 2017, resulting in an average of 130 deaths per day. To combat this crisis, it is essential to understand the brain regions and cells responsible for opioid-induced respiratory depression. This study investigates the effects of opioids on breathing in mice and identifies the brainstem as a key area of interest. By blocking the µ-opioid receptor, the study confirms the brainstem’s role in opioid-induced respiratory depression. Further investigation reveals the pre-Bötzinger Complex as the origin of breathing rhythm, where 70-140 neurons are found to be sensitive to opioids. These neurons may hold the key to developing therapies that prevent respiratory depression while maintaining analgesia.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) co-infection remains a significant public health concern, leading to severe disease outcomes. The entry of both viruses into host cells is mediated by HBV envelope proteins, specifically the pre-S domain of the large envelope protein. However, the identity of the receptor(s) responsible for this interaction has been unknown. This study used near-distance photo-crosslinking and tandem affinity purification to reveal that the pre-S domain of HBV envelope protein interacts with sodium taurochotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver. Silencing NT inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NT expression rendered hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to viral infection. Replacing amino acids 157-165 of nonfunctional monkey NT with human counterpart restored its ability to support viral infection. These findings demonstrate that NT is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV.
Sepsis leads to lasting changes in the phenotype and function of memory CD8 T cells. The global health burden due to sepsis and the associated cytokine storm is substantial. Early intervention has improved survival during the cytok storm, but those who survive enter a state of chronic immunopar defined by lymphopenia and functional deficits of surviving cells. Memory CD8 T cells provide rapid cytolysis and cytokine production following reencounter with cognate to promote long-term immunity and CD T cell impairment due seps can predispose individuals to re-infection. This study investigated the influence of seps on pre-existing memory CD T cells. Central memory CD T cells from septic patients proliferate more than those from healthy individuals. Using LCMV mice and CLP model to induce seps, it was demonstrated that T proliferation is associated with recovery of pathogen-specific CD T following seps-induced lymphopenia. This leads to changes in composition of CD T compartment and altered localization. Further, CD cells from seps survivors have altered transcriptional and chromatin accessibility indicating lasting cell changes. Seps changes the composition of T pool and transcriptional landscape in altered T function and capacity to control L monocogen infection. Thus, seps leads long-term in CD T phenotype, function and localization potentially capacity to respond re-in.
Long interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition poses a mutagenic threat to human genomes. Human cells have evolved strategies to regulate L1 retroposition. The APOB3 (A) family of enzymes catalyze deamination of cytidine nucleotides to uridine (C-U) in single-strand substrates. APO3A (A) is the most potent inhibitor of L1 retroposition in cultured assays. However, characterization of L retroposition events in presence of A did not yield evidence deamination. This study demonstrates A can inhibit L retroposition by deaminating transient single-strand DNA that arises during L integration. This provides mechanistic explanation how A cytidine deaminase can inhibit retroposition.
The article investigates the role of Rem2, a non-canonical Ras-like GTPase, in visual circuit plasticity and experience-dependent changes in the brain. The study reveals that mice lacking Rem2 fail to exhibit normal ocular dominance plasticity during the critical period of development. At the cellular level, it is shown that Rem2 plays a cell-autonomous role in regulating the intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, prior to changes in synaptic function. In vitro and in vivo recordings demonstrate increased spontaneous firing rates in the absence of Rem2. The findings suggest that Rem2 is a key molecule that regulates neuronal excitability and circuit function in the context of changing sensory experience.
Title: Physical Limits to Magnetogenetics: A Critical Analysis of Magnetic Field Effects on Biological Molecules and Cells
    The article presents a critical examination of the impact of magnetic fields on biological molecules and cells, prompted by recent reports of magnetism in biological systems. Studies have identified a protein that acts as a compass to guide magnetic orientation in animals (Qin Qin et al., 2016) and magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel and magnetizing it with a field (Stanley et al., 2015; Wheeler et al., 2016). This analysis argues that these claims contradict fundamental laws of physics, with discrepancies ranging from 5 to 10 orders of magnitude. If these phenomena occur, they must have different causes than proposed by authors. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes limits their utility for magnetically sensitive cells.
Title: Transient Nuclear Prospero Induces Neural Progenitor Quies
    Abstract: Stem cells have the ability to self-renew, differentiate, or enter quies. Understanding how stem cells switch between these states is highly relevant for stem cell therapeutics. Drosophila neural progenitors ( neuroblasts ) have been an excellent model for studying self-renew and differentiation, but quies remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that when neurobl enter quies, the factor Prosper is transiently detected in the neuro nucleus, by the establishment of a molecular profile lacking progenitor and differentiation. The low level of Prosper precedes entry into neurobl quies even the timing of quies is advanced or delayed by temporal factors. Furthermore, loss of Prosper prevents entry into quies, a low level of can drive proliferating neurobl into quies. We propose Prosper levels distinguish progen : for selfnew, for quies, and for differentiation.
The article presents a single-molecule analysis of the kinetics of HIV-1 capsid uncoating, a tightly regulated disassembly process required for the release of viral cDNA prior to nuclear import. To investigate the intrinsic disassembly pathway and its modulation, the authors developed a single-particle fluorescence microscopy method to track real-time unco kinetics of authentic HIV-1 capsids in vitro after membrane permeabilization. The results show that opening the first defect in the lattice is the rate-limiting step of unco, followed by rapid collapse. The caps-binding inhibitor PF74 accelerates opening but stabilizes the lattice. In contrast, polyan binding to a conserved arginine cluster in the lattice delays initiation but does not prevent subsequent disassembly. These findings suggest that different stages of unco can be controlled by the interplay between capsid regulators, determining overall unco kinetics.
The JUN-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and preventing tumor initiation in breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women, and genomic analysis of breast cancer DNA reveals frequent loss-of-function mutations in components of the JNK pathway. Despite JNK promoting cell proliferation by activating AP-1 transcription factor, its association with tumor development is unexpected. This study investigates the effect of J deficiency in murine breast epithelium. Loss of J signaling causes genomic instability and breast cancer development. Moreover, J deficiency leads to widespread neoplasia and rapid tumor formation in murine breast cancer model. This suppressive function is not mediated by J role in tumor growth but requirement to prevent initiation. Data identify J pathway as driver mutations promoting instability and initiation.
The article discusses the role of peptidylglycine-amidating monxygenase (PAM) in ciliogenesis, the process by which cilia are formed and maintained in cells. Cilia are microtubular structures that protrude from the surface of cells and are essential for various cellular functions such as motility and signaling. The authors investigated the function of P in Chlamdomonas, a single-celled organism, and mice. They found that P is required for the assembly of motile primary cilia in both organisms. In Chdomonas, P knockdown lines failed to assemble cilia beyond the transition zone, had abnormal Golgi architecture and altered levels of cilia components. Decreased P expression reduced motile ciliary density on the ventral surface and resulted in cytoplasmic axemes lacking ciliary membrane. The primary cilia on neuroepithelial cells in P-/- mouse embryos were also aberrant. These results suggest that P activity and post-Gol trafficking contribute to c defects and provide a conserved link between P amidation and ciliary assembly.
The article discusses the interaction between class III myosin (My3) and actin-bund protein Espin in the regulation of stereocilia development and maintenance in vertebrate hair cells. My3 interacts with Espin through its tail homology motif 1 (THI), but the exact mechanism of this interaction is unclear. The study reveals that My3 TH contains a pair of sequences that can independently bind to ankyrin repeats of Espin, indicating a novel My3-mediated cross-linking mechanism of Espin. The structure of My3-Espin complex elucidates the binding mechanism and shows My3-induced release of Espin autoinhibition. My3 cross-linking also promotes actin bundling activity of Espin.
Voltage-gated calcium channels play a crucial role in the functioning of excitable cells such as neurons and heart and skeletal muscles. These channels activate at different voltages and kinetics to accomplish diverse functions. To understand the molecular basis of voltage sensing, researchers analyzed the structure, free energy, and kinetics of two functionally distinct voltage sensing domains ( VSDs ) of the eukary calcium channel CaV1 using modeling, mutagenesis and electrophysiology. The two VSDs displayed features of the sliding helix model, but differed in ionair formation of outer charges. Stabilization of the activated state enhanced voltage dependence activation, while stabilization resting states slowed kinetics. This provides a mechanistic model for how ionair formation in VSDs realize characteristic properties of voltageated cation channels.
The article explores the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in adult brain plasticity, specifically in the primary visual cortex (V1) of healthy and stroke-affected brains. Brain plasticity refers to the ability of the brain to change and adapt, which is crucial for recovery from injuries, learning, and improving cognition. Previous studies have shown that MMPs are involved in experience-dependent V1 plasticity in juveniles, but little is known about their role in adults. This study investigated the effects of MMP inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stroke-affected adult mice. In healthy mice, a 7-day application of MMP inhibitor prevented plasticity. However, treatment with MMP inhibitor once but not twice after stroke rescued plasticity normally lost under these conditions. The results suggest that an optimal level of MMP activity is necessary for adult plasticity to occur.
The article discusses the structural dynamics of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydro-5-m-ethyl-4-isoxazole propionate) receptors, a type of glutamate-gated ion channel, during activation and desensitization at vertebrate excitatory synapses. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have revealed full-length structures of AMPA receptors, both alone and in combination with auxiliary subunits. These structures suggest that AMPA dimers undergo significant lateral motions during gating, exposing the extracellular layer along the twofold symmetry axis. To investigate this, bifunctional methaniosulfate crosslinkers were used to calibrate AMP receptor conformations in the presence and absence of auxiliary subunit Stargin. The results indicate that the extracellular AMPA layer can be trapped in stable, opened conformations, especially after prolonged glutamate exposure. In contrast, Stargin limits this conformation flexibility. Under synaptic conditions where glutamate and auxiliary proteins are present, the extracellular AMPA domains likely remain compact during gating.
Biomedical researchers have long faced challenges in isolating intestinal cells from mice infected with helminth parasites due to the strong type 2 immune response, which leads to mucus production, tissue remodeling, and cell infiltration. To overcome this, a standard intestinal digestion protocol was optimized to successfully isolate millions of cells from the duodenum of infected mice. High-dimensional flow cytometry and confocal microscopy were used to validate the accuracy of these cells in representing intestinal responses. The isolation and analysis protocol enabled the identification of hallmarks of anti-parasite responses throughout the course of helmin infection. This approach has the potential to accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helmin immune responses previously unfeasible.
The article presents a quantitative time-resolved analysis of the regulation of the proteasome, a key enzyme responsible for protein degradation and cellular processes such as metabolism and immunological responses. Despite its importance, the mechanisms regulating proteas activity are not fully understood. The study employs an integrated experimental and modeling approach to develop and validate mechanistic models of proteasomal peptide hydrolysis. The 20S proteas is a dynamic enzyme whose activity changes over time due to interactions between substrates and products and proteolytic sites. The locations of these sites and their interactions are predicted by the model and experimentally supported. The analysis suggests the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is substrate transport into the proteas. Transport efficiency varies between standard and immuno proteasomes affecting total degradation and cleavage site usage.
In Drosophila, the recycling of neurotransmitters is crucial for sustained synaptic transmission. Histamine is a key neurotransmitter involved in visual transmission and is rapidly taken up by laminar glial cells where it is converted to carcinine. Caricine is then delivered back to photoreceptors where it is hydrolyzed to histamine and β-alanine. However, it was unclear how β-alanine is returned to laminar glial cells. A new βanine transporter, Bala ( Betaanine Transporter ) was identified. Bala mutants exhibited lower β-al levels and β-al accumulation in the retina. Bala is expressed in retinal pigment cells and required for visual transmission and photaxis behavior. These results show retinal cells play a role in transmission and a Bala-dependent βanine pathway is required for histamine homeostasis and transmission.
The article discusses the role of oxidative events in the aging process of post-mitotic cells, specifically in chronologically aging yeast cells. The study reveals that these cells undergo a sudden redox collapse, affecting over 80% of identified thiol-containing proteins. Contrary to the free radical theory of aging, this collapse is not triggered by an increase in endogenous oxidants, but rather a substantial drop in NAD+ levels, which normally provides electrons for cellular redox homeostasis. This decrease in NAD occurs early in lifespan and initiates a cascade that downregulates cellular processes. Caloric restriction, a universal lifespan-extending measure, increases NAD levels and delays each facet of the cascade. The study outlines a timeline of events leading to system-wide oxidation of the proteome before cell death.
The Mechanism of Chiral Proofreading during Translation of the Genetic Code: Unveiling the Role of D-aminoacyl-tRNA Deacylase
    In the biological world of macromolecules, homirality is essential for cell survival, and its enforcement is crucial for the proper functioning of cellular processes. A key mechanism that ensures this homirality is the proofreading of the genetic code during translation, specifically the removal of D-amino acids from tRNAs. This study reveals the mechanistic basis of this process, focusing on the enzyme D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacyase (DTD) from Plasmodium falcum, a parasite responsible for removing D-am acids from tRNAs. The crystal structure of DTD in complex with a substrate-mim analog provides insight into how it captures the chiral center of D-amacy-tRNA using an invariant cross-subunit Gly-Pro dipeptide. Notably, no protein residues are directly involved in catalysis, instead, the unique side-independent substrate recognition explains DTD’s ability to act on multiple D-am acids. This strict chiral specificity also explains how the enriched pool of L-amacy-tRNAs escapes this proofreading step.
The article discusses the molecular mechanism of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel, which is mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The channel opens in response to ATP-binding dimerization of its two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), and closes following ATP hydrolysis. Spontaneous openings are rare in wild-type CFTR, but occur in certain mutants and are stimulated by ivacaft, a clinically approved CF potentiator. The study investigates the energetic coupling between residues at the dimer interface and spontaneous pore opening/closure in CF channels. The results show that spontaneous openings are strictly coupled to N dimerization, which can occur without ATP. Coordinated NBD/pore movements are intrinsic to CFTR : ATP alters the stability, not the structural architecture of open and closed conformations. This explains the effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP and spontaneous activity, providing insights into CF and drug mechanisms.
The article presents a novel mechanism for the assembly of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers, termed the pre-transition or preel effect. This effect arises from the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases in the membrane. Using large-scale molecular simulations, it is shown that a protein with hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase embedded in an ordered bilayer stabilizes a microscopic–order interface. The stiffness of this interface is finite. When two such proteins approach each other, assembly reduces the interfacial energy. This phenomenon is analogous to the hydroobic effect and is referred to as the orderobic effect. The effect is mediated by proximity to the orderdis phase and hydroph mismatch of the protein. The strength and range of forces arising from this effect are significantly larger than those from membrane elasticity for the membranes considered.
**Summary of Article: Relationship between Simultaneously Recorded Spiking Activity and Fluorescence Signal in GCa6 Transgenic Mice**
 
    **Background:** Fluorescent calcium indicators are widely used to investigate neural dynamics, but the relationship between fluorescence and action potentials (APs) remains unclear. Most APs can be detected when the soma fills the microscope’s field of view, but calcium indicators are used to image populations of neurons, necessitating a large field of view, generating fewer photons per neuron and compromising AP detection.

    **Methods:** This study characterized the AP-fluorescence transfer in vivo for layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex with simultaneous imaging and cell-attached recordings from transgenic mice expressing GCa6 or GCf. 

    **Results:** Most APs were detected under optimal conditions, but under typical population imaging conditions, only a minority of 1 and 2 AP events were detected (<10% and ~20, respectively), emphasizing the limits of detection under realistic conditions.
The article reports the discovery of a unique biological valve system in the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave-dwelling insect Neotla, a species that exhibits sex-role reversal, where females possess a penis-like intromitt organ and males do not. The valve is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in- and outflow canals, which enables females to receive and store seminal packages from males. Females have a penis-like intromitt organ to anchor males and receive voluminous semen, which is packed in a capsule formed by seminal injection. The capsule is used for both fertilization and nutrition by the female. The valve has two slots for insemination, allowing Neotla to mate while one slot is occupied. In conjunction with the penis, this valve is a morphological novelty enabling females to compete for seminal in nutrient-poor cave habitats through copulation and multiple seminal injections. The evolution of this valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of introment organ Neotla.
The article discusses the role of the Munc-18 protein in the assembly of SNARE (soluble Nethylimide-sensitive attachment receptor) proteins and their function in synaptic exocytosis, the process by which neurotransmitters are released from neurons. SNARE proteins consist of three domains : the N-terminal (NTD), C-terminal (CTD), and linker (L) domains. Using optical tweezers, the authors observed four stages of SNARE assembly and found that mutations in each domain affect assembly differently. The NTD and CT domains are responsible for vesicle docking and fusion respectively, while the linker domain regulates SN assembly and fusion. Munc-18 initiates SN assembly and stabilizes the half-zipped SN complex independent of the syntaxin N-terminal regulatory domain. The study reveals distinct functions of SN domains and their assembly is tightly regulated by M-18.
Title: Symmetric Exchange of Multi-protein Building Blocks between Focal Adhesions and the Cytos
    Abstract: How the Integrin Adhesome Self-Assembles Locally and Rapidly at Diverse Cell-Matrix Adhesion Sites

    Integrins are transmembrane receptors that mediate cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion by forming focal adhesions (FAs), which are crucial for cell migration, growth, and differentiation. The integrin adhesome, a complex of integrins and associated proteins, is thought to self-assemble at FAs, but its cytosolic state and dynamics are unclear. To investigate this, we used fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to study integrin adome components and their exchange between FAs and cytos.

    Our results show that integrin adome is pre-assembled in cytos as multi-protein building blocks for FAs. Focal adhes release the same types of protein complexes they recruit, maintaining cytos pool of building blocks spatially uniform. We propose a model where multi-protein blocks enable rapid self-assembly of FAs and symmetric exchange of blocks preserves specificity and assembly logic of system.
Title: Electrophysiological Marker of Arousal in Humans: A Novel Insights into States of Reduced Arousal
    Summary: 
    A recent study investigated the electrophysiological markers of arousal in humans during different states of reduced arousal, including non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, general anesthesia, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Contrary to previous beliefs, the study found that reduced states of arousal are not solely defined by synchronized oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Instead, the 1/f spectral slope of the electrophys power, which reflects the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity, was used to distinguish between wakefulness, propof anesthesia, NREM sleep, and REM sleep. This electroph marker was able to discriminate between wakefulness and REM sleep based solely on the neuro physiological brain state. The study used intracran and surface EEG recordings from four independent data sets to validate the findings. The results suggest that the 1/f slope is a common electroph marker that tracks states of reduced arousal, including sleep stages as well as anesthesia in humans.
Biologists have recently discovered that stromules, dynamic tubular extensions of chloroplasts, interact with the nucleus and play a role in innate immunity. This study found that stromules extend along microtubules (MTs) and their organization affects stromule dynamics, increasing numbers and length when MTs are stabilized chemically or genetically. However, actin filaments (AF) are not required for stromule extension, but provide anchor points for them. There is a strong correlation between stromule direction from chloroplast and chloroplast movement direction. Chloroplast movement was observed in steady-state conditions without immune induction, suggesting a general strom function in epidermal cells. Results show that MT and AF facilitate perinuclear chloroplast clustering during innate response. A model proposes that stromules extend along MT and connect AF points, facilitating chloroplast movement to nuclei during immunity.
The article presents a novel approach to predict residue-residue interactions across protein interfaces using evolutionary information. The study investigates whether amino acid sequences of residues that make contact across protein interfaces covary during evolution, and whether this covariance can be used to predict contacts and assemble models of biological complexes. A pseudo-likelihood method is used to identify residue pairs that covary across proteinprotein interfaces in the 50 ribosomal subunit and 28 bacterial complexes with known structures. The results show that these pairs are almost always in contact in the complex, provided the number of aligned sequences is greater than the length of the two proteins. This method is used to predict subunit contacts for 36 additional complexes with unknown structures and models are presented for four complexes : the tripart ATP-independent periplasm ( TR ), tripart efflux system, pyruvate lyase-activating enzyme, and methine ABC.
Title: Active Sensing in the Categorization of Visual Scenes: A Novel Insights into the Role of Prior Knowledge and Perceptual Biases in Scene Interpretation
    Abstract: Interpreting visual scenes typically requires the accumulation of information from multiple locations within a scene. A novel gaze-contingent paradigm in a visual categorization task revealed that participants’ scan paths follow an active strategy that incorporates prior knowledge of the scene and statistical structure of patterns. Intriguingly, categorization performance was improved when locations were revealed by an optimal Bayesian active algorithm. By combining a Bayesian observer and active algorithm, it was estimated that a major portion of apparent optimality of fixations arose from biases, perceptual noise, and inaccuracies in eye movements, and the process of selecting locations was 70% efficient in the task. Our results suggest participants select eye movements to maximize information about categories requiring integration from multiple locations.
The transport of large molecules into the nucleus is tightly regulated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which allows for the passage of thousands of molecules, including pathogens, mRNAs, and pre-ribosomes. However, the requirements for import of large cargoes (>15nm) are not well understood, particularly the role of multivalent binding to transport receptors via nuclear localization sequences (NLS) and size on import efficiency. To address this, the nuclear import kinetics of 30 large cargo models based on capsid-like particles (17-36nm) with tunable NLS numbers up to 240 were assayed. The results show that transport requirements can be recapitulated by a two-parameter biophysical model correlating import with energetics of large transport through the NPC. The study reveals molecular determinants of large import in cells.
The article discusses the role of the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 in the activation and maintenance of helper T cell responses following priming. CD28 is known to be essential for the activation of helper T cells, but its function after priming is not well understood. To investigate this, a strain of mice was generated where CD28 was removed from CD4+ T cells after priming. The results show that continued CD28 expression is necessary for effector CD4 T cells following infection. Specifically, CD28 is required for the expansion of Th1 cells and the differentiation of follicular helper cells during viral infection. Additionally, CD28 is necessary for clearance of Citrobacterium rodent from the gastrointestinal tract. These findings demonstrate that CD28 persistence is required for helper cell polarization in response to infection, revealing a novel function distinct from its role in priming.
Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium responsible for stomach infections, requires a helical shape to efficiently colonize the stomach. However, the molecular mechanisms generating this shape are not well understood. The helical shape of wild-type H. pylori cells is characterized by high positive and negative Gaussian curvatures, which differ from straight or curved rod-shaped H. pylori cells. Three-dimensional microscopy analysis using fluorescent probes showed that cell growth occurs at both wall extremes of curvature. Immunofluorescence revealed that Mre is abundant at negative curvature, while bactin C is abundant at positive curvature. Strains expressing C variants with altered polymerization properties lose helical shape and positive curvatures. The study proposes a model where C and M promote synthesis at positive and negative curvatures, respectively, and this patterning is necessary for maintaining helical shape.
The article describes the role of Cdc48, a ubiquitin-selective chaper, in regulating mitochondrial dynamics by orchestrating the activities of two deubiquilases (DUBs), Ubp12 and Ubp2. These Ds exert opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion, cleaving different ubiquitin chains on mitofus F1. C48 integrates the activities of these Ds, which are themselves ubiquilated. First, C48 promotes proteolysis of U12, stabilizing pro-fusion ubiqulation on F1. Second, loss of U stabilizes U2 thereby removal of ubiquitin on F, inhibiting fusion. C48 synergistically regulates the ubiqulation of F, controlling the balance between activation or repression of fusion. A new cascade of ubiqulation events comprising C48 and Ds fine-tunes the fusogenic activity of F. Mitochondrial fusion is a critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. The study highlights the importance of C48 in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.
Title: Categorical representation of sound in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex of sighted and blind individuals: Is vision necessary for the development of the categorical organization of the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOT)? 
    Summary: 
    Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the responses of the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOT) to sound categories in sighted and congenitally blind individuals, and a visually sighted group. The study aimed to determine whether vision is necessary for the development of the categorical organization of the VOT. The results showed that VOT reliably encodes sound categories in both sighted and blind individuals using a representational structure and connectivity similar to the one found in vision. However, sound categories were more reliably encoded in the blind group than the sighted group using a representational format closer to the one in vision. Crucially, VOT in the blind represented categorical membership of sounds rather than their acoustic features. The findings suggest that sounds trigger categorical responses in VOT of congenitally blind and sight people partially match the topography and functional of the response, despite differences in the categorical organization of VOT between modalities.
Biologists have long known that certain microbes can alter the behavior of their animal hosts, but the mechanisms behind these changes are not well understood. To study this phenomenon, an experimental system that can be manipulated at the molecular level is needed. A fungal pathogen, Entomophthora muscae, was found to infect Drosophila melanogaster in the wild, and a method to infect D. melanogaster in the lab was developed. Lab-infected flies exhibited behaviors typical of E. mus infection, such as climbing upward, extending their proboscis and raising their wings, creating a path for spores to be released from their abdomens. The fungus was found to invade the nervous system of the fly, suggesting a direct means by which behavioral changes could be induced. D melanogaster has a large toolkit of molecular tools available, making this system useful for studying how E mus manipulates host behavior.
The article presents a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome-wide binding profiles of 30 RNA degradation factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The study reveals the distribution of degradation factors across different RNA classes, including mRNAs, rRNAs, tRNAs, and other non-coding RNAs. The results are consistent with the canonical degradation pathway of closed-loop mRN after deadenylation, where degradation factors bind mRN and decapping factors are recruited for degradation. Modeling of mRNA half-lives suggests that most degradation factors bind intact mRN, whereas decapping factors are only recruited for degradation, consistent with decapping being a rate-limiting step. Decapping factors preferentially bind mRN with non-optimal codons, consistent with degradation of inefficiently translated mRN. The study also suggests that the nuclear surveillance machinery, including complexes Nrd/N3 and TR4, targets aberrant nuclear RN and snoRN. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of RNA degradation in eukaryotic cells.
A novel bivalent chromatin associates with rapid induction of camalexin biosynthesis in response to pathogen in Arabidopsis 
    In Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant defense compound called camalexin is rapidly induced in response to bacterial and fungal infections. While several transcription factors controlling camalex biosynthesis genes have been identified, the rapid activation of this pathway upon pathogen signal remains unclear. Researchers combined publicly available epigenomic data with in vivo chromatin mapping to find that camalex biosynthesis genes are marked with two epigen modifications : trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 ( H3me ) and acetylation of lysine 18 of histone 3 ( Hac ). These modifications have opposite effects on gene expression : H3me represses and Hac activates. A new type of bivalent chromatin was formed. Mutants with reduced H3me or Hac showed that both modifications are required for gene expression and metabolite accumulation at early stress stage. The Hme-Hac bivalent chromatin, named kairo, controls timely gene expression upon stress in plants.
The article discusses the role of the histone methyltransferase EZ2 (EZH2) in astrocytes that serve as neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult subventricular zone (SVZ) of the mouse brain. These astrocytes retain neurogenic competence throughout life, meaning they have the ability to differentiate into neurons, but the underlying epigenetic mechanisms are not well understood. The study shows that ZH2 is expressed in SV NSCs in the SVZ and is required for neurogenesis, independent of its role in cell proliferation. When ZH2 is deleted in SV NSCs, cell proliferation is rescued but neurogenesis remains defective. The study identifies Olig2 as a direct target of ZH2 and shows that repression of this basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor is critical for neuronal differentiation. Additionally, Z2 prevents the activation of genes associated with non-SV neuronal subtypes in the brain. Human SV cells, including astrocytes, also express Z2, correlating with postnatal neurogenesis. The findings suggest that Z2 is an epigenetic regulator that distinguishes neurogenic SV astrocytes and orchestrates distinct aspects of adult stem cell biology. This has implications for regenerative medicine and oncogenesis.
The study investigated the ecology and evolution of viruses infecting uncultivated SUP bacteria in a marine oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) using single-cell genomics and metagenomics. The researchers isolated 127 single amplified genomes (SAGs) from uncultivated SUP bacteria and identified 69 viral contigs representing five new genera within the dsDNA Caudirales and ssDNAviridae families. The results suggest that approximately one-third of SUP bacteria are infected with viruses, with higher infection frequencies observed in areas of severe oxygen deficiency. Microviridae clonality indicates the presence of bloom-terminating viruses, while co-infection between dsDNA and ssDNA viruses reveals previously unrecognized modes of cooperation. The analysis of microbial and viral metagenomes revealed that SUP viruses persisted for years but remained endemic to the OM. The study also identified virus-encoded dissimulatory sulfite reductase, suggesting SUP viruses reprogram their host’s energy metabolism. These findings demonstrate coupled SUP virus-host co-evolution dynamics with potential to modulate biogeochemical cycling in climate-critical and OM.
Title: TTC26/DY13 is an Intraflagellar Transport Protein Required for Transport of Motility Proteins into Cilia/Flagella

   Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is a conserved mechanism responsible for the assembly and maintenance of cilia/flagella, involving more than 20 IFT proteins. However, the functions of individual IFT proteins are not well understood. This study focused on TTC26/DY13, a putative IFT protein. Using live imaging and biochemical approaches, TTC26/D13 was found to be an IFT B protein in mammalian cells and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Knockdown of TTC26/D13 in zebraf embryos or mutation of TTC26/D13 in C reinhardt resulted in short cilia with abnormal motility. Surprisingly, IFT assembly and speed were normal in dy13 mutant flagella, unlike other IFT B mutants. Proteomic and biochemical analyses indicated a set of proteins involved in motility were depleted in dy13 mutant.
Lymphatic Endothelial Cells Promote Melanoma Metastasis and Invasion via MMP-14-Dependent Notch and β1-Integrin Activation
    Lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastasis are associated with poor clinical outcomes in melanoma, but the mechanisms of lymphatic dissemination to distant metastasis are not fully understood. This study investigated the role of lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) in melanoma metastasis. Human WM852 melanoma cells were co-cultured with LEC in 3D, resulting in increased distant metastasis in mice. To elucidate the mechanisms, LEC were co-cultured with melanoma cells from primary tumors or metastases. Notably, expansively growing metastatic melanoma cells adopted an invasive sprouting phenotype in 3D matrix, dependent on MMP-14, Notch, and β-integrin. Unexpectedly, MMP-14 was necessary for LEC-induced Notch activation and β-integr activation. Moreover, MMP-14 and Notch were required for L-mediated metastasis zebraf xenografts. This study reveals a mechanism by which LEC promotes melanoma metastasis by inducing a switch from 3D growth to invasive sprouting phenotype.
Title: MicroRNA-9 Controls Dendritic Development by Targeting REST
    MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are conserved, non-coding RNAs that function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. MicroRNA-9 (miR-9) is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the brain. Although the function of mi-9 has been well-characterized in neural progenitors, its role in dendritic and synaptic development remains largely unknown. To target mi-9 in vivo, a transgenic mi sponge mouse line was developed, allowing conditional inactivation of mi-9 in spatio-temporally controlled. Using this approach, mi-9 was found to control dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. Furthermore, mi- mediated downregulation of transcription repressor REST was shown to be essential for proper dendritic growth.
The study investigated the neural basis of social engagement difficulties in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and eye-tracking data from a large sample of toddlers with ASD and non-ASD comparison groups. The results showed that individuals with ASD had reduced functional connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and visual attention networks compared to non-ASD controls. Furthermore, a subgroup of ASD individuals with pronounced social-visual difficulties (Geo ASD) exhibited marked hypoconnectivity between the DM and occipitotemporal cortex (OTC). This reduced DM-OTC hypoconnectivity was associated with increased severity of social-communication difficulties in Geo ASD only. The findings suggest that pronounced social-visual circuit hypoconnectivity is a key neurobiological feature of Geo ASD and may be critical for future social-communic development and treatment targets for early intervention in these individuals.
In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the hematopoietic system is responsible for producing blood cells necessary for larval homeostasis. Two types of blood cells, plasmatocytes and crystal cells, are produced in the lymph gland but are not released until pupation. However, both cell types increase in number throughout larval development. While plasmatocytes can proliferate, it was unknown whether crystal cells increase through self-renewal or de novo differentiation. This study reveals that crystal cells in third instar larvae originate from plasocyte transdifferentiation through a Notch-dependent process. This process occurs in sessile clusters and requires the integrity of these structures. The existence of a hematietic tissue relying on structure-dependent signaling for homeostasis creates a new paradigm for addressing questions in Dophila hematies and vertebrate systems.
Biologists have long known that aneuploidy, or the presence of an abnormal number of copies of chromosomes, is linked to various diseases in humans and other organisms. However, it is unclear how cells adapt to the negative effects of aneupidy until new phenotypes evolve. Despite laboratory strains being highly sensitive to anupidy, researchers have found that anupidy is common in wild yeast isolates, where many genes are expressed at lower-than-expected levels. To investigate this phenomenon, scientists created diploid yeast strains with two, three, or four copies of the affected chromosomes and found that dosage compensation occurs in 10-30% of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher constraint in wild populations but show elevated rates of amplification, suggesting that copy-number variation is buffered at these genes. The study also found that anup provides an ecological advantage to strain YPS9 by amplifying a gene that escapes compensation. The research presents a model in which dosage compensation buffers amplification through anup to provide a natural but transient route to rapid phenotypic evolution.
The article describes the discovery of extraocular, rod-like photoreceptors in the flatworm Maritrella crozier that express xenopsin, a recently classified subtype of opsin. Traditionally thought to belong to the G-protein-coupled ciliary opsins, xenins are now understood to have diverged from ciliary opsins in pre-bilater times. The study characterizes xenin in Maritre crozier and finds it expressed in ciliary cells of the larva and extra cells around the brain in adult. These extra cells house hundreds of cilia in an intra-cellular vacu (phasome). Functional assays in human cells show Maritre xenin drives phototransduction primarily coupling to G-protein. The findings highlight similarities between xenin and c and ops reveal a novel op-expressing cell type, like jaw vertebrate rods, encloses ciliary within own membrane.
The study investigated how spatial and temporal cues are integrated in neural progenitor cells to specify neuronal diversity. Drosophila neuroblasts were used as a model system, as they are individually identifiable and have known spatial and temporal factors. The study tested whether spatial and temporal factors act independently or sequentially in neuroblasts. The genomic binding sites of the Hunch temporal factor were identified in two neuroblasts ( NB-5 and NB-4 ) that make different progeny using Targeted Dam. The results showed that Hback targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent model. Moreover, each neuroblast had distinct chromatin domains that correlated with differential H-bound loci in each neuro. The spatial factor Gsbax, expressed in NB- but not, had genomic sites correlated with chrom in NB, but not. The data support a model in which early spatial factors like G establish neuroblast-specific chromatin, leading to neuroblast temporal factor binding and production of different neurons each lineage.
The article presents a study on the mechanism of activation of P2X receptors, a type of ion channel that opens a transmembrane pore in response to extracellular ATP. Recent crystal structures of the receptor in apo and ATP-bound states revealed motions of the extracellular domain following agonist binding, but the mechanism of pore opening remained unclear. To investigate this, the authors used photo-switchable crosslinkers as molecular tweezers to monitor inter-residue distances in the transmembrane domain of P2 receptor during activation. These experimentally derived structural constraints were combined with computational studies to provide high-resolution models of the channel in open and closed states. The results show that the extent of outer pore expansion is significantly reduced compared to the ATP-bound structure. Further, the inner and outer ends of pore-lining helices come closer during opening, likely through a hinge-bending motion. These findings provide insight into the gating of P2 receptors and establish a strategy applicable to other membrane proteins.
Cytokinesis, the physical division of a cell into two daughter cells, is a complex process powered by the constriction of the actomyosin contractile ring. While it has been assumed that all animal cells divide by a similar molecular mechanism, recent evidence suggests that cytoketic regulation in individual cell types has more variation than previously thought. In the four-cell Caenorhabdis elegans embryo, each blastomere has a distinct fate specified by conserved pathways. Using fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute drug treatment, researchers identified cell-type variation in cytoketic requirement for for forminCY-1-dependent filamentous-actin ( F-act ) cytoskeleton In cell P2, cytoketic variation is cell-intrinsically regulated, whereas in cell EMS this variation is cell-exinsically regulated dependent on Src-1 signaling and direct contact with neighbor cell P. Both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms control cytoketic variation in individual types can protect against division failure when contractile ring weakened.
Bacterial flagella play a crucial role in mediating host-microbe interactions through tissue tropism during colonization as well as activating immune responses. The flagellar shaft of some bacteria, including human pathogens, is encased in a membranous sheath of unknown function. It has been hypothesized that the sheath allows these bacteria to evade host responses to immunogenic flagellin subunit. However, this structural feature has remained enigmatic. This study demonstrates that rotation of sheathed flagellum in mutualist Vibrio fischer and pathogen Vibrio cholera promotes release of potent bacteria-derived immunogen lipopolysacchar found in flagellar sheath. This reveals a new role for flagellar sheath in triggering rather than circumventing host responses in squid-vibrio symbiosis. This has implications for study of bacterial with sheathed flagella and raises biophysical questions of sheathedellum function.
The article discusses the phenomenon of catastrophic chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination in plants, which is associated with mitotic errors and cancer, leading to deleterious rearrangements and genetic novelty. The study focuses on the hybridization of Arabidopsis plants expressing different centromere histone H3, resulting in shattered chromosomes formed from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single lard chromosome compartmentalized within a micronucle. The analysis of breakpoint junctions implicates breaks followed by non-homous end joining (NHE) or stalled repair. Furthermore, mutation of NHE factor Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery. Lastly, heritability and stability of rearranged chromosome suggest potential for enduring genomic novelty.
Epstein-Barr Virus Ensures Cell Survival by Modulating Apoptosis at Early and Late After Infection
    Abstract: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a causally linked to several human cancers and expresses viral oncogenes that promote cell growth and inhibit the apoptotic response to uncontrolled proliferation. The EB oncoprotein LMP1 constitutively activates NFκ and is critical for survival of EB-immortalized cells. However, during infection EB induces rapid cell proliferation with low levels of L1 and apoptosis. To define the mechanism of survival in the absence of L/NF early, we used BH profiling to query mitochondrial of apoptosis and defined a transition from uninfected (B-2) to early-infected (M-2) and immortalized (1) cells. This change in cell survival mechanisms is unique to virus-infected and relies on regulation of localization and transcription by the protein. This study defines a role in suppression with implications for lymphagenesis.
Title: Genetic Variation, Environment, and Demography Intersect to Shape Arabidopsis Metabolite Variation Across Europe
    Abstract: Plants produce diverse metabolites to cope with the challenges presented by complex and ever-changing environments. These challenges drive the diversification of specialized metabolites within and between species. However, we just beginning to understand how new alleles controlling metabolite diversity and the geographic distribution these may be by ecological and demographic pressures. Here, measure variation metabolites across population 797 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. show combination geography, environmental, demography, and genetic all influence specific and their distribution. causal loci contain independently generated patterns suggesting within-species. This provides perspective complexity selective mechanisms shape generation distribution variation local.
Apoptotic caspases have traditionally been viewed as tumor suppressors due to their role in programmed cell death, but recent studies suggest they can also promote tumor growth under certain conditions. In Drosila, a well-studied neoplastic model, oncogenic mutations in the proto-oncogene RasV maintain tumorous cells in an undead-like state and convert caspases from suppressors to promotors. Activated casases generate intra- and extracellular reactive oxygen species ROS, recruiting macrophage-like cells that signal back to tumorous epithelial cells to activate oncogenic JNK signaling. JNK amplifies casase activity, creating a feedback loop. Interfering with this loop reduces neoplastic behavior and improves survival.
Title: Perception of Social Interactions Compresses Subjective Duration in Oxytocin-Dependent Manner
    Abstract 
    Communication is a fundamental aspect of daily life, and the perception of messages conveyed through body language reflects an individual’s social competency. This study reveals that social competency is reflected in the subjective duration of social interactions, with agents acting communicatively perceived as shorter than those acting non-communicatively. The strength of this effect is inversely correlated with autistic-like tendencies. Critically, intranasal oxytocin administration restored the temporal effect in less socially proficient individuals, whereas atosiban, an oxytocin antagonist, diminished the effect in socially proficient individuals. These findings indicate time is not a faithful representation of physical duration, but rather idiosyncratic and ingrained with personality. They also suggest oxytocin mediates social interaction perception, supporting oxyin’s role in human cognition.
The interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and the human ACE2 cell surface protein is crucial for viral infection. Mutations in the RBD are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that have emerged worldwide. For example, the B.1.1.1 lineage has a mutation N501 in its RBD that enhances binding to ACE2. There are also ACE2 alleles in humans with mutations in the R binding site. This study analyzed the effects of five RBD mutations (K417N, K417, N501, E484, and S477) and two ACE mutations (S19 and K26) on the R/ACE interaction. The effects of individual R mutations and combinations in SARS-CoV Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Gamma (P) variants were examined. Most mutations increased the R/ACE affinity. The exceptions were K417/T, which decreased affinity. The results suggest that N501 and S477 enhance transmission by binding, K/T facilitate escape, and E enhances binding and escape.
Biologists have long understood that genes interact with each other to produce complex phenotypes and modify the effects of mutations during development and disease. These interactions have been used to group genes into functional modules. However, the regulatory relationships between genes, known as epistatic interactions, have been difficult to map on a large scale. To address this challenge, researchers used a combination of RNA interference and single-cell phenotyping to create a genetic map of interactions for 21 phenotypes in Drosophila cells. They developed a method to combine interactions across multiple phenotypes to reveal relationships between genes. This map reconstructed the sequence of protein activities during mitosis and showed that the Ras pathway interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex. This interaction is conserved in human cancer cells. The study presents a powerful approach to reconstructing regulatory networks and provides a resource for understanding the consequences of genetic alterations.
Biologists have long sought to understand the genetic basis of heterosty, a widespread floral adaptation that promotes outbreeding in many plant species. In the Primula primrose, hetery is controlled by the Slocus supergene, which determines the arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between two morphs. However, the identities of the component genes remained unknown. This study identifies the Primula CYP50 gene, a putative brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme, as the locus that determines style dimorphism. CYP50 is present on the short-styled morph haplotype, specifically expressed in short styles, and its loss leads to long styles. The gene arose in the Primulaceae lineage and shows accelerated molecular evolution. The results provide a mechanistic explanation for Prim style dimorphism and shed light on the Sloc as a model for complex supergene.
Title: High-frequency stimulation-induced peptide release synchronizes arcuate kisspeptin neurons and excites GnRH neurons
    Abstract: Kisspept ( Kiss ) and neurokin B ( N ) neurocircuits are essential for pubert development and fertility. Kisspept neurons in the hypothamic arcuate ( ) coexpress Kiss, N, dynorphin and glutamate and are postulated to provide epis, excitatory drive to gonotrop-releasing hormone ( ) neurons, the mechanisms of which are unknown. We characterized the basis for Kiss neuronal activity using optogen, whole electrophys, pharmacology and single RT in mice. High photostimulation Kiss neurons evoked release excit ( ) and inhib ( neurope, which found to synchronize Kiss firing. The-ev activity caused robust of by synaptic mechanism also glutateric to preoptic from Kiss neurons Kiss. We propose Kiss play a of epis secretion through release and amino to coordinate function.
The article discusses the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) in regulating the differentiation of pluripotent cells, which have the ability to develop into any cell type of tissue. BMP is known to maintain pluripotency and promote mesodermal differentiation over neural fates. However, the mechanisms by which BMP controls differentiation are not fully understood. The study found that BMP suppresses differentiation by downregulating Cdh, an event that occurs in early stages of neural and mesermal differentiation. Loss of Cdh is required for differentiation of pluripotent cells and suppression of Cdh activity rescues BMP-imposed block to differentiation. Additionally, BMP acts prior and independently of Cdh to prime plurip cells for mesod differentiation, thus reinforcing block to neural. The study suggests that differentiation depends not only on extrinsic cues but also morphetic events that control receptivity to those cues. BMP is a key plurot signal that feeds into this mechanism.
A novel protein called Cep120 plays a crucial role in regulating the structure and function of centrioles in quiescent cells. Centrioles are the building blocks of the centrosome, a structure that organizes the microtubules and cilia in cells. In quies cells, centri are inherently asymmetric, differing in shape and function, but how this asymmetry is maintained during quies is not well understood. Research has shown that C120 is a protein associated with centri that inhibits the maturation of daughter centri. When C120 is depleted in mouse and human quies cells, centri accumulate peric material, including perentr, C5ap2, and C170. This accumulation leads to increased microtule activity at the centome. As a result, C120 loss causes aberrant trafficking of centri proteins, dispersal of centri satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling. The study suggests that C120 maintains cent homeostasis by inhibiting premature maturation of daughterri and identifies a potential molecular basis for ciliopathies such as Je Asphyating Thoracic Dystrophy and Joub syndrome.
Neuron-glia Signaling in the Developing Retina Mediated by Neurotransmitter Spillo
    Neuronlia play a crucial role in the maturation of neural circuits in the central nervous system (CNS). However, little is known about the pathways that mediate their communication in the developing CNS. This study investigated neuronlia signaling in the retina, where it was found that retinal waves induce calcium transients in Müller glial (MC) cells. During cholinergic waves, MC transients were blocked by muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, whereas glutamateric waves MC transients were inhibited by ionotropic glutamate antagonists. This indicates that the responsiveness of MC changes to match the neurotransmitter used in retinal waves. An optical glutamate sensor was used to show that the decline in MC transients was caused by a reduction in glutamate reaching MC. These studies indicate that neurons and MC exhibit activity during a critical period of retinal maturation enabled by neurotransmitter spillo from retinal synapses.
Title: Microbial Clock Provides Accurate Estimate of Postmortem Interval in a Mouse Model System
    Abstract: Establishing the postmortem interval (PM) is crucial in death investigations, yet current methods are prone to errors and biases. Forensic entomology is widely used to assess PMI, but can be off by days to months. Microbes may offer a novel method to estimate PM that overcomes these limitations. This study demonstrates postmort microbial changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable in a mouse model, allowing PM to be estimated within 3-48 days. Results provide insight into bacterial and fungal ecology within a decomposing system and suggest microbial data can be developed into a tool for PM estimation.
Biologists have long known that bilaterally symmetrical animals, such as humans and flies, share a common set of developmental genes that are expressed in a conserved patterns during embryonic development. The Hox genes, in particular, play a crucial role in defining the anterior-posterior axis of the body. These genes exert their function by interacting with TALE transcription factors, which are also present in some non-bilater phyla. However, the evolution of the Hox-TALE system that provides positional information remains unclear. By studying proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages, researchers found that these networks emerged from an ancestral motif present in Hox and other protein families. The Hox-TALE system experienced additional molecular innovations that differentiated Hox functions along body plans. The study highlights the evolution of homeobox gene families in eukaryotes leading to a major patterning system in Eumazo.
The article presents a study on the use of super-resolution microscopy to investigate the behavior of AMPA receptors (AMPAR) outside and within post-synaptic densities (PSDs) in rat brains. The researchers used fluorescent probes of different sizes to track AMPAR diffusion and found that 90% of AMPs labeled with small probes were confined to nanodomains in PSDs for 15 minutes or longer. In contrast, less than 10% of AMPs labeled with small probes were extrasynaptic and highly mobile. In contrast, 5-10% of AMPs in PSDs and 90-95% extrasynaptic were found with large probes. The study suggests that AMPs enter stable nanodomains in PSD with lifetimes 15 minutes and do not accumulate extrasyn membranes.
Biomedical research article summary: SUMylation of NaV1.2 channels mediates the response to acute hypoxia in central neurons
    neurons respond to acute hypoxia by increasing voltage-gated sodium current (IN). However, the underlying mechanism has been unknown. This study reveals that hypox activates the Small Ubitin-like Modifier (SUM) pathway in rat cerebellar granule neurons (CG) and SUMylation of Na1.2 channels increases IN. The time-course of SUMylation of Na1.2 channels at the surface and IN coincide and are prevented by mutation of Na.2-Lys or application of deSUMylating enzyme. Within 40 seconds, hypox-induced linkage of SUM1 to channels is complete, shifting the voltage-dependence of activation so that depolarizing steps evoke larger sodium currents. Given the role of IN in hypoxic brain damage, the SUM and Na.2 are identified as potential targets for neuroprotective interventions.
The article explores the relationship between temperature and the transmission of Ross River virus, a mosquito-borne pathogen found in Australia and the Pacific Islands with potential for global emergence. A mechanistic model was developed to understand the thermal response of the virus. The results show that transmission peaks at moderate temperatures of 26.4°C and declines to zero at thermal limits of 17.0 and 31.5°C. The model predicts year-round transmission in the tropics and seasonal in temperate regions resulting in a seasonal peak in human cases. Climate change is expected to increase transmission in temperate areas where most Australians live but decrease in tropical areas where temperatures are near the thermal optimum. The study highlights the importance of nonlinear models in understanding temperature’s role in disease dynamics and predicting responses to climate change.
**Summary of Article: Beta Oscillations in Motor Cortex Reflect Neural Signals that Delay Movement Onset**
TRAF2 is a component of the TNF receptor superfamily signaling complexes and plays a crucial role in the regulation of immune cell homeostasis. Mice deficient in TR2 die at birth, limiting the understanding of its role in adult tissues. The function of the TR2 RING domain is controversial, with some studies suggesting it cannot act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, while others propose it requires sphingosine-1-phosphate, generated by sphingosine kinase 1, to function as an E3 ligase. Keratinocyte-specific deletion of TR2, but not Sk1 deficiency, disrupts TNF-mediated NF-κ and MAPK signaling, leading to epidermal hyperplasia and psoriatic skin inflammation. This inflammation is driven by TNF, non-canonical NF-κ, and adaptive immune responses, representing a clinically relevant model of psoriasis. TR2 has tissue-specific functions that do not overlap with Sk.
Summary: 
    Synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis elicited by potent stimulation is rapidly compensated by endocytosis of SV membranes leading to the formation of large endocytic vacuoles, known as bulk endosomes. These vacuoles disappear as new SVs reappear. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this process, synapses from dynamin 1 and 3 double-knockout mice were used, where clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is impaired. Surprisingly, massive endosome formation was not defective but rather enhanced in the absence of dynamin 1 and 3. The conversion of endosomes to SV was not accompanied by clathrin-coated buds on their surface and proceeded even after clrin knockdown, suggesting independence from clrin. These findings support the existence of a pathway for SV reformation that bypasses the requirement for clrin and dynamin 1/3 and operates during intense activity.
The study aimed to identify and validate circulating biomarkers of glucocorticoid action in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency. A randomized, single-blind crossover trial was conducted in 10 patients with primary adrenal insufficiency and no other endocrinopathies, who were admitted to an in-patient clinic and studied during physiological glucortic exposure and withdrawal. A randomization occurred before the first intervention. No serious adverse events were observed, besides mild physical and mental fatigue and salt craving. Transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue, plasma miRNA, and serum metabolomics were compared between interventions using multiomic analysis. A transcriptomic profile from both tissues and multiomic cluster were predictive of glucortic exposure. MicroRNA miR-122-5 correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by glucortic exposure was identified ( p = 0.009 ) and replicated in studies with varying glucortic exposure ( 0.01 ≤ p ≤ 0.05 ). The study generated results provide basis for discovery of biomarkers to measure glucortic effects, allowing individualization and optimization of glucortic therapy, and insight into disease etiology of unphysiological glucortic exposure, such as cardiovascular disease and obesity.
Amino acids are essential activators of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) via a complex containing Rag GTPases, Ragulator, and vacuolar ATPase. The sensing of amino acids triggers the translocation of mTOR1 to lysosomes, an obligate step for activation. To examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of this translocation, we used live imaging of the mTOR component Raptor and a cell-permeable fluorescent analogue leucine methyl ester. Translocation to lysosomes is a transient event, occurring within 2 minutes of amino acid addition and peaking at 5 minutes. It is temporally coupled with leucine appearance in lysosomes and is sustained compared to amino stimulation. Sestrin and vacolar ATP are negative regulators of mTOR activity in our system. Note, phosphorylation of canonical mTOR targets is delayed compared to lysosomal translocation suggesting a dynamic and transient of m from the lysosomal surface targeting its substrates.
The article describes how glycan modification of an antigen can alter its intracellular routing in dendritic cells and promote T cell priming. Dendritic cells take up antigens through C-type lectin receptors that recognize glycan structures. In this study, Ovalbumin ( OVA ) was modified with the glycan structure Lewis X ( Le ), which directed OVA to the C lectin receptor M1 ( M1. This modification favored Th1 skewing of CD4 T cells and enhanced cross-priming of CD8 T cells. In contrast, cross-presentation of native OVA required high antigen doses and TLR stimuli, but Le modification reduced the required amount 100-fold and eliminated its dependence on TLR signaling. The OVA-LeX-induced enhancement of T cross-priming was M1-dependent, as shown by reduced CD8 effector T frequencies in M1-deficient mice. Moreover, M1-mediated cross-presentation of O-Le did not require TAP transporters or Cathepsin-S and was observed after prolonged intracellular storage in Rab11+AMP+ compartments. The study concludes that controlled glycosylation of antigens can significantly influence intracellular routing of antigens and the strength of immune responses, and should be considered for optimizing vaccination strategies.
The article describes the role of type VI secretion system (T6S) in Burkholderia thailandensis, a bacterium that uses acyl-homine lactone-mediated quorum sensing to regulate hundreds of genes. The study reveals that T6 is activated by quorum sensing in B. thailandensis and is required to constrain the proliferation of qu-sensing mutants in cocultures of a BR quorum sensing receptor mutant and its parent. However, the BR mutant is not constrained and outcompetes its parent in broth culture due to lack of cell contact and metabolic cost associated with qu sensing activation. The fitness of the wild type over BR mutant during agar growth is dependent on intact TSS1 apparatus. Quorum sensing activates B thailand TSS1 inhibition, which serves to police and constrain quensing mutants. This defines a novel role for TSS in intraspecies control.
The study investigated the role of glutamatergic drive along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus in the emergence of prefrontal oscillations in neonatal mice. The research focused on the long-range coupling between prefrontal-hippocampal networks and their contribution to cognitive performance early in life. Discontinuous hippocampal theta bursts have been proposed to drive the generation of neonatal prefrontal oscillations, but the cellular substrate of these interactions remained unclear. The study used optogenetic manipulation of glutamateric neurons in the CA1 area of dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus in neonatal to elucidate their contribution to prefront oscillatory entrainment. The results showed that despite stronger theta and ripples in the dorsal hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex was mainly coupled with intermediate/ventral hippocampus through phase-locking of neuronal firing via direct axonal projections. Theta-band activation of pyramidal neurons in intermediate/vent but not dorsal CA1 transfected by utero with high-efficiency channelodopsin boosted prefront oscillations. The findings causally elucidated the cellular origin of long-range coupling in the developing brain.
The article describes the dynamic post-translational modification of RNA polymerase II (RNAPI) in mammalian cells, focusing on the methylation of lysine residues in the C-terminal domain ( CTD) of the largest subunit. The CTD is composed of heptapeptide repeats with a consensus sequence Y-S-P-T-S-P-S-P-S, and is extensively phosphorylated on serine residues at Ser-5 and Ser-7, which mark transcription initiation and elongation, respectively. In vertebrates, the CTD has a non-canonical substitution of Ser-7 to Lys-7, which can be acetylated (Kac). This study reveals mono- and di-methylation of Cys-7 residues (Kme1 and K2), which occur early in transcription and precede or accompany Ser-5 and Ser-7 phosphorylation. In contrast, Kac is associated with RNAPI elongation and Ser-2 phosphorylation and mRNA expression. An unexpected balance between RNAPI K methylation and acetylation is observed at promoters, fine-tuning gene expression.
Biomedical Summary: Post-transcriptional Regulation of Satellite Cell Quies by TTP-Mediated mRNA Decay
    Skeletal muscle satellite cells reside in a quiescent state until muscle injury, at which point they exit quiescence, proliferate to repair tissue, and self-renew to replenish the satellite population. To understand the mechanisms maintaining satellite quies, researchers identified transcripts differentially expressed during cell activation following injury. Transcripts encoding RNA binding proteins were most changed, including the decay factor Tristrol. Trrol promotes decay of MyD mRNA, encoding transcriptional regulator myogenic via binding to MyD 3′ untranslated region. Upon cell activation p38/β MAPK phosphorylates MAPAP and inactivates Tr, stabilizing MyD. Satellite specific knockdown of Trpreciously activates cells in vivo, My accumulation and differentiation into myofers. Regulation mRN by Tr appears as one critical post-transcription mechanism controlling satellite homeasis.
The article reports on a study investigating the role of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in regulating macrophage function during infancy and its impact on the development of colitis in mice lacking the IL-10 receptor (ILR). IL-10 is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and preventing excessive inflammation. Infants with defects in IL-10R develop early-onset inflammatory bowel disease. The study aimed to determine whether IL-10 regulates macrophage function during infancy and if macrophage-intrinsic IL-10 signaling is required to prevent colitis in infancy. The results show that IL-10 deficient mice do not exhibit colitis during the first two weeks of life but develop intestinal inflammation and macrophage dysfunction during the third week of life, coinciding with weaning and diversification of intestinal microbiota. IL-10 did not directly regulate microbial ecology during infancy. Macrophage depletion with clodron inhibited colitis development, while absence of IL-10 on macrophages sensitized mice to colitis. These findings indicate that IL-10 mediated macroage regulation during postnatal period is indispensable for preventing murine colitis.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, piRNAs play a crucial role in regulating transposons and germline genes. The mutator complex is responsible for synthesizing high levels of siRNAs through the activity of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, but the steps between mRNA recognition by the pi pathway and siRNA amplification by the mut complex are unknown. This study identifies the Tudor domain protein SIM-1 as acting downstream of pi production and upstream of mutator-dependent siRNA biogenesis. SIM-1 localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P-granules and Mutator foci, two separate condensates that are sites of pi-dependent mRNA recognition and mut siRNA amplification, respectively. This suggests a role for perinuclear condens in organizing the pi pathway and promoting regulation by the mut complex.
The article reports the discovery of bistability in Purkin neurons in unanesthetized larval zebraf (Danio rerio) using intracellular recordings. Purkin neurons are central to cerebellar function and exhibit bistability when recorded in vitro or in vivo under anesthesia. However, the existence of bistability in vivo in awake animals has been disputed. The study demonstrates bistability in Purkin neurons in awake animals by recording intracellularly from Purkin neurons in unanhetized larval zraf. Tonic firing was observed in depolarized regimes and bursting at hyperpolar membrane potentials. Purkin neurons could switch between states spontaneously or with current injection. GABA or NMDA receptors were not required for bursting, but activation of AMP receptors by climbing fibers (CFs) was sufficient to trigger bursts. Further, recording Purkin membrane potential intracellular and motor spikes extracellular showed initiation of motor spiking correlated with increased CFs and depolarization. Developmentally bistability was observed after Purkin specification and persisted until late larval stages.
The article discusses the principles of self-organization and adaptation of the actin cytoskeleton during clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process by which cells internalize molecules and particles through the formation of endocytic pits. The study reveals that the actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in generating the force required for internalization by assembling into a branched network that shapes the cellular membrane. An experimentally constrained model demonstrates that a minimal branched actin network is sufficient to internalize endocytic pits against membrane tension. The results show that around 200 Arp2/3 complexes are required for robust internalization, and a newly developed molecule-counting method determined that approximately 200 Ar2/3 complexes assemble at sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells. Simulations predict that actin self-organizes into a radial branched array with growing ends oriented toward the base of the pit, with actin filaments bending between the coat and the base of the pit. Cryo-electron tomography confirms the presence of elastic energy stored in bent filaments, which contributes to endocytic internalization. Elevated membrane tension directs growing filaments toward the base of the pit, increasing actin nucleation and bending for force production. The study concludes that spatially constrained actin assembly utilizes an adaptive mechanism for endocytosis under varying physical constraints.
The article discusses the mechanism of macropinocytosis, a cellular process by which cells internalize extracellular liquid into large vesicles. Macropocytic cups are formed through the development of a ring of protrusive actin beneath the plasma membrane. In Dictyostelium, macropocytic cups are organized around patches of intense PIP3, active Ras, and active Rac signaling molecules. These patches are associated with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery, similar to other P3-based structures such as phagocytic cups and basal waves. The formation of these patches does not depend on the F-actin ring and becomes enlarged when RasGAP1 is mutated, indicating Ras plays an instructive role. Macropocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones. It is proposed that cup-shaped plasma membrane structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP, which recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery.
Biologists have long understood that the cohesin complex plays a crucial role in holding sister chromatids together until their separation during anaphase. However, the process of cohes loading onto DNA and its localization across the genome was not well understood. A complex called S2IP/S2/S4M2 ( S2/4 ) is responsible for loading cohes onto DNA and determining its localization. Proper cohes loading is essential for cell division, and defects can lead to chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcription, resulting in developmental defects in multicellular organisms. To better understand this process, researchers studied the interaction between S2 and S4. They found that S4 has a TPR ( tetratricopeptide repeat ) array that envelops an extended S2 peptide. Using yeast, they demonstrated that a conserved patch on S4 surface is required to recruit S2 to centromeres and pericentromeres. These findings reveal the role of S4 in determining cohes localization and provide a basis for S2 recruitment to centromeres.
The study investigated the effects of birth seasonality on growth, fattening, torpor use, winter survival, and fecundity in juvenile garden dormice (Eliomys quercinus). The results showed that late-born (LB) juveniles grew and gained mass twice as fast as early-born (EB) individuals during the first weeks of growth. However, tor use was low during growth but increased during pre-hibernation fattening. In contrast, LB individuals showed higher tor use, reached similar body sizes but lower fat content than EB before hibernation. During hibernation, LB showed similar patterns but higher proportion of breeders the following year than EB dormice. These findings suggest tor is incompatible with growth but promotes fattening and consolidates preibern fat deposits. In dormice, being late in the season is associated with a life history.
The article describes a study on the role of ADAR (Adenosine-to-Inosine RNA editing enzyme) in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and its impact on chemotaxis, the ability to move towards or away from a stimulus. C. elegans has two ADAR enzymes, ADR-1 and ADR-2, but only ADR-2 is responsible for adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing. The study used SAIL software to identify 736 A-to-I editing events in the neural transcriptome of C. elegans and found that one mRNA, cle-41, is edited by ADR-2 and its expression is dependent on ADR-2. Restoring cle-41 expression in ADR-2 deficient cells rescued the chemotaxis defect, indicating that altered expression of cle-41 is responsible for the chemotaxis defect in ADR mutants. This is the first evidence that phenotypes of AD mutants can be caused by altered gene expression.
Influenza A virus (IAV) employs a strategy called host shutoff to repress cellular mRNA translation while allowing efficient translation of viral mRNAs. To elucidate the mechanisms of IAV-induced shutoff, the authors used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling. They found that viral mRNAs are preferentially translated while cellular protein synthesis is reduced due to viral takeover of the mRNA pool. The study also revealed variability in levels of cellular transcript reduction, with short mRNAs being less affected by IAV. mRNAs refractory to IAV are enriched in maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Continuous oxidative phosphorylation is important for viral propagation. The study advances understanding of IAV shutoff and suggests a mechanism facilitating translation of housekeeping genes.
Title: Feedback regulation of cyton-mediated transport shapes tissue-specific FGF morphogen gradient
    Abstract: Gradients of signaling proteins are crucial for inducing tissue morphogenesis. However, mechanisms of gradient formation remain controversial. This study characterizes the distribution of fluorescent-tagged signaling proteins, FGF and FGFR, expressed at physiological levels from genomic knock-in alleles in Drosophila. FGF is produced in the larval wing imaginal disc and moves to the air-achorium ( ASP ) through FG-containing cyton that extend from ASP to contact the wing disc. The number of F-receiving cyton by ASP cells decreases with increasing distance from the source, generating a tissue-specific F gradient. As morphogen in ASP, F activates concentration-dependent gene expression of pointed-P at higher and at lower levels. The transcription factors Pointed-P and Cut antagonize each other and differentially regulating FG-containing cyton, creating regions with higher-lower F-receiving cyton. These results reveal a mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific contours through feedback of cyton-mediated transport.
The α/β Coiled Structure: A Novel Protein Fold Formed by Insertion of Two Residues into a Parallel Trimer α-Helical Coiled Coil
    The α-helical coils are the most well-understood protein fold, with their backbone structure uniquely described by parametric equations. This level of understanding has enabled manipulation in unprecedented detail. Despite their ubiquity, α-helical coils are not a source of surprises, as the formation of a new type of fiber by simple insertion of two or six residues into the heptad repeat of a parallel trimer α-helical coil is reported. The insertions strain the coil to breaking point, causing local formation of β-strands which alter the path of the chain by 120 around the trimer axis. The result is α/β coil, retaining one backbone bond per unit from parent αel coil. This novel structure is possible within Ramachand space with minor mutations to known fold.
Eps is an evolutionarily conserved endocytic clrin adaptor that plays a critical role in clath coat dynamics. To investigate its function, embryonic fibroblasts were generated from conditional KO mice. Triple KO cells exhibited a cell division defect and impaired clrin-mediated endocytosis, with accumulation of early U-shaped pits. This correlated with disruption of the coupling between the clath coat and actin cytoskeleton, confirmed in a cell-free endytosis assay. The results indicate a conserved function of eps, in addition to other roles, is to interact with SNAREs and generate force for clath-coated pit invagination and fission.
A case-control study was conducted in Uganda to investigate the risk factors for asthma among children aged 5-17 years. The study included 555 cases and 111 controls, with asthma diagnosis confirmed by clinicians. The main risk factors for asthma were: higher education level of fathers (adjusted OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.71-3.16) and mothers (1.85, 1.38-2.48); area of birth, with children born in small towns or cities having increased risk compared to those born in rural areas (2.16,1.60-2.92) and (2.79,1.79-4.35); father’s and mother’s history of asthma; children’s allergies; atopy; and cooking with gas/electricity.
Biologists have long sought to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the formation of patterns in zebraf ( Danio rerio ), a small freshwater fish known for its striking striped appearance. Recent research has shed light on the role of gap junctions composed of connexins 41.8 ( C41.8 ) and 39.4 (39.4 ) in this process. Gap junctions are channels that allow direct cell-to-cell communication and are crucial for various biological processes, including pattern formation. In zraf, three types of pigment cells melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores interact to create the characteristic stripes. However, the nature of these interactions was poorly understood until now. Mutations in the gene leopard ( leo ), which encodes connex 41.8 ( C41.8 ), a gap junction subunit, led to spotted patterns in zraf. A new allele, leot3, caused a complete loss of pattern, indicating a dominant negative effect on another gap junction component. A genetic screen identified this component as connex 39.4 (39.4 ). Loss-of-function alleles showed that 39.4 is necessary for stripe formation in zraf, but fins were not affected. Double mutants and chimeras demonstrated that leo and 39.4 are required in melanoph and xanthores but not iridoph, suggesting they form heteromeric gap junctions. The phenotypes indicate these promote homotyp interactions between melanoph and xanthores, instructing patterning iridoph.
The article discusses the evolution of olfactory receptors in insects and their role in detecting behaviorally relevant odor molecules. Insects use olfactory receptors (OR), ionotropic receptors (IR), and gustatory receptors (GR) to detect volatile molecules. ORs are expressed in olfactory organs across Protostomia, while IRs are found in other animal phyla. ORs have been hypothesized to be an adaptation to terrestrial lifestyle. However, this study investigates the olfactory system of three insects: Lepachilis signata (Archaeognatha), Thermobia domestica (Zygentoma), and Phyllium sifolium (Phmatodea). The results show that Lepach lacks OR and Orco, while Thermobia has three Orco candidates, and Phyll has a fully developed OR/Or system. The study suggests that OR did not arise as an adaptation to terrestrial lifestyle but evolved later in insect evolution, with Orco present before ORs.
The article discusses the potential for herd protection against Plasmodium falciparum infections through mass antimal drug administrations (MDA) in the context of global malaria elimination efforts. Malaria burden has decreased over the past decade, but asymptomatic infections pose a significant challenge to elimination efforts, as they often go undiagnosed and untreated. MDAs have been proposed as a solution, contingent on adequate population participation. This study presents a spatial and temporal analysis of malaria episodes and asymptomatic infections in four villages undergoing MD in Myanmar. The results show that individuals from neighborhoods with low MD adherence had 2.85 times the odds of having a malaria episode post-MD compared to those from high adherence neighborhoods, regardless of individual participation, suggesting a herd effect. High mosquito rates, living in a house with someone with malaria, or having asymptomatic infection were also predictors of clinical episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence to MD, even in villages with overall high participation, may hinder elimination efforts.
The study investigated the conservation of transcription factor (TF) binding specificities across 600 million years of bilateria evolution by analyzing the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila TFs and comparing them to human and mouse data. The analysis revealed that TF specificities are highly conserved between Drosila and mammals, with orthologous TFs showing similarity even at the level of subtle dinucleotide binding preferences. This suggests that TF specificities have been conserved over long evolutionary time scales. The study also found that human TFs with divergent specificities in cell types are not found in fruit flies, indicating that evolution of specificities contributes to emergence of novel cell types.
The article presents a novel approach to recapitulating human cardio-pulmonary development using multilineage differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The study focuses on the critical interaction between the developing heart and lung during embryogenesis, which is essential for their proper morphogenesis and maturation. However, there is a lack of models that investigate the cardio-pulmonary interaction during human embryogenesis. To address this, the authors developed a stepwise strategy to direct the simultaneous induction of mesoderm-derived cardiac and enderm-derived lung epithelial lineages within a single hiPSC differentiation via specific tuning of WNT and Nodal signaling in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Using 3D culture, they established concentric cardio-pulmonary micro-tissues (μTs) and expedited alveolar maturation in the presence of cardiac accompaniment. Upon withdrawal of W agonist, the cardiac and pulmonary within dual-line μ effectively segregated from each other with initiation of cardiac contraction. This multiline differentiation model is expected to provide an experimentally tractable system for investigating cardio-p interaction and tissue formation during embryogenesis.
**Summary of Adaptive Tuning of Mutation Rates Allows Fast Response to Stress in Escherichia coli**

   In a study on the bacterium Escherichia coli, researchers have found that the rate of genetic mutations can change rapidly in response to environmental stress. This contrasts with the traditional view that mutation rates are strictly regulated and evolve slowly. When exposed to high levels of ethanol, Escheria coli cultures undergo hypermutation, a state of increased mutation rate. However, this state is transitory and is followed by a decrease in mutation rate once the cells adapt to the stress. The rate of mutation increases when cells are under stress and decreases once they are adapted. The driving force behind this rapid change in mutation rate is found to be cell mortality. The study shows how organisms can balance robustness and evolvability, the ability to adapt to stress and evolve, and explains the prevalence of hypermutation in various settings such as antibiotic resistance in microbes and cancer relapse upon chemotherapy.
The article discusses the role of the SnRK/Sn1 kinases in mediating the low-energy response in plants, specifically in Arabidopsis thaliana. These kinases are known to regulate metabolic responses to changing environmental conditions by modulating enzyme activity and transcription. While their effect on enzyme activity is well understood, their impact on transcriptional regulation is less clear, particularly in plants. The study identifies the transcription factor bZIP63 as a key regulator of starvation response and direct target of the Sn1 kinase. Phosphorylation of bZIP by Sn1 alters its dimerization, affecting gene expression and primary metabolism. A b63 knock-out mutant exhibits starvation-related phenotypes, complemented by wild-type b63 but not by mutated version with point in Sn1 target sites.
The article describes the discovery of a novel protein called Ring finger 10 (RNF10) that acts as a synaptonuclear messenger in the hippocampus. NF10 is activated by calcium signals at the postsynaptic compartment and triggers changes at the transcriptional level. NF is enriched at excitatory synapses where it associates with the Glu2 subunit of NMDA receptors ( NMDARs. The activation of Glu2-containing NMDAR and long-term potentiation (LTP) leads to the translocation of NF from dendritic segments and dendritic spines to the nucleus. The study provides evidence for import-dependent long-distance transport from syn-to-dendritic compartments to the nucleus. NF silencing prevents the maintenance of LTP as well as LTP-dependent modifications of dendritic spines.
The article discusses the structural basis for the recognition and remodeling of the TBP:DNA:NC complex by Mot1, a subunit of the Swi/Snf ATPases family of chromatin remodelers. Swi/Snfases are involved in various DNA-associated processes, including nucleosome and transcription complex remodeling, but the structural details of ATP-dependent reactions are not well understood. Mot1 is a single subunit remodeler that dissociates TATA-binding protein (TBP):DNA complexes, making it a useful system to study Swi/Snfase mechanisms. The study presents the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP, DNA, and transcription regulator cofactor 2 (NC). The results show that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC interactions and unbends DNA compared to TBP:DNA:NC, suggesting Mot primes TBP:NC displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data indicate the Swi/Snf domain of Mot associates with upstream DNA and histone of NC, similar to nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a structural framework for Swi/Sase interaction with DNA:protein complex.
Title: Tern and Synthetic Variants Kill Cancer Cells by Targeting the Elongation Factor-1 Ternary Complex
    Abstract
    Cyclic peptides have evolved to target diverse proteins controlling cellular processes. Tern, a cytotoxic natural product with unknown mode of action, was used to design synthetic variants. The new variants are cytotoxic to cancer cells, up 500-fold more potent than Tern itself. Using a Tern affinity probe, the elongation factor-1 ternary complex ( e1·G·aminoacy-tRNA ) was identified as a target and shown to bind by unrelated products demin and cyrien. Mutations in domain III of e1 prevent Tern binding and confer resistance to cyt effects, implicating the hydrophobic surface as a functional for e1 modulation. We conclude the elongation factor-1 and ternary with G and amino-tRNA are common targets for cyt natural products.
The article discusses the role of OCRL (inositol 5-phosphatase) in clathrin-coated pit dynamics and its relation to Lowe syndrome. Mutations in the OCRL gene cause Lowe syndrome and Dent disease. Although OCRL is a clathrin interactor that is recruited to late-stage clath-coated pits, previous studies have attributed clinical manifestations to intracellular sorting defects. This study reveals that OCRL loss in Lowe syndrome fibroblasts impacts clath-mediated endocytosis and results in endocytic defect. Cells exhibit accumulation of clath-coated vesicles and increase in U-shaped cl-coated pits due to sequestration of coat components on-coated vesicles. Endytic vesicles fail to lose their coat and contain numerous actin comets in patient cells. SN9, an adaptor that couples late endytic-coated pits to actin polymerization, binds directly to OCRL and remains with vesicles. These findings indicate OCRL acts as uncoating factor and defects in clrin-mediated endyt likely contribute to pathology in patients with OC mutations.
The article describes a novel regulation mechanism of the Wnt/β-caten signaling pathway in intestinal tumorigenesis. Focal adhesion kinase 2 (FAK) and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) are elevated in adenomas of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mice and human colorectal cancer tissues. These proteins redundantly promote the Wnt/β-caten pathway by phosphorylating glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK) at residue 216. This phosphorylation reinforces β-caten accumulation and intestinal tumenesis. Wnt-induced β-caten accumulation requires W-induced GSK/TC interaction. The study reveals that GSK phosphorylation at residue 216 is a determinant of G recruitment to TC. Pharmacological inhibition of F/PK2 suppresses adenoma formation in APC mice with reduced levels of phospho-G and βaten. The F/P axis is critical for W activation in APC intestinal tumenesis.
The study investigated the neural control of transitions between posture and movement by examining the regulation of vestibular stabilizing mechanisms during quiet standing and locomotion. The theory suggests that optimal transitions require disengagement of one motor control before implementation of another. To test this, healthy subjects initiated and terminated locomotion by shifting their weight between feet while exposed to vestibular stimuli. The relationship between vestibular stimuli and ground forces was quantified using time-frequency analysis. Discontinuities in coherence were observed before movement onset and during locomotion termination. These results indicate that vestibular balance mechanisms transition between motor states, supporting a change in motor control as predicted by optimal theory.
The article discusses the role of the transcription factor Rpa in regulating circadian rhythms in cyanobacteria. Rpa is the master regulator of circadian transcription, driving genome-wide oscillations in mRNA abundance. In constant light conditions, deletion of rpa has no effect on cell viability. However, in light-dark cycling conditions, rpa- cells are inviable. To understand this defect, the mechanisms were investigated and it was found that rpa cells cannot maintain energy status at night, do not accumulate carbon stores during day, and are defective in transcription of genes for carbohydrate utilization at night.
The article discusses the structure and ion-release mechanism of P-4-type ATPases, a subclass of heavy-metal transporting ATPases that play a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and detoxification by transporting heavy metals across cell membranes. Despite their importance, the structure of P-4-ATPases remains elusive due to a lack of available information. This study presents the structure and functional analysis of an archetypal P-4-ATPase, CoT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS-1, providing new insights into the mechanism and diversity of heavy-metal transporters. The structure reveals the absence of classical heavy-metal binding domains (HMDs) and a novel features of P-ATPases, including a dual role in heavy-metal release and internalization of an invariant histidine. Additionally, the study shows that P-ATP turnover is independent of potassium, differing from other P-type ATPases. These findings open up new avenues for drug discovery as P-4-ATPases are virulence factors in many pathogens.
The study identifies a chromatin signature that distinguishes genes subject to mitotically stable allelic expression (MA) in human cells. This signature is characterized by the simultaneous presence of chromatin marks associated with active (H3K36me) and silencing (H3me) in the gene body. The MA signature is found in approximately 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types. Notably, it is enriched among developmental genes with bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. The results provide a new approach to study MA that is independent of polymorphisms and suggest MA is linked to cell differentiation.
The article discusses the role of coiled-coil domains in regulating the activity of the AAA+ chaper Clp, a protein complex essential for bacterial virulence and stress resistance. Clp forms a complex with the peptidase Clp and exerts ATP-fue substrate unfolding through a central pore. However, its activity is tightly controlled by the adaptor protein MecA, which activates Clp by targeting substrates and stimulating its ATPase activity. The study reveals that Clp is repressed in its ground state, as shown by Clp cryo-EM structures without MecA. In this state, Clp forms two-helical assemblies via head-to-head contacts between coiled-coil domains (MD). Mec converts this resting state to an active planar ring by binding to MD sites. Loss of Clp repression in MD mutants causes constitutive activation and severe cellular toxicity.
Biologists have long sought to understand how adult stem cells, such as muscle precursors in Drosophila, remain in a dormant state and how they are reactivated. In this study, researchers used a Dophila model to investigate the in vivo behavior of adult muscle precursors ( AMPs ), the fruit fly stem cells responsible for muscle regeneration. The results show that AMPs extend thin filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles, and maintain these connections throughout their dormant state and proliferative phases. This suggests that muscles may play a role in reactivating AMPs. Genetic analysis indicates that muscles secrete Dll6 signals that activate the insulin pathway in nearby AMPs, leading to Notch activation, which regulates AMP proliferation via Myc. The study reveals that Doph AMPs interact with muscle niche and the insulin-Notch-Myc cascade is involved in AMP reactivation.
The article discusses the role of the leak sodium channel NAL in controlling the tonic firing and glycolytic sensitivity of substantia nigra pars reticulata (SN) neurons. The SN is a major output of the basal ganglia and provides tonic inhibition to downstream brain areas through spontaneously active GABAergic neurons. These neurons fire at high rates, which is crucial for their function in brain circuits. The depolarizing leak current supports this pattern, but its molecular basis is poorly understood. To understand how SN neurons maintain activity, single-cell RNA sequencing was used to determine the transcriptome of individual SN neurons. The results show that SN express the sodium channel NAL and SN lacking NAL have impaired firing. In addition, NAL is involved in modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The findings suggest that disruption of NAL could impair basal ganglia circuits, which may underlie severe motor deficits in humans with mutations in NAL. The study highlights the importance of NAL in maintaining tonic activity of SN neurons and its potential role in basal ganglia function.
Title: Highly Parallelized Droplet Cultivation and Prioritization of Antibiotic Producers from Natural Microbial Communities
    Abstract: Antibiotics from culturable microorganisms have saved millions of lives since the 20th century. With the formation of resistance, these compounds become increasingly ineffective, while the majority of microbial with chemical diversity remains inaccessible for exploration. Culturing recalcant bacteria is a stochastic process. Conventional methods are limited to low throughput. By increasing ( ) and sensitivity miniaturization, we innovate microbiological to comply with biological. Here, we introduce a droplet microscale system, coupled to high-throughput for antimicrobial prior isolation. We demonstrate highly parallel inro starting single results the of uncultured and higher than standard plate. Strains inhibit reporter isolated the system A variety compounds detected potent.
Title: A Bayesian Analysis of the Association between Leukotriene A Hydrolase Genotype and Survival in Tuberculous Meningitis

    Tuberculous meningitis is a severe form of tuberculosis that affects the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, and is associated with high mortality rates due to excessive inflammation. The use of adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids has been shown to reduce mortality by 30%, indicating that inflammatory pathophysiology only contributes to a subset of deaths. A study conducted in Vietnam found that the survival benefit of anti-inflammatory corticoids was most pronounced in patients with the C/T promoter variant of the leukotri A hydrolase (TAH) gene, which encodes an enzyme regulating inflammatory eicosoids. Patients with the TT genotype had increased survival, consistent with corticoids benefiting individuals with hyper-inflammatory responses. However, a study in Indonesia did not find an L4H genotype survival benefit. Using Bayesian methods to analyze both studies, it was found that L4 genotype confers survival that begins early and continues long-term in both populations. This benefit is nullified in most cases with high mortality. L4 genotyping with disease severity assessment may target corticoid therapy to patients most benefit.
Biomedical research article summary: Gradient-reading and mechano-effector for netrin-1-induced axon guidance

   Axonal growth cones play a crucial role in the development of the nervous system by navigating to their target destinations in response to guidance cues. However, the mechanism by which they convert local cues into protrusive forces to decide their migratory direction remains unclear. This study investigated the role of the protein Shootin in axon guidance and its interaction with the axon guidance molecule Netrin-1. Mice lacking Shoot1 showed abnormal projection of forebrain commissural axons, similar to the phenotype of Netrin-1 knockout mice. Netrin-1 elicited highly polarized phosphorylation of Shootin within growth cones, which increased its interaction with the cell adhesion molecule L-CAM. This, in turn, promoted F-act–adhesion and concomitant generation of forces for growth cone migration. Spatially regulated Shoot1 phosphorylation within cones was required for ax turning by Netrin-1 gradients. The study defines a mech-effector for Netrin signaling and shows that Shoot1 phosphorylation is a readout for Netrin gradients resulting in directional axon guidance.
Biologists have long been fascinated by the unique humming sound produced by hummingbirds during flight, but the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon have remained poorly understood. A recent study aimed to elucidate the biophysical origin of the hummingbird’s hum by combining acoustic and aerodynamic measurements with an idealized modeling. Six freely hovering Anna’s hummingbirds were studied using a 217-microphone array for acoustic holography and a new aerodynamic platform to measure 3D forces in vivo. The acoustic measurements were corroborated by an integrated model that linked aerodynamic forces with wing kinematics, revealing that the hummingbird’s timbre arises from oscillating lift and drag forces on each wing. A comparative analysis of birds and insects showed that the characteristic timbre and radiated power of flapping wings stem from higher harmonics in aerodynamic forces supporting body weight. The study also found that allometric scaling makes larger birds quieter and elongated flies louder, while clarifying bioacoustic behavior.
Biologists have long debated the relative roles of chance and necessity in the evolution of proteins. To address this question, researchers used a combination of ancestral protein reconstruction and mutagenesis to study the evolution of the B-cell lymphoma 2 ( BCL-2 ) protein family. BCL-2 proteins interact with other proteins to regulate cell survival and death. The team created ancestral versions of BCL-2 proteins and subjected them to mutation and selection to mimic evolution. They found that over long periods of time, chance became the primary cause of sequence variation, while necessity became less important. This was true even when proteins from different species were subjected to the same selective pressures. Many mutations could alter protein specificity at any point in time, but contingency arose from historical changes to these sets of mutations. The results suggest that BCL-2 and other protein sequences are unique products of unpredictable historical events. The study provides insight into how proteins evolve over time.
The article presents a genome-wide haplotype analysis of 48 sub-Saharan African populations to investigate the structure of genetic diversity and gene flow within the region. The study reveals that coastal populations have experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 700 years, while Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo groups share ancestry with Central Africans due to recent expansions. Most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups outside their geographic region due to gene flow within the last 400 years. The analysis provides insight into haplotype sharing across ethno-linguistic groups and movement of alleles into new environments, relevant to genetic epidemiology.
Title: Mitotic Spindle Scaling during Xenopus Development: Role of Kif2 and Importin α
    During early animal development, cells undergo rapid cleavage divisions that lead to a significant decrease in cell size. However, how the mitotic spindle adapts to changing cell dimensions is not well understood. To identify mechanisms that scale the spindle during Xenopus lae embryogenesis, an in vitro system was established using cytoplasmic extracts from embryos that recapitulates in vivo spindle size differences between stage 3 (4 cells, 37µm) and stage 8 (∼400 cells,18m). Kinesinase Kif2 was identified as a driver of spindle scaling, whose microtubule-stabilizing activity is inhibited in stage 3 spindles by transport receptor Importin α, and activated in stage 8 when Import α partitions to membrane. Altering spindle size in developing embryos impaired spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remained robust. Thus, spindle in Xenopus development is coupled to size through rati mechanism controlling microtub destabilization.
Title: Riboswitches Form a Natural Boolean Gate to Control Purine Metabolism in Bacteria
    Abstract: Riboswitches are a type of RNA molecule that can regulate gene expression by binding to specific ligands. In some cases, riboswitches form pairs to act as two-input logic gates. This study found riboswitches for phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( PR ) that exist alone or paired with guanine ribwitches. Guanine-PR ribwitch can bind to ligands separately or together, acting as an IMPLY logic gate to control RNA for purine biosynthesis in bacteria. This discovery supports the idea that ancient RNA systems could control metabolism without proteins.
The release of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles into the synaptic cleft with each action potential determines the reliability of synaptic transmission. The variability of this property contributes to the diversity of synaptic function across brain regions, but the source of this variability is unclear. The prevailing view is that the release of a single vesicle ( unives release, UVR ) or multiple vesicles ( multives release, MVR ) reflects variability in vesicle release probability, which is supported by the calcium-dependence of release. However, this study demonstrates that the number of ves released is regulated by the size of the readily releasable pool upstream of ves release probability. The results point to a model wherein protein kinase and its vesicle target synapsin dynamically control release occupancy to dictate the number of ves released without altering probability. These findings define mechanisms that control MVR and diversity of synaptic signaling.
HIV-1 Gag protein selectively packages unspliced dimeric viral RNA in the presence of excess cytoplasmic RNAs by assembling on the plasma membrane. A minimal system of purified RN, recombinant HIV-1 G and unilamellar vesicles was used to recapitulate the selective packaging of the 5 untranslated region of the HIV-1 genome in the presence of competitor RNA. Mutations in the CA-CT domain of G affected self-assembly and abrogated selectivity. tRNA suppressed G membrane binding when G had bound viral. The ability of HIV-1 G to selectively package its genome and self- on membranes are interdependent.
