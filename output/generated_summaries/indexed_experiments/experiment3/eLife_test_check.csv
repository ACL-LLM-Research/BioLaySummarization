    Title: 
    Abstract: Most nervous systems combine both transmitter-mediated and direct cell–cell communication , known as ‘chemical’ and ‘electrical’ synapses , respectively . Chemical synapses can be identified by their multiple structural components . Electrical synapses are , on the other hand , generally defined by the presence of a ‘gap junction’ ( a cluster of intercellular channels ) between two neuronal processes . However , while gap junctions provide the communicating mechanism , it is unknown whether electrical transmission requires the contribution of additional cellular structures . We investigated this question at identifiable single synaptic contacts on the zebrafish Mauthner cells , at which gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release and where the contact unequivocally defines the anatomical limits of a synapse . Expansion microscopy of these single contacts revealed a detailed map of the incidence and spatial distribution of proteins pertaining to various synaptic structures . Multiple gap junctions of variable size were identified by the presence of their molecular components . Remarkably , most of the synaptic contact’s surface was occupied by interleaving gap junctions and components of adherens junctions , suggesting a close functional association between these two structures . In contrast , glutamate receptors were confined to small peripheral portions of the contact , indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse . Thus , our results revealed the overarching organization of an electrical synapse that operates with not one , but multiple gap junctions , in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions . The relationship between these intercellular structures will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses found throughout animal connectomes and provide insight into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses .

    ","Biologists have long known that nervous systems use both chemical and electrical synapses to communicate between cells. Chemical synapses are identified by their structural components, while electrical synapses are defined by the presence of a gap junction, a cluster of intercellular channels between neuronal processes. However, it is unclear whether electrical transmission requires additional cellular structures beyond the gap junction. To investigate this question, researchers studied single synaptic contacts on zebraf Mauthner cells, where gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release. Using expansion microscopy, they mapped the distribution of proteins at these contacts, revealing multiple gap junctions of varying in size and molecular composition. Notably, most of the synaptic surface was occupied by gap junction and adherens junction components, suggesting a close association between the two structures. In contrast, glutamate receptors were confined to small portions of the contact, indicating most of the area functions as an electrical synapse. The study found that an electrical synapse operates with multiple gap junctions in association with structural and signaling molecules of adherens junction. The relationship between intercellular structures will help establish boundaries of electrical syn found in animal connectomes and provide insight into syn diversity."

    Title: 
    Abstract: The pre-Bötzinger complex ( preBötC ) , a key primary generator of the inspiratory breathing rhythm , contains neurons that project directly to facial nucleus ( 7n ) motoneurons to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity . To further understand the identity of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons , we used a combination of optogenetic viral transgenic approaches to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects mystacial pad activity , with minimal effects on breathing . These effects are altered by the type of anesthetic employed and also between anesthetized and conscious states . The population of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons we transduced consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that also send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved with the regulation of autonomic activity . We show that modulation of subgroups of preBötC neurons , based on their axonal projections , is a useful strategy to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors . This is of fundamental importance , given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors have been associated with the development and progression of diseases .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus ( PBN ) represent aversive information and signal a general alarm to the forebrain . If CGRP neurons serve as a true general alarm , their activation would modulate both passive nad active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat . However , most prior research has focused on the role of CGRP neurons in passive freezing responses , with limited exploration of their involvement in active defensive behaviors . To address this , we examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice . Our electrophysiological results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes . Optogenetic activation of CGRP neurons during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests , presumably by amplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous . In contrast , animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses , even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning . These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system , capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception , and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger .

    Title: 
    Abstract: The relationship between obesity and human brain structure is incompletely understood . Using diffusion-weighted MRI from ∼30 , 000 UK Biobank participants , we test the hypothesis that obesity ( waist-to-hip ratio , WHR ) is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction ( ISOVF ) , an index of free water , and intra-cellular volume fraction ( ICVF ) , an index of neurite density . We observed significant associations with obesity in two coupled but distinct brain systems: a prefrontal/temporal/striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal/occipital/striatal system associated with ICVF . The ISOVF~WHR system colocated with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions , decreased glial density , and high mu opioid ( MOR ) and other neurotransmitter receptor density . Conversely , the ICVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors . To test whether these distinct brain phenotypes might differ in terms of their underlying shared genetics or relationship to maps of the inflammatory marker C-reactive Protein ( CRP ) , we estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF ( rg = 0 . 026 , P = 0 . 36 ) and ICVF ( rg = 0 . 112 , P < 9×10−4 ) as well as comparing correlations between WHR maps and equivalent CRP maps for ISOVF and ICVF ( P<0 . 05 ) . These correlational results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity , whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation .

The researchers tested the hypothesis that waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is associated with regional differences in microstructural metrics: isotropic volume fraction (ISO) and index of free water, and intra-cellular volume (IC) index of neurite density.

The ISO-WHR system co-located with genes for innate functions, decreased glial density, and high opioid (MOR) and other neurotransmitter density. Conversely, the IC-WHR system co-located with genes for G-protein receptors and decreased MOR and other receptors. Genetic correlations were estimated between WHR and ISO (r = 0.026, P = 0.36) and IC (r = 0.112, P < 9×10-4) as well as between WHR maps and equivalent CRP for ISO and IC (P < 0.05).

    Abstract: Cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) to drive metastatic dissemination in experimental cancer models . However , tumour cells undergoing EMT have not been observed disseminating into the tissue surrounding human tumour specimens , leaving the relevance to human cancer uncertain . We have previously identified both EpCAM and CD24 as CSC markers that , alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin , identify EMT CSCs in human oral cancer cell lines . This afforded the opportunity to investigate whether the combination of these three markers can identify disseminating EMT CSCs in actual human tumours . Examining disseminating tumour cells in over 12 , 000 imaging fields from 74 human oral tumours , we see a significant enrichment of EpCAM , CD24 and Vimentin co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour body in metastatic specimens . Through training an artificial neural network , these predict metastasis with high accuracy ( cross-validated accuracy of 87–89% ) . In this study , we have observed single disseminating EMT CSCs in human oral cancer specimens , and these are highly predictive of metastatic disease .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Apoptosis and clearance of apoptotic cells via efferocytosis are evolutionarily conserved processes that drive tissue repair . However , the mechanisms by which recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells regulate repair are not fully understood . Here , we use single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a map of the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds . We find that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells , including resident Lyve1+ macrophages , during inflammation . Interestingly , human diabetic foot wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway genes and display altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor Axl and its ligand Gas6 . During early inflammation in mouse wounds , we detect upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR3-independent mechanisms . Inhibition studies in vivo in mice reveal that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but is dispensable for efferocytosis . By contrast , inhibition of another efferocytosis receptor , Timd4 , in mouse wounds decreases efferocytosis and abrogates wound repair . These data highlight the distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell detection coordinates tissue repair and provides potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients .

    Abstract: Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have provided novel insights into the dynamics of gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues and have enabled the construction of transcriptomic cell atlases . However , linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and positively identifying the cell types that correspond to gene expression clusters in single-cell sequencing data sets remains a challenge . We describe a straightforward genetic barcoding approach that takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools in Drosophila to allow in vivo tagging of defined cell populations . This method , called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing ( TaG-EM ) , involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during single-cell sequencing , labeling a cell population of interest . By creating many such independently barcoded fly strains , TaG-EM enables positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects , identification of multiplet droplets , and barcoding of experimental timepoints , conditions , and replicates . Furthermore , we demonstrate that TaG-EM barcodes can be read out using next-generation sequencing to facilitate population-scale behavioral measurements . Thus , TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens in addition to improving the ability to multiplex and reliably annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Understanding the origins of novel , complex phenotypes is a major goal in evolutionary biology . Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the novel ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times . However , taxon sampling for alkaloids has been biased towards colorful species , without similar attention paid to inconspicuous ones that are often assumed to be undefended . As a result , our understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group is incomplete . Here , we provide new data showing that , in contrast to previous studies , species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids . We confirm that undefended dendrobatids regularly consume mites and ants , which are known sources of alkaloids . Thus , our data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype . Our data support the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration — passive accumulation — that differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation . We discuss the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms . In light of ideas from pharmacokinetics , we incorporate new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and provide insight into the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins .

    ","Title: The Impact of Seedling Root Traits on Plant Establishment in Challenging Environments: A Study on Pearl Millet’s Adaptation to the Sahelian Climate

Abstract
    Pearl millet is a highly drought-tolerant cereal crop that serves as a vital food source in the sub-Saharan region. Its early root system features a fast-growing primary root, which is hypothesized to be an adaptation to the Sahelian climate. Using modeling, we demonstrate that drought is an important constraint in agro systems in the Sahel where pearl was domesticated. We show that increased millet primary root growth is correlated with increased water tolerance in field conditions. A genome-wide association and quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) studies identify genomic regions controlling this root trait. Combining gene expression, re-sequencing and reannotation of these regions, a glutaredin-encoding gene PgXC is identified as a candidate resilience root regulator. Functional characterization of its Arabidopsis homolog AtXY reveals a role in regulating cell elongation. Our study suggests a conserved function for GR genes in root elongation and resilience of millet in the Sahelian environment."

    Abstract: Language is acquired and processed in complex and dynamic naturalistic contexts , involving the simultaneous processing of connected speech , faces , bodies , objects , etc . How words and their associated concepts are encoded in the brain during real-world processing is still unknown . Here , the representational structure of concrete and abstract concepts was investigated during movie watching to address the extent to which brain responses dynamically change depending on visual context . First , across contexts , concrete and abstract concepts are shown to encode different experience-based information in separable sets of brain regions . However , these differences are reduced when multimodal context is considered . Specifically , the response profile of abstract words becomes more concrete-like when these are processed in visual scenes highly related to their meaning . Conversely , when the visual context is unrelated to a given concrete word , the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing . These results suggest that while concepts generally encode habitual experiences , the underlying neurobiological organisation is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Despite exciting developments in cancer immunotherapy , its broad application is limited by the paucity of targetable antigens on the tumor cell surface . As an intrinsic cellular pathway , nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) conceals neoantigens through the destruction of the RNA products from genes harboring truncating mutations . We developed and conducted a high-throughput screen , based on the ratiometric analysis of transcripts , to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells . This screen implicated disruption of kinase SMG1’s phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potential disruptor of NMD . This led us to design a novel SMG1 inhibitor , KVS0001 , that elevates the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo .

    ","Biomedical researchers have made significant progress in developing cancer immunotherapies, but their application is hindered by the limited number of targetable antigens on the surface of tumor cells. A cellular pathway called nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) degrades RNA from genes with truncating mutations, concealing neoantigens from the immune system. To identify mediators of NMD in human cells, a high-throughput screen based on rati analysis of transcripts was conducted. This screen implicated SMG1’s phosphorylation of UPF1 as a disruptor of NMD, leading to the design of a novel SM1 inhibitor, KVS1. KVS1 elevates expression of transcripts and proteins from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo. Notably, K1 concomitantly increases presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I peptides from N-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells. K1 provides opportunities for studying NMD and diseases where N plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Age is the most important risk factor for cancer , but aging rates are heterogeneous across individuals . We explored a new measure of aging-Phenotypic Age ( PhenoAge ) -in the risk prediction of site-specific and overall cancer . Using Cox regression models , we examined the association of Phenotypic Age Acceleration ( PhenoAgeAccel ) with cancer incidence by genetic risk group among 374 , 463 participants from the UK Biobank . We generated PhenoAge using chronological age and nine biomarkers , PhenoAgeAccel after subtracting the effect of chronological age by regression residual , and an incidence-weighted overall cancer polygenic risk score ( CPRS ) based on 20 cancer site-specific polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ) . Compared with biologically younger participants , those older had a significantly higher risk of overall cancer , with hazard ratios ( HRs ) of 1 . 22 ( 95% confidence interval , 1 . 18–1 . 27 ) in men , and 1 . 26 ( 1 . 22–1 . 31 ) in women , respectively . A joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAgeAccel was observed on overall cancer risk , with HRs of 2 . 29 ( 2 . 10–2 . 51 ) for men and 1 . 94 ( 1 . 78–2 . 11 ) for women with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge compared with those with low genetic risk and younger PhenoAge . PhenoAgeAccel was negatively associated with the number of healthy lifestyle factors ( Beta = –1 . 01 in men , p<0 . 001; Beta = –0 . 98 in women , p<0 . 001 ) . Within and across genetic risk groups , older PhenoAge was consistently related to an increased risk of incident cancer with adjustment for chronological age and the aging process could be retarded by adherence to a healthy lifestyle . This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 82230110 , 82125033 , 82388102 to GJ; 82273714 to MZ ) ; and the Excellent Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province ( BK20220100 to MZ ) .

    ","The study investigated the relationship between a new measure of aging, PhenoAge, and cancer risk in a cohort of 374,463 participants from the UK Biobank. Pheno was generated using chronological age and nine biomarkers, and PhenoAcc was calculated by subtracting the effect of chronological age by regression and incidence-weighted overall cancer polygenic risk score (CPRS) based on 20 site-specific polygenic risk scores (PRS). The results showed that older participants had a higher overall cancer risk, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.22 (95% CI 1.18-1.27) in men and 1.26 (1.22-1.31) in women. A joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAcc was observed on overall risk, with HRs of 2.29 (2.10-2.51) for men and 1.94 (1.78-2.11) with high genetic and older Pheno compared to low genetic youngereno. PhenoAcc was negatively associated with healthy lifestyle factors (Beta -0.01 in men, p<0.001; -0.98 women, p<0.001). Within genetic groups, oldereno was related to increased cancer risk, adjusting for chronological age. Adherence to a healthy lifestyle could retard aging."

Species distribution models ( SDMs ) estimate species distribution while accommodating such bias . Here , we investigated the quality of Biome data and its impact on SDM performance . Species identification accuracy exceeds 95% for birds , reptiles , mammals , and amphibians , but seed plants , molluscs , and fishes scored below 90% . Our SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan revealed that incorporating Biome data into traditional survey data improved accuracy . For endangered species , traditional survey data required >2000 records for accurate models ( Boyce index ≥ 0 . 9 ) , while blending the two data sources reduced this to around 300 . The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by Biome data , compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas , may explain this improvement .

    Abstract: Abnormal lung development can cause congenital pulmonary cysts , the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown . Although the cystic lesions are believed to result directly from disrupted airway epithelial cell growth , the extent to which developmental defects in lung mesenchymal cells contribute to abnormal airway epithelial cell growth and subsequent cystic lesions has not been thoroughly examined . In the present study using genetic mouse models , we dissected the roles of bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) receptor 1a ( Bmpr1a ) -mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development and discovered that abrogation of mesenchymal Bmpr1a disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis , leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions . Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers were found in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs . In addition , ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs . However , deletion of Smad1/5 , two major BMP signaling downstream effectors , from the lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs , suggesting that a Smad-independent mechanism contributes to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions . These findings reveal for the first time the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts .

    Abstract: Anionic lipid molecules , including phosphatidylinositol-4 , 5-bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) , are implicated in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . However , the role of the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 in the regulation of EGFR activity in living cells is not fully understood , as it is difficult to visualize the local lipid domains around EGFR . Here , we visualized both EGFR and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells using super-resolution single-molecule microscopy . The EGFR and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 nanodomains aggregated before stimulation with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) through transient visits of EGFR to the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 nanodomains . The degree of coaggregation decreased after EGF stimulation and depended on phospholipase Cγ , the EGFR effector hydrolyzing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . Artificial reduction in the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 content of the plasma membrane reduced both the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after stimulation with EGF . Inhibition of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 hydrolysis after EGF stimulation decreased phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654 . Thus , EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 around EGFR molecules were found to be mutually regulated .

    Abstract: Stramenopiles form a clade of diverse eukaryotic organisms , including multicellular algae , the fish and plant pathogenic oomycetes , such as the potato blight Phytophthora , and the human intestinal protozoan Blastocystis . In most eukaryotes , glycolysis is a strictly cytosolic metabolic pathway that converts glucose to pyruvate , resulting in the production of NADH and ATP ( Adenosine triphosphate ) . In contrast , stramenopiles have a branched glycolysis in which the enzymes of the pay-off phase are located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix . Here , we identify a mitochondrial carrier in Blastocystis that can transport glycolytic intermediates , such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate , across the mitochondrial inner membrane , linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis . Comparative analyses with the phylogenetically related human mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier ( SLC25A11 ) and dicarboxylate carrier ( SLC25A10 ) show that the glycolytic intermediate carrier has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate . Blastocystis lacks several key components of oxidative phosphorylation required for the generation of mitochondrial ATP , such as complexes III and IV , ATP synthase , and ADP/ATP carriers . The presence of the glycolytic pay-off phase in the mitochondrial matrix generates ATP , which powers energy-requiring processes , such as macromolecular synthesis , as well as NADH , used by mitochondrial complex I to generate a proton motive force to drive the import of proteins and molecules . Given its unique substrate specificity and central role in carbon and energy metabolism , the carrier for glycolytic intermediates identified here represents a specific drug and pesticide target against stramenopile pathogens , which are of great economic importance .

    Abstract: We propose a new framework for human genetic association studies: at each locus , a deep learning model ( in this study , Sei ) is used to calculate the functional genomic activity score for two haplotypes per individual . This score , defined as the Haplotype Function Score ( HFS ) , replaces the original genotype in association studies . Applying the HFS framework to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank , we identified 3619 independent HFS–trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8 . Fine-mapping revealed 2699 causal associations , corresponding to a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared with single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) -based analysis . HFS-based enrichment analysis uncovered 727 pathway–trait associations and 153 tissue–trait associations with strong biological interpretability , including ‘circadian pathway-chronotype’ and ‘arachidonic acid-intelligence’ . Lastly , we applied least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( LASSO ) regression to integrate HFS prediction score with SNP-based polygenic risk scores , which showed an improvement of 16 . 1–39 . 8% in cross-ancestry polygenic prediction . We concluded that HFS is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of human complex traits .

The current study assessed whether three different types of 3 months mental Training Modules geared towards nurturing ( a ) attention-based mindfulness , ( b ) socio-affective , or ( c ) socio-cognitive skills may impact hippocampal organization by reducing stress . We evaluated mental training-induced changes in hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic functional connectivity , by combining longitudinal structural and resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis in 332 healthy adults . We related these changes to changes in diurnal and chronic cortisol levels . We observed increases in bilateral cornu ammonis volume ( CA1-3 ) following the 3 months compassion-based module targeting socio-affective skills ( Affect module ) , as compared to socio-cognitive skills ( Perspective module ) or a waitlist cohort with no training intervention . Structural changes were paralleled by relative increases in functional connectivity of CA1-3 when fostering socio-affective as compared to socio-cognitive skills . Furthermore , training-induced changes in CA1-3 structure and function consistently correlated with reductions in cortisol output . Notably , using a multivariate approach , we found that other subfields that did not show group-level changes also contributed to changes in cortisol levels . Overall , we provide a link between a socio-emotional behavioural intervention , changes in hippocampal subfield structure and function , and reductions in cortisol in healthy adults .

    Abstract: Local adaptation commonly involves alleles of large effect , which experience fitness advantages when in positive linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) . Because segregating inversions suppress recombination and facilitate the maintenance of LD between locally adapted loci , they are also commonly found to be associated with adaptive divergence . However , it is unclear what fraction of an adaptive response can be attributed to inversions and alleles of large effect , and whether the loci within an inversion could still drive adaptation in the absence of its recombination-suppressing effect . Here , we use genome-wide association studies to explore patterns of local adaptation in three species of sunflower: Helianthus annuus , Helianthus argophyllus , and Helianthus petiolaris , which each harbour a large number of species-specific inversions . We find evidence of significant genome-wide repeatability in signatures of association to phenotypes and environments , which are particularly enriched within regions of the genome harbouring an inversion in one species . This shows that while inversions may facilitate local adaptation , at least some of the loci can still harbour mutations that make substantial contributions without the benefit of recombination suppression in species lacking a segregating inversion . While a large number of genomic regions show evidence of repeated adaptation , most of the strongest signatures of association still tend to be species-specific , indicating substantial genotypic redundancy for local adaptation in these species .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Effects from aging in single cells are heterogenous , whereas at the organ- and tissue-levels aging phenotypes tend to appear as stereotypical changes . The mammary epithelium is a bilayer of two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages: luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells . Mammary luminal epithelia exhibit substantial stereotypical changes with age that merit attention because these cells are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers . We hypothesize that effects from aging that impinge upon maintenance of lineage fidelity increase susceptibility to cancer initiation . We generated and analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from younger <30 ( y ) ears old and older >55 y women . In addition to age-dependent directional changes in gene expression , we observed increased transcriptional variance with age that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity . Age-dependent variant responses were common to both lineages , whereas directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and involved altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SATB1 . Epithelial expression variance of gap junction protein GJB6 increased with age , and modulation of GJB6 expression in heterochronous co-cultures revealed that it provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells . Age-dependent luminal transcriptomes comprised a prominent signal that could be detected in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers . A machine learning classifier based on luminal-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was highly predictive of breast cancer subtype . We speculate that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue , and that their emergent phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and represents a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Understanding the genomic basis of natural variation in plant pest resistance is an important goal in plant science , but it usually requires large and labor-intensive phenotyping experiments . Here , we explored the possibility that non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing can serve as phenotyping proxies for addressing such questions . We used data from a whole-genome and -epigenome sequencing study of 207 natural lines of field pennycress ( Thlaspi arvense ) that were grown in a common environment and spontaneously colonized by aphids , mildew , and other microbes . We found that the numbers of non-target reads assigned to the pest species differed between populations , had significant SNP-based heritability , and were associated with climate of origin and baseline glucosinolate contents . Specifically , pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats , presumably less favorable to aphids , showed higher aphid DNA load , i . e . , decreased aphid resistance . Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants at known defense genes but also novel genomic regions associated with variation in aphid and mildew DNA load .

    ","Biologists have long sought to understand the genetic basis of natural variation in plant resistance to pests, but this requires extensive and labor-intensive phenotyping experiments. To address this challenge, researchers explored the possibility of using non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing as phenotyping proxies. They analyzed whole-genome and epigenome sequencing data from 207 lines of the plant species Thlaspi arven grown in a common environment and colonized by aphids, mildew, and microbes. The results showed that non-target reads assigned to pest species differed between populations, had significant SNP heritability, and were associated with climate origin and glucosinolate content. Lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, less favorable to aphids, had higher aphid load, indicating decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants in defense genes and novel regions associated with aphid and mildew load. Differentially methylated regions were found associated with pathogen loads, particularly transposons and hypomethylation in a gene promoter of stomatal closure induced by pathogens. This study provides insights into defense mechanisms of Thpi arven, a crop model species, and demonstrates non-target sequencing can estimate plant biotic interactions. With increasing large datasets, this approach has broad application in fundamental and applied research."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Drug resistance remains a major obstacle to malaria control and eradication efforts , necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat this disease . Drug combinations based on collateral sensitivity , wherein resistance to one drug causes increased sensitivity to the partner drug , have been proposed as an evolutionary strategy to suppress the emergence of resistance in pathogen populations . In this study , we explore collateral sensitivity between compounds targeting the Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( DHODH ) . We profiled the cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity phenotypes of several DHODH mutant lines to a diverse panel of DHODH inhibitors . We focus on one compound , TCMDC-125334 , which was active against all mutant lines tested , including the DHODH C276Y line , which arose in selections with the clinical candidate DSM265 . In six selections with TCMDC-125334 , the most common mechanism of resistance to this compound was copy number variation of the dhodh locus , although we did identify one mutation , DHODH I263S , which conferred resistance to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265 . We found that selection of the DHODH C276Y mutant with TCMDC-125334 yielded additional genetic changes in the dhodh locus . These double mutant parasites exhibited decreased sensitivity to TCMDC-125334 and were highly resistant to DSM265 . Finally , we tested whether collateral sensitivity could be exploited to suppress the emergence of resistance in the context of combination treatment by exposing wildtype parasites to both DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 simultaneously . This selected for parasites with a DHODH V532A mutation which were cross-resistant to both compounds and were as fit as the wildtype parent in vitro . The emergence of these cross-resistant , evolutionarily fit parasites highlights the mutational flexibility of the DHODH enzyme .

Selection of DH276 with TDC-334 yields additional changes in dhod locus. Double mutants exhibit decreased sensitivity TDC-334, highly resistant DSM. The study tests whether collateral can suppress emergence in combination by exposing wildtype to DSM and TDC-334 simultaneously.

    Abstract: Cannabis , the most consumed illicit psychoactive drug in the world , is increasingly used by pregnant women . However , while cannabinoid receptors are expressed in the early embryo , the impact of phytocannabinoids exposure on early embryonic processes is lacking . Here , we leverage a stepwise in vitro differentiation system that captures the early embryonic developmental cascade to investigate the impact of exposure to the most abundant phytocannabinoid , Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ9-THC ) . We demonstrate that Δ9-THC increases the proliferation of naive mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) but not of their primed counterpart . Surprisingly , this increased proliferation , dependent on the CB1 receptor binding , is only associated with moderate transcriptomic changes . Instead , Δ9-THC capitalizes on ESCs’ metabolic bivalence by increasing their glycolytic rates and anabolic capabilities . A memory of this metabolic rewiring is retained throughout differentiation to Primordial Germ Cell-Like Cells in the absence of direct exposure and is associated with an alteration of their transcriptional profile . These results represent the first in-depth molecular characterization of the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early stages of germline development .

The zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) has hundreds of NLR immune genes , making this species ideal for studying this phenomenon . By sequencing 93 zebrafish from multiple wild and laboratory populations , we identified a total of 1513 NLRs , many more than the previously known 400 . Approximately half of those are present in all wild populations , but only 4% were found in 80% or more of the individual fish . Wild fish have up to two times as many NLRs per individual and up to four times as many NLRs per population than laboratory strains .

    Abstract: The ovules or seeds ( fertilized ovules ) with wings are widespread and especially important for wind dispersal . However , the earliest ovules in the Famennian of the Late Devonian are rarely known about the dispersal syndrome and usually surrounded by a cupule . From Xinhang , Anhui , China , we now report a new taxon of Famennian ovules , Alasemenia tria gen . et sp . nov . Each ovule of this taxon possesses three integumentary wings evidently extending outwards , folding inwards along abaxial side and enclosing most part of nucellus . The ovule is borne terminally on smooth dichotomous branches and lacks a cupule . Alasemenia suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cupule evolved functions in probable photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal . It indicates that the seed wing originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms such as seed plume and pappus , and that three- or four-winged seeds were followed by seeds with less wings . Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one , two or four wings under the same condition .

Here , we report a new leukemogenic process in which RAPSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph+ leukemia , and RAPSYN mediates the neddylation of BCR-ABL . Consequently , neddylated BCR-ABL enhances the stability by competing its c-CBL-mediated degradation .

Moreover , in contrast to in vivo ineffectiveness of PROTAC-based degraders , depletion of RAPSYN expression , or its ligase activity decreased BCR-ABL stability and , in turn , inhibited tumor formation and growth .

This study identifies a novel leukemogenic process where RSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph leukemia, and RSY mediates neddylation of B-ABL. Neddylated B-ABL enhances its stability by inhibiting CBL-mediated degradation, and phosphorylates RSY to activate its NEDD8 ligase activity, promoting BABL stabilization and disease progression. In contrast, in vivo PROTAC-based degraders are ineffective, depletion of RSY expression or its ligase activity decreases BABL stability, inhibiting tumor formation and growth. These findings provide an alternative to tyrosine kinase activity for oncoprotein leukemic cells and a rationale for targeting RSY-mediated B- nedlation in Ph leukemia treatment."

    Abstract: Phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases ( i . e . lysins ) are considered promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to their direct peptidoglycan degradation activity and low risk of resistance development . The discovery of these enzymes is often hampered by the limited availability of phage genomes . Herein , we report a new strategy to mine active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes by lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening . As a proof-of-concept , five peptidoglycan hydrolases from the Acinetobacter baumannii proteome ( PHAb7-PHAb11 ) were identified using PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template . Among them , PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr , while the other three were thermosensitive . We solved the crystal structures of PHAb8 , PHAb10 , and PHAb11 and unveiled that hyper-thermostable PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by a dimer-monomer transition , while thermosensitive PHAb8 formed a monomer . Two mouse models of bacterial infection further demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PHAb10 . In conclusion , our antimicrobial peptide-primed strategy provides new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs .

To complement and compare the registry diagnosis codes with deeper clinical data , we used a text mining approach to extract symptoms from free text clinical notes in electronic health records ( 3078 pancreatic cancer patients and 30 , 780 controls ) . We used both data sources to generate and compare symptom disease trajectories to uncover temporal patterns of symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis for the same patients . We show that the text mining of the clinical notes was able to complement the registry-based symptoms by capturing more symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis . For example , ‘Blood pressure reading without diagnosis’ , ‘Abnormalities of heartbeat’ , and ‘Intestinal obstruction’ were not found for the registry-based analysis . Chaining symptoms together in trajectories identified two groups of patients with lower median survival ( <90 days ) following the trajectories ‘Cough→Jaundice→Intestinal obstruction’ and ‘Pain→Jaundice→Abnormal results of function studies’ . These results provide a comprehensive comparison of the two types of pancreatic cancer symptom trajectories , which in combination can leverage the full potential of the health data and ultimately provide a fuller picture for detection of early risk factors for pancreatic cancer .

    Abstract: The synchronization of canonical fast sleep spindle activity ( 12 . 5–16 Hz , adult-like ) precisely during the slow oscillation ( 0 . 5–1 Hz ) up peak is considered an essential feature of adult non-rapid eye movement sleep . However , there is little knowledge on how this well-known coalescence between slow oscillations and sleep spindles develops . Leveraging individualized detection of single events , we first provide a detailed cross-sectional characterization of age-specific patterns of slow and fast sleep spindles , slow oscillations , and their coupling in children and adolescents aged 5–6 , 8–11 , and 14–18 years , and an adult sample of 20- to 26-year-olds . Critically , based on this , we then investigated how spindle and slow oscillation maturity substantiate age-related differences in their precise orchestration . While the predominant type of fast spindles was development-specific in that it was still nested in a frequency range below the canonical fast spindle range for the majority of children , the well-known slow oscillation-spindle coupling pattern was evident for sleep spindles in the adult-like canonical fast spindle range in all four age groups—but notably less precise in children . To corroborate these findings , we linked personalized measures of fast spindle maturity , which indicate the similarity between the prevailing development-specific and adult-like canonical fast spindles , and slow oscillation maturity , which reflects the extent to which slow oscillations show frontal dominance , with individual slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns . Importantly , we found that fast spindle maturity was uniquely associated with enhanced slow oscillation-spindle coupling strength and temporal precision across the four age groups . Taken together , our results suggest that the increasing ability to generate adult-like canonical fast sleep spindles actuates precise slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns from childhood through adolescence and into young adulthood .

    Abstract: Artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides were suggested as healthier alternatives to sugar-sweetened beverages . Nevertheless , the potential detrimental effects of these noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function remain inadequately understood . We have established a zebrafish model that exhibits significant excessive angiogenesis induced by high glucose , resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) . Utilizing this model , we observed that glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides could induce excessive formation of blood vessels , especially intersegmental vessels ( ISVs ) . The excessively branched vessels were observed to be formed by ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells ( ECs ) into tip cells .

    ","Artificially sweetened beverages containing non-caloric monosaccharides have been proposed as a healthier alternative to sugar-sweetened beverages. However, the potential effects of these non-caloric monacides on blood vessel function are not well understood. To investigate this, a zebraf model was developed that exhibits excessive angiogenesis in response to high glucose, mimicking the hyperangiogenic characteristics of proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ). Using this model, glucose and nonoric monacides were found to induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels ( ISVs ). Excessively branched vessels were formed by ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells ( ECs ) into tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of ECs exposed to high glucose revealed increased capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and upregulated proangiogenic genes. Further experiments confirmed that fox1 mediated excessive angiogenesis by monacides via upregulating marck1. This study provides evidence of negative effects of nonoric monacides on vascular system and underlying mechanisms."

    Abstract: Daily experiences often involve the processing of multiple sequences , yet storing them challenges the limited capacity of working memory ( WM ) . To achieve efficient memory storage , relational structures shared by sequences would be leveraged to reorganize and compress information . Here , participants memorized a sequence of items with different colors and spatial locations and later reproduced the full color and location sequences one after another . Crucially , we manipulated the consistency between location and color sequence trajectories . First , sequences with consistent trajectories demonstrate improved memory performance and a trajectory correlation between reproduced color and location sequences . Second , sequences with consistent trajectories show neural reactivation of common trajectories , and display spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations . Finally , neural reactivation correlates with WM behavior . Our findings suggest that a shared common structure is leveraged for the storage of multiple sequences through compressed encoding and neural replay , together facilitating efficient information organization in WM .

    Abstract: Mutations in the human PURA gene cause the neurodevelopmental PURA syndrome . In contrast to several other monogenetic disorders , almost all reported mutations in this nucleic acid-binding protein result in the full disease penetrance . In this study , we observed that patient mutations across PURA impair its previously reported co-localization with processing bodies . These mutations either destroyed the folding integrity , RNA binding , or dimerization of PURA . We also solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA and combined them with molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements . The observed unusually high dynamics and structural promiscuity of PURA indicated that this protein is particularly susceptible to mutations impairing its structural integrity . It offers an explanation why even conservative mutations across PURA result in the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome .

    ","**Summary: Mutations in the Human PUR Gene Cause Neurodevelopmental PURA Syndrome: A Study Reveals Protein’s Susceptibility to Structural Impairment**

   Mutations in the human PUR gene have been identified as the primary cause of neurodevelopmental PUR syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by developmental delays and intellectual disability. Unlike other genetic disorders, nearly all mutations in the nucleic acid-binding protein result in full penetrance of the disease. This study aimed to investigate the impact of mutations on PUR’s localization and structure. Researchers observed that mutations in PUR impair its localization to processing bodies, either destroying its integrity, RNA binding, or dimerization. The study also solved the crystal structures of the N and C-terminal domains of human PUR and combined with molecular dynamics and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The results showed unusually high dynamics and promiscuity of PUR, indicating the protein’s susceptibility to structural impairment. This may explain why even conservative mutations in PUR result in full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PUR syndrome."

    Abstract: Reports indicate that an interaction between TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 ( ANO1 ) could be widely involved in water efflux of exocrine glands , suggesting that the interaction could play a role in perspiration . In secretory cells of sweat glands present in mouse foot pads , TRPV4 clearly colocalized with cytokeratin 8 , ANO1 , and aquaporin-5 ( AQP5 ) . Mouse sweat glands showed TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases that were inhibited by menthol . Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type , but not in TRPV4-deficient mice and was inhibited by menthol both in wild-type and TRPM8KO mice . The basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by an ANO1 inhibitor . Sweating could be important for maintaining friction forces in mouse foot pads , and this possibility is supported by the finding that wild-type mice climbed up a slippery slope more easily than TRPV4-deficient mice . Furthermore , TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis ( AIGA ) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA . Collectively , TRPV4 is likely involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with ANO1 , and TRPV4 itself or the TRPV4/ANO 1 complex would be targeted to develop agents that regulate perspiration .

Despite this diversity , we present a universal multi-scale description of primate cortices . We show that all cortical shapes can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes . As neighbouring folds are gradually merged , the cortices of 11 primate species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory , that also overlaps with over 70 other mammalian species . Our results indicate that all cerebral cortices are approximations of the same archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of df = 2 . 5 . Importantly , this new understanding enables a more precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale . To demonstrate the importance of this new understanding , we show a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology . We observe a more than fourfold increase in effect size ( from two standard deviations to eight standard deviations ) at a spatial scale of approximately 2 mm compared to standard morphological analyses . Our new understanding may , therefore , generate superior biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future .

    Abstract: The canonical NF-κB transcription factor RELA is a master regulator of immune and stress responses and is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocardinoma ( PDAC ) tumours . In this study , we characterised previously unexplored endogenous RELA-GFP dynamics in PDAC cell lines through live single-cell imaging . Our observations revealed that TNFα stimulation induces rapid , sustained , and non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA . Through Bayesian analysis of single-cell datasets with variation in nuclear RELA , we predicted that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cell lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics . RNA-seq analysis identified distinct clusters of RELA-regulated gene expression in PDAC cells , including TNFα-induced RELA upregulation of the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31 . Further , siRNA-mediated depletion of ARHGAP31 and NUAK2 altered TNFα-stimulated nuclear RELA dynamics in PDAC cells , establishing a novel negative feedback loop that regulates RELA activation by TNFα . Additionally , we characterised the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells , identifying how NF-κB/IκB proteins genetically and physically interact with RELA in the absence or presence of TNFα . Taken together , we provide computational and experimental support for interdependence between the F-actin network and the NF-κB pathway with RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC .

    Abstract: A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition ( E/I ) is essential for proper brain function . Disruptions in the GABAergic system , which alter this equilibrium , are a common feature in various types of neurological disorders , including autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) . Mutations in Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog ( PTEN ) , the main negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway , are strongly associated with ASD . However , it is unclear whether PTEN deficiencies can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling . Using the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system , where both excitatory ( cholinergic ) and inhibitory ( GABAergic ) inputs regulate muscle activity , we found that daf-18/PTEN mutations impact GABAergic ( but not cholinergic ) neurodevelopment and function . This selective impact results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling . The defects observed in the GABAergic system in daf-18/PTEN mutants are due to reduced activity of DAF-16/FOXO during development . Ketogenic diets ( KGDs ) have proven effective for disorders associated with E/I imbalances . However , the mechanisms underlying their action remain largely elusive . We found that a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate during early development induces DAF-16/FOXO activity , therefore improving GABAergic neurodevelopment and function in daf-18/PTEN mutants . Our study provides valuable insights into the link between PTEN mutations and neurodevelopmental defects and delves into the mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of KGDs .

However, it is unclear whether PTEN affects inhibitory and excitatory signaling differently. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system, both excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABA inputs regulate muscle activity, d-PT mutations impact GABA but not cholin development and function. This results in a deficiency of inhibitory signaling. The GABA system in d-PT mutants is due to reduced DAF activity during development. Ketogenic diets (KDs) have been effective for disorders with E imbalances. A diet enriched with ketone body-hydrobutyrate during development induces DAF activity, improving GABA development in d-PT mutants.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Insulin plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis . Drosophila insulin-producing cells ( IPCs ) are functional analogues of mammalian pancreatic beta cells and release insulin directly into circulation . To investigate the in vivo dynamics of IPC activity , we quantified the effects of nutritional and internal state changes on IPCs using electrophysiological recordings . We found that the nutritional state strongly modulates IPC activity . IPC activity decreased with increasing periods of starvation . Refeeding flies with glucose or fructose , two nutritive sugars , significantly increased IPC activity , whereas non-nutritive sugars had no effect . In contrast to feeding , glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity . This was reminiscent of the mammalian incretin effect , where glucose ingestion drives higher insulin release than intravenous application . Contrary to IPCs , Diuretic hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis ( DH44PINs ) responded to glucose perfusion . Functional connectivity experiments demonstrated that these DH44PINs do not affect IPC activity , while other DH44Ns inhibit them . Hence , populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis . Accordingly , activating IPCs had a small , satiety-like effect on food-searching behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity , whereas activating DH44Ns strongly increased hyperactivity . Taken together , we demonstrate that IPCs and DH44Ns are an integral part of a modulatory network that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolic state .

Studies of bee detection of neonicotinoids have reported contradictory evidence about whether bees can taste these pesticides in sucrose solutions and hence avoid them . Here , we use an assay for the detection of food aversion combined with single-sensillum electrophysiology to test whether the mouthparts of the buff-tailed bumblebee ( Bombus terrestris ) detect the presence of pesticides in a solution that mimicked the nectar of oilseed rape ( Brassica napus ) . Bees did not avoid consuming solutions containing concentrations of imidacloprid , thiamethoxam , clothianidin , or sulfoxaflor spanning six orders of magnitude , even when these solutions contained lethal doses . Only extremely high concentrations of the pesticides altered spiking in gustatory neurons through a slight reduction in firing rate or change in the rate of adaptation . These data provide strong evidence that bumblebees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using information from their mouthparts . As bees rarely contact floral nectar with other body parts , we predict that they are at high risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops .

As bees rarely contact nectar with other parts, it is predicted that they are at risk of unwittingly consuming nectar of pesticide-treated crops."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Zoonotic disease dynamics in wildlife hosts are rarely quantified at macroecological scales due to the lack of systematic surveys . Non-human primates ( NHPs ) host Plasmodium knowlesi , a zoonotic malaria of public health concern and the main barrier to malaria elimination in Southeast Asia . Understanding of regional P . knowlesi infection dynamics in wildlife is limited . Here , we systematically assemble reports of NHP P . knowlesi and investigate geographic determinants of prevalence in reservoir species . Meta-analysis of 6322 NHPs from 148 sites reveals that prevalence is heterogeneous across Southeast Asia , with low overall prevalence and high estimates for Malaysian Borneo . We find that regions exhibiting higher prevalence in NHPs overlap with human infection hotspots . In wildlife and humans , parasite transmission is linked to land conversion and fragmentation . By assembling remote sensing data and fitting statistical models to prevalence at multiple spatial scales , we identify novel relationships between P . knowlesi in NHPs and forest fragmentation . This suggests that higher prevalence may be contingent on habitat complexity , which would begin to explain observed geographic variation in parasite burden . These findings address critical gaps in understanding regional P . knowlesi epidemiology and indicate that prevalence in simian reservoirs may be a key spatial driver of human spillover risk .

    Title: 
    Abstract: The rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic marked major transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions . To elucidate how contemporary trophic interactions were influenced by host plant shifts and palaeogeographical events , we integrated molecular data with information from the fossil record to construct a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae . Our analyses indicate that crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 Ma ago in Gondwana , associated with Pinopsida ( conifer ) host plants , with larvae likely developing in dead/decaying branches . Belids tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gondwana’s breakup , surviving on distant , disjunct landmasses . Some belids shifted to Angiospermae and Cycadopsida when and where conifers declined , evolving new trophic interactions , including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms . Extant radiations of belids in the genera Rhinotia ( Australian region ) and Proterhinus ( Hawaiian Islands ) have relatively recent origins .

    Abstract: In growing cell populations such as tumours , mutations can serve as markers that allow tracking the past evolution from current samples . The genomic analyses of bulk samples and samples from multiple regions have shed light on the evolutionary forces acting on tumours . However , little is known empirically on the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution . Here , we leverage published data from resected hepatocellular carcinomas , each with several hundred samples taken in two and three dimensions . Using spatial metrics of evolution , we find that tumour cells grow predominantly uniformly within the tumour volume instead of at the surface . We determine how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumour and how cell death contributes to the overall tumour growth . Our methods shed light on the early evolution of tumours in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Seasonal polyphenism enables organisms to adapt to environmental challenges by increasing phenotypic diversity . Cacopsylla chinensis exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism , specifically in the form of summer-form and winter-form , which have distinct morphological phenotypes . Previous research has shown that low temperature and the temperature receptor CcTRPM regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C . chinensis by impacting cuticle content and thickness . However , the underling neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown . Bursicon , also known as the tanning hormone , is responsible for the hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle . In this study , we report for the first time on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C . chinensis . Firstly , we identified CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β as two typical subunits of Bursicon in C . chinensis , which were regulated by low temperature ( 10 °C ) and CcTRPM . Subsequently , CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing the cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness . Furthermore , we demonstrated that CcBurs-R acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the up-stream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway , regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form . Finally , we discovered that miR-6012 directly targets CcBurs-R , contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of C . chinensis . In summary , these findings reveal the novel function of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor .

The study identifies Bicon, also known as tanning hormone, as a key player in this process, responsible for hardening and darkening the cuticle. Two subunits of Bicon, Cursα and Cursβ, were found to be regulated by low temperature and CTR, and form a heterodimer that influences cuticle chitin and thickness. The study also shows that Curs acts as the Bicon receptor and plays a role in upstream of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer to winter. Additionally, miR-2 was found to target Curs, regulating Bicon signaling in seasonal polyism.

Treatment of H3-K27M patient-derived cells with Sulfopin , an inhibitor shown to block MYC-driven tumors in vivo , in combination with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat , resulted in substantial decrease in cell viability . Moreover , transcriptome and epigenome profiling revealed synergistic effect of this drug combination in downregulation of prominent oncogenic pathways such as mTOR . Finally , in vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the drug combination . These results highlight the combined treatment with PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach for these aggressive tumors .

These characteristics of P . leucopus were also noted in a Borrelia hermsii infection model .

    Abstract: Caspase ( CASP ) is a family of proteases involved in cleavage and activation of gasdermin , the executor of pyroptosis . In humans , CASP3 and CASP7 recognize the same consensus motif DxxD , which is present in gasdermin E ( GSDME ) . However , human GSDME is cleaved by CASP3 but not by CASP7 . The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear . In this study , we identified a pyroptotic pufferfish GSDME that was cleaved by both pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3/7 . Domain swapping between pufferfish and human CASP and GSDME showed that the GSDME C-terminus and the CASP7 p10 subunit determined the cleavability of GSDME by CASP7 . p10 contains a key residue that governs CASP7 substrate discrimination . This key residue is highly conserved in vertebrate CASP3 and in most vertebrate ( except mammalian ) CASP7 . In mammals , the key residue is conserved in non-primates ( e . g . , mouse ) but not in primates . However , mouse CASP7 cleaved human GSDME but not mouse GSDME . These findings revealed the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrate . These results also suggested that mutation-mediated functional alteration of CASP probably enabled the divergence and specialization of different CASP members in the regulation of complex cellular activities in mammals .

    Abstract: Ketamine has emerged as one of the most promising therapies for treatment-resistant depression . However , inter-individual variability in response to ketamine is still not well understood and it is unclear how ketamine’s molecular mechanisms connect to its neural and behavioral effects . We conducted a single-blind placebo-controlled study , with participants blinded to their treatment condition . 40 healthy participants received acute ketamine ( initial bolus 0 . 23 mg/kg , continuous infusion 0 . 58 mg/kg/hr ) . We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via data-driven global brain connectivity and related it to individual ketamine-induced symptom variation and cortical gene expression targets . We found that: ( i ) both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine are multi-dimensional , reflecting robust inter-individual variability; ( ii ) ketamine’s data-driven principal neural gradient effect matched somatostatin ( SST ) and parvalbumin ( PVALB ) cortical gene expression patterns in humans , while the mean effect did not; and ( iii ) behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine , which were resolvable at the single-subject level . These results highlight the importance of considering individual behavioral and neural variation in response to ketamine . They also have implications for the development of individually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry . This study was supported by NIH grants DP5OD012109-01 ( A .

    Title: 
    Abstract: The RNA world hypothesis proposes that during the early evolution of life , primordial genomes of the first self-propagating evolutionary units existed in the form of RNA-like polymers . Autonomous , non-enzymatic , and sustained replication of such information carriers presents a problem , because product formation and hybridization between template and copy strands reduces replication speed . Kinetics of growth is then parabolic with the benefit of entailing competitive coexistence , thereby maintaining diversity . Here , we test the information-maintaining ability of parabolic growth in stochastic multispecies population models under the constraints of constant total population size and chemostat conditions . We find that large population sizes and small differences in the replication rates favor the stable coexistence of the vast majority of replicator species ( ‘genes’ ) , while the error threshold problem is alleviated relative to exponential amplification . In addition , sequence properties ( GC content ) and the strength of resource competition mediated by the rate of resource inflow determine the number of coexisting variants , suggesting that fluctuations in building block availability favored repeated cycles of exploration and exploitation . Stochastic parabolic growth could thus have played a pivotal role in preserving viable sequences generated by random abiotic synthesis and providing diverse genetic raw material to the early evolution of functional ribozymes .

    Abstract: Nonstructural protein 5 ( Nsp5 ) is the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 that cleaves viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides necessary for viral replication . Here , we show that Nsp5 binds and cleaves human tRNA methyltransferase 1 ( TRMT1 ) , a host enzyme required for a prevalent post-transcriptional modification in tRNAs . Human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a decrease in TRMT1 protein levels and TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications , consistent with TRMT1 cleavage and inactivation by Nsp5 . Nsp5 cleaves TRMT1 at a specific position that matches the consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites , and a single mutation within the sequence inhibits Nsp5-dependent proteolysis of TRMT1 . The TRMT1 cleavage fragments exhibit altered RNA binding activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TRMT1-deficient human cells . Compared to wild-type human cells , TRMT1-deficient human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit reduced levels of intracellular viral RNA . These findings provide evidence that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and perturbation of tRNA modification patterns contribute to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection .

Our results support the idea that selection for trait in open can generate opportunistic ‘accidental pathogens."

    Abstract: Proteins containing prion-like low complexity domains ( PLDs ) are common drivers of the formation of biomolecular condensates and are prone to misregulation due to amino acid mutations . Here , we exploit the accuracy of our residue-resolution coarse-grained model , Mpipi , to quantify the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of 140 PLD mutants from six proteins ( hnRNPA1 , TDP43 , FUS , EWSR1 , RBM14 , and TIA1 ) . Our simulations reveal the existence of scaling laws that quantify the range of change in the critical solution temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations . These rules are consistent with the physicochemical properties of the mutations and extend across the entire family tested , suggesting that scaling laws can be used as tools to predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates . Our work offers a quantitative lens into how the emergent behavior of PLD solutions vary in response to physicochemical changes of single PLD molecules .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Predicting an individual’s cognitive traits or clinical condition using brain signals is a central goal in modern neuroscience . This is commonly done using either structural aspects , such as structural connectivity or cortical thickness , or aggregated measures of brain activity that average over time . But these approaches are missing a central aspect of brain function: the unique ways in which an individual’s brain activity unfolds over time . One reason why these dynamic patterns are not usually considered is that they have to be described by complex , high-dimensional models; and it is unclear how best to use these models for prediction . We here propose an approach that describes dynamic functional connectivity and amplitude patterns using a Hidden Markov model ( HMM ) and combines it with the Fisher kernel , which can be used to predict individual traits . The Fisher kernel is constructed from the HMM in a mathematically principled manner , thereby preserving the structure of the underlying model . We show here , in fMRI data , that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach is accurate and reliable . We compare the Fisher kernel to other prediction methods , both time-varying and time-averaged functional connectivity-based models . Our approach leverages information about an individual’s time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction and has broad applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalised medicine .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) variants associated with Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) and Crohn’s disease lead to increased phosphorylation of its Rab substrates . While it has been recently shown that perturbations in cellular homeostasis including lysosomal damage can increase LRRK2 activity and localization to lysosomes , the molecular mechanisms by which LRRK2 activity is regulated have remained poorly defined . We performed a targeted siRNA screen to identify regulators of LRRK2 activity and identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of one of its substrates , Rab10 . Using a combination of imaging and immunopurification methods to isolate lysosomes , we demonstrated that Rab12 is actively recruited to damaged lysosomes and leads to a local and LRRK2-dependent increase in Rab10 phosphorylation . PD-linked variants , including LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N , lead to increased recruitment of LRRK2 to the lysosome and a local elevation in lysosomal levels of pT73 Rab10 . Together , these data suggest a conserved mechanism by which Rab12 , in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants , facilitates the recruitment of LRRK2 and phosphorylation of its Rab substrate ( s ) at the lysosome .

    Abstract: The diversity of cognitive skills across primates remains both a fascinating and a controversial issue . Recent comparative studies provided conflicting results regarding the contribution of social vs ecological constraints to the evolution of cognition . Here , we used an interdisciplinary approach combining comparative cognitive neurosciences and behavioral ecology . Using brain imaging data from 16 primate species , we measured the size of two prefrontal brain regions , the frontal pole ( FP ) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , respectively , involved in metacognition and working memory , and examined their relation to a combination of socio-ecological variables . The size of these prefrontal regions , as well as the whole brain , was best explained by three variables: body mass , daily traveled distance ( an index of ecological constraints ) , and population density ( an index of social constraints ) . The strong influence of ecological constraints on FP and DLPFC volumes suggests that both metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates . Interestingly , FP volume was much more sensitive to social constraints than DLPFC volume , in line with laboratory studies showing an implication of FP in complex social interactions . Thus , our data highlights the relative weight of social vs ecological constraints on the evolution of specific prefrontal brain regions and their associated cognitive operations in primates .

    Title: 
    Abstract: An increase in mechanical loading , such as that which occurs during resistance exercise , induces radial growth of muscle fibers ( i . e . an increase in cross-sectional area ) . Muscle fibers are largely composed of myofibrils , but whether radial growth is mediated by an increase in the size of the myofibrils ( i . e . myofibril hypertrophy ) and/or the number of myofibrils ( i . e . myofibrillogenesis ) is not known . Electron microscopy ( EM ) can provide images with the level of resolution that is needed to address this question , but the acquisition and subsequent analysis of EM images is a time- and cost-intensive process . To overcome this , we developed a novel method for visualizing myofibrils with a standard fluorescence microscope ( fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution [FIM-ID] ) . Images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast , and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines for automated measurements of myofibril size and number . After extensively validating the automated measurements , we used both mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading to discover that the radial growth of muscle fibers is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis . Collectively , the outcomes of this study offer insight into a fundamentally important topic in the field of muscle growth and provide future investigators with a time- and cost-effective means to study it .

    ","The study aimed to investigate how muscle fibers grow in response to increased mechanical loading, such as during exercise, and whether this growth is due to an increase in the size of myofibrils (myofibril hypertrophy) or the number of myofils (myillogenesis). Muscle fibers are primarily composed of myofils, and understanding the mechanism of growth is crucial for muscle development and repair. Electron microscopy (EM) can provide high-resolution images but is a time and cost-intensive process. To address this, a novel method was developed to visualize myils using a standard microscope, fluorescence imaging myils with deconvolution (F-ID). This method produced images with high resolution and contrast, allowing for automated measurements of myil size and number. After validation, the method was used in mouse and human models of increased loading to show that muscle fiber growth is largely due to myogenesis, not myil hypertrophy."

    Title: 
    Abstract: SNAP25 is one of three neuronal SNAREs driving synaptic vesicle exocytosis . We studied three mutations in SNAP25 that cause epileptic encephalopathy: V48F , and D166Y in the synaptotagmin-1 ( Syt1 ) -binding interface , and I67N , which destabilizes the SNARE complex . All three mutations reduced Syt1-dependent vesicle docking to SNARE-carrying liposomes and Ca2+-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and when expressed in mouse hippocampal neurons . The V48F and D166Y mutants ( with potency D166Y > V48F ) led to reduced readily releasable pool ( RRP ) size , due to increased spontaneous ( miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Current , mEPSC ) release and decreased priming rates . These mutations lowered the energy barrier for fusion and increased the release probability , which are gain-of-function features not found in Syt1 knockout ( KO ) neurons; normalized mEPSC release rates were higher ( potency D166Y > V48F ) than in the Syt1 KO . These mutations ( potency D166Y > V48F ) increased spontaneous association to partner SNAREs , resulting in unregulated membrane fusion . In contrast , the I67N mutant decreased mEPSC frequency and evoked EPSC amplitudes due to an increase in the height of the energy barrier for fusion , whereas the RRP size was unaffected . This could be partly compensated by positive charges lowering the energy barrier . Overall , pathogenic mutations in SNAP25 cause complex changes in the energy landscape for priming and fusion .

    Title: 
    Abstract: In cardiomyocytes , the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex mediates the slow delayed-rectifier current ( IKs ) , pivotal during the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential . Mutations in IKs cause long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) , a syndrome with a prolonged QT interval on the ECG , which increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death . One potential therapeutical intervention for LQTS is based on targeting IKs channels to restore channel function and/or the physiological QT interval . Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) are potent activators of KCNQ1 channels and activate IKs channels by binding to two different sites , one in the voltage sensor domain – which shifts the voltage dependence to more negative voltages – and the other in the pore domain – which increases the maximal conductance of the channels ( Gmax ) . However , the mechanism by which PUFAs increase the Gmax of the IKs channels is still poorly understood . In addition , it is unclear why IKs channels have a very small single-channel conductance and a low open probability or whether PUFAs affect any of these properties of IKs channels . Our results suggest that the selectivity filter in KCNQ1 is normally unstable , contributing to the low open probability , and that the PUFA-induced increase in Gmax is caused by a stabilization of the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Organogenesis requires the proper production of diverse cell types and their positioning/migration . However , the coordination of these processes during development remains poorly understood . The gonad in C . elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip cells ( DTCs ) , which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors ( SGPs; Z1 and Z4 ) . We found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4 , which possess mirror-symmetric orientation , is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins ( CWN-1 , CWN-2 , and EGL-20 ) with distinct functions . In lin-17 mutants , CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4 , while CWN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4 , respectively . In contrast , EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4 . In lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1 , DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side . Our further analysis demonstrates that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration . Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1 ( RNAi ) animals producing ectopic DTCs . These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ .

    ","The development of the gonad in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a complex process that involves the production of diverse cell types and their precise positioning and migration. However, the coordination of these processes during development is not well understood. The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure, which is guided by the migration of distal tip cells (DTCs), resulting from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (Z1 and Z4). The polarity of Z1 and Z4, which is mirror-symmetric, is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Fizzled receptor and Wnt proteins (WN-1, WN-2, and EGL-20) with distinct roles. In LIN-17 mutants, WN-2 promotes normal polarity in Z and Z, while WN-1 promotes normal polarity in Z and Z, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of Z and Z. In LIN-17 EGL-20-WN-2 mutants, polarity of Z is reversed, resulting in frequent mis-migration of DTCs to the posterior. Further analysis shows that mispositioning of Ds in the gon due to polarity of Z leads to misigration. Similar misigration is also observed in C-1 RNAi animals producing ectopic Ds. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of Ds to establish a mirrorymmetric organ."

    Title: 
    Abstract: There is growing interest in designing multidrug therapies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance . Tradeoffs are common in evolution and occur when , for example , resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another . Major questions remain about the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable , specifically , whether the mutants that provide resistance to a given drug all suffer similar tradeoffs . This question is difficult because the drug-resistant mutants observed in the clinic , and even those evolved in controlled laboratory settings , are often biased towards those that provide large fitness benefits . Thus , the mutations ( and mechanisms ) that provide drug resistance may be more diverse than current data suggests . Here , we perform evolution experiments utilizing lineage-tracking to capture a fuller spectrum of mutations that give yeast cells a fitness advantage in fluconazole , a common antifungal drug . We then quantify fitness tradeoffs for each of 774 evolved mutants across 12 environments , finding these mutants group into classes with characteristically different tradeoffs . Their unique tradeoffs may imply that each group of mutants affects fitness through different underlying mechanisms . Some of the groupings we find are surprising . For example , we find some mutants that resist single drugs do not resist their combination , while others do . And some mutants to the same gene have different tradeoffs than others . These findings , on one hand , demonstrate the difficulty in relying on consistent or intuitive tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments . On the other hand , by demonstrating that hundreds of adaptive mutations can be reduced to a few groups with characteristic tradeoffs , our findings may yet empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance . More generally speaking , by grouping mutants that likely affect fitness through similar underlying mechanisms , our work guides efforts to map the phenotypic effects of mutation .

    ","The article explores the concept of drug resistance tradeoffs in the context of multidrug therapies, where resistance to one drug can result in increased sensitivity to another. However, the reliability of these tradeoffs remains unclear, as observed drug-resistant mutants in the clinic and laboratory settings are often biased towards those with large fitness benefits. To address this, the authors performed experiments using lineage-tracking to capture a broader spectrum of mutations that provide yeast cells an advantage against fluconazole, an antifungal drug. They quantified fitness tradeoffs for 774 mutants across 12 environments, grouping them into classes with characteristic tradeoffs. The unique tradeoffs suggest each group affects fitness through different mechanisms. Some groupings were unexpected, such as mutants resistant to single drugs but not combinations, and same gene mutants with different tradeoffs. These findings highlight the difficulty in relying on consistent tradeoffs for multidrug design, but also demonstrate that hundreds of mutations can be reduced to a few with characteristic tradeoffs. This may enable multidrug strategies leveraging tradeoffs to combat resistance. By grouping mutants affecting similar mechanisms, the study guides efforts to map phenotypic effects of mutations."

    Title: 
    Abstract: The central tendency bias , or contraction bias , is a phenomenon where the judgment of the magnitude of items held in working memory appears to be biased toward the average of past observations . It is assumed to be an optimal strategy by the brain and commonly thought of as an expression of the brain’s ability to learn the statistical structure of sensory input . On the other hand , recency biases such as serial dependence are also commonly observed and are thought to reflect the content of working memory . Recent results from an auditory delayed comparison task in rats suggest that both biases may be more related than previously thought: when the posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) was silenced , both short-term and contraction biases were reduced . By proposing a model of the circuit that may be involved in generating the behavior , we show that a volatile working memory content susceptible to shifting to the past sensory experience – producing short-term sensory history biases – naturally leads to contraction bias . The errors , occurring at the level of individual trials , are sampled from the full distribution of the stimuli and are not due to a gradual shift of the memory toward the sensory distribution’s mean . Our results are consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and provide predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings , delay intervals , as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas . Finally , we validate our model by performing a set of human psychophysics experiments of an auditory parametric working memory task .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICIs ) and their combination with other therapies such as chemotherapy , fail in most cancer patients . We previously identified the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 ( PDLIM2 ) as a bona fide tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer to drive cancer and its chemo and immunotherapy resistance , suggesting a new target for lung cancer therapy improvement . In this study , human clinical samples and data were used to investigate PDLIM2 genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer . Using an endogenous mouse lung cancer model faithfully recapitulating refractory human lung cancer and a clinically feasible nano-delivery system , we investigated the therapeutic efficacy , action mechanism , and safety of systemically administrated PDLIM2 expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles ( nanoPDLIM2 ) and its combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs . Our analysis indicate that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration . NanoPDLIM2 showed low toxicity , high tumor specificity , antitumor activity , and greatly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs , with complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice by their triple combination . Mechanistically , nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC-I ) expression , suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 ( MDR1 ) induction and survival genes and other tumor-related genes expression in tumor cells , and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration , turning the cold tumors hot and sensitive to ICIs and rendering them vulnerable to chemotherapeutic drugs and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) including those unleashed by ICIs . These studies established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other cold cancers .

    Abstract: To survive in challenging environments , animals must develop a system to assess food quality and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly . However , the mechanisms that regulate this chronic physiological food evaluation system , which monitors specific nutrients from ingested food and influences food-response behavior , are still not fully understood . Here , we established a low-quality food evaluation assay system and found that heat-killed E . coli ( HK-E . coli ) , a low-sugar food , triggers cellular UPRER and immune response . This encourages animals to avoid low-quality food . The physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - Innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) axis , particularly its neuronal function , which subsequently regulates feeding behaviors . Moreover , animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment through sugar supplementation , which inhibits the UPRER -PMK-1 regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis . This study reveals the role of the cellular stress response pathway as physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food , thereby enhancing survival in natural environments .

    Abstract: As a major class of biomolecules , carbohydrates play indispensable roles in various biological processes . However , it remains largely unknown how carbohydrates directly modulate important drug targets , such as G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) . Here , we employed P2Y purinoceptor 14 ( P2Y14 ) , a drug target for inflammation and immune responses , to uncover the sugar nucleotide activation of GPCRs . Integrating molecular dynamics simulation with functional study , we identified the uridine diphosphate ( UDP ) -sugar-binding site on P2Y14 , and revealed that a UDP-glucose might activate the receptor by bridging the transmembrane ( TM ) helices 2 and 7 . Between TM2 and TM7 of P2Y14 , a conserved salt bridging chain ( K2 . 60-D2 . 64-K7 . 35-E7 . 36 [KDKE] ) was identified to distinguish different UDP-sugars , including UDP-glucose , UDP-galactose , UDP-glucuronic acid , and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine . We identified the KDKE chain as a conserved functional motif of sugar binding for both P2Y14 and P2Y purinoceptor 12 ( P2Y12 ) , and then designed three sugar nucleotides as agonists of P2Y12 . These results not only expand our understanding for activation of purinergic receptors but also provide insights for the carbohydrate drug development for GPCRs .

    Abstract: Stem cell niche is critical for regulating the behavior of stem cells . Drosophila neural stem cells ( Neuroblasts , NBs ) are encased by glial niche cells closely , but it still remains unclear whether glial niche cells can regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of NBs . Here , we show that ferritin produced by glia , cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for the energy production , which is essential to the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs . The knockdown of glial ferritin encoding genes causes energy shortage in NBs via downregulating aconitase activity and NAD+ level , which leads to the low proliferation and premature differentiation of NBs mediated by Prospero entering nuclei . More importantly , ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression . In addition , the level of glial ferritin production is affected by the status of NBs , establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis . In this study , we demonstrate that glial cells are indispensable to maintain the self-renewal of NBs , unveiling a novel role of the NB glial niche during brain development .

    Abstract: Cancer is considered a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality , yet several countries have reported that deaths with a primary code of cancer remained within historic levels during the COVID-19 pandemic . Here , we further elucidate the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level in the US . We compared pandemic-related mortality patterns from underlying and multiple cause ( MC ) death data for six types of cancer , diabetes , and Alzheimer’s . Any pandemic-related changes in coding practices should be eliminated by study of MC data . Nationally in 2020 , MC cancer mortality rose by only 3% over a pre-pandemic baseline , corresponding to ~13 , 600 excess deaths . Mortality elevation was measurably higher for less deadly cancers ( breast , colorectal , and hematological , 2–7% ) than cancers with a poor survival rate ( lung and pancreatic , 0–1% ) . In comparison , there was substantial elevation in MC deaths from diabetes ( 37% ) and Alzheimer’s ( 19% ) . To understand these differences , we simulated the expected excess mortality for each condition using COVID-19 attack rates , life expectancy , population size , and mean age of individuals living with each condition . We find that the observed mortality differences are primarily explained by differences in life expectancy , with the risk of death from deadly cancers outcompeting the risk of death from COVID-19 .

    Abstract: Preserved communication abilities promote healthy ageing . To this end , the age-typical loss of sensory acuity might in part be compensated for by an individual’s preserved attentional neural filtering . Is such a compensatory brain–behaviour link longitudinally stable ? Can it predict individual change in listening behaviour ? We here show that individual listening behaviour and neural filtering ability follow largely independent developmental trajectories modelling electroencephalographic and behavioural data of N = 105 ageing individuals ( 39–82 y ) . First , despite the expected decline in hearing-threshold-derived sensory acuity , listening-task performance proved stable over 2 y . Second , neural filtering and behaviour were correlated only within each separate measurement timepoint ( T1 , T2 ) . Longitudinally , however , our results raise caution on attention-guided neural filtering metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening behaviour: neither neural filtering at T1 nor its 2-year change could predict individual 2-year behavioural change , under a combination of modelling strategies .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae are associated with gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding and bacteremia and are a leading cause of death , from sepsis , for individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases . The bacterial behaviors and mechanisms underlying why these bacteria are prone to bloodstream entry remain poorly understood . Herein , we report that clinical isolates of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars , Escherichia coli , and Citrobacter koseri are rapidly attracted toward sources of human serum . To simulate GI bleeding , we utilized an injection-based microfluidics device and found that femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to the serum source . This response is orchestrated through chemotaxis and the chemoattractant L-serine , an amino acid abundant in serum that is recognized through direct binding by the chemoreceptor Tsr . We report the first crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine and identify a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues . We find Tsr to be widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections .

    ","Bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family, including non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica, Escherichia, and Citrobacter, are associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and bacteremia and are a leading cause of death from sepsis in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. These bacteria are prone to entering the bloodstream, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study reports that clinical isolates of these bacteria are rapidly attracted to human serum, simulating GI bleeding using an injection-based microfluidics device. Femtol volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce attraction. The response is through chemotaxis and chemoattract L-ser, an amino acid abundant in serum recognized by chemoreceptor T. Crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimium Tsr with L-ser are reported, identifying a conserved amino motif for L-ser among Tsr orthologues. Tsr is conserved among Enterobacteraceae and WHO priority pathogens with bloodstream infections. Enterobacter use serum as a nutrient source for growth and chemaxis and T provide a competitive advantage for migration into hemorrhagic lesions. This behavior is defined as ‘bacterial vampirism’, related to proclivity for bloodstream infections."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Male germ cells share a common origin across animal species , therefore they likely retain a conserved genetic program that defines their cellular identity . However , the unique evolutionary dynamics of male germ cells coupled with their widespread leaky transcription pose significant obstacles to the identification of the core spermatogenic program . Through network analysis of the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species , we describe the conserved evolutionary origin of metazoan male germ cells at the molecular level . We estimate the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell to correspond to the expression of approximately 10 , 000 protein-coding genes , a third of which defines a genetic scaffold of deeply conserved genes that has been retained throughout evolution . Such scaffold contains a set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene expression regulators that represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of metazoan spermatogenesis . By genetically interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity , we uncover 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three new potential genetic causes of human infertility . These findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on human reproductive disease and establish a cross-species analytical pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell types and pathologies .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Eukaryotes swim with coordinated flagellar ( ciliary ) beating and steer by fine-tuning the coordination . The model organism for studying flagellate motility , Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , employs synchronous , breaststroke-like flagellar beating to swim , and it modulates the beating amplitudes differentially to steer . This strategy hinges on both inherent flagellar asymmetries ( e . g . different response to chemical messengers ) and such asymmetries being effectively coordinated in the synchronous beating . In C . reinhardtii , the synchrony of beating is known to be supported by a mechanical connection between flagella; however , how flagellar asymmetries persist in the synchrony remains elusive . For example , it has been speculated for decades that one flagellum leads the beating , as its dynamic properties ( i . e . frequency , waveform , etc . ) appear to be copied by the other one . In this study , we combine experiments , computations , and modeling efforts to elucidate the roles played by each flagellum in synchronous beating . With a non-invasive technique to selectively load each flagellum , we show that the coordinated beating essentially only responds to load exerted on the cis flagellum; and that such asymmetry in response derives from a unilateral coupling between the two flagella . Our results highlight a distinct role for each flagellum in coordination and have implication for biflagellates’ tactic behaviors .

Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice .

Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells and macrophages .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Defensive behavior changes based on threat intensity , proximity , and context of exposure , and learning about danger-predicting stimuli is critical for survival . However , most Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms focus only on freezing behavior , obscuring the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic defensive responses . To thoroughly investigate defensive ethograms , we subjected male and female adult C57BL/6 J mice to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that paired footshock with a serial compound stimulus ( SCS ) consisting of distinct tone and white noise ( WN ) stimulus periods . To investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms affect defensive responses , we compared this paired SCS-footshock group with four control groups that were conditioned with either pseudorandom unpaired presentations of SCS and footshock , shock only , or reversed SCS presentations with inverted tone-WN order , with paired or unpaired presentations . On day 2 of conditioning , the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period with switching to explosive jumping and darting behaviors during the WN period . Comparatively , the unpaired and both reverse SCS groups expressed less tone-induced freezing and rarely showed jumping or darting during WN . Following the second day of conditioning , we observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions . During extinction , the tone-induced freezing decreased in the paired group , and mice rapidly shifted from escape jumping during WN to a combination of freezing and darting . The unpaired , unpaired reverse , and shock-only groups displayed defensive tail rattling and darting during the SCS , with minimal freezing and jumping . Interestingly , the paired reverse group did not jump to WN , and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction . These findings demonstrate that non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness , but associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression .

    Abstract: To navigate their environment , insects need to keep track of their orientation . Previous work has shown that insects encode their head direction as a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure . However , it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding of head direction is just an evolutionary coincidence or if it offers a particular functional advantage . To address this question , we establish the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and show that it can be performed by many circuits , all with different activity patterns . Among these activity patterns , we prove that the sinusoidal one is the most noise-resilient , but only when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity pattern between the encoding neurons . We compare this predicted optimal connectivity pattern with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and the fruit fly , finding that our theory agrees with experimental evidence . Furthermore , we demonstrate that our predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity , implying that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect but rather can emerge during development . Finally , we illustrate that in our theory , the consistent presence of the eight-column organisation of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance artefact but instead can be explained by basic evolutionary principles .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain . Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin , both pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control . CISD1 , a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulfur-binding protein , is a major target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination . We here discovered a heightened propensity of CISD1 to form dimers in Pink1 mutant flies and in dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients . The dimer consists of two monomers that are covalently linked by a disulfide bridge . In this conformation CISD1 cannot coordinate the iron-sulfur cofactor . Overexpressing Cisd , the Drosophila ortholog of CISD1 , and a mutant Cisd incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster in Drosophila reduced climbing ability and lifespan . This was more pronounced with mutant Cisd and aggravated in Pink1 mutant flies . Complete loss of Cisd , in contrast , rescued all detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing ability , wing posture , dopamine levels , lifespan , and mitochondrial ultrastructure . Our results suggest that Cisd , probably iron-depleted Cisd , operates downstream of Pink1 shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Obligate parasites often trigger significant changes in their hosts to facilitate transmission to new hosts . The molecular mechanisms behind these extended phenotypes - where genetic information of one organism is manifested as traits in another - remain largely unclear . This study explores the role of the virulence protein SAP54 , produced by parasitic phytoplasmas , in attracting leafhopper vectors . SAP54 is responsible for the induction of leaf-like flowers in phytoplasma-infected plants . However , we previously demonstrated that the insects were attracted to leaves and the leaf-like flowers were not required . Here , we made the surprising discovery that leaf exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction phenotype , suggesting a leaf response that distinguishes leafhopper sex in the presence of SAP54 . In contrast , this phytoplasma effector alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization . We demonstrate that SAP54 effectively suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to the males . Critically , the host plant MADS-box transcription factor short vegetative phase ( SVP ) emerges as a key element in the female leafhopper preference for plants exposed to males , with SAP54 promoting the degradation of SVP . This preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed svp null mutant plants over those not exposed to males . Our research underscores the dual role of the phytoplasma effector SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction - integral to the phytoplasma life cycle . Importantly , we clarify how SAP54 , by targeting SVP , heightens leaf vulnerability to leafhopper males , thus facilitating female attraction and subsequent plant colonization by the insects . SAP54 essentially acts as a molecular ‘matchmaker’ , helping male leafhoppers more easily locate mates by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves . This study not only provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes , but also opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions .

Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell cycle stage with distinct metabolic and stress responses . At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure ( a time when tolerance is measurable ) , surviving cells bifurcate into two major subpopulations: one characterized by the upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins , rRNA processing machinery , and mitochondrial cellular respiration capacity , termed the Ribo-dominant ( Rd ) state; and the other enriched for genes encoding stress responses and related processes , termed the Stress-dominant ( Sd ) state .

    Abstract: The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution posits variation among species in the effectiveness of selection . In an idealized model , the census population size determines both this minimum magnitude of the selection coefficient required for deleterious variants to be reliably purged , and the amount of neutral diversity . Empirically , an ‘effective population size’ is often estimated from the amount of putatively neutral genetic diversity and is assumed to also capture a species’ effectiveness of selection . A potentially more direct measure of the effectiveness of selection is the degree to which selection maintains preferred codons . However , past metrics that compare codon bias across species are confounded by among-species variation in %GC content and/or amino acid composition . Here , we propose a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species ( CAIS ) , based on Kullback–Leibler divergence , that corrects for both confounders . We demonstrate the use of CAIS correlations , as well as the Effective Number of Codons , to show that the protein domains of more highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher intrinsic structural disorder .

    Abstract: Sepsis causes millions of deaths per year worldwide and is a current global health priority declared by the WHO . Sepsis-related deaths are a result of dysregulated inflammatory immune responses indicating the need to develop strategies to target inflammation . An important mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) that is released by inflamed host cells and tissues , and also by bacteria in a strain-specific and growth-dependent manner . Here , we investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP . Using genetic mutant strains of Escherichia coli ( E . coli ) , we demonstrate that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane . In addition , impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane notably contributes to ATP release and is associated with bacterial death . In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis , local effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using a transformed E . coli bearing an arabinose-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released . Abrogating bacterial ATP release shows that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses , resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival . In addition , bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles ( OMV ) . ATP-loaded OMV are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulated expression of genes activating degranulation in neutrophils , potentially contributing to the exacerbation of sepsis severity .

    Abstract: In children , psychotic-like experiences ( PLEs ) are related to risk of psychosis , schizophrenia , and other mental disorders . Maladaptive cognitive functioning , influenced by genetic and environmental factors , is hypothesized to mediate the relationship between these factors and childhood PLEs . Using large-scale longitudinal data , we tested the relationships of genetic and environmental factors ( such as familial and neighborhood environment ) with cognitive intelligence and their relationships with current and future PLEs in children . We leveraged large-scale multimodal data of 6 , 602 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study . Linear mixed model and a novel structural equation modeling ( SEM ) method that allows estimation of both components and factors were used to estimate the joint effects of cognitive phenotypes polygenic scores ( PGSs ) , familial and neighborhood socioeconomic status ( SES ) , and supportive environment on NIH Toolbox cognitive intelligence and PLEs . We adjusted for ethnicity ( genetically defined ) , schizophrenia PGS , and additionally unobserved confounders ( using computational confound modeling ) . Our findings indicate that lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs are significantly associated with lower PGSs for cognitive phenotypes , lower familial SES , lower neighborhood SES , and less supportive environments . Specifically , cognitive intelligence mediates the effects of these factors on PLEs , with supportive parenting and positive school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing PLEs . This study underscores the influence of genetic and environmental factors on PLEs through their effects on cognitive intelligence . Our findings have policy implications in that improving school and family environments and promoting local economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children .

    ","The study investigated the relationship between psychotic-like experiences (Ps) in children and the risk of psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders, as well as the role of genetic and environmental factors in mediating this relationship. It was hypothesized that adaptive cognitive functioning, influenced by genetic and environmental factors, mediates the relationship between these factors and childhood Ps. The study used large-scale longitudinal data from 6,602 children in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Study to examine the relationships between genetic and environmental factors, such as familial and neighborhood environment, with intelligence and current and future Ps. The study leveraged multimodal data to estimate the joint effects of phenotypic scores (PS), familial socioeconomic status (SES), and environment on cognitive and Ps. The study controlled for ethnicity-defined schizophrenia PS and unobserved confounders using computational modeling. The findings indicate that lower intelligence and Ps are associated with lower PS for cognitive phenotypes, familial SES, neighborhood, and less supportive environments. Intelligence mediates the effects of these factors on Ps, with positive parenting and school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing Ps. The study highlights the influence of genetic and environmental factors on Ps through their effects on intelligence. The findings suggest that improving school and family environments and promoting economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children."

    Title: 
    Abstract: The morphogen FGF8 establishes graded positional cues imparting regional cellular responses via modulation of early target genes . The roles of FGF signaling and its effector genes remain poorly characterized in human experimental models mimicking early fetal telencephalic development . We used hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids as an in vitro platform to investigate the effect of FGF8 signaling on neural identity and differentiation . We found that FGF8 treatment increases cellular heterogeneity , leading to distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic-like domains that co-develop in multi-regional organoids . Within telencephalic regions , FGF8 affects the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons , thus impacting spontaneous neuronal network activity . Moreover , FGF8 efficiently modulates key regulators responsible for several human neurodevelopmental disorders . Overall , our results show that FGF8 signaling is directly involved in both regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids and in modulating genes associated with normal and pathological neural development .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Sleep and feeding patterns lack strong daily rhythms during early life . As diurnal animals mature , feeding is consolidated to the day and sleep to the night . In Drosophila , circadian sleep patterns are initiated with formation of a circuit connecting the central clock to arousal output neurons; emergence of circadian sleep also enables long-term memory ( LTM ) . However , the cues that trigger the development of this clock-arousal circuit are unknown . Here , we identify a role for nutritional status in driving sleep-wake rhythm development in Drosophila larvae . We find that in the 2nd instar larval period ( L2 ) , sleep and feeding are spread across the day; these behaviors become organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar larval stage ( L3 ) . Forcing mature ( L3 ) animals to adopt immature ( L2 ) feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and the ability to exhibit LTM . In addition , the development of the clock ( DN1a ) -arousal ( Dh44 ) circuit itself is influenced by the larval nutritional environment . Finally , we demonstrate that larval arousal Dh44 neurons act through glucose metabolic genes to drive onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms . Together , our data suggest that changes to energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Many animals moving through fluids exhibit highly coordinated group movement that is thought to reduce the cost of locomotion . However , direct energetic measurements demonstrating the energy-saving benefits of fluid-mediated collective movements remain elusive . By characterizing both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic energy contributions in schools of giant danio ( Devario aequipinnatus ) , we discovered that fish schools have a concave upward shaped metabolism–speed curve , with a minimum metabolic cost at ~1 body length s-1 . We demonstrate that fish schools reduce total energy expenditure ( TEE ) per tail beat by up to 56% compared to solitary fish . When reaching their maximum sustained swimming speed , fish swimming in schools had a 44% higher maximum aerobic performance and used 65% less non-aerobic energy compared to solitary individuals , which lowered the TEE and total cost of transport by up to 53% , near the lowest recorded for any aquatic organism . Fish in schools also recovered from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish . The non-aerobic energetic savings that occur when fish in schools actively swim at high speed can considerably improve both peak and repeated performance which is likely to be beneficial for evading predators . These energetic savings may underlie the prevalence of coordinated group locomotion in fishes .

    Abstract: Airway macrophages ( AM ) are the predominant immune cell in the lung and play a crucial role in preventing infection , making them a target for host directed therapy . Macrophage effector functions are associated with cellular metabolism . A knowledge gap remains in understanding metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of distinct human macrophage subpopulations , especially in lung resident AM . We examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM; as a model of blood derived macrophages ) in their resting state and after priming with IFN-γ or IL-4 to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung . Human macrophages , regardless of origin , had a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFN-γ or upon stimulation . IFN-γ significantly enhanced cellular energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation . Upon stimulation , AM do not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike MDM which shift to ‘Warburg’-like metabolism . IFN-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM . Blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose significantly reduced IFN-γ driven cytokine production in AM , indicating that IFN-γ induces functional plasticity in human AM , which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis . Directly comparing responses between macrophages , AM were more responsive to IFN-γ priming and dependent on glycolysis for cytokine secretion than MDM . Interestingly , TNF production was under the control of glycolysis in AM and not in MDM . MDM exhibited glycolysis-dependent upregulation of HLA-DR and CD40 , whereas IFN-γ upregulated HLA-DR and CD40 on AM independently of glycolysis . These data indicate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ in a manner distinct from MDM . These data provide evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases .

Early pter had long, stiff tails with a mobile base that allowed them to shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. However, these tails ended in a tall, thin vane that would compromise aerodynamic efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. Maintaining stiffness in the vane was crucial for early pter flight, but how this was achieved remained unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pter and absent in birds and bats. A recent study used Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence to investigate the structure of the vanes in earlyter. The results revealed a cross-link lattice within the vanes that supported a dynamic tension system to maintain stiffness.

    Abstract: Adolescence is characterized by changes in reward-related behaviors , social behaviors , and decision-making . These behavioral changes are necessary for the transition into adulthood , but they also increase vulnerability to the development of a range of psychiatric disorders . Major reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence is thought to underlie , in part , the associated behavioral changes and increased vulnerability . Here , we utilized fast scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine differences in dopamine release as well as mechanisms that underlie differential dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) core of adolescent ( P28-35 ) and adult ( P70-90 ) male rats . We show baseline differences between adult and adolescent-stimulated dopamine release in male rats , as well as opposite effects of the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) on modulating dopamine release . The α6-selective blocker , α-conotoxin , increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats , but decreased dopamine release in rats beginning in middle adolescence and extending through adulthood . Strikingly , blockade of GABAA and GABAB receptors revealed that this α6-mediated increase in adolescent dopamine release requires NAc GABA signaling to occur . We confirm the role of α6 nAChRs and GABA in mediating this effect in vivo using microdialysis . Results herein suggest a multisynaptic mechanism potentially unique to the period of development that includes early adolescence , involving acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs to drive inhibitory GABA tone on dopamine release .

A striking example of diverse structure and function is presented by the afferent synapses between inner hair cells ( IHCs ) and spiral ganglion neurons ( SGNs ) in the cochlea . Presynaptic active zones at the pillar IHC side activate at lower IHC potentials than those of the modiolar side that have more presynaptic Ca2+ channels . The postsynaptic SGNs differ in their spontaneous firing rates , sound thresholds , and operating ranges . While a causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity seems likely , experimental evidence linking synaptic and SGN physiology has remained difficult to obtain . Here , we aimed at bridging this gap by ex vivo paired recordings of murine IHCs and postsynaptic SGN boutons with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic those of in vivo SGN characterization . Synapses with high spontaneous rate of release ( SR ) were found predominantly on the pillar side of the IHC . These high SR synapses had larger and more temporally compact spontaneous EPSCs , lower voltage thresholds , tighter coupling of Ca2+ channels and vesicular release sites , shorter response latencies , and higher initial release rates . This study indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs .

    Abstract: The environmental challenges the human malaria parasite , Plasmodium falciparum , faces during its progression into its various lifecycle stages warrant the use of effective and highly regulated access to chromatin for transcriptional regulation . Microrchidia ( MORC ) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across plant and animal kingdoms . Accumulating evidence has shed light on the role MORC protein plays as a transcriptional switch in apicomplexan parasites . In this study , using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool along with complementary molecular and genomics approaches , we demonstrate that PfMORC not only modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite erythrocytic cycle , but is also essential to the parasite survival . Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) experiments suggests that PfMORC binds to not only sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation but may also play a role in modulating stage transition . Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture ( Hi-C ) studies indicate that downregulation of PfMORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite heterochromatin structure leading to its death . All together these findings confirm that PfMORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation , validating this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies .

    Abstract: Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health , prompting an exploration into whether nerves infiltrating tumors contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions . Using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing , we show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas . The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors ( decreased nest-building , increased latency to eat a cookie , and reduced wheel running ) . Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos as well as increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts . The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor . While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie test behaviors , it did not fully restore voluntary wheel running indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts .

    ","**Summary of Article: Exploring the Role of Tumor-Infiltrating Nerves in Cancer-Associated Mental Health Alterations in Mouse Model of Head and Neck Cancer**

    Researchers investigated the impact of tumor-infiltrating nerves on mental health changes in cancer patients by using a mouse model of head and neck cancer. The study found that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas and activate neuronal circuitry, leading to altered behaviors such as decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced running. Tumor-infiltrating nocicept neurons exhibited heightened activity and brain regions receiving these projections showed increased Fos and calcium compared to non-tumor counterparts. The elimination of nocicept neurons decreased F expression and mitigated behavioral changes induced by tumor presence. Analesic treatment restored nesting and cookie behaviors but not wheel running, indicating pain is not sole driver of behavioral shifts. The interaction between tumor-infiltr nerves and brain is crucial for developing interventions to alleviate mental burdens associated with cancer."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Genetic diversity is a hallmark of RNA viruses and the basis for their evolutionary success . Taking advantage of the uniquely large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2 , we examine the impact of mutations across the spectrum of viable amino acid sequences on the biophysical phenotypes of the highly expressed and multifunctional nucleocapsid protein . We find variation in the physicochemical parameters of its extended intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) sufficient to allow local plasticity , but also observe functional constraints that similarly occur in related coronaviruses . In biophysical experiments with several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants , we find that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal impact and modulate thermodynamic stability , secondary structure , protein oligomeric state , particle formation , and liquid-liquid phase separation . In the Omicron variant , distant mutations in different IDRs have compensatory effects in shifting a delicate balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties , and include the creation of a new protein-protein interaction interface in the N-terminal IDR through the defining P13L mutation . A picture emerges where genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional N-protein species , in particular in the IDRs .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Hibernation is a period of metabolic suppression utilized by many small and large mammal species to survive during winter periods . As the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood , our study aimed to determine whether skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency undergo alterations during hibernation to optimize energy utilization . We isolated muscle fibers from small hibernators , Ictidomys tridecemlineatus and Eliomys quercinus and larger hibernators , Ursus arctos and Ursus americanus . We then conducted loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure resting myosin dynamics and its ATP demand . In parallel , we performed multiple proteomics analyses . Our results showed a preservation of myosin structure in U . arctos and U . americanus during hibernation , whilst in I . tridecemlineatus and E . quercinus , changes in myosin metabolic states during torpor unexpectedly led to higher levels in energy expenditure of type II , fast-twitch muscle fibers at ambient lab temperatures ( 20 °C ) . Upon repeating loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments at 8 °C ( near the body temperature of torpid animals ) , we found that myosin ATP consumption in type II muscle fibers was reduced by 77–107% during torpor compared to active periods . Additionally , we observed Myh2 hyper-phosphorylation during torpor in I . tridecemilineatus , which was predicted to stabilize the myosin molecule . This may act as a potential molecular mechanism mitigating myosin-associated increases in skeletal muscle energy expenditure during periods of torpor in response to cold exposure . Altogether , we demonstrate that resting myosin is altered in hibernating mammals , contributing to significant changes to the ATP consumption of skeletal muscle . Additionally , we observe that it is further altered in response to cold exposure and highlight myosin as a potentially contributor to skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis .

    Abstract: Chondrocyte columns , which are a hallmark of growth plate architecture , play a central role in bone elongation . Columns are formed by clonal expansion following rotation of the division plane , resulting in a stack of cells oriented parallel to the growth direction . In this work , we analyzed hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos using a pipeline comprising 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis . Surprisingly , analysis of the elevation angles between neighboring pairs of cells revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation , implying incomplete rotation of the division plane . Morphological analysis revealed that although embryonic clones were elongated , they formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction . Analysis of growth plates of postnatal mice revealed both complex columns , composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks , and small , disorganized clusters located in the outer edges . Finally , correlation between the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns and between bone elongation and expansion suggests that clusters may promote expansion , whereas columns support elongation . Overall , our findings support the idea that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determines the formation of either clusters or columns , a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth . Broadly , this work provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development .

    Abstract: Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters ( POTs ) are of great pharmaceutical interest owing to their promiscuous substrate binding site that has been linked to improved oral bioavailability of several classes of drugs . Members of the POT family are conserved across all phylogenetic kingdoms and function by coupling peptide uptake to the proton electrochemical gradient . Cryo-EM structures and alphafold models have recently provided new insights into different conformational states of two mammalian POTs , SLC15A1 , and SLC15A2 . Nevertheless , these studies leave open important questions regarding the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling , while simultaneously providing a unique opportunity to investigate these processes using molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations . Here , we employ extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling MD to map out the full SLC15A2 conformational cycle and its thermodynamic driving forces . By computing conformational free energy landscapes in different protonation states and in the absence or presence of peptide substrate , we identify a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access . These simulations identify key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs , which we validate experimentally in cell-based transport assays . Our results from constant-PH MD and absolute binding free energy ( ABFE ) calculations also establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition , revealing key details underpining secondary active transport in POTs . This study provides a vital step forward in understanding proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals and pave the way to integrate knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design to target tissue and organ bioavailability .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Across the animal kingdom , neural responses in the auditory cortex are suppressed during vocalization , and humans are no exception . A common hypothesis is that suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback , enabling the detection of vocalization errors . This hypothesis has been previously confirmed in non-human primates , however a direct link between auditory suppression and sensitivity in human speech monitoring remains elusive . To address this issue , we obtained intracranial electroencephalography ( iEEG ) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production . We first characterized the detailed topography of auditory suppression , which varied across superior temporal gyrus ( STG ) . Next , we performed a delayed auditory feedback ( DAF ) task to determine whether the suppressed sites were also sensitive to auditory feedback alterations . Indeed , overlapping sites showed enhanced responses to feedback , indicating sensitivity . Importantly , there was a strong correlation between the degree of auditory suppression and feedback sensitivity , suggesting suppression might be a key mechanism that underlies speech monitoring . Further , we found that when participants produced speech with simultaneous auditory feedback , posterior STG was selectively activated if participants were engaged in a DAF paradigm , suggesting that increased attentional load can modulate auditory feedback sensitivity .

    Abstract: A comprehensive census of McrBC systems , among the most common forms of prokaryotic Type IV restriction systems , followed by phylogenetic analysis , reveals their enormous abundance in diverse prokaryotes and a plethora of genomic associations . We focus on a previously uncharacterized branch , which we denote coiled-coil nuclease tandems ( CoCoNuTs ) for their salient features: the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases . The CoCoNuTs alone show extraordinary variety , with three distinct types and multiple subtypes . All CoCoNuTs contain domains predicted to interact with translation system components , such as OB-folds resembling the SmpB protein that binds bacterial transfer-messenger RNA ( tmRNA ) , YTH-like domains that might recognize methylated tmRNA , tRNA , or rRNA , and RNA-binding Hsp70 chaperone homologs , along with RNases , such as HEPN domains , all suggesting that the CoCoNuTs target RNA . Many CoCoNuTs might additionally target DNA , via McrC nuclease homologs . Additional restriction systems , such as Type I RM , BREX , and Druantia Type III , are frequently encoded in the same predicted superoperons . In many of these superoperons , CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides , possibly , RNA fragments with cyclic termini , that bind associated CARF ( CRISPR-Associated Rossmann Fold ) domains . We hypothesize that the CoCoNuTs , together with the ancillary restriction factors , employ an echeloned defense strategy analogous to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems , in which an immune response eliminating virus DNA and/or RNA is launched first , but then , if it fails , an abortive infection response leading to PCD/dormancy via host RNA cleavage takes over .

Calcineurin inhibition leads to defects in the DMP , resulting in intestinal bloating , rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria , and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection . We demonstrate that intestinal bloating caused by calcineurin inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction , resulting in enhanced lifespan . The TFEB ortholog , HLH-30 , is required for lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide . Most cases of preterm birth occur spontaneously and result from preterm labor with intact ( spontaneous preterm labor [sPTL] ) or ruptured ( preterm prelabor rupture of membranes [PPROM] ) membranes . The prediction of spontaneous preterm birth ( sPTB ) remains underpowered due to its syndromic nature and the dearth of independent analyses of the vaginal host immune response . Thus , we conducted the largest longitudinal investigation targeting vaginal immune mediators , referred to herein as the immunoproteome , in a population at high risk for sPTB . Vaginal swabs were collected across gestation from pregnant women who ultimately underwent term birth , sPTL , or PPROM . Cytokines , chemokines , growth factors , and antimicrobial peptides in the samples were quantified via specific and sensitive immunoassays . Predictive models were constructed from immune mediator concentrations . Throughout uncomplicated gestation , the vaginal immunoproteome harbors a cytokine network with a homeostatic profile . Yet , the vaginal immunoproteome is skewed toward a pro-inflammatory state in pregnant women who ultimately experience sPTL and PPROM . Such an inflammatory profile includes increased monocyte chemoattractants , cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation , and reduced antimicrobial proteins/peptides . The vaginal immunoproteome has improved predictive value over maternal characteristics alone for identifying women at risk for early ( <34 weeks ) sPTB . The vaginal immunoproteome undergoes homeostatic changes throughout gestation and deviations from this shift are associated with sPTB . Furthermore , the vaginal immunoproteome can be leveraged as a potential biomarker for early sPTB , a subset of sPTB associated with extremely adverse neonatal outcomes . This research was conducted by the Perinatology Research Branch , Division of Obstetrics and Maternal-Fetal Medicine , Division of Intramural Research , Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , National Institutes of Health , U . S . Department of Health and Human Services ( NICHD/NIH/DHHS ) under contract HHSN275201300006C .

Current prediction of PT is limited due to its complex nature and lack of understanding of the host immune response.

    Abstract: The function of the smooth muscle cells lining the walls of mammalian systemic arteries and arterioles is to regulate the diameter of the vessels to control blood flow and blood pressure . Here , we describe an in silico model , which we call the ‘Hernandez–Hernandez model’ , of electrical and Ca2+ signaling in arterial myocytes based on new experimental data indicating sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes from murine resistance arteries . The model suggests the fundamental ionic mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ signaling during the development of myogenic tone in arterial blood vessels . Although experimental data suggest that KV1 . 5 channel currents have similar amplitudes , kinetics , and voltage dependencies in male and female myocytes , simulations suggest that the KV1 . 5 current is the dominant current regulating membrane potential in male myocytes . In female cells , which have larger KV2 . 1 channel expression and longer time constants for activation than male myocytes , predictions from simulated female myocytes suggest that KV2 . 1 plays a primary role in the control of membrane potential . Over the physiological range of membrane potentials , the gating of a small number of voltage-gated K+ channels and L-type Ca2+ channels are predicted to drive sex-specific differences in intracellular Ca2+ and excitability . We also show that in an idealized computational model of a vessel , female arterial smooth muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to commonly used Ca2+ channel blockers compared to male . In summary , we present a new model framework to investigate the potential sex-specific impact of antihypertensive drugs .

The Hernandez-Hern model provides a framework to investigate the sex-specific impact of antihypertensive drugs."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Litter decomposition is expected to be positively associated with precipitation despite evidence that decomposers of varying sizes have different moisture dependencies . We hypothesized that higher tolerance of macro-decomposers to aridity may counterbalance the effect of smaller decomposers , leading to similar decomposition rates across climatic gradients . We tested this hypothesis by placing plant litter baskets of different mesh sizes in seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient , and by characterizing the macro-decomposer assemblages using pitfall trapping . We found that decomposers responded differently to precipitation levels based on their size . Microbial decomposition increased with precipitation in the winter while macro-decomposition peaked in arid sites during the summer . This led to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient except in hyper-arid sites . Macro-decomposer richness , abundance , and biomass peaked in arid environments . Our findings highlight the importance of macro-decomposition in arid-lands , possibly resolving the dryland decomposition conundrum , and emphasizing the need to contemplate decomposer size when investigating zoogeochemical processes .

We find that CYRI-B is highly expressed in pancreatic tumours in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer .

    ","Summary: 
    Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a type of pancreatic cancer with a poor prognosis and high rates of metastasis and limited treatment options. The activation of the KRAS gene is a common in most tumours, leading to increased migratory and proliferative capacity as well as macropocytosis. Macropocytosis is known as a nutrient scavenging mechanism, but its role in trafficking of signalling receptors is not well understood. This study investigated the role of CYRI-B, a protein highly expressed in pancreatic tumours in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Deletion of the gene encoding CYRI accelerated tumourigenesis, leading to increased ERK and JNK proliferation in precancerous lesions, suggesting a role as a buffer of RAC activation in early stages. However, as disease progressed, loss of CY-B inhibited metastasis. CY-B depleted tumour cells showed reduced chemotactic response to lysosphatidic acid, a major driver of tumour spread due to impaired macinocytic uptake of lysosphatid acid 1 receptor. The study implicates CY-B as a mediator of growth and signalling in pancreatic cancer, providing insights into pathways controlling metastasis."

    Title: 
    Abstract: HERV-K ( HML-2 ) , the youngest clade of human endogenous retroviruses ( HERVs ) , includes many intact or nearly intact proviruses , but no replication competent HML-2 proviruses have been identified in humans . HML-2-related proviruses are present in other primates , including rhesus macaques , but the extent and timing of HML-2 activity in macaques remains unclear . We have identified 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques , including a clade of young , rhesus-specific insertions . Age estimates , intact open reading frames , and insertional polymorphism of these insertions are consistent with recent or ongoing infectious activity in macaques . 106 of the proviruses form a clade characterized by an ~750 bp sequence between env and the 3′ long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K ( HML-8 ) -related virus . This clade is found in Old World monkeys ( OWM ) , but not great apes , suggesting it originated after the ape/OWM split . We identified similar proviruses in white-cheeked gibbons; the gibbon insertions cluster within the OWM recombinant clade , suggesting interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons . The LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in U3 , which disrupt the Rec Response Element ( RcRE ) , required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA . We show that the HML-8-derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element ( CTE ) , indicating the ancestral Rec–RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism .

    Abstract: Volatiles emitted by herbivore-attacked plants ( senders ) can enhance defenses in neighboring plants ( receivers ) , however , the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon remain poorly studied . Using a custom-built , high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( PTR-ToF-MS ) system , we explored temporal patterns of volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants . We found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles results in clocked temporal response patterns in neighboring plants , characterized by an induced terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure . This delayed burst is not explained by terpene accumulation during the night , but coincides with delayed jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants . The delayed burst occurs independent of day:night light transitions and cannot be fully explained by sender volatile dynamics . Instead , it is the result of a stress memory from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary exposure to bioactive volatiles on the second day . Our study reveals that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern . This provides an answer to the long-standing question of whether stress volatiles predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants , by revealing that they can do both in sequence .

    Abstract: Recursive procedures that allow placing a vocal signal inside another of a similar kind provide a neuro-computational blueprint for syntax and phonology in spoken language and human song . There are , however , no known vocal sequences among nonhuman primates arranged in self-embedded patterns that evince vocal recursion or potential incipient or evolutionary transitional forms thereof , suggesting a neuro-cognitive transformation exclusive to humans . Here , we uncover that wild flanged male orangutan long calls feature rhythmically isochronous call sequences nested within isochronous call sequences , consistent with two hierarchical strata . Remarkably , three temporally and acoustically distinct call rhythms in the lower stratum were not related to the overarching rhythm at the higher stratum by any low multiples , which suggests that these recursive structures were neither the result of parallel non-hierarchical procedures nor anatomical artifacts of bodily constraints or resonances . Findings represent a case of temporally recursive hominid vocal combinatorics in the absence of syntax , semantics , phonology , or music . Second-order combinatorics , ‘sequences within sequences’ , involving hierarchically organized and cyclically structured vocal sounds in ancient hominids may have preluded the evolution of recursion in modern language-able humans .

    Abstract: The incessant arms race between viruses and hosts has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that shape life’s evolution . During this process , the interactions between viral receptors and viruses have garnered significant interest since viral receptors are cell surface proteins exploited by viruses to initiate infection . Our study sheds light on the arms race between the MDA5 receptor and 5’ppp-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate fish , Miichthys miiuy . Firstly , the frequent and independent loss events of RIG-I in vertebrates prompted us to search for alternative immune substitutes , with homology-dependent genetic compensation response ( HDGCR ) being the main pathway . Our further analysis suggested that MDA5 of M . miiuy and Gallus gallus , the homolog of RIG-I , can replace RIG-I in recognizing 5’ppp-RNA virus , which may lead to redundancy of RIG-I and loss from the species genome during evolution . Secondly , as an adversarial strategy , 5’ppp-RNA SCRV can utilize the m6A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability , thus promoting its own replication and immune evasion . In summary , our study provides a snapshot into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus , offering valuable perspectives on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system .

A key aspect of this interaction is the relationship between viral receptors and host cells, where viruses exploit surface proteins to initiate infection. This study focuses on the dynamic between the MDA receptor and 5’pp-RNA virus in the lower vertebrate Miichthys mii. The frequent loss of RIG in vertebrates prompted the search for alternative substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation (HDCR) being the primary pathway. Analysis revealed that MDA in Miichys and Gallus, a homolog of RIG, can replace RIG in recognizing 5pp-RNA, potentially leading to RIG loss from the genome during evolution. As a countermeasure, 5pp-R virus utilizes m6A methylation to degrade MDA and weaken its antiviral ability, promoting replication and immune evasion.

    Abstract: Among its extragonadal effects , follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) has an impact on body composition and bone metabolism . Since androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) has a profound impact on circulating FSH concentrations , this hormone could potentially be implicated in the changes of fat body mass ( FBM ) , lean body mass ( LBM ) , and bone fragility induced by ADT . The objective of this study is to correlate FSH serum levels with body composition parameters , bone mineral density ( BMD ) , and bone turnover markers at baseline conditions and after 12 months of ADT . Twenty-nine consecutive non-metastatic prostate cancer ( PC ) patients were enrolled from 2017 to 2019 in a phase IV study . All patients underwent administration of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist degarelix . FBM , LBM , and BMD were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 12 months of ADT . FSH , alkaline phosphatase , and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months . For outcome measurements and statistical analysis , t-test or sign test and Pearson or Spearman tests for continuous variables were used when indicated . At baseline conditions , a weak , non-significant , direct relationship was found between FSH serum levels and FBM at arms ( r = 0 . 36 ) and legs ( r = 0 . 33 ) . Conversely , a stronger correlation was observed between FSH and total FBM ( r = 0 . 52 , p = 0 . 006 ) , fat mass at arms ( r = 0 . 54 , p = 0 . 004 ) , and fat mass at trunk ( r = 0 . 45 , p = 0 . 018 ) assessed after 12 months . On the other hand , an inverse relationship between serum FSH and appendicular lean mass index/FBM ratio was observed ( r = −0 . 64 , p = 0 . 001 ) . This is an ancillary study of a prospective trial and this is the main limitation . FSH serum levels after ADT could have an impact on body composition , in particular on FBM . Therefore , FSH could be a promising marker to monitor the risk of sarcopenic obesity and to guide the clinicians in the tailored evaluation of body composition in PC patients undergoing ADT .

Despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolemmal ion channels , none have proven sufficiently effective for preventing SCD . Sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor 2 ( RyR2 ) Ca2+ release channels , the downstream effectors of sarcolemmal ion channels , are underexplored in this context . Recent evidence implicates reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) -mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of RyR2s in the pathophysiology of SCD . We tested the hypothesis that RyR2 inhibition of failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability , mitigates VT/VF/SCD and improves contractile function . We used a guinea pig model that replicates key clinical aspects of human nonischemic HF , such as a prolonged QT interval , a high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic SCD , and profound Ca2+ leak via a hyperactive RyR2 . HF animals were randomized to receive dantrolene ( DS ) or placebo in early or chronic HF . We assessed the incidence of VT/VF and SCD ( primary outcome ) , ECG heart rate and QT variability , echocardiographic left ventricular ( LV ) structure and function , immunohistochemical LV fibrosis , and sarcoplasmic RyR2 oxidation . DS treatment prevented VT/VF and SCD by decreasing dispersion of repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias . Compared to placebo , DS lowered resting heart rate , preserved chronotropic competency during transient β-adrenergic challenge , and improved heart rate variability and cardiac function . Inhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene mitigates the vicious cycle of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak-induced increases in diastolic Ca2+ and ROS-mediated RyR2 oxidation , thereby reducing repolarization lability and protecting against VT/VF/SCD . Moreover , the consequent increase in sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load improves contractile function . These potentially life-saving effects of RyR2 inhibition warrant further investigation , such as clinical studies of repurposing dantrolene as a potential new therapy for heart failure and/or SCD .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Smads and their transcription factor partners mediate the transcriptional responses of target cells to secreted ligands of the transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) family , including those of the conserved bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) family , yet only a small number of direct target genes have been well characterized . In C . elegans , the BMP2/4 ortholog DBL-1 regulates multiple biological functions , including body size , via a canonical receptor-Smad signaling cascade . Here , we identify functional binding sites for SMA-3/Smad and its transcriptional partner SMA-9/Schnurri based on ChIP-seq peaks ( identified by modEncode ) and expression differences of nearby genes identified from RNA-seq analysis of corresponding mutants . We found that SMA-3 and SMA-9 have both overlapping and unique target genes . At a genome-wide scale , SMA-3/Smad acts as a transcriptional activator , whereas SMA-9/Schnurri direct targets include both activated and repressed genes . Mutations in sma-9 partially suppress the small body size phenotype of sma-3 , suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors and challenging the prevailing model for Schnurri function . Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) secretory pathway , including the disulfide reductase dpy-11 . Our findings indicate that Smads and SMA-9/Schnurri have previously unappreciated complex genetic and genomic regulatory interactions that in turn regulate the secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body size regulation .

    ","In C. elegans, the transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) family, including the conserved bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) family, mediate transcriptional responses to secreted ligands. However, only a small number of direct target genes have been well characterized. This study identifies functional binding sites for SMA-3/Sm and its transcription partner SMA-9/Schnri based on ChIP-seq peaks and RNA-seq analysis of mutants. SMA-3 and SMA-9 have overlapping and unique target genes. Genome-wide SMA-3/Sm acts as a transcriptional activator, while SMA-9/Sur targets both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in sma-9 partially suppress the body size phenotype of sma-3, suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors. Functional analysis of target genes reveals a role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and endoplasmic retic ( ER ) secretory pathway, including disulf reductase d-11. The study indicates Sm and SMA-9/Sur have complex and regulatory interactions that regulate secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body size."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Cancer immune evasion contributes to checkpoint immunotherapy failure in many patients with metastatic cancers . The embryonic transcription factor DUX4 was recently characterized as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation that is aberrantly expressed in a small subset of primary tumors . Here , we report that DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors , with ~10–50% of advanced bladder , breast , kidney , prostate , and skin cancers expressing DUX4 . DUX4 expression is significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and decreased objective response to PD-L1 blockade in a large cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients . DUX4 expression is a significant predictor of survival even after accounting for tumor mutational burden and other molecular and clinical features in this cohort , with DUX4 expression associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year . Our data motivate future attempts to develop DUX4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Lack of data on the aetiology of livestock diseases constrains effective interventions to improve livelihoods , food security and public health . Livestock abortion is an important disease syndrome affecting productivity and public health . Several pathogens are associated with livestock abortions but across Africa surveillance data rarely include information from abortions , little is known about aetiology and impacts , and data are not available to inform interventions . This paper describes outcomes from a surveillance platform established in Tanzania spanning pastoral , agropastoral and smallholder systems to investigate causes and impacts of livestock abortion . Abortion events were reported by farmers to livestock field officers ( LFO ) and on to investigation teams . Events were included if the research team or LFO could attend within 72 hr . If so , samples and questionnaire data were collected to investigate ( a ) determinants of attribution; ( b ) patterns of events , including species and breed , previous abortion history , and seasonality; ( c ) determinants of reporting , investigation and attribution; ( d ) cases involving zoonotic pathogens . Between 2017–2019 , 215 events in cattle ( n=71 ) , sheep ( n=44 ) , and goats ( n=100 ) were investigated . Attribution , achieved for 19 . 5% of cases , was significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples . Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid deterioration of samples . Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection . Livestock abortion surveillance , even at a small scale , can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks , reproductive losses and can identify pathogens not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance . This study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system , achieved through engagement of community-based field officers , establishment of practical sample collection and application of molecular diagnostic platforms .

    Abstract: Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor inducing the development and progression of various diseases . Nicotine ( NIC ) is the major constituent of cigarette smoke . However , knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated stem cell functions is limited . In this study , we demonstrate that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) in vivo and ex vivo . Moreover , NIC induces Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) /Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif ( TAZ ) and Notch signaling in ISCs via α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAchR ) and protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation; this effect was not detected in Paneth cells . The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine ( DBZ ) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs . NIC enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc , DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth . Hence , this study identifies a NIC-triggered pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs and suggests the use of DBZ as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Hsp70 is a key cellular system counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation , associated with stress , ageing , and disease . Hsp70 solubilises aggregates and aids protein refolding through substrate binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaperones: J-domain proteins ( JDPs ) and nucleotide exchange factors ( NEFs ) . Here , we elucidate the collaborative impact of Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes throughout Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing . We show that Hsp110 plays a major role at initial stages of disaggregation , determining its final efficacy . The NEF catalyses the recruitment of thick Hsp70 assemblies onto aggregate surface , which modifies aggregates into smaller species more readily processed by chaperones . Hsp70 stimulation by Hsp110 is much stronger with class B than class A JDPs and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif . Furthermore , we demonstrate for the first time that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction . Such destabilisation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface might improve disaggregation , but also lead to the inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum . Thus , balanced interplay between the co-chaperones and Hsp70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Gait is impaired in musculoskeletal conditions , such as knee arthropathy . Gait analysis is used in clinical practice to inform diagnosis and monitor disease progression or intervention response . However , clinical gait analysis relies on subjective visual observation of walking as objective gait analysis has not been possible within clinical settings due to the expensive equipment , large-scale facilities , and highly trained staff required . Relatively low-cost wearable digital insoles may offer a solution to these challenges . In this work , we demonstrate how a digital insole measuring osteoarthritis-specific gait signatures yields similar results to the clinical gait-lab standard . To achieve this , we constructed a machine learning model , trained on force plate data collected in participants with knee arthropathy and controls . This model was highly predictive of force plate data from a validation set ( area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [auROC] = 0 . 86; area under the precision-recall curve [auPR] = 0 . 90 ) and of a separate , independent digital insole dataset containing control and knee osteoarthritis subjects ( auROC = 0 . 83; auPR = 0 . 86 ) . After showing that digital insole-derived gait characteristics are comparable to traditional gait measurements , we next showed that a single stride of raw sensor time-series data could be accurately assigned to each subject , highlighting that individuals using digital insoles can be identified by their gait characteristics . This work provides a framework for a promising alternative to traditional clinical gait analysis methods , adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding wearable technology analytical pipelines , and supports clinical development of at-home gait assessments , with the potential to improve the ease , frequency , and depth of patient monitoring .

Therefore , there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid therapies for managing post-surgical pain . Local application of Clarix Flo ( FLO ) , a human amniotic membrane ( AM ) product , attenuated established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity without exhibiting known side effects of opioid use in mice . This effect was achieved through direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways . We further purified the major matrix component , the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 ( HC-HA/PTX3 ) from human AM that has greater purity and water solubility than FLO . HC-HA/PTX3 replicated FLO-induced neuronal and pain inhibition . Mechanistically , HC-HA/PTX3-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements to inhibit sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive DRG neurons , suggesting it is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief . Collectively , our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain . Moreover , we unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 .

    Abstract: Retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) cells show heterogeneous levels of pigmentation when cultured in vitro . To know whether their color in appearance is correlated with the function of the RPE , we analyzed the color intensities of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cells ( iPSC-RPE ) together with the gene expression profile at the single-cell level . For this purpose , we utilized our recent invention , Automated Live imaging and cell Picking System ( ALPS ) , which enabled photographing each cell before RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of each cell . While our iPSC-RPE were categorized into four clusters by gene expression , the color intensity of iPSC-RPE did not project any specific gene expression profiles . We reasoned this by less correlation between the actual color and the gene expressions that directly define the level of pigmentation , from which we hypothesized the color of RPE cells may be a temporal condition not strongly indicating the functional characteristics of the RPE .

    Abstract: In recent years , the field of neuroscience has increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in naturalistic environments to gain deeper insights into ethologically relevant behavioral processes and neural mechanisms . The common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ) , due to its small size , prosocial nature , and genetic proximity to humans , has emerged as a pivotal model toward this effort . However , traditional research methodologies often fail to fully capture the nuances of marmoset social interactions and cooperative behaviors . To address this critical gap , we developed the Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling ( MarmoAAP ) , a novel behavioral apparatus designed for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmosets . MarmoAAP addresses the limitations of traditional behavioral research methods by enabling high-throughput , detailed behavior outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings , allowing for more nuanced and comprehensive analyses even in a naturalistic setting . We also highlight the flexibility of MarmoAAP in task parameter manipulation which accommodates a wide range of behaviors and individual animal capabilities . Furthermore , MarmoAAP provides a platform to perform investigations of neural activity underlying naturalistic social behaviors . MarmoAAP is a versatile and robust tool for advancing our understanding of primate behavior and related cognitive processes . This new apparatus bridges the gap between ethologically relevant animal behavior studies and neural investigations , paving the way for future research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmosets as a model organism .

We employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate prenatal alcohol exposure ( PAE ) resembling common patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy in humans . Early moderate PAE was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborn pups without altering behavioural outcomes in adult littermates . Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific , with some perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation . DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential indicative of broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation . Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested some effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits including facial morphology , intelligence , educational attainment , autism , and schizophrenia . In our murine model , a maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation . Our studies demonstrate that early moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes and highlight a role for preventative maternal dietary interventions .

    Abstract: Since double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) is effective for silencing a wide variety of genes , all genes are typically considered equivalent targets for such RNA interference ( RNAi ) . Yet , loss of some regulators of RNAi in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can selectively impair the silencing of some genes . Here , we show that such selective requirements can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism . In this network , the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10 , the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16 , and the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 work together so that any two are required for silencing one somatic gene , but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene , where only the requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing . Quantitative models and their exploratory simulations led us to find that ( 1 ) changing cis-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce the dependence on NRDE-3 , ( 2 ) animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells , and ( 3 ) cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides , which makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs , are enriched within ‘pUG zones’ matching the dsRNA . Similar crosstalk between pathways and restricted amplification could result in apparently selective silencing by endogenous RNAs .

This phenomenon can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism. In this network, the Maelstrom domain protein RDE-10, the intrically disordered protein MUT-16 and the Argona protein NR-3 work together to silence genes, but each is required for silencing a different gene.

We aimed to uncover genes and pathways associated with TBM pathogenesis and mortality , and determine the best predictors of death , utilizing whole-blood RNA sequencing from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM , 295 pulmonary tuberculosis ( PTB ) , and 30 healthy controls . Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis , we identified hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality , with a consensus analysis revealing distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals . We employed multivariate elastic-net Cox regression to select candidate predictors of death , then logistic regression and internal bootstrap validation to choose best predictors . Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways were associated with TBM mortality . Among HIV-positive individuals , mortality associated with increased angiogenesis , while HIV-negative individuals exhibited elevated TNF signaling and impaired extracellular matrix organization . Four hub genes—MCEMP1 , NELL2 , ZNF354C , and CD4—were strong TBM mortality predictors . These findings indicate that TBM induces a systemic inflammatory response similar to PTB , highlighting critical genes and pathways related to death , offering insights for potential therapeutic targets alongside a novel four-gene biomarker for predicting outcomes .

Weighted gene co-expression analysis identified genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality, revealing distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. Multivariate Cox regression selected candidate predictors of death, and logistic regression and bootstrap validation chose the best predictors. Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T cell activation were associated with TBM mortality. Among HIV-positive individuals, mortality was associated with angiogenesis, while HIV-negative exhibited TNF signaling and extracellular organization. Four genes-MMP, NEL2, ZNF, and CD-were strong TBM predictors. These findings indicate TBM induces a systemic response similar to PT, highlighting genes and pathways related to death, offering potential therapeutic targets and a four-gene biomarker for outcomes."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Antibodies are critical reagents to detect and characterize proteins . It is commonly understood that many commercial antibodies do not recognize their intended targets , but information on the scope of the problem remains largely anecdotal , and as such , feasibility of the goal of at least one potent and specific antibody targeting each protein in a proteome cannot be assessed . Focusing on antibodies for human proteins , we have scaled a standardized characterization approach using parental and knockout cell lines ( Laflamme et al . , 2019 ) to assess the performance of 614 commercial antibodies for 65 neuroscience-related proteins . Side-by-side comparisons of all antibodies against each target , obtained from multiple commercial partners , have demonstrated that: ( i ) more than 50% of all antibodies failed in one or more applications , ( ii ) yet , ~50–75% of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody , depending on application , suggesting that coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies is significant; and ( iii ) recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies . The hundreds of underperforming antibodies identified in this study were found to have been used in a large number of published articles , which should raise alarm . Encouragingly , more than half of the underperforming commercial antibodies were reassessed by the manufacturers , and many had alterations to their recommended usage or were removed from the market . This first study helps demonstrate the scale of the antibody specificity problem but also suggests an efficient strategy toward achieving coverage of the human proteome; mine the existing commercial antibody repertoire , and use the data to focus new renewable antibody generation efforts .

    Title: 
    Abstract: The ability to independently control gene expression in two different tissues in the same animal is emerging as a major need , especially in the context of inter-organ communication studies . This type of study is made possible by technologies combining the GAL4/UAS and a second binary expression system such as the LexA system or QF system . Here , we describe a resource of reagents that facilitate combined use of the GAL4/UAS and a second binary system in various Drosophila tissues . Focusing on genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns , we generated a set of more than 40 LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions by CRISPR knock-in and verified their tissue specificity in larvae . We also built constructs that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector . Following successful integration of this construct into the fly genome , FLP/FRT recombination is used to isolate fly lines that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD . Finally , using new compatible shRNA vectors , we evaluated both LexA and QF systems for in vivo gene knockdown and are generating a library of such RNAi fly lines as a community resource . Together , these LexA and QF system vectors and fly lines will provide a new set of tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal .

    Title: 
    Abstract: The transcription factor Bcl11b has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction . Bcl11b is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses . The underlying molecular mechanisms , however , remained unclear . We show in mice that the synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2 is a direct functional target of Bcl11b that regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in vivo and in vitro . Furthermore , we demonstrate C1ql2 to exert its functions through direct interaction with a specific splice variant of neurexin-3 , Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) . Interruption of C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) interaction by expression of a non-binding C1ql2 mutant or by deletion of Nrxn3 in the dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates major parts of the Bcl11b as well as C1ql2 mutant phenotype . Together , this study identifies a novel C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) -dependent signaling pathway through which Bcl11b controls mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function . Thus , our findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders accompanied by synaptic dysfunction .

    Title: 
    Abstract: To function effectively as an integrated system , the transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries must communicate through mechanisms that are still poorly understood . Here , we focus on the zinc-finger Sfp1 , known to regulate transcription of proliferation-related genes . We show that Sfp1 can regulate transcription either by binding to promoters , like most known transcription activators , or by binding to the transcribed regions ( gene bodies ) , probably via RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) . We further studied the first mode of Sfp1 activity and found that , following promoter binding , Sfp1 binds to gene bodies and affects Pol II configuration , manifested by dissociation or conformational change of its Rpb4 subunit and increased backtracking . Surprisingly , Sfp1 binds to a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them . The interaction between Sfp1 and its client mRNAs is controlled by their respective promoters and coincides with Sfp1’s dissociation from chromatin . Intriguingly , Sfp1 dissociation from the chromatin correlates with the extent of the backtracked Pol II . We propose that , following promoter recruitment , Sfp1 accompanies Pol II and regulates backtracking . The backtracked Pol II is more compatible with Sfp1’s relocation to the nascent transcripts , whereupon Sfp1 accompanies these mRNAs to the cytoplasm and regulates their stability . Thus , Sfp1’s co-transcriptional binding imprints the mRNA fate , serving as a paradigm for the cross-talk between the synthesis and decay of specific mRNAs , and a paradigm for the dual-role of some zinc-finger proteins . The interplay between Sfp1’s two modes of transcription regulation remains to be examined .

Here , we investigate the connection between developmentally controlled PCD and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thaliana roots , focusing on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO ( SMB ) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1 . Mutations of both dPCD regulators increase colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendipita indica , primarily in the differentiation zone . smb-3 mutants additionally exhibit hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and a delay of S . indica-induced root-growth promotion . This demonstrates that root cap dPCD and rapid post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root . Additionally , reporter lines and transcriptional analysis revealed that BFN1 expression is downregulated during S . indica colonization in mature root epidermal cells , suggesting a transcriptional control mechanism that facilitates the accommodation of beneficial microbes in the roots .

    Abstract: Large vesicle extrusion from neurons may contribute to spreading pathogenic protein aggregates and promoting inflammatory responses , two mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative disease . Factors that regulate the extrusion of large vesicles , such as exophers produced by proteostressed C . elegans touch neurons , are poorly understood . Here , we document that mechanical force can significantly potentiate exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons . Exopher production from the C . elegans ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3 , coinciding with the C . elegans reproductive peak . Genetic disruption of C . elegans germline , sperm , oocytes , or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period . Conversely , restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can strongly increase ALMR exopher production . Overall , genetic interventions that promote ALMR exopher production are associated with expanded uterus lengths and genetic interventions that suppress ALMR exopher production are associated with shorter uterus lengths . In addition to the impact of fertilized eggs , ALMR exopher production can be enhanced by filling the uterus with oocytes , dead eggs , or even fluid , supporting that distention consequences , rather than the presence of fertilized eggs , constitute the exopher-inducing stimulus . We conclude that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons . Our observations draw attention to the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and in aggregate spreading mechanisms , making a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease .

Our findings show that DKK3 expression is upregulated in the brains of AD subjects and that DKK3 protein levels increase at early stages in the disease . In hAPP-J20 and hAPPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mouse AD models , extracellular DKK3 levels are increased and DKK3 accumulates at dystrophic neuronal processes around plaques .

    Abstract: Schizophrenia results in part from a failure of prefrontal networks but we lack full understanding of how disruptions at a synaptic level cause failures at the network level . This is a crucial gap in our understanding because it prevents us from discovering how genetic mutations and environmental risks that alter synaptic function cause prefrontal network to fail in schizophrenia . To address that question , we developed a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal local circuits that can explain the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits we recently observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia . We analyze how the balance between AMPA and NMDA components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition in the network influence oscillatory spike synchrony to inform the biological data . We show that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting from a steady to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs such as might occur during behavior . These findings strongly parallel dynamic modulation of 0-lag spike synchrony we observed between neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex during behavior , as well as the suppression of this 0-lag spiking by administration of NMDAR antagonists . As such , our cortical network model provides a plausible mechanism explaining the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia .

    Abstract: Angiogenesis is a morphogenic process resulting in the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones , usually in hypoxic micro-environments . The initial steps of angiogenesis depend on robust differentiation of oligopotent endothelial cells into the Tip and Stalk phenotypic cell fates , controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell–cell communication . The dynamics of spatial patterning of this cell fate specification are only partially understood . Here , by combining a controlled experimental angiogenesis model with mathematical and computational analyses , we find that the regular spatial Tip–Stalk cell patterning can undergo an order–disorder transition at a relatively high input level of a pro-angiogenic factor VEGF . The resulting differentiation is robust but temporally unstable for most cells , with only a subset of presumptive Tip cells leading sprout extensions . We further find that sprouts form in a manner maximizing their mutual distance , consistent with a Turing-like model that may depend on local enrichment and depletion of fibronectin . Together , our data suggest that NOTCH signaling mediates a robust way of cell differentiation enabling but not instructing subsequent steps in angiogenic morphogenesis , which may require additional cues and self-organization mechanisms . This analysis can assist in further understanding of cell plasticity underlying angiogenesis and other complex morphogenic processes .

However , the precise timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and which LC-derived neurotransmitters are important for memory formation in the hippocampus are currently unknown . Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine , several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other cortical regions . In some cases , it appears that dopamine release from LC into the hippocampus may be more important for memory than norepinephrine . Here , we extend these data by characterizing the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace fear conditioning in mice . We find that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and that amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term memory formation . We also demonstrate that LC activity increases both norepinephrine and dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus and that the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during trace fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity . Finally , we show that hippocampal dopamine is important for trace fear memory formation , while norepinephrine is not .
